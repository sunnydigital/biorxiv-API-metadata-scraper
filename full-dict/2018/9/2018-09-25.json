    "abstract": "From foraging for food to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem with a vast space of possible actions. Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using a variety of bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, where the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across a variety of diifferent probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian Process function learning--combined with an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound sampling strategy--provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable, and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Memory traces and associations between them are fundamental for cognitive brain function. Neuron recordings suggest that distributed assemblies of neurons in the brain serve as memory traces for spatial information, real-world items, and concepts. How-ever, there is conflicting evidence regarding neural codes for associated memory traces. Some studies suggest the emergence of overlaps between assemblies during an association, while others suggest that the assemblies themselves remain largely unchanged and new assemblies emerge as neural codes for associated memory items. Here we study the emergence of neural codes for associated memory items in a generic computational model of recurrent networks of spiking neurons with a data-constrained rule for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The model depends critically on two parameters, which control the excitability of neurons and the scale of initial synaptic weights. By modifying these two parameters, the model can reproduce both experimental data from the human brain on the fast formation of associations through emergent overlaps between assemblies, and rodent data where new neurons are recruited to encode the associated memories. Hence our findings suggest that the brain can use both of these two neural codes for associations, and dynamically switch between them during consolidation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssessment of sleep/wake by electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) is invasive, resource intensive, and not amenable to rapid screening at scale for drug discovery. In the preclinical development of therapeutics for narcolepsy, efficacy tests are hindered by the lack of a non-EEG/EMG based translational test of symptom severity. The current methods study offers proof-of-principle that PiezoSleep (noninvasive, unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring of gross body movement, together with respiration patterns during behavioral quiescence), can be used to determine sleep/wake as applicable to the development of wake-promoting therapeutics. First, the translational wake-maintenance score (WMS, the ratio of time during the first half of the dark period spent in long wake bouts to short sleep bouts) of the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen was introduced as a means by which to rank narcoleptic orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type mice by sleep/wake fragmentation severity. Accuracy of the WMS to detect narcoleptic phenotypes were determined in genotype-confirmed orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type colony mates. The WMS was used to identify the most highly symptomatic mice for resource-intensive EEG/EMG studies for further analysis of specific arousal states. Second, PiezoSleep was demonstrated for use in high-throughput screening of wake-promoting compounds using modafinil in orexin/ataxin-3 and wild type mice.\\n\\nResultsThe WMS detected a narcoleptic phenotype with 89% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 98% positive predictive value. A 15-fold difference in WMS differentiated wild type littermates from the most severely affected orexin/ataxin-3 mice. Follow-up EEG/EMG study indicated 82% of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice with the lowest wake-maintenance scores met or exceeded the cataplexy-occurrence threshold ([&ge;] 3 bouts) for inclusion in therapeutic efficacy studies. In the PiezoSleep dose-response study, the ED50 for wake-promotion by modafinil was approximately 50 mg/kg in both genotypes. Using unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring, the efficacy of wake-promoting compounds can be determined in a 5-arm study with 60 mice in less than one week--a fraction of the time compared to EEG/EMG studies.\\n\\nConclusionsThe WMS on the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen quantifies the inability to sustain wakefulness and provides an accurate measure of the narcoleptic phenotype in mice. PiezoSleep offers rapid, scalable assessment of sleep/wake for high-throughput screening in drug discovery.",

The fluctuation theorem, which represents the thermodynamic properties of small fluctuating non-equilibrium systems, has been applied to the analysis of the thermodynamic properties of motor proteins in vitro. Here, we extend it to the axonal transport (displacement) of endosomes. The distribution of the displacement fluctuation had three or four distinct peaks around multiples of a unit value, which the fluctuation theorem can convert into the drag force exerted on the endosomes. The results demonstrated that a single cargo vesicle is conveyed by one to three or four units of force production.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we evaluate using genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) data to perform parentage assignment in lieu of traditional array data. The use of GBS data raises two issues: First, for low-coverage GBS data, it may not be possible to call the genotype at many loci, a critical first step for detecting opposing homozygous markers. Second, the amount of sequencing coverage may vary across individuals, making it challenging to directly compare the likelihood scores between putative parents. To address these issues we extend the probabilistic framework of Huisman (2017) and evaluate putative parents by comparing their (potentially noisy) genotypes to a series of proposal distributions. These distributions describe the expected genotype probabilities for the relatives of an individual. We assign putative parents as a parent if they are classified as a parent (as opposed to e.g., an unrelated individual), and if the assignment score passes a threshold. We evaluated this method on simulated data and found that (1) high-coverage GBS data performs similarly to array data and requires only a small number of markers to correctly assign parents and (2) low-coverage GBS data (as low as 0.1x) can also be used, provided that it is obtained across a large number of markers. When analysing the low-coverage GBS data, we also found a high number of false positives if the true parent is not contained within the list of candidate parents, but that this false positive rate can be greatly reduced by hand tuning the assignment threshold. We provide this parentage assignment method as a standalone program called AlphaAssign.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) impact 7% to 14% of all children in developed countries and are one of the leading causes of lifelong disability. Epigenetic modifications are poised at the interface between genes and environment and are predicted to reveal insight into the gene networks, cell types, and developmental timing of NDD etiology. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to examine DNA methylation in 49 human cortex samples from three different NDDs (autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, and Dup15q syndrome) and matched controls. Integration of methylation differences across NDDs with relevant genomic and genetic datasets revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) unique to each type of NDD but with shared regulatory functions in neurons and microglia. DMRs were significantly enriched for known NDD genetic risk factors, including both common inherited and rare de novo variants. Weighted region co-methylation network analysis revealed a module related to NDD diagnosis and enriched for microglial regulatory regions. Together, these results demonstrate an epigenomic signature of NDDs in human cortex shared with known genetic and immune etiological risk. Epigenomic insights into cell types and gene regulatory regions will aid in defining therapeutic targets and early biomarkers at the interface of genetic and environmental NDD risk factors.",

It remains unclear, however, to what extent the geometry of the tunnel influences protein folding. Here, using E. coli ribosomes with deletions in loops in proteins uL23 and uL24 that protrude into the tunnel, we investigate how tunnel geometry determines where proteins of different sizes fold. We find that a 29-residue zinc-finger domain normally folding close to the uL23 loop folds deeper in the tunnel in uL23 {Delta}loop ribosomes, while two ~100-residue protein normally folding close to the uL24 loop near the tunnel exit port fold at deeper locations in uL24 {Delta}loop ribosomes, in good agreement with results obtained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This supports the idea that cotranslational folding commences once a protein domain reaches a location in the exit tunnel where there is sufficient space to house the folded structure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/introPioneer factors have the exquisite ability to engage their target sites at nucleosomal DNA, which leads to a local remodeling of chromatin and the establishment of a transcriptional competence. However, the direct impact of enhancer priming by pioneer factors on the temporal control of gene expression and on mitotic memory remains elusive. In Drosophila embryos, the maternally deposited activator Zelda (Zld) exhibits key pioneer factor properties and indeed regulates the awakening of the zygotic genome. The analysis of thousands of endogenous Zld bound regions in various genetic contexts, as well as the study of isolated synthetic enhancers with static approaches, led to the proposal that Zld could act as a quantitative developmental timer. Here we employ quantitative live imaging methods and mathematical modeling to directly test the effect of Zld on temporal coordination in gene activation and on mitotic memory. Using an automatic tracking software, we quantified the timing of activation in hundreds of nuclei and their progeny in Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that increasing the number of Zld binding sites accelerates the kinetics of transcriptional activation regardless of their past transcriptional state. In spite of its known pioneering activities, we show that Zld is not a mitotic bookmarker and is neither necessary nor sufficient to foster mitotic memory. Fluorescent recovery after photo-bleaching and fluorescent correlation spectroscopy experiments reveal that, Zld is highly dynamic and exhibits transient binding to chromatin. We propose that Zld low binding rates could be compensated for by local accumulation of Zld in nuclear microenvironments in vivo, thus allowing rapid and coordinated gene activation.",

    "abstract": "The status signalling hypothesis aims to explain conspecific variation in ornamentation by suggesting that some ornaments signal dominance status. Here, we use multilevel meta-analytic models to challenge the textbook example of this hypothesis, the black bib of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We conducted a systematic review, and obtained raw data from published and unpublished studies to test whether dominance rank is positively associated with bib size across studies. Contrary to previous studies, our meta-analysis did not support this prediction. Furthermore, we found several biases in the literature that further question the support available for the status signalling hypothesis. First, the overall effect size of unpublished studies was zero, compared to the medium effect size detected in published studies. Second, the effect sizes of published studies decreased over time, and recently published effects were, on average, no longer distinguishable from zero. We discuss several explanations including pleiotropic, population- and context-dependent effects. Our findings call for reconsidering this established textbook example in evolutionary and behavioural ecology, raise important concerns about the validity of the current scientific publishing culture, and should stimulate renewed interest in understanding within-species variation in ornamental traits.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that the power of prestimulus neural alpha oscillations ([~]10 Hz) holds information on a perceivers bias or confidence in an ensuing perceptual decision, rather than perceptual sensitivity per se. Obviously, however, confidence also depends on the physical evidence available in the stimulus as well as on task performance. If prestimulus alpha power has a direct impact on decision confidence, this link should hold independent of variations in stimulus evidence and performance. We tested this assertion in a paradigm where human listeners (n = 17) rated their confidence in the discrimination of the pitch of two identical tones. Lower prestimulus alpha power in the electroencephalogram (EEG) was predictive of higher confidence ratings, but not of the decision outcome (i.e., judging the first or the second tone as being higher in pitch). Importantly, the link between prestimulus alpha power and decision confidence was not mediated by auditory evoked activity. Our findings demonstrate that the link between prestimulus alpha power and decision confidence does not hinge on physical evidence in the stimulus or task performance. Instead, these results speak to a model wherein low prestimulus alpha power increases neural baseline excitability, which is reflected in enhanced stimulus-evoked neural responses and higher confidence.\\n\\nSignificance statementIn order to understand the mechanistic relevance of neural oscillations for perception, we here relate these directly to changes in human auditory decision confidence. Human subjects rated their confidence in the discrimination of the pitch of two tones, which were, unbeknownst to the listener, physically identical. In the absence of changing evidence in the physical stimulus or changes in task performance, we demonstrate that prestimulus alpha power negatively relates to decision confidence. Our results support a model of cortical alpha oscillations as a proxy for neural baseline excitability in which lower prestimulus alpha power does not lead to more precise but rather to overall amplified neural representations.",

Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is an emergent fungal pathogen of rising public health concern due to increasing reports of outbreaks in healthcare settings and resistance to multiple classes of antifungal drugs. While distantly related to the more common pathogens C. albicans and C. glabrata, C. auris is closely related to three rarely observed and often multidrug-resistant species, C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii. Here, we generated and analyzed near complete genome assemblies and RNA-Seq-guided gene predictions for isolates from each of the four major C. auris clades and for C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii. Our analyses mapped seven chromosomes and revealed chromosomal rearrangements between C. auris clades and related species. We found conservation of genes involved in mating and meiosis and identified both MTLa and MTL C. auris isolates, suggesting the potential for mating between clades. Gene conservation analysis highlighted that many genes linked to drug resistance and virulence in other pathogenic Candida species are conserved in C. auris and related species including expanded families of transporters and lipases, as well as mutations and copy number variants in ERG11 that confer drug resistance. In addition, we found genetic features of the emerging species that likely underlie differences in virulence and drug response between these and other Candida species, including genes involved in cell wall structure. To begin to characterize the species-specific genes important for antifungal response, we profiled the gene expression of C. auris in response to voriconazole and amphotericin B and found induction of several transporters and metabolic regulators that may play a role in drug resistance. This study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic basis of drug resistance, potential for mating, and virulence in this emerging fungal clade.",

Pretreatment MR images of 494 glioblastoma patients (299 males and 195 females) were segmented to quantify tumor volumes. Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models and Students t-tests were used to assess which variables were associated with survival outcomes.\\n\\nResultsAmong males, tumor (T1Gd) radius was a predictor of overall survival (HR=1.027, p=0.044). Among females, higher tumor cell net invasion rate was a significant detriment to overall survival (HR=1.011, p<0.001). Female extreme survivors had significantly smaller tumors (T1Gd) (p=0.010 t-test), but tumor size was not correlated with female overall survival (p=0.955 CPH).

    "abstract": "We performed whole-genome sequencing for eight inbred rat strains commonly used in genetic mapping studies, and they are the founders of the NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) outbred colony. We provide their sequences and variant calls to the rat genomics community. When analyzing the variant calls we identified regions with unusually high heterozygosity. We show that these regions are consistent across the eight inbred strains, including the BN strain, which was the basis of the rat reference genome. These regions show significantly higher read depth than other regions in the genome. The evidence suggests that these regions may contain segmental duplications that are incorrectly overlaid in the reference genome. We provide masks for these suspected regions of mis-assembly as a resource for the community to flag potentially false interpretations of mapping results or functional data.",

    "abstract": "The P3a observed after novel events is an event-related potential comprising an early fronto-central phase and a late fronto-parietal phase. It has classically been considered to reflect the attention processing of distracting stimuli. However, novel sounds can lead to behavioral facilitation as much as behavioral distraction. This illustrates the duality of the orienting response which includes both an attentional and an arousal component. Using a paradigm with visual or auditory targets to detect and irrelevant unexpected distracting sounds to ignore, we showed that the facilitation effect by distracting sounds is independent of the target modality and endures more than 1500 ms. These results confirm that the behavioral facilitation observed after distracting sounds is related to an increase in unspecific phasic arousal on top of the attentional capture. Moreover, the amplitude of the early phase of the P3a to distracting sounds positively correlated with subjective arousal ratings, contrary to other event-related potentials. We propose that the fronto-central early phase of the P3a would index the arousing properties of distracting sounds and would be linked to the arousal component of the orienting response. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the P3a as a marker of distraction.",

Thus, the current burden, type, and sources of Gram-positive bacterial resistance and their dissemination routes from farm to fork is absent. To fill this One Health information gap, we systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science and African Journals Online for English research articles reporting on the resistance mechanisms and clonality of resistant Gram-positive bacteria in Africa within 2007 to 2018. The review and all statistical analysis were undertaken with 130 included articles.\\n\\nFrom our analyses, the same resistant Gram-positive bacterial clones, resistance genes, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are circulating in humans, animals and the environment.

    "abstract": "Adult zebrafish regenerate neurons in their brain, but the extent and variability of this capacity is unclear. Here we ask whether loss of various dopaminergic neuron populations is sufficient to trigger their functional regeneration. Genetic lineage tracing shows that specific diencephalic ependymo-radial glial progenitor cells (ERGs) give rise to new dopaminergic (Th+) neurons. Ablation elicits an immune response, increased proliferation of ERGs and increased addition of new Th+ neurons in populations that constitutively add new neurons, e.g. diencephalic population 5/6. Inhibiting the immune response attenuates neurogenesis to control levels. Boosting the immune response enhances ERG proliferation, but not addition of Th+ neurons. In contrast, in populations in which constitutive neurogenesis is undetectable, e.g. the posterior tuberculum and locus coeruleus, cell replacement and tissue integration are incomplete and transient. This is associated with loss of spinal Th+ axons, as well as permanent deficits in shoaling and reproductive behaviour. Hence, dopaminergic neuron populations in the adult zebrafish brain show vast differences in regenerative capacity that correlate with constitutive addition of neurons and depend on immune system activation.",

    "abstract": "Determining the net charge and protonation states populated by a small molecule in an environment of interest or the cost of altering those protonation states upon transfer to another environment is a prerequisite for predicting its physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties. The environment of interest can be aqueous, an organic solvent, a protein binding site, or a lipid bilayer. Predicting the protonation state of a small molecule is essential to predicting its interactions with biological macromolecules using computational models. Incorrectly modeling the dominant protonation state, shifts in dominant protonation state, or the population of significant mixtures of protonation states can lead to large modeling errors that degrade the accuracy of physical modeling. Low accuracy hinders the use of physical modeling approaches for molecular design. For small molecules, the acid dissociation constant (pKa) is the primary quantity needed to determine the ionic states populated by a molecule in an aqueous solution at a given pH. As a part of SAMPL6 community challenge, we organized a blind pKa prediction component to assess the accuracy with which contemporary pKa prediction methods can predict this quantity, with the ultimate aim of assessing the expected impact on modeling errors this would induce. While a multitude of approaches for predicting pKa values currently exist, predicting the pKas of drug-like molecules can be difficult due to challenging properties such as multiple titratable sites, heterocycles, and tautomerization. For this challenge, we focused on set of 24 small molecules selected to resemble selective kinase inhibitors--an important class of therapeutics replete with titratable moieties. Using a Sirius T3 instrument that performs automated acid-base titrations, we used UV absorbance-based pKa measurements to construct a high-quality experimental reference dataset of macroscopic pKas for the evaluation of computational pKa prediction methodologies that was utilized in the SAMPL6 pKa challenge. For several compounds in which the microscopic protonation states associated with macroscopic pKas were ambiguous, we performed follow-up NMR experiments to disambiguate the microstates involved in the transition. This dataset provides a useful standard benchmark dataset for the evaluation of pKa prediction methodologies on kinase inhibitor-like compounds.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the binding affinities of small organic molecules to biological macro-molecules can greatly accelerate drug discovery by reducing the number of compounds that must be synthesized to realize desired potency and selectivity goals. Unfortunately, the process of assessing the accuracy of current computational approaches to affinity prediction against binding data to biological macro-molecules is frustrated by several challenges, such as slow conformational dynamics, multiple titratable groups, and the lack of high-quality blinded datasets. Over the last several SAMPL blind challenge exercises, host-guest systems have emerged as a practical and effective way to circumvent these challenges in assessing the predictive performance of current-generation quantitative modeling tools, while still providing systems capable of possessing tight binding affinities. Here, we present an overview of the SAMPL6 host-guest binding affinity prediction challenge, which featured three supramolecular hosts: octa-acid (OA), the closely related tetra-endo-methyl-octa-acid (TEMOA), and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8), along with 21 small organic guest molecules. A total of 119 entries were received from 10 participating groups employing a variety of methods that spanned from electronic structure and movable type calculations in implicit solvent to alchemical and potential of mean force strategies using empirical force fields with explicit solvent models. While empirical models tended to obtain better performance than first-principle methods, it was not possible to identify a single approach that consistently provided superior results across all host-guest systems and statistical metrics. Moreover, the accuracy of the methodologies generally displayed a substantial dependence on the system considered, emphasizing the need for host diversity in blind evaluations. Several entries exploited previous experimental measurements of similar host-guest systems in an effort to improve their physical-based predictions via some manner of rudimentary machine learning; while this strategy succeeded in reducing systematic errors, it did not correspond to an improvement in statistical correlation. Comparison to previous rounds of the host-guest binding free energy challenge highlights an overall improvement in the correlation obtained by the affinity predictions for OA and TEMOA systems, but a surprising lack of improvement regarding root mean square error over the past several challenge rounds. The data suggests that further refinement of force field parameters, as well as improved treatment of chemical effects (e.g., buffer salt conditions, protonation states) may be required to further enhance predictive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Under oxygen/nutrient deprivation cancer cells modify the balance between fatty acid (FA) synthesis and uptake, which alters the levels of individual triglyceride or phospholipid sub-species. These modifications may affect survival and drug-uptake in cancer cells. Here, we aimed to attain a more holistic overview of the lipidomic profiles of cancer cells under stress and assess the changes in major lipid-classes. First, expressions of markers of FA synthesis/uptake in cancer cells were assessed and found to be differentially regulated under metabolic stress. Next, we performed a broad lipidomics assay, comprising 244 lipids from six major classes, which allowed us to investigate robust stress induced changes in median levels of different lipid classes -additionally stratified by fatty acid side chain saturation status. The lipidomic profiles of cancer cells were predominantly affected by nutrient-deprivation. Neutral lipid compositions were markedly modified under serum-deprivation and, strikingly, the cellular level of triglyceride subspecies decreased with increasing number of double bonds in their fatty acyl chains. In contrast, cancer cells maintained lipid class homeostasis under hypoxic stress. We conclude that although the levels of individual lipid moieties alter under hypoxia, the robust averages of broader lipid class remain unchanged.",

    "abstract": "The clock of life ticks as fast as how efficiently proteins could perform their functional dynamics. Protein complexes execute functions via several large-scale intrinsic motions across multiple conformational states, which occur at a timescale of nano-to milliseconds for well-folded proteins. Computationally expensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been the only theoretical tool to time and size these motions, though barely to their slowest ends. Here, we convert a simple elastic network model (ENM), which takes a few seconds (ubiquitin) to hours (ribosome) for the analysis, into a molecular timer and sizer to gauge the slowest functional motions of proteins. Quasi-harmonic analysis, fluctuation-profile matching (FPM) and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem (WKT) are used to define the \\\"time-periods\\\", t, for anharmonic principal components (PCs) which are validated by NMR order parameters. The PCs with their respective \\\"time-periods\\\" are mapped to the eigenvalues ({lambda}ENM) of the corresponding ENM modes. Thus, the power laws t(ns) = 86.9{lambda}ENM-1.9 and {sigma}2([A]2) = 46.1 {lambda}ENM-2.5 are established allowing the characterization of the time scales of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-solved conformers, crystallographic anisotropic displacement parameters, and important ribosomal motions, as well as motional sizes of the latter.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe time scale of biological processes is governed by protein functional dynamics that often corresponds to the largest conformational spread and the longest time scales among all possible motions. Current simulation methodologies cannot reach the slowest, often functional, motions especially for supramolecular machineries. Borrowing the spring-bead model used in polymer physics since 60s, the efficient elastic network model (ENM), introduced in 90s, captured all modes of protein motions but largely underestimated the time scales of slowest modes due to its harmonic approximation.\\n\\nHere we map water-damped modes sampled by MD simulations to corresponding ones in ENM and thereby establish 2 power laws that describe the authentic time scales and sizes for the slowest anharmonic modes as functions of ENM eigenvalues. With that, we adequately describe the sizes and time scales for three proteins, confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and ribosome that contains ~0.2 million heavy atoms (~ 20 thousands coarse-grained nodes).",

    "abstract": "Deflecting biomineralized crystals attached to vestibular hair cells are necessary for maintaining balance. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are useful organisms to study these biomineralized crystals called otoliths, as many required genes are homologous to human otoconial development. We sought to identify and characterize the causative gene in a trio of mutants, no content (nco) and corkscrew (csr), and vanished (vns), which fail to develop otoliths during early ear development. We show that nco, csr, and vns have potentially deleterious mutations in polyketide synthase (pks1), a multi-modular protein that has been previously implicated in biomineralization events in chordates and echinoderms. We found that Otoconin-90 (Oc90) expression within the otocyst is normal in nco and csr; therefore, it is not sufficient for otolith biomineralization in zebrafish. Similarly, normal localization of Otogelin, a protein required for otolith tethering in the otolithic membrane, is not sufficient for Oc90 attachment. Furthermore, eNOS signaling and Endothelin-1 signaling were the most up- and down-regulated pathways during otolith agenesis in nco, respectively. Our results demonstrate distinct processes for otolith nucleation and biomineralization in vertebrates and will be a starting point for models that are independent of Oc90-mediated seeding. This study will serve as a basis for investigating the role of eNOS signaling and Endothelin-1 signaling during otolith formation.",

    "abstract": "CELF6 is a RNA-binding protein in a family of proteins with roles in human health and disease, however little is known about the mRNA targets or in vivo function of this protein. We utilized CLIP-Seq to identify, for the first time, in vivo targets of CELF6 and identify hundreds of transcripts bound by CELF6 in the brain. We found these are disproportionately mRNAs coding for synaptic proteins. We then conducted functional validation of these targets, testing greater than 400 CELF6 bound sequence elements for their activity, applying a massively parallel reporter assay framework to evaluation of the CLIP data. We also mutated potential binding motifs within these elements and tested their impact. This comprehensive analysis led us to ascribe a previously unknown function to CELF6: we found bound elements were generally repressive of translation, that CELF6 further enhances this repression via decreasing RNA abundance, and this process was dependent on UGU-rich sequence motifs. This greatly extends the known role for CELF6, which had previously been defined only as a splicing factor. We further extend these findings by demonstrating the same function for CELF3, CELF4, and CELF5. Finally, we demonstrate that the CELF6 targets are derepressed in CELF6 mutant mice in vivo, confirming this new role in the brain. Thus, our study demonstrates that CELF6 and other sub-family members are repressive CNS RNA-binding proteins, and CELF6 downregulates specific mRNAs in vivo.",

A coarse level representation in early lmVTC activity allowed for decoding of visually dissimilar real words, pseudowords, and false fonts. Functional interactions between anterior ventral temporal regions, possibly containing stored knowledge about words, and low-order visual regions occurred after this initial stage of processing and was followed by the individuation of orthographically similar real words in lmVTC, but not similar pseudowords, letter strings, or false fonts. These results suggest that the individuation of real word representations in lmVTC is catalyzed by stored knowledge about word forms that emerges from network-level interactions with anterior regions of the temporal lobe.",

MESSI was used to infer coevolution rates associated with GC, AU (AT in DNA), GU (GT in DNA) pairs in non-coding RNA alignments, and single-stranded RNA and DNA virus alignments. Inferred rates of GU pair coevolution were found to be higher at base-paired sites in single-stranded RNA viruses and non-coding RNAs than those of GT pairs in single-stranded DNA viruses, suggesting that GT pairs do not stabilise DNA secondary structures to the same extent as GU pairs in RNA. The relative coevolution rates associated with GC, AU, and GU pairs were largely consistent with their relative chemical base-pairing stabilities (GC base-pairs being more stable than AU base-pairs, and AU base-pairs being more stable than GU base-pairs). Additionally, MESSI estimates the degrees of coevolution at individual base-paired sites in an alignment. These estimates were computed for a SHAPE-MaP-determined HIV-1 NL4-3 RNA secondary structure and two corresponding alignments. MESSIs estimates of coevolution were significantly more strongly correlated with experimentally-determined SHAPE-MaP pairing scores as compared to three non-evolutionary measures of base-pairing covariation. Finally, to assist researchers in prioritising substructures with potential biological functionality, MESSI automatically identifies substructures and ranks them by degrees of coevolution at base-paired sites within them. Such a ranking was created for an HIV-1 subtype B alignment, revealing an excess of top-ranking substructures that have been previously identified in the literature as having structure-related functional importance, and a number of top-ranking structures that have not yet been characterised.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3.3 is a developmentally essential variant encoded by two independent genes in human (H3F3A and H3F3B). While this two-gene arrangement is evolutionarily conserved, its origins and function remain unknown. Phylogenetics, synteny and gene structure analyses of the H3.3 genes from 32 metazoan genomes indicate independent evolutionary paths for H3F3A and H3F3B. While H3F3B bears similarities with H3.3 genes in distant organisms and with canonical H3 genes, H3F3A is sarcopterygian-specific and evolves under strong purifying selection. Additionally, H3F3B codon-usage preferences resemble those of broadly expressed genes and  cell differentiation-induced genes, while codon-usage of H3F3A resembles that of  cell proliferation-induced genes. We infer that H3F3B is more similar to the ancestral H3.3 gene and likely evolutionarily adapted for broad expression pattern in diverse cellular programs, while H3F3A adapted for a subset of gene expression programs. Thus, the arrangement of two independent H3.3 genes facilitates fine-tuning of H3.3 expression across cellular programs.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory shows that social interactions involving coordination between individuals are subject to an \\\"evolutionary trap.\\\" Once a suboptimal strategy has evolved, mutants playing an alternative strategy are counterselected because they fail to coordinate with the majority. This creates a detrimental situation from which evolution cannot escape. To determine how this problem materializes in a model with a greater degree of realism than conventional game-theoretical models, we simulate the life and the long-term evolution of a population of individuals playing a two-player coordination game, using the framework of evolutionary robotics. We first confirm the existence of an evolutionary trap in a simple setting. We then, however, reveal that this problem disappears in a more realistic setting where individuals need to coordinate with one another. In this setting, robots evolve an ability to adapt plastically their behavior to one another, as this improves the efficiency of their interaction. This ability has an unintended evolutionary consequence: a genetic mutation affecting one individuals behavior also indirectly alters their partners behavior because the two individuals influence one another, which is called an \\\"indirect genetic effect\\\". Consequently, pairs of partners can virtually change strategy together with a single mutation, and the evolutionary barrier between alternative strategies disappears. This finding reveals a general principle that could play a role in nature to smoothen the transition to efficient collective behaviors in all games with multiple equilibriums.",

Using a DNN as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, our recent study found that human brain activity patterns measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be decoded (translated) into DNN feature values given the same inputs. However, not all DNN features are equally decoded, indicating a gap between the DNN and human vision. Here, we present a dataset derived through the DNN feature decoding analyses including fMRI signals of five human subjects during image viewing, decoded feature values of DNNs (AlexNet and VGG19), and decoding accuracies of individual DNN features with their rankings. The decoding accuracies of individual features were highly correlated between subjects, suggesting the systematic differences between the brain and DNNs.

    "abstract": "IFN{gamma} and IL10 pathways elicit functionally opposing cell fates, however, these two stimuli activate common transcription factors like STAT1 and STAT3 (S/1/3). How the two stimuli regulate the dynamics of S/1/3 activation remains less understood. Here, we experimentally measured the signaling dynamics of S/1/3 in response to IFN{gamma} and IL10 and found that STAT3, in particular, exhibits a bell-shaped response to both stimuli with maximal activation in an intermediate dose. We built a mathematical model, which quantitatively captured the S/1/3 dynamics and by model analysis, we identified the primary regulators controlling the bell-shaped STAT3 responses in both pathways. As the STATs are activated in response to both stimuli, in a scenario when cells are subjected to co-stimulation of IFN{gamma} and IL10, an interpathway competition to activate the common substrate is plausible. Additionally, a strong transcriptional induction of SOCS1 (a negative regulator of IFN{gamma} pathway) was observed upon IL10 stimulation, suggesting that IL10 pathway can potentially inhibit the IFN{gamma} pathway via SOCS1 induction. To quantitatively understand the S/1/3 responses to co-stimulation we next simulated the same which predicted STAT3 activation and SOCS1 induction dynamics would robustly remain IL10 driven. Subsequent experiments validated the model predictions. Further, the model analysis identified the primary regulators controlling the robustness of IL10-STAT3 axis in co-stimulation. Together, our data-driven model quantitatively captured the dynamics of the STATs in response to both pro (IFN{gamma}) and anti (IL10)-inflammatory stimuli and identifies distinct regulatory elements controlling STAT3 signaling in individual and co-stimulation conditions.",

    "abstract": "MYCN is a transcription factor that is aberrantly expressed in many tumor types and is often correlated with poor patient prognosis. Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of MYC family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of MYC proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of MYCN overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of MYCN induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of MYCN. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of MYCN overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced. Thus, our study uncovered MYCN induction and nutrient levels as important metabolic master switches in neuroblastoma cells and identified critical nodes that restrict tumor cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Severe locomotor impairment is a common phenotype of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsons disease (PD). Drosophila models of PD, studied from more than a decade, have helped in understanding the interaction between various genetic factors, such as parkin and PINK1, in this disease. To characterize locomotor behavioural phenotypes for these genes, fly climbing assays have been widely used. While these simple current assays for locomotor defects in Drosophila mutants measure some locomotor phenotypes well, it is possible that detection of subtle changes in behaviour is important to understand the early manifestation of locomotor disorders. We introduce a novel climbing behaviour assay which provides such fine-scale behavioural data and tests this proposition for the Drosophila model. We use this inexpensive, fully automated, high resolution assay to quantitatively characterize the parameters of climbing behaviour in three contexts. First, we characterize wild type flies and uncover a hitherto unknown sexual dimorphism in climbing behaviour. Second, we study climbing behaviour of heterozygous mutants of genes implicated in the fly PD model and reveal previously unreported prominent locomotor defects in some of these heterozygous fly lines. Finally, we study locomotor defects in a homozygous proprioceptory mutation (Trp-{gamma}1) known to affect fine motor control in Drosophila. Moreover, we identify aberrant geotactic behaviour in Trp-{gamma}1 mutants, thereby opening up a finer assay for geotaxis and its genetic basis. Our assay is therefore a cost-effective, general tool for measuring locomotor behaviours of wild type and mutant flies in fine detail and can reveal mild motor defects.\\n\\nSignificance statementFine control of neuronal activity is required for proper motor output. Severe locomotor impairment is a common result of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsons disease (PD). The fruitfly, Drosophila, has been widely used as a model system to study the genetics of these disorders and simple climbing assays have been used to study the behavioural phenotypes of mutations in these genes. Here we introduce a novel, fully automated, high resolution climbing behaviour assay and use this assay to characterize climbing behaviour in wild type flies and in various fly mutant lines related to PD and defects in proprioception. Our assay is a general tool for measuring locomotor behaviours of flies in fine detail and can reveal very mild motor defects.",

SIM is a valuable method for high resolution imaging of fixed cells or tissues labeled with conventional fluorophores, as well as for imaging the dynamics of live cells expressing fluorescent protein constructs. In SIM, one acquires a set of images with shifting illumination patterns. This set of images is subsequently treated with image analysis algorithms to produce an image with reduced out-of-focus light (optical sectioning) and/or with improved resolution (super-resolution).\\n\\nFindingsFive complete and freely available SIM datasets are presented including raw and analyzed data.

We processed the data using established optical sectioning SIM and super-resolution SIM methods, and with newer Bayesian restoration approaches which we are developing.\\n\\nConclusionVarious methods for SIM data acquisition and processing are actively being developed, but complete raw data from SIM experiments is not typically published.

    "abstract": "BackgroundVariation in body size is thought to be a major driver of a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary patterns, including changes in development, reproduction, and longevity. Caenorhabditis inopinata is a recently-discovered fig-associated nematode that is unusually large relative to other members of the genus, including the closely related model system C. elegans. Here we test whether the dramatic increase in body size has led to correlated changes in key life history and developmental parameters within this species.\\n\\nResultsUsing four developmental milestones, C. inopinata was found to have a slower rate of development than C. elegans across a range of temperatures. Despite this, C. inopinata did not reveal any differences in adult lifespan from C. elegans after accounting for differences in developmental timing and reproductive mode. C. inopinata fecundity was generally lower than that of C. elegans, but fitness improved under continuous-mating, consistent with sperm-limitation under gonochoristic (male/female) reproduction. C. inopinata also revealed greater fecundity and viability at higher temperatures.\\n\\nConclusionConsistent with observations in other ectotherms, slower growth in C. inopinata indicates a potential trade-off between body size and developmental timing, whereas its unchanged lifespan suggests that longevity is largely uncoupled from its increase in body size. Additionally, temperature-dependent patterns of fitness in C. inopinata are consistent with its geographic origins in subtropical Okinawa. Overall, these results underscore the extent to which changes in ecological context and body size can shape life history traits.",

Development of stomata is guided by endogenous and environmental cues and is tightly coupled to overall plant growth 1,2,3. YODA signaling pathway is essential to stomatal lineage specification4,5,6 since it regulates the activities of transcription factors such as SPEECHLESS (SPCH)7,8,9,10. Heat-shock proteins 90 (HSP90s) are evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperones implicated in a broad range of signalling pathways being integrated in interaction networks with client proteins11,12,13,14. Herein, based on genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cell biological evidence we report that heat-stress conditions affect phosphorylation and deactivation of SPCH and modulate stomatal density. We show that genetic and physical interactions between HSP90s and YODA control stomatal patterning, distribution and morphology. We provide solid evidence that HSP90s play a major role in transducing the heat-stress response since they act upstream and downstream of YODA signalling, regulate the activity and nucleocytoplasmic distribution of MAPKs, and the activation of SPCH. Thus, HSPs control the stomatal development both under normal temperature and acute heat-stress conditions. Our results demonstrate that HSP90s couple stomatal formation and patterning to environmental cues providing an adaptive mechanism of heat-stress tolerance response and stomatal formation in Arabidopsis.",

Here we show that stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus actively transcribe the pro-activation factor Ascl1 regardless of their activation state. We found that the inhibitor of DNA binding protein Id4 suppresses Ascl1 activity in neural stem cell cultures. Id4 sequesters Ascl1 heterodimerisation partner E47, promoting Ascl1 protein degradation and neural stem cell quiescence. Accordingly, elimination of Id4 from stem cells in the adult hippocampus results in abnormal accumulation of Ascl1 protein and premature stem cell activation. We also found that multiple signalling pathways converge on the regulation of Id4 to reduce the activity of hippocampal stem cells. Id4 therefore maintains quiescence of adult neural stem cells, in sharp contrast with its role of promoting the proliferation of embryonic neural progenitors.",

Zebrafish imaging analyses of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling-gradient, which acts as a morphogen to establish embryonic anterior-posterior patterning, revealed that unfit cells with abnormal Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity spontaneously appear and produce noise in the Wnt/{beta}-catenin-gradient. Communication between the unfit and neighboring fit cells via cadherin proteins stimulates the apoptosis of the unfit cells by activating Smad signaling and reactive oxygen species production. This unfit cell elimination is required for proper Wnt/{beta}-catenin-gradient formation and consequent anterior-posterior patterning. Because this gradient controls patterning not only in the embryo but also in adult tissues, this system may support tissue robustness and disease prevention.",

Here, we describe 34 excised Saccharomyces cerevisiae introns that, although rapidly degraded in log-phase growth, accumulate as linear RNAs under either saturated-growth conditions or other stresses that cause prolonged inhibition of TORC1, a key integrator of growth signaling. Introns that become stabilized remain associated with components of the spliceosome and differ from the other spliceosomal introns in having a short distance between their lariat branch point and 3' splice site, which is necessary and sufficient for their stabilization. Deletion of these unusual introns is disadvantageous in saturated conditions and causes aberrantly high growth rates of yeast chronically challenged with the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Reintroduction of native or engineered stable introns suppresses this aberrant rapamycin response. Thus, excised introns function within the TOR growth-signaling network of S. cerevisiae, and more generally, excised spliceosomal introns can have biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Glial-neuronal signaling at synapses is widely appreciated, but how glia interact with neuronal cell bodies is less clear. Drosophila cortex glia are restricted to brain regions devoid of synapses, providing an opportunity to characterize interactions between glia and neuronal somas. Mutations in the cortex glial NCKX exchanger zydeco abolish microdomain Ca2+ oscillatory activity and elevate glial Ca2+, predisposing animals to seizures. To determine how cortex glial Ca2+ signaling controls neuronal excitability, an in vivo modifier screen for the NCKXzydeco seizure phenotype was performed. Our results indicate elevation of glial Ca2+ causes hyperactivation of calcineurin-dependent endocytosis and accumulation of early endosomes. Knockdown of sandman, a K2P channel, recapitulates NCKXzydeco seizures. Restoring glial K+ buffering by overexpressing a leak K+ channel rescues zydeco seizures. These findings indicate cortex glial Ca2+ couples to K+ buffering through calcineurin regulated endo-exocytotic balance and K2P channel expression to modulate neuronal excitability.",

    "abstract": "We studied the propagation of orientation selectivity over layers in a model of rodent primary visual cortex in terms of the underlying connectivity. While significant progress has been made in measuring the activity in the different sub-populations as well as the connectivity between those in experiments, a comprehensive theoretical explanation of how network structure and its dynamics are related is still missing. We suggest a model of layered mouse visual cortex by extending the model suggested by Potjans and Diesmann (2014) with thalamic input that has an orientation bias according to Sadeh et al. (2014). We then studied the response properties of the network to such non-homogeneous input. We found that, without further assumptions, the connectivity derived from experimental data leads to layer-specific distributions of orientation selectivity very similar to what has been observed in mouse experiments. Interestingly, the network settles in a dynamical operating point, in which the efficacy of the different projections and their contribution to orientation tuning deviate strongly from the expectations based on the underlying anatomical connectivity. To understand the processes that shape the observed dynamics, it is essential to perform the analysis of the microcircuit on the system level. With that perspective, we find in particular that the difference in tuning of L2/3 and L4 neurons is an immediate, albeit unexpected consequence of the specific network connectivity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for predicting the effects of optogenetic stimulation of specific neuronal sub-populations and demonstrate its power in network simulations.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the precise roles of neuronal sub-populations in shaping the activity of neuronal networks is a fundamental objective of neuroscience research. To this end, our work makes three important contributions. First, we show that the experimentally extracted connectivity suffices to explain the degree of selectivity of sub-populations in mouse visual cortex to visual stimulation. Second, we introduce a novel system-level approach for the analysis of input-output relations of recurrent networks, which lead to distinct activity patterns. Third, we present a method for the design of optogenetic experiments that can be used to devise specific stimuli which result in a desired and predictable change of neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new and increasingly sophisticated behaviors after birth is accompanied by dramatic increase of newly established synaptic connections in the nervous system. Little is known, however, of how nascent connections are organized to support such new behaviors alongside existing ones. To understand this, in the larval zebrafish we examined the development of spinal pathways from hindbrain V2a neurons and the role of these pathways in the development of locomotion. We found that new projections are continually layered laterally to existing neuropil, and give rise to distinct pathways that function in parallel to existing pathways. Across these chronologically layered pathways, the connectivity patterns and biophysical properties vary systematically to support a behavioral repertoire with a wide range of kinematics and dynamics. Such layering of new parallel circuits equipped with systematically changing properties may be central to the postnatal diversification and increasing sophistication of an animals behavioral repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Normal arm swing plays a role in decreasing the cost of transport during walking. However, whether excessive arm swing can reduce the cost of transport even further is unknown. Therefore, we tested the effects of normal and exaggerated arm swing on the cost of transport in the current study. Healthy participants (n=12) walked on a treadmill (1.25 m/s) in seven trials with different arm swing amplitudes (in-phase, passive restricted, active restricted, normal, three gradations of extra arm swing), while metabolic energy cost and the vertical angular momentum (VAM) and ground reaction moment (GRM) were measured.\\n\\nIn general, VAM and GRM decreased as arm swing amplitude was increased, except for in the largest arm swing amplitude condition. The decreases in VAM and GRM were accompanied by a decrease in cost of transport from in-phase walking (negative amplitude) up to a slightly increased arm swing (non-significant difference compared to normal arm swing). The most excessive arm swings led to an increase in the cost of transport, most likely due to the cost of swinging the arms. In conclusion, increasing arm swing amplitude leads to a reduction in vertical angular moment and ground reaction moments, but it does not lead to a reduction in cost of transport for the most excessive arm swing amplitudes. Normal or slightly increased arm swing amplitude appears to be optimal in terms of cost of transport in young and healthy individuals.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTExcessive arm swing reduces the vertical angular momentum and ground reaction moment, but not necessarily the energetic cost of transport.",

    "abstract": "Young adults with ADHD often gain less than expected from practice sessions well-suited for their peers. Here, we tested whether task-irrelevant, low-intensity vibratory stimulation (VtSt), suggested to modulate motor learning, may compensate for such learning deficits. Participants were given training, either with or without VtSt, on a sequence of finger opposition movements. Under VtSt, typical individuals had reduced overnight, consolidation phase, gains; performance partly recovering one week later. In contrast, participants with ADHD benefitted from VtSt both during the acquisition (online) and the overnight skill consolidation (offline) phases. One week later, both groups showed robust retention of the gains in performance, but when tested with background VtSt, individuals with ADHD outperformed their typical peers. We propose that ADHD can confer advantages in performance, learning and skill memory consolidation in specific  noisy conditions that adversely affect typical adults; we conjecture that the effects of VtSt are contingent on baseline arousal levels.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in several genes encoding components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex cause syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Here, we report on 5 individuals with mutations in the SMARCD1 gene, presenting with ID, developmental delay, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and small extremities. The mutations were proven to be de novo in 4 of the 5 individuals. Mutations in other SWI/SNF components cause Coffin-Siris, Nicolaides-Baraitser, or other syndromic ID disorders. Although the individuals presented here have some clinical overlap with these disorders, they lack the typical facial dysmorphisms. To gain insight into the function of SMARCD1 in neurons, we investigated the Drosophila ortholog, Bap60, in postmitotic memory-forming neurons of the adult Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Targeted knockdown of Bap60 in the MB of adult flies causes defects in long-term memory. Mushroom body specific transcriptome analysis revealed that Bap60 is required for context-dependent expression of genes involved in neuron function and development in juvenile flies when synaptic connections are actively being formed in response to experience. Taken together, we identify SMARCD1 mutations as a novel cause of ID, and establish a role for the SMARCD1 ortholog Bap60 in regulation of neurodevelopmental genes during a critical time window of juvenile adult brain development that is essential in establishing neuronal circuits that are required for learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are thought to encode reward prediction errors (RPE) by comparing actual and expected rewards. In recent years, much work has been done to identify how the brain uses and computes this signal.While several lines of evidence suggest the the interplay of he DA and the inhibitory interneurons in the VTA implements the RPE computaiton, it still remains unclear how the DA neurons learn key quantities, for example the amplitude and the timing of primary rewards during conditioning tasks. Furthermore, exogenous nicotine and endogenous acetylcholine, acting on both VTA DA and GABA ({gamma} - aminobutyric acid) neurons via nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), also likely affect these computations. To explore the potential circuit-level mechanisms for RPE computations during classical-conditioning tasks, we developed a minimal computational model of the VTA circuitry. The model was designed to account for several reward-related properties of VTA afferents and recent findings on VTA GABA neuron dynamics during conditioning.\\n\\nWith our minimal model, we showed that the RPE can be learned by a two-speed process computing reward timing and magnitude. Including a model of nAChR-mediated currents in the VTA DA-GABA circuit, we also showed that nicotine should reduce the acetylcholine action on the VTA GABA neurons by receptor desensitization and therefore potentially boost the DA responses to reward information. Together, our results delineate the mechanisms by which RPE are computed in the brain, and suggest a hypothesis on nicotine-mediated effects on reward-related perception and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Genetic models in Drosophila have made invaluable contributions to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. In human patients, some neurodegenerative diseases lead to characteristic movement dysfunctions, such as abnormal gait and tremors. However, it is currently unknown whether similar movement defects occur in the respective fly models, which could be used to model and better understand the pathophysiology of movement disorders. To address this question, we developed a machine-learning image-analysis programme -- Feature Learning-based LImb segmentation and Tracking (FLLIT) -- that automatically tracks leg claw positions of freely moving flies recorded on high-speed video, generating a series of body and leg movement parameters. Of note, FLLIT requires no user input for learning. We used FLLIT to characterise fly models of Parkinsons Disease (PD) and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3). Between these models, walking gait and tremor characteristics differed markedly, and recapitulated signatures of the respective human diseases. Selective expression of mutant SCA3 in dopaminergic neurons led to phenotypes resembling that of PD flies, suggesting that the behavioural phenotype may depend on the circuits affected, rather than the specific nature of the mutation. Different mutations produced tremors in distinct leg pairs, indicating that different motor circuits are affected. Almost 190,000 video frames were tracked in this study, allowing, for the first time, high-throughput analysis of gait and tremor features in Drosophila mutants. As an efficient assay of mutant gait and tremor features in an important model system, FLLIT will enable the analysis of the neurogenetic mechanisms that underlie movement disorders.",

We first investigated changes in the neuromuscular junction and motor neuron innervation following a surgical hindlimb ischemia model of critical limb ischemia in mice. Along with previous findings that support remodeling of the neuromuscular junction, we report that ischemic injury also causes significant alterations to the myofiber through a muscle stem cell-mediated increase of myonuclei number per fiber, a concomitant decrease in myonuclear domain size, and an increase in relative mitochondrial content per myonucleus. These results indicate that as a regenerative response to critical limb ischemia, myofibers exhibit myonuclear expansion to allow enhanced transcriptional support and an increase in mitochondrial content for bioenergetic need of the energy-demanding tissue regeneration.",

Moreover, the amygdala widely broadcasts internal state information via several output pathways to larger brain networks, and sensory responses in BA occur independently of behavioral state encoding. Thus, the brain processes external stimuli and internal states in an orthogonal manner, which may facilitate rapid and flexible selection of appropriate, state-dependent behavioral responses.",

    "abstract": "PREMISE OF THE STUDYThe evolution of novel fruit morphologies has been integral to the success of angiosperms. The inflated fruiting calyx, in which the balloon-like calyx swells to completely surround the fruit, has evolved repeatedly across angiosperms and is postulated to aid in protection and dispersal. Here we investigate the evolution of this trait in the tomatillos and their allies (Physalideae, Solanaceae), using a newly estimated phylogeny and a suite of comparative methods to infer evolutionary gains and losses.\\n\\nMETHODSThe Physalideae phylogeny was estimated using DNA sequences from four regions (ITS, LEAFY, trnL-F, waxy) using maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference. Maximum likelihood model selection was used to determine the best fitting model of trait evolution. Using this model, we estimated ancestral states along with the numbers of gains and losses of fruiting calyx accrescence and inflation with Bayesian stochastic mapping. Also, phylogenetic signal in calyx morphology was examined with two metrics (parsimony score and Fritz and Purvis D).\\n\\nKEY RESULTSThe well resolved phylogeny points to multiple taxa in need of revision, including the eight genera that are non-monophyletic as presently circumscribed. Model fitting indicated that calyx evolution has proceeded in stepwise fashion, from non-accrescent, to accrescent, to inflated. Moreover, these transitions appear to be largely irreversible. Among the 215 sampled Physalideae, we inferred 24 gains of fruiting calyx accrescence, 24 subsequent transitions to a fully inflated calyx and only two reversals. A median of 50 shifts were estimated in total across the clade from the ancestral non-accrescent calyx. Nonetheless, fruiting calyx accrescence and inflation show strong phylogenetic signal.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur phylogeny greatly improves the resolution of Physalideae and highlights the need for taxonomic work. The analyses of trait evolution reveal that the inflated fruiting calyx has evolved many times and that the trajectory towards this phenotype is generally stepwise and directional.

    "abstract": "The family of VPS10P domain receptors emerges as central regulator of intracellular protein sorting in neurons with relevance for various brain pathologies. Here, we identified a unique role for the family member SorCS2 in protection of neurons from oxidative stress and from epilepsy-induced cell death. We show that SorCS2 acts as sorting receptor that targets the neuronal amino acid transporter EAAT3 to the plasma membrane to facilitate import of cysteine, required for synthesis of the reactive oxygen species scavenger glutathione. Absence of SorCS2 activity causes aberrant transport of EAAT3 to lysosome for catabolism and impairs cysteine uptake. As a consequence, SorCS2-deficient mice exhibit oxidative brain damage that coincides with enhanced neuronal cell death and increased mortality during epilepsy. Our findings highlight a protective role for SorCS2 in neuronal stress response and provide an explanation for upregulation of the receptor seen in surviving neurons of the human epileptic brain.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the forces that drive the dynamics of adaptive evolution is a goal of many subfields within evolutionary biology. The fitness landscape analogy has served as a useful abstraction for addressing these topics across many systems, and recent treatments have revealed how different environments can frame the particulars of adaptive evolution by changing the topography of fitness landscapes. In this study, we examine how the larger, ambient genotypic context in which the fitness landscape being modeled is embedded affects fitness landscape topography and subsequent evolution. Using simulations on empirical fitness landscapes, we discover that genotypic context, defined by genetic variability in regions outside of the locus under study (in this case, an essential bacterial enzyme target of antibiotics), influences the speed and direction of evolution in several surprising ways. These findings have implications for how we study the evolution of drug resistance in nature, and for presumptions about how biological evolution might be expected to occur in genetically-modified organisms. More generally, the findings speak to theory surrounding how \\\"difference can beget difference\\\" in adaptive evolution: that small genetic differences between organisms can greatly alter the specifics of how evolution occurs, which can rapidly drive even slightly diverged populations further apart.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTechnological advances enable scientists to engineer individual mutations at specific sites within an organisms genome with increasing ease. These breakthroughs have provided scientists with tools to study how different engineered mutations affect the function of a given gene or protein, yielding useful insight into genotype-phenotype mapping and evolution. In this study, we use engineered strains of bacteria to show how the dynamics (speed and direction) of evolution of drug resistance in an enzyme depends on the species-type of that bacterial enzyme, and on the presence/absence of mutations in other genes in the bacterial genome. These findings have broad implications for public health, genetic engineering, and theories of speciation. In the context of public health and biomedicine, our results suggest that future efforts in managing antimicrobial resistance must consider genetic makeup of different pathogen populations before predicting how resistance will occur, rather than assuming that the same resistance pathways will appear in different pathogen populations. With regard to broader theory in evolutionary biology, our results show how even small genetic differences between organisms can alter how future evolution occurs, potentially causing closely-related populations to quickly diverge.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial pathogens hijack macrophages to egress from the port of entry to the lymphatic/blood-stream, causing dissemination of life-threatening infections. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that Salmonella infection generates directional electric fields (EF) in the follicle-associated epithelium of mouse cecum. In vitro application of an EF, mimicking the infection-generated electric field (IGEF), induces directional migration of primary mouse macrophages to the anode, which is reversed to the cathode upon Salmonella infection. This infection-dependent directional switch is independent of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system. The switch is accompanied by a reduction of sialic acids on glycosylated surface components during phagocytosis of bacteria, which is absent in macrophages challenged by microspheres. Moreover, enzymatic cleavage of terminally exposed sialic acids reduces macrophage surface negativity and severely impairs directional migration of macrophages in response to EF. Based on these findings, we propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection.\\n\\nAbbreviationsCFU, colony-forming unit; Con A, Concanavalin A; EF, electric field; FAE, follicle-associated epithelium; GNL, Galanthus Nivalis lectin; IGEF, infection-generated electric field; Ji, electric current density; MAL-2, Maackia Amurensis lectin II; MLN, mesenteric lymph node; MOI, multiplicity of infection; nMFI, normalized mean fluorescence intensity; RCA-1, Ricinus Communis Agglutinin I; SNA, Sambucus Nigra lectin; S.

    "abstract": "Dominant mutations of Gata4, an essential cardiogenic transcription factor (TF), cause outflow tract (OFT) defects in both human and mouse. We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this requirement. Gata4 happloinsufficiency in mice caused OFT defects including double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and conal ventricular septum defects (VSDs). We found that Gata4 is required within Hedgehog (Hh)-receiving second heart field (SHF) progenitors for normal OFT alignment. Increased Pten-mediated cell-cycle transition, rescued atrial septal defects but not OFT defects in Gata4 heterozygotes. SHF Hh-receiving cells failed to migrate properly into the proximal OFT cushion in Gata4 heterozygote embryos. We find that Hh signaling and Gata4 genetically interact for OFT development. Gata4 and Smo double heterozygotes displayed more severe OFT abnormalities including persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) whereas restoration of Hedgehog signaling rescued OFT defects in Gata4-mutant mice. In addition, enhanced expression of the Gata6 was observed in the SHF of the Gata4 heterozygotes. These results suggested a SHF regulatory network comprising of Gata4, Gata6 and Hh-signaling for OFT development. This study indicates that Gata4 potentiation of Hh signaling is a general feature of Gata4-mediated cardiac morphogenesis and provides a model for the molecular basis of CHD caused by dominant transcription factor mutations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGata4 is an important protein that controls the development of the heart. Human who possess a single copy of Gata4 mutation display congenital heart defects (CHD), including the double outlet right ventricle (DORV). DORV is an alignment problem in which both the Aorta and Pulmonary Artery originate from the right ventricle, instead of originating from the left and the right ventricles, respectively. To study how Gata4 mutation causes DORV, we used a Gata4 mutant mouse model, which displays DORV. We showed that Gata4 is required in the cardiac precursor cells for the normal alignment of the great arteries. Although Gata4 mutation inhibits the rapid increase in number of the cardiac precursor cells, rescuing this defects does not recover the normal alignment of the great arteries. In addition, there is a movement problem of the cardiac precursor cells when migrating toward the great arteries during development. We further showed that a specific molecular signaling, Hh-signaling, is responsible to the Gata4 action in the cardiac precursor cells. Importantly, over-activating the Hh-signaling rescues the DORV in the Gata4 mutant embryos. This study provides an explanation for the ontogeny of CHD.",

    "abstract": "Retinoblastoma-binding protein 4 (Rbbp4) is a WDR adaptor protein for multiple chromatin remodelers implicated in human oncogenesis. Here we show Rbbp4 is overexpressed in zebrafish rb1-embryonal brain tumors and is upregulated across the spectrum of human embryonal and glial brain cancers. We demonstrate in vivo Rbbp4 is essential for zebrafish neurogenesis and has distinct roles in neural stem and progenitor cells. rbbp4 mutant neural stem cells show delayed cell cycle progression and become hypertrophic. In contrast, rbbp4 mutant neural precursors accumulate extensive DNA damage and undergo programmed cell death that is dependent on Tp53 signaling. Loss of Rbbp4 and disruption of genome integrity correlates with failure of neural precursors to initiate quiescence and transition to differentiation. rbbp4; rb1 double mutants show that survival of neural precursors after disruption of Rb1 is dependent on Rbbp4. Elevated Rbbp4 in Rb1-deficient brain tumors might drive proliferation and circumvent DNA damage and Tp53-dependent apoptosis, lending support to current interest in Rbbp4 as a potential druggable target.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryExamining the developmental mechanisms controlling neural stem and progenitor cell behavior is critical to our understanding of the processes driving brain tumor oncogenesis. Chromatin remodelers and their associated adaptor proteins are thought to be key drivers of brain development and disease through epigenetic regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome integrity, but knowledge of their in vivo roles in vertebrate neurogenesis is limited. The chromatin remodeler adaptor protein Rbbp4 has recently been shown to function in a mouse model of neuroblastoma and in glioblastoma multiforme cell resistance to the chemotherapeutic temozolomide. However, an in vivo requirement for Rbbp4 in neurogenesis has only just been shown by isolation of a recessive lethal mutation in zebrafish rbbp4. Here we provide conclusive genetic evidence that zebrafish rbbp4 is essential in neural stem and progenitor cell function during development. Our data reveal for the first time in vivo that Rbbp4 prevents DNA damage and activation of Tp53 signaling pathway that leads to programmed cell death. Importantly, neural progenitors that are mutant for the tumor suppressor Rb1 also depend on Rbbp4 for survival. Finally, we show that neural stem cells that have lost Rbbp4 cease dividing, and may enter a senescent like state. Together, these observations provide novel evidence that elevated expression of Rbbp4 in rb1-mutant tumors may contribute to cancer cell survival by blocking senescence and/or DNA damage-induced cell death.",

To study the role of the dACC and its communication with the dlPFC in cognitive control, we recorded the local field potentials from the dlPFC before and during the reversible deactivation of the dACC, in macaque monkeys engaging in uncued switches between two stimulus-response rules. Cryogenic dACC deactivation impaired response accuracy during rule-maintenance, but not rule-switching, which coincided with a reduction in the correct-error difference in dlPFC beta activities specifically during maintenance of the more challenging rule. During both rule switching and maintenance, dACC deactivation prolonged the animals reaction time and reduced task-related theta/alpha activities in the dlPFC; it also weakened dlPFC theta-gamma phase-amplitude modulation. Thus, the dACC and its interaction with the dlPFC plays a critical role in the maintenance of a new, challenging rule.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between embryo and endometrium at implantation are critical for the progression and the issue of pregnancy. These reciprocal actions involve exchange of paracrine signals that govern implantation and placentation. However, it remains unknown how these interactions between the conceptus and the endometrium are coordinated at the level of an individual pregnancy. Under the hypothesis that gene expression of endometrium is dependent on gene expression of extraembryonic tissues, we performed an integrative analysis of transcriptome profiles of paired conceptuses and endometria obtained from pregnancies initiated by artificial insemination. We quantified strong dependence (|r|>0.95, eFDR<0.01) in transcript abundance of genes expressed in the extraembryonic tissues and genes expressed in the endometrium. The profiles of connectivity revealed distinct co-expression patterns of extraembryonic tissues with caruncular and intercaruncular areas of the endometrium. Notably, a subset of highly co-expressed genes between conceptus (n=229) and caruncular areas of the endometrium (n=218, r>0.9999, eFDR<0.001) revealed a blueprint of gene expression specific to each pregnancy. Functional analyses of genes co-expressed between conceptus and endometrium revealed significantly enriched functional modules with critical contribution for implantation and placentation, including \\\"in utero embryonic development\\\", \\\"placenta development\\\" and \\\"regulation of transcription\\\". Functional modules were remarkably specific to caruncular or intercaruncular areas of the endometrium. The quantitative and functional association between genes expressed in conceptus and endometrium emphasize a coordinated communication between these two entities in mammals. To our knowledge, we provide first evidence that implantation in mammalian pregnancy relies on the ability of the conceptus and the endometrium to develop a fine-tuned adaptive response characteristic of each pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "During female mammal reproductive tract development, epithelial cells of the lower Mullerian duct are committed to become stratified squamous epithelium of vagina and ectocervix, when the expression of {Delta}Np63 transcription factor is induced by mesenchymal cells. The absence of {Delta}Np63 expression leads to adenosis, the putative precursor of vaginal adenocarcinoma. Our previous studies with genetically engineered mouse models have established that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD, and activin A/runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) signaling pathways are independently required for {Delta}Np63 expression in Mullerian duct epithelium (MDE). Here we report that sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) plays a critical role in the activation of {Delta}Np63 locus in MDE as a downstream transcription factor of mesenchymal signals. In mouse developing reproductive tract, SIX1 expression was restricted to MDE of the future cervix and vagina. SIX1 expression was totally absent in SMAD4 null MDE and was reduced in RUNX1 null and FGFR2 null MDE, indicating that SIX1 is under the control of vaginal mesenchymal factors, BMP4, activin A and FGF7/10. Furthermore, Six1, Runx1 and Smad4 gene-dose-dependently activated {Delta}Np63 expression in MDE within vaginal fornix. Using a mouse model of diethylstilbestrol (DES)-associated vaginal adenosis, we found DES action through epithelial estrogen receptor  (ESR1) down-regulates SIX1 and RUNX1 in MDE within the vaginal fornix. This study establishes that the vaginal/ectocervical cell fate of MDE is regulated by a collaboration of multiple transcription factors including SMAD4, SIX1 and RUNX1, and the down-regulation of these key transcription factors leads to vaginal adenosis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn embryogenesis, differentiation fate of cells is specified through constant communication between neighboring cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of epithelial cell fate commitment in the lower female reproductive organs utilizing mouse genetic models. The cell fate of epithelial cells in the uterus, cervix and vagina is directed by signaling from mesenchymal cells. We demonstrated that within the epithelial cells of the developing vagina, signals from mesenchymal cells are integrated into activities of transcription factors including SMAD4, RUNX1 and SIX1, which dose-dependently co-operate in the determination of vaginal epithelial cell fate. Disruption of these processes alters the cell fate from vaginal to uterine epithelium, resulting in a condition called vaginal adenosis, a putative precursor of vaginal adenocarcinoma. Women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the womb have about 40 times the risk of developing vaginal adenocarcinoma. We determined that developmental exposure to DES induces vaginal adenosis by repressing SIX1 and RUNX1 through ESR1 in the epithelial cells. This discovery enhances the understanding of how early-life events, such as exposure to endocrine disruptors, causes vaginal adenosis, and thus may contribute to the prevention and therapeutic treatment of idiopathic vaginal adenocarcinoma.",

Nonetheless, mitochondria possess multiple resident phosphatases, suggesting that protein dephosphorylation may be broadly important for mitochondrial activities. To explore this, we deleted the poorly characterized matrix phosphatase Pptc7 from mice using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Strikingly, Pptc7-/- mice exhibited marked hypoketotic hypoglycemia, elevated acylcarnitines, and lactic acidosis, and died soon after birth. Pptc7-/- tissues had significantly diminished mitochondrial size and protein content despite normal transcript levels, but consistently elevated phosphorylation on select mitochondrial proteins. These putative Pptc7 substrates include the protein translocase complex subunit Timm50, whose phosphorylation reduced import activity. We further find that phosphorylation in or near the mitochondrial targeting sequences of multiple proteins can disrupt their import rates and matrix processing.

    "abstract": "Dorsal hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) interact to mediate diverse cognitive functions, but the cellular basis for these interactions is unclear. We hypothesized a long-range circuit converging in layer 1 (L1) of RSC, based on the pathway anatomy of GABAergic CA1 retrosplenial-projecting (CA1-RP) neurons and thalamo-restrosplenial projections from ATN. We find that CA1[-&gt;]RSC projections stem from GABAergic neurons with a distinct morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular profile, likely corresponding to recently described Ntng1-expressing hippocampal interneurons. CA1-RP neurons monosynaptically inhibit L5 pyramidal neurons, principal outputs of RSC, via potent GABAergic synapses onto apical tuft dendrites in L1. These inhibitory inputs align precisely with L1-targeting thalamocortical excitatory inputs from ATN, particularly the anteroventral nucleus, forming a convergent circuit whereby CA1 inhibition can intercept ATN excitation to co-regulate RSC activity. Excitatory axons from subiculum, in contrast, innervate proximal dendrites in deeper layers. Short-term synaptic plasticity differs at each connection. Chemogenetically abrogating inhibitory CA1[-&gt;]RSC or excitatory ATN[-&gt;]RSC connections oppositely affects the encoding of contextual fear memory. Collectively, our findings identify multiple cellular mechanisms underlying hippocampo-thalamo-retrosplenial interactions, establishing CA1 RSC-projecting neurons as a distinct class with long-range axons that target apical tuft dendrites, and delineating an unusual cortical circuit in the RSC specialized for integrating long-range inhibition and thalamocortical excitation.",

    "abstract": "Preferred particle orientation represents a recurring problem in single-particle cryogenic electron microcopy (cryo-EM). A specimen-independent approach through tilting has been attempted to increase particle orientation coverage, thus minimizing anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. However, focus gradient is a critical issue hindering tilt applications from being a general practice in single-particle cryo-EM. The present study describes a newly developed geometrically optimized approach, goCTF, to reliably determine the global focus gradient. A novel strategy of determining contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters from a sector of the signal preserved power spectrum is applied to increase reliability. Subsequently, per-particle based local focus refinement is conducted in an iterative manner to further improve the defocus accuracy. Novel diagnosis methods using a standard deviation defocus plot and goodness fitting heatmap have also been proposed to evaluate CTF fitting quality prior to 3D refinement. In a benchmark study, goCTF processed a published single-particle cryo-EM dataset for influenza hemagglutinin trimer collected at a 40-degree specimen tilt. The resulting 3D reconstruction map was improved from 4.1[A] to 3.7[A] resolution. The goCTF program is built on the open-source code of CTFFIND4, which adopts a consistent user interface ease of use.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), is a flexible and widely used tool routinely exploited for in vivo and in vitro applications. While FCS provides estimates of dynamical quantities, such as diffusion coefficients, it demands high signal to noise ratios and long time traces, typically in the minute range. In principle, the same information can be extracted from {micro}-s long time traces; however, an appropriate analysis method is missing. To overcome these limitations, we adapt novel tools inspired by Bayesian non-parametrics, which starts from the direct analysis of the observed photon counts. With this approach, we are able to analyze time traces, which are too short to be analyzed by existing methods, including FCS. Our new analysis extends the capability of single molecule fluorescence confocal microscopy based approaches, to probe processes several orders of magnitude faster in time and permits a reduction of phototoxic effects on living samples induced by long periods of light exposure.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular communication within the bone marrow niche significantly influences leukemogenesis and the sensitivity of leukemic cells to therapy. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk. They are long, thin membranous protrusions that enable the direct transfer of various cargo between cells. Here we show that TNTs are formed between leukemic and bone marrow stromal cells. Fluorescence confocal microscopy with 3D reconstructions, correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography provided evidence that TNTs transfer cellular vesicles between cells. The quantitative analysis demonstrated that the stromal cells stimulate TNT-mediated vesicle transfer towards leukemic cells. Transfer of vesicular cargo from stromal cells correlated with increased resistance to anti-leukemic treatment. Moreover, specific sets of proteins with a potential role in survival and the drug response were transferred within these vesicles. Altogether, we found that TNTs are involved in the leukemia-stroma cross-talk and the stroma-mediated cytoprotection of leukemic cells. Our findings implicate TNT connections as a possible target for therapeutic interventions within the leukemia microenvironment to attenuate stroma-conferred protection.",

    "abstract": "SynopsisDrug resistant tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health challenge with limited treatment options and high associated mortality. Rifamycins are among the most potent anti-TB drugs, and the loss of susceptibility to these agents, a hallmark of MDR TB, is considered a substantial therapeutic challenge. Rifamycins are known to target the RpoB subunit of RNA polymerase; however, our understanding of how rifamycin resistance is genetically encoded remains incomplete. Here we investigated rpoB genetic diversity and cross resistance between the two rifamycin drugs rifampicin (RIF) and rifabutin (RFB). We performed whole genome sequencing of 1005 MTB clinical isolates and measured minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to both agents on 7H10 agar using the indirect proportion method. Of the 1005 isolates, 767 were RIF resistant, and of these, 211 (27%) were sensitive to RFB at the critical concentration of 0.5ug/ml; 101/211 isolates had the rpoB mutation D435V (E.coli D516V). Isolates with discrepant resistance (RIF R and RFB S) 16.9 times more likely to harbor a D435V mutation as those resistant to both agents (OR 95% CI 10.5-27.9, P-value <10-40). To further understand this discrepancy, we generated both D435V and S450L (E.coli S531L) rpoB mutants in a laboratory strain and measured their antibiotic susceptibility using the alamar blue reduction assay. Compared with wildtype, D435V increased the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) to both RIF and RFB, however in both cases to a lesser degree than the S450L mutation. The observation that the rpoB D435V mutation produces an increase in the IC50 for both drugs contrasts with findings from previous smaller studies that suggested that isolates with D435V mutation remain RFB susceptible despite being RIF resistant. Our finding thus suggests that the recommended critical testing concentration for RFB should be revised.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing crisis within the 1st world and the causes of obesity are well studied: a lack of physical activity combined with an increased calorie intake. This energy imbalance leads to fat accumulation leading to eventual obesity. Whilst the cause may appear clear, the options of lifestyle change and/or diet planning that is efficient with effective sustainability has been harder to come by. Genetic variants linked to obesity may hold clues on how to best customise a diet plan to an individual leading to an easier to change lifestyle with better sustainability. This study aimed to find correlations with a diet change that decreased kcal intake by 200kcal per day with a macronutrient alteration (decreased carbohydrates and increased unsaturated fat) and genetic components to discover responders and non-responders. Within the study group of Caucasian males the genes TCF7L2, TFAP2B, PPARG2 and FTO all impacted the response of the dietary intervention. In conclusion it would be prudent to consider DNA analysis as part of a battery of diet and lifestyle tests to personalise a sustainable and effective lifestyle/dietary intervention to help control weight.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between protein sequence and structure well enough to rationally design novel proteins or protein complexes is a longstanding goal in protein science. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a key resource for defining sequence-structure relationships that has supported the development of critical resources such as rotamer libraries and backbone torsional statistics that quantify the probabilities of protein sequences adopting different structures. Here, we show that well-defined, non-contiguous structural motifs (TERMs) in the PDB can also provide rich information useful for protein-peptide interaction prediction and design. Specifically, we show that it is possible to rapidly predict the binding energies of peptides to Bcl-2 family proteins as accurately as can be done with widely used structure-based tools, without explicit atomistic modeling. One benefit of a TERM-based approach is that prediction performance is less sensitive to the details of the input structure than are methods that evaluate energies using precise atomic coordinates. We show that protein design using TERM energies (dTERMen) can generate highly novel and diverse peptides to target anti-apoptotic proteins Bfl-1 and Mcl-1. 15 of 17 peptides designed using dTERMen bound tightly to their intended targets, and these peptides have just 15 - 38% sequence identity to any known native Bcl-2 family protein ligand. High-resolution structures of four designed peptides bound to their targets provided opportunities to analyze strengths and limitations of this approach. Dramatic success designing peptides using dTERMen, which comprised going from input structure to experimental validation of high-affinity binders in approximately one month, provides strong motivation for further developing TERM-based approaches to design.",

We use CRISPR/Cas9 to insert a tandem array of seven copies of the GFP11 {beta}-strand (gfp11x7) at the genomic locus of each target protein. The resultant gfp11x7 knock-in strain is then crossed with separate reporter lines that express the complementing split-GFP fragment (gfp1-10) in specific cell types thus affording tissue-specific labeling of the target protein at its native level. We show that NATF reveals the otherwise undetectable intracellular location of the immunoglobulin protein, OIG-1, and demarcates a receptor auxiliary protein LEV-10 at cell-specific synaptic domains in the C. elegans nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The urea cycle protects the central nervous system from ammonia toxicity by converting ammonia to non-toxic urea. N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG), an allosteric activator of carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the rate limiting enzyme of the urea cycle. Enzymatic activity of mammalian NAGS doubles in the presence of L-arginine but the physiological significance of NAGS activation by L-arginine is unknown. Previously, we have described the creation of a NAGS knockout (Nags-/-) mouse, which develops hyperammonemia without N-carbamylglutamate and L-citrulline supplementation (NCG+Cit). In order to investigate the effect of L-arginine on ureagenesis in vivo, we used adeno associated virus (AAV) mediated gene transfer to deliver either wild-type or E354A mutant mouse NAGS (mNAGS), which is not activated by L-arginine, to Nags-/- mice. The ability of the E354A mNAGS mutant protein to rescue Nags-/- mice was determined by measuring their activity on the voluntary wheel following NCG+Cit withdrawal. The Nags-/- mice that received E354A mNAGS remained apparently healthy and active but had elevated plasma ammonia concentration despite similar expression levels of the E354A mNAGS and control wild-type NAGS proteins. The corresponding mutation in human NAGS (NP 694551.1:p.E360D) that abolishes binding and activation by L-arginine was also identified in a patient with hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency. Taken together, our results suggest that L-arginine binding to the NAGS enzyme is essential for normal ureagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown participants associate high pitch tones with small objects, and low pitch tones with large objects. Yet it remains unclear when these associations emerge in neural signals, and whether or not they are likely the result of predictive coding mechanisms being influenced by multisensory priors. Here we investigated these questions using a modified version of the implicit association task, 128-channel human EEG, and two approaches to single-trial analysis (linear discriminant and mutual information). During two interlaced discrimination tasks (auditory high/low tone and visual small/large circle), one stimulus was presented per trial and the auditory stimulus-response assignment was manipulated. On congruent trials preferred pairings (high tone, small circle) were assigned to the same response key, and on incongruent trials non-preferred pairings were (low tone, small circle). The results showed participants (male and female) responded faster during auditory congruent than incongruent trials. The EEG results showed that acoustic pitch and visual size were represented early in the trial (~100 ms and ~220 ms), over temporal and frontal regions. Neural signals were also modulated by congruency early in the trial for auditory (<100ms) and visual modalities (~200ms). For auditory trials, EEG components were predictive of reaction times, but for visual trials they were not. These EEG results were consistent across analysis methods, demonstrating they are robust to the statistical methodology used. Overall, our data support an early origin of cross-modal associations, and suggest that these may originate during early sensory processing potentially due to predictive coding mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cellulose is an important biocompatible and nontoxic polymer widely used in numerous biomedical applications. The impact of cellulose-based materials on cells and, more specifically, on plasma membranes that surround cells, however, remains poorly understood. To this end, here we performed atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) bilayers interacting with the surface of a cellulose crystal. Both biased umbrella sampling and unbiased simulations clearly show the existence of strong attractive interactions between phospholipids and cellulose: the free energy of the cellulose-bilayer binding was found to be -1.89 and -1.96 kJ/mol per cellulose dimer for PC and PE bilayers, respectively. Although the values are similar, there is a pronounced difference between PC and PE bilayers. The driving force in both cases is the formation of hydrogen bonds. There are two distinct types of hydrogen bonds: 1) between the lipid head groups and the hydroxyl (hydroxymethyl) groups of cellulose, and 2) lipid-water and cellulose-water bonds. The former is the dominant component for PE systems whereas the latter dominates in PC systems. This suggests that achieving controlled binding via new cellulose modifications must pay close attention to the lipid head groups involved. The observed attractive phospholipid-cellulose interactions have a significant impact on bilayer properties: a cellulose crystal induces noticeable structural perturbations on the bilayer leaflet next to the crystal. Given that such perturbations can be undesirable when it comes to the interactions of cellulose-based materials with cell membranes, our computational studies suggest that the impact of cellulose could be reduced through chemical modification of the cellulose surface which prevents cellulose-phospholipid hydrogen bonding.",

    "abstract": "Tissue growth is a fundamental aspect of development and is intrinsically noisy. Stochasticity has important implications for morphogenesis, precise control of organ size, and regulation of tissue composition and heterogeneity. Yet, the basic statistical properties of growing tissues, particularly when growth induces mechanical stresses that can in turn affect growth rates, have received little attention. Here, we study the noisy growth of elastic sheets subject to mechanical feedback. Considering both isotropic and anisotropic growth, we find that the density-density correlation function shows power law scaling. We also consider the dynamics of marked, neutral clones of cells. We find that the areas (but not the shapes) of two clones are always statistically independent, even when they are adjacent. For anisotropic growth, we show that clone size variance scales like the average area squared and that the mode amplitudes characterizing clone shape show a slow 1/n decay, where n is the mode index. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic case, where relative variations in clone size and shape vanish at long times. The high variability in clone statistics observed in anisotropic growth is due to the presence of two soft modes--growth modes that generate no stress. Our results lay the groundwork for more in-depth explorations of the properties of noisy tissue growth in specific biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Effects of parental environment on offspring traits have been well known for decades. Interest in this transgenerational form of phenotypic plasticity has recently surged due to advances in our understanding of its mechanistic basis. Theoretical research has simultaneously advanced by predicting the environmental conditions that should favor the adaptive evolution of transgenerational plasticity. Yet whether such conditions actually exist in nature remains largely unexplored. Here, using long-term climate data, we modeled optimal levels of transgenerational plasticity for an organism with a one-year life cycle at a spatial resolution of 4km2 across the continental US. Both annual temperature and precipitation levels were often autocorrelated, but the strength and direction of these autocorrelations varied considerably across the continental US and even among nearby sites. When present, such environmental autocorrelations render offspring environments statistically predictable based on the parental environment, a key condition for the adaptive evolution of transgenerational plasticity. Results of our optimality models were consistent with this prediction: high levels of transgenerational plasticity were favored at sites with strong environmental autocorrelations, and little-to-no transgenerational plasticity was favored at sites with weak or non-existent autocorrelations. These results are among the first to show that natural patterns of environmental variation favor the evolution of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Furthermore, these findings suggest that transgenerational plasticity is highly variable in nature, depending on site-specific patterns of environmental variation.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex has structural, signaling and catalytic functions in the cellular response to DNA damage. Xrs2, the eukaryotic-specific component of the complex, is required for nuclear import of Mre11 and Rad50, and to recruit the Tel1 kinase to damage sites. We show that nuclear-localized MR complex (Mre11-NLS) catalyzes homology-dependent repair without Xrs2, but MR cannot activate Tel1 and it fails to tether DSBs resulting in sensitivity to genotoxins, replisome instability and increased gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs). Fusing the Tel1 interaction domain from Xrs2 to Mre11-NLS is sufficient to restore telomere elongation and Tel1 signaling to Xrs2-deficient cells. Furthermore, Tel1 stabilizes Mre11-DNA association, and this stabilization function becomes important for DNA damage resistance in the absence of Xrs2. Enforcing Tel1 recruitment to the nuclear MR complex fully rescues end tethering, stalled replication fork stability and suppresses GCRs, highlighting important roles for Xrs2 and Tel1 to ensure optimal MR activity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIXrs2 is required for recruitment but not for activation of Tel1 kinase\\nC_LIO_LITel1 and Xrs2 function independently to optimize MR activity at DSBs and stalled replication forks\\nC_LIO_LIStable association of Mre11 at DSBs is required to maintain end-to-end tethering\\nC_LIO_LIMR-mediated DNA tethering promotes replisome stability and genome integrity\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Backgroundadministration of anandamide (AEA) or 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) induces CB1 coupling and activation of TRKB receptors, regulating the neuronal migration and maturation in the developing cortex. However, at higher concentrations AEA also engages vanilloid receptor - TRPV1, usually with opposed consequences on behavior.\n\nMethods and ResultsUsing primary cell cultures from the cortex of rat embryos (E18) we determined the effects of AEA on phosphorylated TRKB (pTRK). We observed that AEA (at 100 and 200nM) induced a significant increase in pTRK levels. Such effect of AEA at 100nM was blocked by pretreatment with the CB1 antagonist AM251 (200nM) and, at the higher concentration of 200nM by the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (200nM), but mildly attenuated by AM251. Interestingly, the effect of AEA or capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist, also at 200nM) on pTRK was blocked by TRKB.Fc (a soluble form of TRKB able to bind BDNF) or capsazepine, suggesting a mechanism dependent on BDNF release. Using the marble-burying test (MBT) in mice, we observed that the local administration of ACEA (a CB1 agonist) into the prelimbic region of prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) was sufficient to reduce the burying behavior, while capsaicin or BDNF exerted the opposite effect, increasing the number of buried marbles. In addition, both ACEA and capsaicin effects were blocked by previous administration of k252a (an antagonist of TRK receptors) into PL-PFC. The effect of systemically injected CB1 agonist WIN55,212-2 was blocked by previous administration of k252a. We also observed a partial colocalization of CB1 /TRPV1 /TRKB in the PL-PFC, and the localization of TRPV1 in CaMK2+ cells.\n\nConclusiontaken together, our data indicate that anandamide engages a coordinated activation of TRKB, via CB1 and TRPV1. Thus, acting upon CB1 and TRPV1, AEA could regulate the TRKB-dependent plasticity in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments.",

    "abstract": "Whether sexual selection impedes or aids adaptation has become a pressing question in times of rapid environmental change and parallels the debate about how the evolution of individual traits impacts on population dynamics and viability. The net effect of sexual selection on population viability results from a balance between genetic benefits of \\\"good genes\\\" effects and costs of sexual conflict. Depending on how these facets of sexual selection are affected under environmental change, extinction of maladapted populations could either be avoided or accelerated. Here, we evolved seed beetles under three alternative mating regimes (polygamy, monogamy and male-limited selection) to disentangle the contributions of sexual selection, fecundity selection and male-female coevolution to individual reproductive success and population fitness. We compared these contributions between the ancestral environment and two new stressful environments (temperature and host plant shift). Evolution under polygamy resulted in the highest individual reproductive success in competitive context for both sexes. Moreover, females evolving only via sexual selection on their male siblings in the male-limited regime had similar reproductive success and higher fertility than females evolving under monogamy, suggesting that sexual selection on males had positive effects on female fitness components. Interestingly, male-limited sexual selection resulted in males that were robust to stress, compared to males from the two evolution regimes applying fecundity selection. We quantified the population-level consequences of this sex-specific adaptation and found evidence that costs of socio-sexual interactions were higher in male-limited lines compared to polygamous lines, and that this difference was particularly pronounced at elevated temperature to which males from the male-limited regime were more robust compared to their conspecific females. These results illustrate the tension between individual-level adaptation and population-level viability in sexually reproducing species and suggest that sex-specific selection can cause differences in environmental robustness that may impact population demography under environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Benzimidazoles have been intensively used in the livestock sector, particularly in small ruminants for over 40 years. This has been led to the widespread emergence of resistance in a number of small ruminant parasite species, in particular Haemonchus contortus. In many counties benzimidazole resistance in the small ruminants H. contortus has become severely compromising its control; but there is a little information on benzimidazole resistance in H. contortus infecting buffalo and cattle. Resistance to benzimidazoles have also been reported in the large ruminant parasite, Haemonchus placei, but again there is relatively little information on its prevalence. Hence it is extremely important to understand how resistance-conferring mutations emerge and spread in both parasites in the buffalo and cattle host in order to develop the approaches for the recognition of the problem at an early stage of its development. The present study suggests that the F200Y (TAC) mutation is common in H. contortus, being detected in 5/7 populations at frequencies between 7 to 57%. Furthermore, 6/10 H. placei populations contained the F200Y (TAC) mutation, albeit at low frequencies of between 0.4 to 5%. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the F200Y (TAC) mutation in H. contortus has emerged on multiple occasions in the region, with at least three independent emergence of resistance alleles across the populations. In contrast, the F200Y (TAC) resistance-conferring mutation in H. placei is only seen on a single haplotype. A high level of haplotype frequency of the susceptible alleles in the region, suggests that the unique resistance conferring-mutation has spread from a single emergence; likely by anthropogenic animal movement. Overall, these results provide the first clear genetic evidence for the spread of benzimidazoles resistance-conferring mutations to multiple different locations from a single emergence in H. placei; while supporting previous small ruminant-based observations of multiple emergence of resistance mutations in H. contortus.",

However, translating the results of GWAS for drug discovery remains challenging. We analyzed 1,589 GWAS across 1,456 protein interaction pathways to translate these often, imprecise genetic loci into therapeutic hypotheses for 182 diseases. We validate these pathway-based genetic targets by testing if current drug targets are enriched in the pathway space of the same indication. Remarkably, 30% of diseases have significantly more targets in these pathways than expected by chance; the comparable number for GWAS alone (without using pathway analysis) is zero. Although pathway analysis is routine for GWAS, this study shows that the routine analysis can often enrich for drug targets, by performing a systematic global analysis to translate genetic findings into therapeutic hypotheses for new drug discovery and repositioning opportunities for current drugs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe risk of recurrence for endocrine-treated breast cancer patients persists for many years or even decades following surgery and apparently successful adjuvant therapy. This period of dormancy and acquired resistance is inherently difficult to investigate, previous efforts have been limited to in vitro or in vivo approaches. In this study, sequential tumour samples from patients receiving extended neoadjuvant endocrine treatment were characterised as a novel clinical model.\\n\\nMethodsConsecutive tumour samples from 62 patients undergoing extended (4-45 months) neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, therapy were subjected to transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, representing before ([&le;]0), early-on (13-120 days) and long-term (>120 days) neoadjuvant letrozole treatment. Patients with at least a 40% initial reduction in tumour size by 4 months of treatment were included. Of these, 42 patients with no subsequent progression were classified as \\\"dormant\\\", and the remaining 20 patients as \\\"acquired resistant\\\".\\n\\nResultsChanges in gene expression in dormant tumours begin early and become more pronounced at later timepoints. Therapy-induced changes in resistant tumours were common features of treatment, rather than being specific to resistant phenotype. Comparative analysis of long-term treated dormant and resistant tumours highlighted changes in epigenetics pathways including DNA methylation and histone acetylation. DNA methylation marks 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine were significantly reduced in resistant tumours compared to dormant tissues after extended letrozole treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first patient-matched gene expression study investigating long-term aromatase inhibitor-induced dormancy and acquired resistance in breast cancer. Dormant tumours continue to change during treatment whereas acquired resistant tumours more closely resemble their diagnostic samples. Global loss of DNA methylation was observed in resistant tumours under extended treatment. Epigenetic alterations may lead to escape from dormancy and drive acquired resistance in a subset of patients supporting a potential role for therapy targeted at these epigenetic alterations in the management of endocrine resistant breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant chromosomal translocations leading to tumorigenesis have been ascribed to the heterogeneously oncogenic functions. However, how fusion transcripts exporting remains to be declared. Here, we showed that the nuclear speckle-specific long non coding RNA MALAT1 controls chimeric mRNA export processes and regulates myeloid progenitor cell differentiation in malignant hematopoiesis. We demonstrated that MALAT1 regulates chimeric mRNAs export in an m6A-dependent manner and thus controls hematopoietic cell differentiation. Specifically, reducing MALAT1 or m6A methyltransferases and the  reader YTHDC1 result in the universal retention of distinct oncogenic gene mRNAs in nucleus. Mechanically, MALAT1 hijacks both the chimeric mRNAs and fusion proteins in nuclear speckles during chromosomal translocations and mediates the colocalization of oncogenic fusion proteins with METTL14. MALAT1 and fusion protein complexes serve as a functional loading bridge for the interaction of chimeric mRNA and METTL14. This study demonstrated a universal mechanism of chimeric mRNA transport that involves lncRNA-fusion protein-m6A autoregulatory loop for controlling myeloid cell differentiation. Targeting the lncRNA-triggered autoregulatory loop to disrupt chimeric mRNA transport might represent a new common paradigm for treating blood malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations arise during the life history of a cell. Mutations occurring in cancer driver genes may ultimately lead to the development of clinically detectable disease. Nascent cancer lineages continue to acquire somatic mutations throughout the neoplastic process and during cancer evolution (Martincorena and Campbell, 2015). Extrinsic and endogenous mutagenic factors contribute to the accumulation of these somatic mutations (Zhang and Pellman, 2015). Understanding the underlying factors generating somatic mutations is crucial for developing potential preventive, therapeutic and clinical decisions. Earlier studies have revealed that DNA replication timing (Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009) and chromatin modifications (Schuster-Bockler and Lehner, 2012) are associated with variations in mutational density. What is unclear from these early studies, however, is whether all extrinsic and exogenous factors that drive somatic mutational processes share a similar relationship with chromatin state and structure. In order to understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific individual mutational processes, we report here a study of 3000 tumor-normal pair whole genome datasets from more than 40 different human cancer types. Our analyses revealed that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions between chromatin folding domains. APOBEC- or MSI-related mutations are enriched in transcriptionally-active domains while mutations occurring due to tobacco-smoke, ultraviolet (UV) light exposure or a signature of unknown aetiology (signature 17) enrich predominantly in transcriptionally-inactive domains. Active mutational processes dictate the mutation distributions in cancer genomes, and we show that mutational distributions shift during cancer evolution upon mutational processes switch. Moreover, a dramatic instance of extreme chromatin structure in humans, that of the unique folding pattern of the inactive X-chromosome leads to distinct somatic mutation distribution on X chromosome in females compared to males in various cancer types. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation rate variations observed in human cancer.",

However, how these AD-associated SNPs (AD SNPs) contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease is poorly understood because most of them are located in non-coding regions, such as introns and intergenic regions. Previous studies reported that some disease-associated SNPs affect regulatory elements including enhancers. We hypothesized that non-coding AD SNPs are located in enhancers and affect gene expression levels via chromatin loops.\\n\\nResultsWe examined enhancer locations that were predicted in 127 human tissues or cell types, including ten brain tissues, and identified chromatin-chromatin interactions by Hi-C experiments. We report the following findings: (1) nearly 30% of non-coding AD SNPs are located in enhancers; (2) expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) genes affected by non-coding AD SNPs within enhancers are associated with amyloid beta clearance, synaptic transmission, and immune responses; (3) 95% of the AD SNPs located in enhancers co-localize with their eQTL genes in topologically associating domains suggesting that regulation may occur through chromatin higher-order structures; (4) rs1476679 spatially contacts the promoters of eQTL genes via CTCF-CTCF interactions; (5) the effect of other AD SNPs such as rs7364180 is likely to be, at least in part, indirect through regulation of transcription factors that in turn regulate AD associated genes.\\n\\nConclusionOur results suggest that non-coding AD SNPs may affect the function of enhancers thereby influencing the expression levels of surrounding or distant genes via chromatin loops.

    "abstract": "Neural circuits underpin the production of animal behavior, largely based upon the precise pattern of synaptic connectivity among the neurons involved. For large numbers of neurons, determining such \\\"connectomes\\\" by direct physiological means is difficult, as physiological accessibility is ultimately required to verify and characterize the function of synapses. We collected a volume of images spanning an entire ganglion of the juvenile leech nervous system via serial blockface electron microscopy (SBEM). We validated this approach by reconstructing a well-characterized circuit of motor neurons involved in the swimming behavior of the leech by locating the synapses among them. We confirm that there are multiple synaptic contacts between connected pairs of neurons in the leech, and that these synapses are widely distributed across the region of neuropil in which the neurons arbors overlap. We verified the anatomical existence of connections that had been described physiologically among longitudinal muscle motor neurons. We also found that some physiological connections were not present anatomically. We then drew upon the SBEM dataset to design additional physiological experiments. We reconstructed an uncharacterized neuron and one of its presynaptic partners identified from the SBEM dataset. We subsequently interrogated this cell pair via intracellular electrophysiology in an adult ganglion and found that the anatomically-discovered synapse was also functional physiologically. Our findings demonstrate the value of combining a connectomics approach with electrophysiology in the leech nervous system.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe function of any nervous system depends on the arrangement of its component neurons into circuits. Determining this precise pattern requires an account of which neurons are linked by synapses, and where. Here we use serial electron microscopy to confirm, challenge, and discover synapses in the neuropil of one ganglion from a juvenile leech. Relying on the homology of the ganglion from animal to animal, we demonstrate that we can identify synapses we knew existed from previous physiological work, and that we can confirm a new anatomically-discovered synapse by subsequently recording from the same neurons in a different animal. Here we show how analyses of anatomical detail and physiologically determined interactions complementarily yield insight into how neural circuits produce behavior.",

Growing legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes, combined with decreasing perceptions of harm, makes it increasingly important to determine the consequences of frequent adolescent exposure for motivated behavior and lasting tolerance in response to THC. Male and female rats inhaled THC vapor, or that from the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, twice daily for 30 minutes from postnatal day (PND) 35-39 and PND 42-45 using an e-cigarette system. Thermoregulatory responses to vapor inhalation were assessed by radio-telemetry during adolescence and from PND 86-94; chow intake was assessed in adulthood. Blood samples were obtained from additional adolescent groups following initial THC inhalation and after four days of twice daily exposure. Additional groups exposed repeatedly to THC or PG during adolescence were evaluated for intravenous self-administration of oxycodone as adults. Female, not male, adolescents developed tolerance to the hypothermic effects of THC inhalation in the first week of repeated exposure despite similar plasma THC levels. Each sex exhibited tolerance to THC hypothermia in adulthood after repeated adolescent THC with THC greater potency exhibited in females. Repeated-THC male rats consumed more food than their PG treated control group, in the absence of a significant bodyweight difference. Adolescent THC did not alter oxycodone self-administration in either sex, but increased fentanyl self-administration in females. Repeated THC vapor inhalation in adolescent rats results in lasting consequences observable in adulthood.\\n\\nAbbreviationsPG, propylene glycol; THC, {Delta}9tetrahydrocannabinol;",

    "abstract": "Simian Virus 40 (SV40) exists as chromatin throughout its life cycle, and undergoes typical epigenetic regulation mediated by changes in nucleosome location and associated histone modifications. In order to investigate the role of epigenetic regulation during the encapsidation of late stage minichromosomes into virions, we have mapped the location of nucleosomes containing acetylated or methylated lysines in the histone tails of H3 and H4 present in the chromatin from 48-hour post-infection minichromosomes and disrupted virions. In minichromosomes obtained late in infection, nucleosomes were found carrying various histone modifications primarily in the regulatory region with a major nucleosome located within the enhancer and other nucleosomes at the early and late transcriptional start sites. The nucleosome found in the enhancer would be expected to repress early transcription by blocking access to part of the SP1 binding sites and the left side of the enhancer in late stage minichromosomes while also allowing late transcription. In chromatin from virions, the principal nucleosome located in the enhancer was shifted ~ 70 bases in the late direction from what was found in minichromosomes and the level of modified histones was increased throughout the genome. The shifting of the enhancer-associated nucleosome to the late side would effectively serve as a switch to relieve the repression of early transcription found in late minichromosomes while likely also repressing late transcription by blocking access to necessary regulatory sequences. This epigenetic switch appeared to occur during the final stage of virion formation.",

    "abstract": "The architectonic type principle attributes patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity to the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions. One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our in silico model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated histogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of experimentally observed connection patterns. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Our study pinpointed potential mechanisms of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. The successful prediction of connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe mechanisms that govern the establishment of cortico-cortical connections during the development of the mammalian brain are not completely understood. In computational simulation experiments reported here, we explored the foundations of an architectonic type principle, which attributes adult cortical connectivity to the relative architectonic differentiation of connected areas. Architectonic differentiation refers, among other characteristics, to the cellular make-up of cortical areas. This architectonic type principle has been found to account for diverse properties of cortical connectivity across mammalian species. Our in silico model generated connectivity patterns consistent with the architectonic type principle and typically observed in mammalian cortices, if model settings were chosen such that they corresponded to empirical observations about how cortical development proceeds. Our computational experiments systematically evaluated previously proposed mechanisms of cortical development and showed that connectivity consistent with the architectonic type principle arises only from realistic assumptions about the growth of the cortical sheet.",

    "abstract": "In the Drosophila antenna, different subtypes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in the same sensory hair (sensillum) can inhibit each other non-synaptically. However, the mechanisms underlying this unusual form of lateral inhibition remain unclear. Here we use recordings from pairs of sensilla impaled by the same tungsten electrode to prove that direct electrical (\\\"ephaptic\\\") interactions mediate lateral inhibition between ORNs. Intriguingly, within individual sensilla, we find that ephaptic lateral inhibition is asymmetric such that one ORN exerts greater influence onto its neighbor. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy of genetically identified ORNs and circuit modeling indicate that asymmetric lateral inhibition reflects a surprisingly simple mechanism: the physically larger ORN in a pair corresponds to the dominant neuron in ephaptic interactions. Thus, morphometric differences between compartmentalized ORNs account for highly specialized inhibitory interactions that govern information processing at the earliest stages of olfactory coding.",

Here we introduce two novel visualization methods to display the dynamics of the ionic currents, and to investigate how the contribution of each current changes in response to perturbation. We explored the solutions of a single compartment, conductance-based model of neural activity with seven voltage-gated ionic currents and a leak channel. We employed landscape optimization to find sets of maximal conductances that produce similar target activity and displayed the dynamics of the currents. We examined in detail six examples of a bursting model neuron that differ as much as 3-fold in the conductance densities of each of the 8 currents in the model. The maximal conductance of each current does not simply predict the importance of the current for neuronal dynamics. We then compared the effects of systematically reducing the conductances of each current for neuronal dynamics, and demonstrate that models that appear similar under starting conditions behave dramatically differently to the decreases in conductance densities. These examples provide heuristic insight into why individuals with similar behavior can nonetheless respond widely differently to perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Oxalate decarboxylase catalyzes the redox-neutral unimolecular disproportionation reaction of oxalic acid. The pH maximum for catalysis is ~4.0 and activity is negligible above pH7. Here we report on the first crystal structure of the enzyme in its active pH range at pH4.6, and at a resolution of 1.45 [A], the highest to date. The fundamental tertiary and quaternary structure of the enzyme does not change with pH. However, the low pH crystals are heterogeneous containing both a closed and open conformation of a flexible loop region which gates access to the N-terminal active site cavity. Residue E162 in the closed conformation points away from the active-site Mn ion owing to the coordination of a buffer molecule, acetate. Since the quaternary structure of the enzyme appears unaffected by pH many conclusions drawn from the structures taken at high pH remain valid. Density functional theory calculations of the possible binding modes of oxalate to the N-terminal Mn ion demonstrate that both mono- and bi-dentate coordination modes are possible in the closed conformation with an energetic preference for the bidentate binding mode. The simulations suggest that R92 plays an important role as a guide for positioning the substrate in its catalytically competent orientation. A strong hydrogen bond is seen between the bi-dentate bound substrate and E101, one of the coordinating ligands for the N-terminal Mn ion. This suggests a more direct role of E101 as a transient base during the first step of catalysis.",

    "abstract": "The brain is highly dynamic, reorganizing its activity at different interacting spatial and temporal scales including variation within and between brain networks. The chronnectome is a model of the brain in which nodal activity and connectivity patterns are changing in fundamental and recurring ways through time. Most previous work has assumed fixed spatial nodes/networks, ignoring the possibility that spatial nodes or networks may vary in time, particularly at the level of the voxel. Here, we introduce an approach allowing for a spatially fluid chronnectome (called the spatial chronnectome for clarity), which focuses on the variation in spatiotemporal coupling at the voxel level within each network. We identify a novel set of spatially dynamic features which can be obtained and evaluated under different conditions. Results reveal transient spatially fluid interactions between intra- and inter-network relationships in which brain networks transiently merge and then separate again, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between segregation and integration. We also show that brain networks exhibit distinct spatial patterns with unique temporal characteristics, potentially explaining a broad spectrum of inconsistencies in previous studies which assumed static networks. Moreover, we show for the first time that anticorrelative connections to the default mode network, are transient as opposed to constant across the entire scan. Preliminary assessments of the approach using a multi-site dataset collected from 160 healthy subjects and 149 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) revealed the ability of the approach to obtain new information and nuanced alterations of brain networks that remain undetected during static analysis. For example, patients with SZ display transient decreases in voxel-wise network coupling including within visual and auditory networks that are not detectable in a spatially static analysis. Our approach also enabled calculation of a novel parameter, the intra-domain coupling variability which was higher within patients with SZ. The significant association between spatiotemporal uniformity and attention/vigilance cognitive domain highlights the cognitive relevance of the spatial chronnectome. In summary, the spatial chronnectome represents a new direction of research enabling the study of functional networks that are transient at the voxel level and identification of mechanisms for within and between-subject spatial variability to study functional brain homeostasis.",

Designing out-of-equilibrium architectures, however, requires a more subtle control over the thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions. We propose a new mechanism for enhancing thermodynamic drive of DNA strand displacement reactions whilst barely perturbing forward reaction rates - introducing mismatches in an internal location within the initial duplex. Through a combination of experiment and simulation, we demonstrate that displacement rates are strongly sensitive to mismatch location and can be tuned by rational design. By placing mismatches away from duplex ends, the thermodynamic drive for a strand-displacement reaction can be varied without significantly affecting the forward reaction rate. This hidden thermodynamic driving motif is ideal for the engineering of nonequilibrium systems that rely on catalytic control and must be robust to leak reactions.",
