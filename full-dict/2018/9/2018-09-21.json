    "abstract": "We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic datasets that measure many effects in many conditions (e.g., gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates, and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple \"shared/condition-specific\" assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally-acting variants associated with gene expression (\"cis eQTLs\") in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that while genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (e.g., brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (e.g., testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions, and available online.",

    "abstract": "There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.",

    "abstract": "After domestication in the Near East around 10,000 years ago several founder crops, flax included, spread to European latitudes. On reaching northerly latitudes the architecture of domesticated flax became more suitable to fiber production over oil, with longer stems, smaller seeds and fewer axillary branches. Latitudinal adaptations in crops typically result in changes in flowering time, often involving the PEBP family of genes that also have the potential to influence plant architecture. Two PEBP family genes in the flax genome, LuTFL1 and LuTFL2, vary in wild and cultivated flax over latitudinal range with cultivated flax receiving LuTFL1 alleles from northerly wild flax populations. Compared to a background of population structure of flaxes over latitude, the LuTFL1 alleles display a level of differentiation that is consistent with selection for an allele III in the north. We demonstrate through heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana that LuTFL1 is a functional homolog of TFL1 in A. thaliana capable of changing both flowering time and plant architecture. We conclude that specialized fiber flax types could have formed as a consequence of a natural adaptation of cultivated flax to higher latitudes.",

    "abstract": "Effort constitutes a major part of cost-benefit calculations underlying decision making. Therefore, estimating the effort someone has spent on a task is a core dimension for evaluating own and others actions. It has been previously shown that self-judgments of effort are influenced by the magnitude of obtained rewards. It is unclear, however, whether the influence of reward on effort estimations is limited to self-judgments or whether reward incorporation represents a general computational principle when judging effort. Here we show that people also integrate reward magnitude when judging the effort exerted by others. Participants (N=48) performed an effortful sensorimotor task interleaved with a partner, while rating either their own or the other persons effort. After each trial but before the effort rating, both participants were informed about the obtained reward. We found that higher rewards led to higher estimations of exerted effort, in self-as well as other-judgments, and this effect was more pronounced for other-judgments. In both types of judgment, computational modelling revealed that reward information and the perceived level of exertion were combined in a Bayes optimal manner to form effort estimates. Remarkably, the extent to which rewards influenced effort judgments was positively correlated with conservative world-views, indicating that the basic computations underlying this behavioural phenomenon might be related to more general beliefs about the association between effort and reward in the society. The integration of reward information into retrospective effort judgments underscores the convergence of multiple information sources that supports adaptive learning and decision making in social contexts.",

    "abstract": "Multi-species microbial communities often display functions - biochemical activities unattainable by member species alone, such as fighting pathogens. To improve community function, we can artificially select communities by growing \\\"Newborn\\\" communities over \\\"maturation time\\\" into \\\"Adult\\\" communities, and selecting highest-functioning Adults to \\\"reproduce\\\" by diluting each into multiple Newborns of the next cycle. Community selection has been attempted a few times on complex communities, often generating mixed results that are difficult to interpret. Here, we ask how costly community function may be improved via mutations and community selection. We simulate selection of two-species communities where Helpers digest Waste and generate Byproduct essential to Manufacturers; Manufacturers divert a fraction of their growth to make Product. Community function, the total Product in an \\\"Adult\\\", is sub-optimal even when both species have been pre-optimized as monocultures. If we dilute an Adult into Newborns by pipetting (a common experimental procedure), stochastic fluctuations in Newborn composition prevents community function from improving. Reducing fluctuations via cell sorting allows selection to work. Our conclusions hold regardless of whether H and M are commensal or mutualistic, or variations in model assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Engineering microbial consortia is an important new frontier for synthetic biology given its efficiency in performing complex tasks and endurance to environmental uncertainty. Most synthetic circuits regulate populational behaviors via cell-to-cell communications, which are affected by spatially heterogenous environments. Therefore, it is important to understand the limits on controlling system dynamics that are determined by interconnections among cell agents and provide a control strategy for engineering consortia. Here, we build a network model for a fractional population control circuit in two-strain consortia, and characterize the cell-to-cell communication network by topological properties, such as symmetry, locality and connectivity. Using linear network control theory, we relate the network topology to system outputs tracking performance. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that the minimum network control energy for accurate tracking depends on locality difference between two cell populations spatial distributions and how strongly the controller node contributes to communication strength. To realize a robust consortia, we can manipulate the communication network topology and construct strongly connected consortia by altering chemicals in environments. Our results ground the expected cell population dynamics in its spatially organized communication network, and inspire directions in cooperative control in microbial consortia.",

    "abstract": "Contextual information accompanying others actions modulates \\\"motor resonance\\\", i.e. neural activity within motor areas that is elicited by movement observation. One possibility is that we weight and combine such information in a Bayesian manner according to their relative uncertainty. Therefore, contextual information becomes particularly useful when others actions are ambiguous. It is unclear, however, whether this uncertainty modulates the neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1) during movement observation. Here we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects watched different grasping actions. We operationalized motor resonance as grip specific modulation of corticomotor excitability measured in the index (FDI) versus the little finger abductor (ADM). We experimentally modulated either the availability of kinematic information (Exp. 1) or the reliability of contextual cues (Exp. 2). Our results indicate that even in the absence of movement kinematics, reliable contextual information is enough to trigger significant muscle-specific corticomotor excitability changes in M1 (p<.0001) which are strongest when both kinematics and contextual information are available (p<.005). These findings suggest that bottom-up mechanisms that activate motor representations as a function of the observed kinematics, and top-down mechanisms which activate motor representations associated with arbitrary cues converge in M1 in a statistically optimal manner.",

We developed mHi-C, a multi-read mapping strategy to probabilistically allocate Hi-C multi-reads. mHi-C exhibited superior performance over utilizing only uni-reads and heuristic approaches aimed at rescuing multi-reads on benchmarks. Specifically, mHi-C increased the sequencing depth by an average of 20% leading to higher reproducibility of contact matrices and larger number of significant interactions across biological replicates. The impact of the multi-reads on the identification of novel significant interactions is influenced marginally by relative contribution of multi-reads to the sequencing depth compared to uni-reads, cis-to-trans ratio of contacts, and the broad data quality as reflected by the proportion of mappable reads of datasets. Computational experiments highlighted that in Hi-C studies with short read lengths, mHi-C rescued multi-reads can emulate the effect of longer reads. mHi-C also revealed biologically supported bona fide promoter-enhancer interactions and topologically associating domains involving repetitive genomic regions, thereby unlocking a previously masked portion of the genome for conformation capture studies.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental diseases displaying significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity1-4. Despite recent progress in understanding ASD genetics, the nature of phenotypic heterogeneity across probands remains unclear5, 6. Notably, likely gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo mutations affecting the same gene often result in substantially different ASD phenotypes. Nevertheless, we find that truncating mutations that affect the same exon frequently lead to strikingly similar intellectual phenotypes in unrelated ASD probands. Analogous patterns are observed for two independent proband cohorts and several other important ASD-associated phenotypes. We find that exons biased towards prenatal and postnatal expression preferentially contribute to ASD cases with lower and higher IQ phenotypes, respectively. These results suggest that exons, rather than genes, often represent a unit of effective phenotypic impact for truncating mutations in autism. The observed phenotypic effects are likely mediated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of splicing isoforms, with autism phenotypes usually triggered by relatively mild (15-30%) decreases in overall gene dosage. We find that each gene with recurrent ASD mutations can be described by a parameter, phenotype dosage sensitivity (PDS), which characterizes the quantitative relationship between changes in a genes dosage and changes in a given disease phenotype. We further demonstrate analogous relationships between LGD mutations and changes in gene expression across human tissues. Therefore, similar phenotypic patterns may be also observed in multiple other systems and genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Trabecular architecture (i.e., the main orientation of the bone trabeculae, their number, mean thickness, spacing, etc.) has been shown experimentally to adapt with great accuracy and sensitivity to the loadings applied to the bone during life. However, the potential of trabecular parameters used as a proxy for the mechanical environment of an organisms organ to help reconstruct the lifestyle of extinct taxa has only recently started to be exploited. Furthermore, these parameters are rarely combined to the long-used mid-diaphyseal parameters to inform such reconstructions. Here we investigate xenarthrans, for which functional and ecological reconstructions of extinct forms are particularly important in order to improve our macroevolutionary understanding of their main constitutive clades, i.e., the Tardigrada (sloths), Vermilingua (anteaters), and Cingulata (armadillos and extinct close relatives). The lifestyles of modern xenarthrans can be classified as fully terrestrial and highly fossorial (armadillos), arboreal (partly to fully) and hook-and-pull digging (anteaters), or suspensory (fully arboreal) and non-fossorial (sloths). The degree of arboreality and fossoriality of some extinct forms, \\\"ground sloths\\\" in particular, is highly debated. We used high-resolution computed tomography to compare the epiphyseal 3D architecture and mid-diaphyseal structure of the forelimb bones of extant and extinct xenarthrans. The comparative approach employed aims at inferring the most probable lifestyle of extinct taxa, using a phylogenetically informed discriminant analysis. Several challenges preventing the attribution of one of the extant xenarthran lifestyles to the sampled extinct sloths were identified. Differing from that of the larger \\\"ground sloths\\\", the bone structure of the small-sized Hapalops (Miocene of Argentina), however, was found as significantly more similar to that of extant sloths, even when accounting for the phylogenetic signal.",

Considerable data indicate that HPC-mPFC circuits are involved in contextual and spatial memory; however, it is not clear whether the RE mediates the acquisition or retrieval of these memories. To examine this question, we inactivated the RE with muscimol before either the acquisition or retrieval of Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats; freezing served as the index of fear. We found that RE inactivation before conditioning impaired the acquisition of contextual freezing, whereas inactivation of the RE prior to retrieval testing increased the generalization of freezing to a novel context; inactivation of the RE did not affect either the acquisition or expression of auditory fear conditioning. Interestingly, contextual conditioning impairments were absent when retrieval testing was also conducted after RE inactivation. Contextual memories acquired under RE inactivation were hippocampal-independent, insofar as contextual freezing in rats conditioned under RE inactivation was insensitive to intra-hippocampal infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist, D,L-amino-5-phosophonovaleric acid (APV). Together, these data reveal that the RE supports hippocampal-dependent encoding of precise contextual memories that allow discrimination of dangerous from safe contexts. When the RE is inactive, however, alternate neural systems acquire an impoverished contextual memory that is only expressed when the RE is offline.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe midline thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) coordinates communication between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, brain areas critical for contextual and spatial memory.

However, inactivating the RE prior to retrieval testing restored contextual memory in rats conditioned after RE inactivation.

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is a potentially lethal gut pathogen that causes nosocomial and community acquired infections. Limited treatment options and reports of reduced susceptibility to current treatment emphasize the necessity for novel antimicrobials. The DNA-polymerase of gram-positive organisms is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials. ACX-362E (N2-(3<,4-Dichlorobenzyl)-7-(2-[1-morpholinyl]ethyl)guanine; MorE-DCBG) is a DNA polymerase inhibitor in pre-clinical development as a novel therapeutic against C. difficile infection. This synthetic purine shows preferential activity against C. difficile PolC over those of other organisms in vitro and is effective in an animal model of C. difficile infection. In this study we have determined its efficacy against a large collection of clinical isolates. At concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration, the presumed slowing (or stalling) of replication forks due to ACX-362E leads to a growth defect. We have determined the transcriptional response of C. difficile to replication inhibition and observed an overrepresentation of up-regulated genes near the origin of replication in the presence of PolC-inhibitors, but not when cells were subjected to sub-inhibitory concentrations of other antibiotics. This phenomenon can be explained by a gene dosage shift, as we observed a concomitant increase in the ratio between origin-proximal versus terminus-proximal gene copy number upon exposure to PolC-inhibitors. Moreover, we show that certain genes differentially regulated under PolC-inhibition are controlled by the origin-proximal general stress response regulator sigma factor B. Together, these data suggest that genome location both directly and indirectly determines the transcriptional response to replication inhibition in C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is the most widely reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Its incidence is rapidly increasing and disease symptoms can be debilitating. The need to understand the biology of the disease agent, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is thus evermore pressing. Despite important advances in B. burgdorferi genetics, the array of molecular tools available for use in this organism remains limited, especially for cell biological studies. Here, we adapt a palette of bright and mostly monomeric fluorescent proteins for versatile use and multi-color imaging in B. burgdorferi. We also characterize two novel antibiotic selection markers and establish the feasibility of their use in conjunction with extant markers. Lastly, we describe a set of constitutively active promoters of low and intermediate strengths that allow fine-tuning of gene expression levels. These molecular tools complement and expand current experimental capabilities in B. burgdorferi, which will facilitate future investigation of this important human pathogen. To showcase the usefulness of these reagents, we used them to investigate the subcellular localization of BB0323, a B. burgdorferi lipoprotein essential for survival in the host and vector environments. We show that BB0323 accumulates at the cell poles and future division sites of B. burgdorferi cells, highlighting the complex subcellular organization of this spirochete.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEGenetic manipulation of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi remains cumbersome, despite significant progress in the field. The scarcity of molecular reagents available for use in this pathogen has slowed research efforts to study its unusual biology. Of interest, B. burgdorferi displays complex cellular organization features that have yet to be understood. These include an unusual morphology and a highly fragmented genome, both of which are likely to play important roles in the bacteriums transmission, infectivity, and persistence. Here, we complement and expand the array of molecular tools available for use in B. burgdorferi by generating and characterizing multiple fluorescent proteins, antibiotic selection markers, and constitutively active promoters of different strengths. These tools will facilitate investigations in this important human pathogen, as exemplified by the polar and midcell localization of the cell envelope regulator BB0323, which we uncovered using these reagents.",

    "abstract": "Modern improvement of complex traits in agricultural species relies on successful associations of heritable molecular variation with observable phenotypes. Historically, this pursuit has primarily been based on easily measurable genetic markers. The recent advent of new technologies allows assaying and quantifying biological intermediates (hereafter endophenotypes) which are now readily measurable at a large scale across diverse individuals. The potential of using endophenotypes for dissecting traits of interest remains underexplored in plants. The work presented here illustrated the utility of a large-scale (299 genotype and 7 tissue) gene expression resource to dissect traits across multiple levels of biological organization. Using single-tissue- and multi-tissue-based transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), we revealed that about half of the functional variation for agronomic and seed quality (carotenoid, tocochromanol) traits is regulatory. Comparing the efficacy of TWAS with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and an ensemble approach that combines both GWAS and TWAS, we demonstrated that results of TWAS in combination with GWAS increase the power to detect known genes and aid in prioritizing likely causal genes. Using a variance partitioning approach in the independent maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population, we also showed that the most strongly associated genes identified by combining GWAS and TWAS explain more heritable variance for a majority of traits, beating the heritability captured by the random genes and the genes identified by GWAS or TWAS alone. This improves not only the ability to link genes to phenotypes, but also highlights the phenotypic consequences of regulatory variation in plants.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe examined the ability to associate variability in gene expression directly with terminal phenotypes of interest, as a supplement linking genotype to phenotype. We found that transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are a useful accessory to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In a combined test with GWAS results, TWAS improves the capacity to re-detect genes known to underlie quantitative trait loci for kernel and agronomic phenotypes. This improves not only the capacity to link genes to phenotypes, but also illustrates the widespread importance of regulation for phenotype.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVisual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture.\\n\\nMethodology / Principal FindingsWe introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. This framework is applied to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. Cross-validation analysis is employed to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that these models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. How observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels is investigated by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, revealing a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. Our results suggest that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing the method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries.\\n\\nConclusions / SignificanceThis study demonstrates how machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems must possess mechanisms that prevent inappropriate responses to spurious environmental signals. Gene regulatory network circuitries known as coherent type 1 feed-forward loops (FFLs) with AND-logic gates have been proposed to function as a persistence detector because it generates a delay in target activation and prevents target induction unless the input signal is sustained. While such a circuit has been found for the L-arabinose utilization system in E. coli, their existence and relevance multicellular organisms has remained unclear. Here, we identify the first persistence detector in an animal that redirects propionate breakdown to a shunt pathway when flux through the canonical propionate breakdown pathway is perturbed. We propose that this mechanism has evolved to ensure the shunt pathway stays off unless propionate accumulation is persistent because the shunt pathway generates highly toxic acrylate. Our study uniquely connects persistence detector circuitry to a physiological response in an animal.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is utilized to study the structure and dynamics of many bio-molecules, such as proteins, DNA and their various complexes. The structural assessment is based on the well-known Forster relationship between the measured efficiency of energy transfer between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) dye and the distance between them. Classical smFRET analysis methods called photon distribution analysis (PDA) take into account photon shot-noise, D-A distance distribution and, more recently, interconversion between states in order to extract accurate distance information. It is known that rapid D-A distance fluctuations on the order of the D lifetime (or shorter) can increase the measured mean FRET efficiency and thus decrease the estimated D-A distance. Nonetheless, this effect has been so far neglected in smFRET experiments, potentially leading to biases in estimated distances.\\n\\nHere we introduce a PDA approach dubbed Monte-Carlo-diffusion-enhanced photon inference (MC-DEPI). MC-DEPI recolor detected photons of smFRET experiments taking into account dynamics of D-A distance fluctuations, multiple interconverting states and photo-blinking. Using this approach, we show how different underlying conditions may yield identical FRET histograms and how the additional information from fluorescence decays helps distinguishing between the different conditions. We also introduce a machine learning fitting approach for retrieving the D-A distance distribution, decoupled from the above-mentioned effects. We show that distance interpretation of smFRET experiments of even the simplest dsDNA is nontrivial and requires decoupling the effects of rapid D-A distance fluctuations on FRET in order to avoid systematic biases in the estimation of the D-A distance distribution.",

One ecosystem prone to fauna shifts is the Northeast Greenland shelf. The dispersal route taken by boreal fauna to this area is, however, not known. This knowledge is essential to predict to what extent boreal biota will colonise Arctic habitats. Using population genetics, we show that Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella), and deep-sea shrimp (Pandalus borealis) specimens recently found on the Northeast Greenland shelf originate from the Barents Sea, and suggest that pelagic offspring were dispersed via advection across the Fram Strait. Our results indicate that boreal invasions of Arctic habitats can be driven by advection, and that the fauna of the Barents Sea can project into adjacent habitats with the potential to colonise putatively isolated Arctic ecosystems such as Northeast Greenland.",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor neurons, primarily in young children. SMA is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN functions in the assembly of spliceosomal RNPs and is well conserved in many model systems including mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, and fission yeast. Work in Drosophila has primarily focused on loss of SMN function during larval stages, primarily using null alleles or strong hypomorphs. A systematic analysis of SMA-related phenotypes in the context of moderate alleles that more closely mimic the genetics of SMA has not been performed in the fly, leading to debate over the validity and translational value of this model. We therefore examined fourteen Drosophila lines expressing SMA patient-derived missense mutations in Smn, with a focus on neuromuscular phenotypes in the adult stage. Animals were evaluated on the basis of organismal viability and longevity, locomotor function, neuromuscular junction structure, and muscle health. In all cases, we observed phenotypes similar to those of SMA patients, including progressive loss of adult motor function. The severity of these defects is variable, and forms a broad spectrum across the fourteen lines examined, recapitulating the full range of phenotypic severity observed in human SMA. This includes late-onset models of SMA, which have been difficult to produce in other model systems. The results provide direct evidence that SMA-related locomotor decline can be reproduced in the fly and support the use of patient-derived SMN missense mutations as a comprehensive system for modeling SMA.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has revealed the pivotal role of epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of liver disease. However, the epigenetic mechanism that accounts for hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation in liver fibrosis remains largely unknown. In this study, primary HSCs were used to screen the differentially expressed histone H3 lysine methyltransferases and demethylases during HSC activation. KDM4D was identified as a remarkable up-regulated histone H3 demethylase during HSC activation. The overexpression profile of KDM4D was further confirmed in three fibrosis animal models and human fibrotic liver tissues. In vitro genetic silencing of Kdm4d impaired the collagen gel contraction and migration capacity of primary HSCs. In established CCl4-induced mice model, Kdm4d knockdown inhibited fibrosis progression, and promoted fibrosis reversal, with enhanced thinning and splitting of fibrotic septa, as well as a dramatic decrease in collagen area. Whole gene transcriptome analysis showed the regulatory role of KDM4D in Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Mechanistically, KDM4D catalyzed histone 3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) di-, and tri-demethylation, which promoted TLR4 expression, and subsequently prompted liver fibrogenesis by activating NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways. KDM4D facilitates TLR4 transcription through demethylation of H3K9, thus activating TLR4/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathways in HSCs, contributing to HSC activation and collagen crosslinking, further, hepatic fibrosis progression.",

Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons with 3D-time-lapse imaging and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. By speci1cally inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. We show that Reelin signaling promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) display hyperpolarisation-gated synaptic plasticity, where inhibition believed to come from cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) of vestibular nerve afferent synapses. This phenomenon is thought to underlie the plasticity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here we present a novel multi-scale computational model, which captures both electrophysiological and biochemical signalling at vestibular nerve synapses on proximal dendrites of the MVN neuron. We show that AMPA receptor phosphorylation at the vestibular synapse depends in complex ways on dendritic calcium influx, which is in turn shaped by patterns of post-synaptic hyperpolarisation and vestibular nerve stimulation. Hyperpolarisation-gated synaptic plasticity critically depends on the activation of LVA calcium channels and on the interplay between CaMKII and PP2B in dendrites of the post-synaptic MVN cell. The extent and direction of synaptic plasticity depend on the strength and duration of hyperpolarisation, and on the relative timing of hyperpolarisation and vestibular nerve stimulation. The multi-scale model thus enables us to explore in detail the interactions between electrophysiological activation and post-synaptic biochemical reaction systems. More generally, this model has the potential to address a wide range of questions about neural signal integration, post-synaptic biochemical reaction systems and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe parasite Leishmania infantum causes zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a potentially fatal vector-borne disease of canids and humans. Zoonotic VL poses a significant risk to public health, with regions of Latin America being particularly afflicted by the disease.\\n\\nLeishmania infantum parasites are transmitted between hosts during blood feeding by infected female phlebotomine sand flies. With a principal reservoir host of L. infantum being domestic dogs, limiting prevalence in this reservoir may result in a reduced risk of infection for the human population. To this end, a primary focus of research efforts has been to understand disease transmission dynamics among dogs. One way this can be achieved is through the use of mathematical models.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed a stochastic, spatial, individual-based mechanistic model of L. infantum transmission in domestic dogs. The model framework was applied to a rural Brazilian village setting with parameter values informed by fieldwork and laboratory data. To ensure household and sand fly populations were realistic, we statistically fit distributions for these entities to existing survey data. To identify the model parameters of highest importance, we performed a stochastic parameter sensitivity analysis of the prevalence of infection among dogs to the model parameters.\\n\\nResultsWe computed parametric distributions for the number of humans and animals per household and a non-parametric temporal profile for sand fly abundance. The stochastic parameter sensitivity analysis determined prevalence of L. infantum infection in dogs to be most strongly affected by the sand fly associated parameters and the proportion of immigrant dogs already infected with L. infantum parasites.\\n\\nConclusionsEstablishing the model parameters with the highest sensitivity of average L. infantum infection prevalence in dogs to their variation helps motivate future data collection efforts focusing on these elements. Moreover, the proposed mechanistic modelling framework provides a foundation that can be expanded to explore spatial patterns of zoonotic VL in humans and to assess spatially targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. However, GWAS techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWAS method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach. GenEpi identifies both within-gene and cross-gene epistasis through a two-stage modeling workflow. In both stages, GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. The simulated data showed that GenEpi outperforms other widely-used methods on detecting ground-truth epistasis. As real data is concerned, this study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power. Availability: GenEpi is an open-source python package and available free of charge only for non-commercial users. The package can be downloaded from https://github.com/Chester75321/GenEpi, and has also been published on The Python Package Index.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory shows that social interactions involving coordination between individuals are subject to an \\\"evolutionary trap.\\\" Once a suboptimal strategy has evolved, mutants playing an alternative strategy are counterselected because they fail to coordinate with the majority. This creates a detrimental situation from which evolution cannot escape. To determine how this problem materializes in a model with a greater degree of realism than conventional game-theoretical models, we simulate the life and the long-term evolution of a population of individuals playing a two-player coordination game, using the framework of evolutionary robotics. We first confirm the existence of an evolutionary trap in a simple setting. We then, however, reveal that this problem disappears in a more realistic setting where individuals need to coordinate with one another. In this setting, robots evolve an ability to adapt plastically their behavior to one another, as this improves the efficiency of their interaction. This ability has an unintended evolutionary consequence: a genetic mutation affecting one individuals behavior also indirectly alters their partners behavior because the two individuals influence one another, which is called an \\\"indirect genetic effect\\\". Consequently, pairs of partners can virtually change strategy together with a single mutation, and the evolutionary barrier between alternative strategies disappears. This finding reveals a general principle that could play a role in nature to smoothen the transition to efficient collective behaviors in all games with multiple equilibriums.",

    "abstract": "Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is being adopted increasingly broadly in many research, commercial and clinical settings. Currently used target capture methods, however, typically require complex and lengthy (sometimes multi-day) workflows that complicates their use in certain applications. In addition, small panels for high sequencing depth applications such as liquid biopsy typically have low on-target rates, resulting in unnecessarily high sequencing cost.\\n\\nWe have developed a novel targeted sequencing library preparation method, named Linked Target Capture (LTC), which replaces typical multi-day target capture workflows with a single-day, combined  target-capture-PCR workflow. This approach uses physically linked capture probes and PCR primers and is expected to work with panel sizes from 100 bp to >10 Mbp. It reduces the time and complexity of the capture workflow, eliminates long hybridization and wash steps and enables rapid library construction and target capture. High on-target read fractions are achievable due to repeated sequence selection in the target-capture-PCR step, thus lowering sequencing cost.\\n\\nWe have demonstrated this technology on sample types including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) derived DNA, capturing a 35-gene pan-cancer panel, and therein detecting single nucleotide variants, copy number variants, insertions, deletions and gene fusions. With the integration of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), variants as low as 0.25% abundance were detected, limited by input mass and sequencing depth. Additionally, sequencing libraries were prepared in less than eight hours from extracted DNA to loaded sequencer, demonstrating that LTC holds promise as a broadly applicable tool for rapid, cost-effective and high performance targeted sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Theories of predictive processing propose that prediction error responses are modulated by the certainty of the predictive model or precision. While there is some evidence for this phenomenon in the visual and, to a lesser extent, the auditory modality, little is known about whether it operates in the complex auditory contexts of daily life. Here, we examined how prediction error responses behave in a more complex and ecologically valid auditory context than those typically studied. We created musical tone sequences with different degrees of pitch uncertainty to manipulate the precision of participants auditory expectations. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure the magnetic counterpart of the mismatch negativity (MMNm) as a neural marker of prediction error in a multi-feature paradigm. Pitch, slide, intensity and timbre deviants were included. We compared high-entropy stimuli, consisting of a set of non-repetitive melodies, with low-entropy stimuli consisting of a simple, repetitive pitch pattern. Pitch entropy was quantitatively assessed with an information-theoretic model of auditory expectation. We found a reduction in pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-entropy as compared to the low-entropy context. No significant differences were found for intensity and timbre MMNm amplitudes. Furthermore, in a separate behavioral experiment investigating the detection of pitch deviants, similar decreases were found for accuracy measures in response to more fine-grained increases in pitch entropy. Our results are consistent with a precision modulation of auditory prediction error in a musical context, and suggest that this effect is specific to features that depend on the manipulated dimension--pitch information, in this case.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe mismatch negativity (MMNm) is reduced in musical contexts with high pitch uncertainty\\nC_LIO_LIThe MMNm reduction is restricted to pitch-related features\\nC_LIO_LIAccuracy during deviance detection is reduced in contexts with higher uncertainty\\nC_LIO_LIThe results suggest a feature-selective precision modulation of prediction error\\nC_LI\\n\\nMaterials, data and scripts can be found in the Open Science Framework repository: http://bit.ly/music_entropy_MMN\\n\\nDOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/MY6TE",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA mediated incoherent feed forward loops (IFFLs) are recurrent network motifs in mammalian cells and have been a topic of study for their noise rejection and buffering properties. Previous work showed that IFFLs can adapt to varying promoter activity and are less prone to noise than similar circuits without the feed forward loop. Furthermore, it has been shown that microRNAs are better at rejecting extrinsic noise than intrinsic noise. This work studies the biological mechanisms that lead to extrinsic noise rejection for microRNA mediated feed forward network motifs. Specifically, we compare the effects of microRNA-induced mRNA degradation and translational inhibition on extrinsic noise rejection, and identify the parameter regimes where noise is most efficiently rejected. In the case of static extrinsic noise, we find that translational inhibition can expand the regime of extrinsic noise rejection. We then analyze rejection of dynamic extrinsic noise in the case of a single-gene feed forward loop (sgFFL), a special case of the IFFL motif where the microRNA and target mRNA are co-expressed. For this special case, we demonstrate that depending on the time-scale of fluctuations in the extrinsic variable compared to the mRNA and microRNA decay rates, the feed forward loop can both buffer or amplify fluctuations in gene product copy numbers.",

We describe here a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework which makes two major advances: an efficient parallel implementation, allowing parameter estimation for more complex forward models, and a system for practical model selection, allowing evidence-based comparison between distinct physical models. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by generating simulated noisy flow velocity data from a branching arterial tree model in which a structural defect is introduced at an unknown location; our approach is shown to accurately locate the abnormality and estimate its physical properties even in the presence of significant observational and systemic error.

    "abstract": "A novel lipase gene, Lip-1420, was isolated from a metagenomics library constructed from soil samples from reed marshes and from Mt. Jumbong in Korea consisting of 112,500 recombinant plasmids. A selected recombinant plasmid, Lip-1420, was further analyzed which exhibited the maximum lipolytic activity among 18 recombinant fosmids that showed lipolytic activity. Among them, DNA sequence analysis of a 5,513 bp subclone in pUC119 Lip-1420-sub revealed that 11 ORFs were included in the gene according to the blast search from GenBank. The transformant of Lip-1420-ORF3 exhibited lipolytic activity, and plasmid pET21a(+)-Lipase-6H was constructed and transferred to the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3). Finally, the lipase Lip1420 was purified from a FPLC system, and the recombinant enzyme was kept in a -70 {o}C freezer at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in a buffer solution (50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4). The Lip-1420 gene was registered in GenBank (MH628529), and the purified enzyme had an optimal activity at 40 {degrees}C and pH 8.0. Kinetic analysis of the Lip-1420 lipase with the substrate p-nitrophenyl palmitate was performed at 40 {degrees}C and pH 8.0, and the Km and Vmax values of the protein were determined to be 0.268 mM and 1.821 units, respectively. The purified Lip-1420 exhibited the maximum enzymatic activity towards p-nitrophenyl palmitate, indicating that it is an esterase.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThis study provides the knowledge to develop a new lipase from the metagenomics library of rhizosphere in Korea using an activity-based method. In addition, the knowledge gained from this study has allowed us to understand that the natural ecosystems are still an unknown genetic material storage report in relation to industrially useful biocatalysts, which are still rich in biodiversity. Moreover, alkaline lipase has great potential for applications in the detergent industry. Especially in the major part of the global industrial enzyme market with high growth potential. It is used, for example, in detergent additives, biopolymer synthesis, and biodiesel production, synthesis of optically pure compounds and food additives as well as in the paper industry, perfume and fragrance blends, biological purification and waste treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSomatic mutations in cancer genomes occur through a variety of molecular mechanisms, which contribute to different mutational patterns. To summarize these, mutational signatures have been defined using a large number of cancer genomes, and related to distinct mutagenic processes. Each cancer genome can be compared to this reference dataset and its exposure to one or the other signature be determined. Given the very different mutational patterns of these signatures, we anticipate that they will have distinct impact on genomic elements, in particular motifs for transcription factor binding sites (TFBS).\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we build the link between mutational signatures and TFBS motif alterations. We investigated and computed the theoretical impact of mutational signatures on 512 TFBS motifs, hence translating the trinucleotide mutation frequencies of the signatures into alteration frequencies of specific TFBS motifs, leading either to creation of disruption of these motifs. We further build a theoretical prediction of the alteration patterns for different cancer types based on the exposure of these cancer types to the mutation signatures. For certain motifs, a high correlation is observed between the TFBS motif creation and disruption events related to the information content of the motif.\\n\\nConclusionOur results show that the mutational signatures have different impact on the binding motifs of transcription factors and that for certain high complexity motifs there is a strong correlation between creation and disruption, related to the information content of the motif. This study represents a background estimation of the alterations due purely to mutational signatures in the absence of additional contributions, e.g. from evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus houses, organizes, and protects chromatin to ensure genome integrity and proper gene expression, but how the nucleus adapts mechanically to changes in the extracellular environment is poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular chemical or physical stresses induce chromatin compaction via mechanotransductive processes. We report that increased extracellular multivalent cations lead to increased heterochromatin levels through mechanosensitive ion channels. This increase in heterochromatin results in increased chromatin-based nuclear rigidity, which suppresses nuclear blebbing in cells with perturbed chromatin or lamins. Furthermore, transduction of elevated extracellular cations rescues nuclear morphology in model and patient cells of human diseases, including progeria and the breast cancer model cell line MDA-MB-231. We conclude that nuclear mechanics and morphology, including abnormal phenotypes found in human diseases, can be modulated by cell sensing of the extracellular environment and consequent changes to histone modification state and chromatin-based nuclear rigidity, without requiring direct mechanical perturbations to the cell interior.",

    "abstract": "One of three vertebrates belongs to a fish lineage for which protrusile jaws are a synapomorphy. Identifying the developmental determinants of protrusion ability will improve our understanding of an important area of evolutionary diversification. The high water viscosities experienced by tiny fish larvae inhibit the viability of protrusile jaws. In the zebrafish protrusion does not arise until after metamorphosis. Fish metamorphosis typically includes significant changes in trophic morphology, accompanies a shift in feeding niche and coincides with increased thyroid hormone production. We tested whether thyroid hormone affects the development of zebrafish feeding mechanics. We found that it affected all developmental stages examined, but that these effects were most pronounced after metamorphosis. Thyroid hormone levels affected the development of jaw morphology, feeding mechanics, shape variation and cranial ossification. Adult zebrafish utilize protrusile jaws, but an absence of thyroid hormone eliminated postmetamorphic remodeling of the premaxilla and the premaxillary structure that permits protrusion never formed. The premaxillae of late juvenile and adult zebrafish are similar to those found in the adults of other Danio species. Premaxillae from early juvenile zebrafish and hypothyroid adult zebrafish resemble those from adults in the genera Danionella, Devario and Microdevario that show little to no jaw protrusion.",

    "abstract": "Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) is a kinship-based method for estimating adult abundance. However, the application of CKMR is limited to using a kinship relationship that is not affected by family-correlated survivorship, which leads to a biased estimation. We developed a nearly unbiased estimator of the number of mothers in a population, which is based on the known maternal half-sibling relationship found within the same cohort. Our method allowed for variance of the averaged offspring number per mother (between-age variation) and for variance of the offspring number among mothers with the same reproductive potential (within-age variation). Estimators of its variance and coefficient variation were also provided. The performance of the estimators was quantitatively evaluated by running an individual-based model. Our results provide guidance for (i) a sample size to archive the required accuracy and precision when the order of mother size is available and (ii) a degree of uncertainty regarding the estimated mother size when information about the mother size is not available. Taken together, these findings offer an opportunity to shed light on the usefulness of analysing within-cohort half-sibling pairs and will greatly widen the scope of the CKMR method.",

    "abstract": "Although hydrology and water chemistry are known to change in proximity to cities, there remains little empirical evidence connecting specific components of urban landscapes to mangrove flooding dynamics or surface water chemistry. This study constructs five-year water level models from tidal harmonics and precipitation inputs to characterize mangrove flooding across urban gradients in three watersheds of Puerto Rico. There was some evidence for an influence of urbanization on both flooding and water chemistry, but this depended on the definition of urbanness, and points instead to geomorphology as the primary culprit. Urban sites exhibited 46% longer hydroperiods and 450% lower depths than non-urban sites. Rainfall importance was explained more by geomorphology than by urbanization and suggested systems with limited tidal connectivity are four times more sensitive to rainfall than systems with full tidal connectivity. There was also evidence for changes in tidal amplitudes along the urban gradient, which may explain the observed differences in flooding. Relationships between surface water chemical metrics and land cover contradicted previous studies by suggesting lower nutrients and biochemical oxygen demand with increasing urbanization. These results reinforce the understanding that the most important drivers of urban mangrove hydrology and water quality in Puerto Rico are likely geomorphology and tidal connectivity, with little but not zero influence from surrounding land cover. Results should be considered alongside the reported errors stemming from inaccuracies in digital elevation and rainfall response models, and will be useful in understanding future ecological censuses on the island.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMalawi has the highest rates of mortality directly or indirectly associated with burn injuries in Southern Africa. There is however no published literature on risk factors of mortality among adult patients.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross sectional audit records of patients admitted at the burns unit of Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) between the years 2007 and 2017. Death due to burns was our outcome of interest. We collected patient data including demographic information, details of the burn injury and its management and determined how these factors were associated with the risk of death using Person Chi square tests in a univariate analysis and likelihood ratio tests in a multivariate logistic regression model. We also determined the odds ratios of death within the categories of the risk factors after adjusting for important variables using a logistic regression model.\\n\\nResultsAn analysis of 500 burns patient records showed that 132(26.4%) died during the 10-year period. The lethal area for 50% of burns (LA50) was 28.75% and mortality reached 100% at 40% total burn surface area. The following variables were found to be significantly associated with mortality after controlling for confounders: scalds (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.05-0.33; <0.0001), increasing total burn surface area (p<0.0001), time lapse to hospital presentation between 48 hours and one week(OR 0.27; 95%CI 0.11-0.68; <0.0001), inhalation burns (OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.0-13.3 p 0.0004) and length of hospital stay greater than two months (OR 0.04 95, CI 0.01-0.15; P<0.0001).\\n\\nConclusionsRisk factors for mortality are connected by their association with post-burn hypermetabolism.

    "abstract": "Prolidase (PEPD) catalyses the cleavage of dipeptides with high affinity for proline at the C-terminal end. This function is required in almost all living organisms. In order to detect strongly conserved residues in PEPD, we analysed PEPD orthologous sequences identified in data sets of animals, plants, fungi, archaea, and bacteria. Due to conservation over very long evolutionary time, conserved residues are likely to be of functional relevance. Single amino acid mutations in PEPD cause a disorder called prolidase deficiency and are associated with various cancer types. We provide new insights into 15 additional residues with putative roles in prolidase deficiency and cancer. Moreover, our results confirm previous reports identifying five residues involved in the binding of metal cofactors as highly conserved and enable the classification of several non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms as likely pathogenic and seven as putative polymorphisms. Moreover, more than 50 novel conserved residues across species were identified. Conservation degree per residue across the animal kingdom were mapped to the human PEPD 3D structure revealing the strongest conservation close to the active site accompanied with a higher functional implication and pathogenic potential, validating the importance of a characteristic active site fold for prolidase identity.",

    "abstract": "Immune priming, the increased chance to survive a secondary encounter with a pathogen, has been described for many invertebrate species, which lack the classical adaptive immune system of vertebrates. Priming can be specific even for closely related bacterial strains, last up to the entire lifespan of an individual, and in some species, it can also be transferred to the offspring and is then called transgenerational immune priming (TGIP). In the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, a pest of stored grains, TGIP has even been shown to be transferred paternally after injection of adult beetles with heat-killed Bacillus thuringiensis.\\n\\nHere we studied whether TGIP in T. castaneum is also transferred to the second filial generation, whether it can also occur after oral and injection priming of larvae and whether it has effects on offspring development. We found that paternal priming with B. thuringiensis does not only protect the first but also the second offspring generation. Also, fitness costs of the immune priming became apparent, when the first filial generation produced fewer offspring. Furthermore, we used two different routes of exposure to prime larvae, either by injecting them with heat-killed bacteria or orally feeding them B. thuringiensis spore culture supernatant. Neither of the parental larval priming methods led to any direct benefits regarding offspring resistance. However, the injections slowed down development of the injected individuals, while oral priming with both a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic strain of B. thuringiensis delayed offspring development.\\n\\nThe long-lasting transgenerational nature of immune priming and its impact on offspring development indicate that potentially underlying epigenetic modifications might be stable over several generations. Therefore, this form of phenotypic plasticity might impact pest control and should be considered when using products of bacterial origin against insects.",

    "abstract": "Although environments rife with enemies should cause selection for defensive traits, such enemy-rich environments should also select for greater virulence in co-occurring symbionts, yet many defensive symbionts cause little to no damage while protecting their hosts from enemies. Thus, co-infection of a defensive symbiont and a parasite is predicted to select both for increased virulence in co-infecting symbionts and for increased defense in the protective symbiont. Why then do we observe defensive mutualists that protect hosts while causing little damage? To address this question, we build a symbiont-centered model that incorporates the evolution of two independent traits: defense and virulence. Virulence is modeled as a continuous trait spanning mutualism (negative virulence) and parasitism (virulence) and thus accounts for the entire range of direct effects that symbionts have on host mortality. Defense is modeled as a continuous trait that ameliorates the costs to the host associated with co-infection with a deleterious parasite. We obtain the counterintuitive result that the evolution of increased defense in one symbiont largely leads to the evolution of lower virulence in both symbionts and may even facilitate pathogens evolving to mutualism. However, results are context-dependent and when defensive traits are costly, the evolution of greater defense may also lead to higher virulence.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand the full complexity in pattern and process that shapes organismal diversity. Although phylogenetic comparative methods are often used to reconstruct complex evolutionary dynamics, they are typically limited to a single phenotypic trait. Extensions that accommodate multiple traits lack the ability to partition multidimensional datasets into a set of mosaic suites of evolutionarily linked characters. I introduce a comparative framework that identifies heterogeneity in evolutionary patterns across large datasets of continuous traits. Using a model of continuous trait evolution based on the differential accumulation of disparity across lineages in a phylogeny, the approach algorithmically partitions traits into a set of character suites that best explains the data, where each suite displays a distinct pattern in phylogenetic morphological disparity. When applied to empirical data, the approach revealed a mosaic pattern predicted by developmental biology. The evolutionary distinctiveness of individual suites can be investigated in more detail, either by fitting conventional comparative models or by directly studying the phylogenetic patterns in disparity recovered during the analysis. This framework can supplement existing comparative approaches by inferring the complex, integrated patterns that shape evolution across the body plan from disparate developmental, morphometric, and environmental sources of phenotypic data.",

    "abstract": "Polyandry drives postcopulatory sexual selection (PCSS), resulting in rapid evolution of male ejaculate traits. Critical to male and female fitness, the ejaculate is known to contain rapidly evolving seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) produced by specialized male secretory accessory glands. The evidence that rapid evolution of some SFPs is driven by PCSS, however, is indirect, based on either plastic responses to changes in the sexual selection environment or correlative macroevolutionary patterns. Moreover, such studies focus on SFPs that represent but a small component of the accessory gland proteome. Neither how SFPs function with other reproductive proteins, nor how PCSS influences the underlying secretory tissue adaptations and content of the accessory gland, has been addressed at the level of the proteome. Here we directly test the hypothesis that PCSS results in rapid evolution of the entire male accessory gland proteome and protein networks by taking a system-level approach, combining divergent experimental evolution of PCSS in Drosophila pseudoobscura (Dpse), high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and proteomic discovery, bioinformatics and population genetic analyses. We demonstrate that PCSS influences the abundance of over 200 accessory gland proteins, including SFPs. A small but significant number of these proteins display molecular signatures of positive selection. Divergent PCSS also results in fundamental and remarkably compartmentalized evolution of accessory gland protein networks in which males subjected to strong PCSS invest in protein networks that serve to increase protein production whereas males subjected to relaxed PCSS alters protein networks involved in protein surveillance and quality. These results directly demonstrate that PCSS is a key evolutionary driver that shapes not only individual reproductive proteins, but rewires entire reproductive protein networks.\\n\\nThe abbreviations used are",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses (HVs) have large genomes that can encode thousands of proteins. Apart from amino acid mutations, protein domain acquisitions, duplications and losses are also common modes of evolution. HV domain repertoires differ across species, and only a core set is shared among all viruses, aspect that raises a question: How have HV domain repertoires diverged while keeping some similarities? To answer such question, we used profile HMMs to search for domains in all possible translated ORFs of fully sequenced HV genomes. With at least 274 domains being identified, we built a matrix of domain counts per species, and applied a parsimony method to reconstruct the ancestral states of these domains along the HV phylogeny. It revealed events of domain gain, duplication and loss over more than 400 millions of years, where Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaherpesviruses expanded and condensed their domain repertoires at distinct rates. Most of the acquired domains perform  Modulation and Control,  Envelope or  Auxiliary functions, categories that showed high flexibility (number of domains) and redundancy (number of copies). Conversely, few gains and duplications were observed for domains involved in  Capsid assembly and structure, and  DNA Replication, recombination and metabolism. Among the 41 primordial domains encoded by herpesvirus ancestors, 28 are still found in all present-day HVs. Because of their distinct evolutionary strategies, herpesvirus domain repertoires are very specific at the subfamily, genus and species levels. Differences in domain composition may not just explain HV host range and tissue tropism, but also provide hints to the origins of herpesviruses.",

SIT can occur with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). However, most people with SIT do not have PCD, and the etiology of their condition remains poorly studied. Those without PCD may have an elevated rate of left-handedness, implying developmental mechanisms linking brain and body laterality. We sequenced the genomes of 15 people with SIT, of which six had PCD, and 15 controls. The SIT subjects with PCD all had likely recessive mutations in genes already known to cause PCD. Two non-PCD SIT cases also had recessive mutations in known PCD genes, suggesting reduced penetrance for PCD in some SIT cases. One non-PCD SIT case had a recessive mutation in PKD1L1, which has previously been linked to SIT without PCD. However, six of the nine non-PCD SIT cases, including most of the left-handers in this dataset, had no obvious candidate genes or significant pathways affected by the mutations that they carried.

Most of the Dzudzuana populations ancestry was deeply related to the post-glacial western European hunter-gatherers of the  Villabruna cluster3, but it also had ancestry from a lineage that had separated from the great majority of non-African populations before they separated from each other, proving that such  Basal Eurasians6,9 were present in West Eurasia twice as early as previously recorded5,6.

We finally show that the Dzudzuana population contributed the majority of the ancestry of post-Ice Age people in the Near East, North Africa, and even parts of Europe, thereby becoming the largest single contributor of ancestry of all present-day West Eurasians.",

The best modern proxies for the source populations for the admixture with proportions 0.78/0.22 are Lao people from Laos and Dravidian speakers from Kerala in India, while the South Asian population(s), with whom the incoming Southeast Asians intermixed, had a smaller proportion of West Eurasian component than contemporary proxies. Somewhat surprisingly Malaysian Peninsular tribes rather than the geographically closer Austroasiatic languages speakers like Vietnamese and Cambodians show highest sharing of IBD segments with the Munda. In addition, we affirmed that the grouping of the Munda speakers into North and South Munda based on linguistics is in concordance with genome-wide data.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that heat shock stress may increase transcription levels and, in some cases, also the transposition of certain transposable elements (TEs) in Drosophila and other organisms. Other studies have also demonstrated that heat shock chaperones as Hsp90 and Hop are involved in repressing transposons activity in Drosophila melanogaster by their involvement in crucial steps of the biogenesis of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), the largest class of germline-enriched small non-coding RNA implicated in the epigenetic silencing of TEs. However, a satisfying picture of how many chaperones and their respective functional roles could be involved in repressing transposons in germ cell is still unknown. Here we show that in Drosophila heat shock activates transposon's expression at post-transcriptional level by disrupting a repressive chaperone complex by a decisive role of the stress-inducible chaperone Hsp70. We found that stress-induced transposons activation is triggered by an interaction of Hsp70 with the Hsc70-Hsp90 complex and other factors all involved in piRNA biogenesis in both ovaries and testes. Such interaction induces a displacement of all such factors to the lysosomes resulting in a functional collapse of piRNA biogenesis. In support of a significant role of Hsp70 in transposon activation after stress, we found that the expression under normal conditions of Hsp70 in transgenic flies increases the amount of transposon transcripts and displaces the components of chaperon machinery outside the nuage as observed after heat shock. So that, our results demonstrate that heat shock stress is capable to increase the expression of transposons at post-transcriptional level by affecting piRNA biogenesis through the action of the inducible chaperone Hsp70. We think that such mechanism proposes relevant evolutionary implications. In presence of drastic environmental changes, Hsp70 plays a key dual role in increasing both the survival probability of individuals and the genetic variability in their germ cells. This in turn should be translated into an increase of genetic variability inside the populations thus potentiating their evolutionary plasticity and evolvability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSilene vulgaris (bladder campion) is a gynodioecious species existing as two genders - male-sterile females and hermaphrodites. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is generally encoded by mitochondrial genes, which interact with nuclear fertility restorer genes. Mitochondrial genomes of this species vary in DNA sequence, gene order and gene content. Multiple CMS genes are expected to exist in S. vulgaris, but little is known about their molecular identity.\\n\\nResultsWe assembled the complete mitochondrial genome from the haplotype KRA of S. vulgaris. It consists of five chromosomes, two of which recombine with each other. Two small non-recombining chromosomes exist in linear, supercoiled and relaxed circle forms. We compared the mitochondrial transcriptomes from females and hermaphrodites and confirmed the differentially expressed chimeric gene bobt as the strongest CMS candidate gene in S. vulgaris KRA. The chimeric gene bobt is co-transcribed with the Cytochrome b (cob) gene in some genomic configurations. The co-transcription of a CMS factor with an essential gene may constrain transcription inhibition as a mechanism for fertility restoration because of the need to maintain appropriate production of the necessary protein. Homologous recombination places the gene cob outside the control of bobt, which allows for the suppression the CMS gene by the fertility restorer genes. In addition, by analyzing RNA editing, we found the loss of three editing sites in the KRA mitochondrial genome and identified four sites with highly distinct editing rates between KRA and another S. vulgaris haplotypes (KOV). Three of these highly differentially edited sites were located in the transport membrane protein B (mttB) gene. They resulted in differences in MttB protein sequences between haplotypes despite completely identical gene sequences.\\n\\nConclusionsFrequent homologous recombination events that are widespread in plant mitochondrial genomes may change chromosomal configurations and also the control of gene transcription including CMS gene expression. Posttranscriptional processes, e.g RNA editing shall be evaluated in evolutionary and co-evolutionary studies of mitochondrial genes, because they may change protein composition despite the sequence identity of the respective genes. The investigation of natural populations of wild species such as S. vulgaris are necessary to reveal important aspects of CMS missed in domesticated crops, the traditional focus of the CMS studies.",

Within mountainous watersheds, microbial communities impact water chemistry and element fluxes as water from precipitation events discharges through soils and underlying weathered rock, yet there is limited information regarding the structure and function of these communities. Within the East River, CO watershed, we conducted a depth-resolved, hillslope to riparian zone transect study to identify factors that control how microorganisms are distributed and their functions. Metagenomic and geochemical analyses indicate that distance from the East River and proximity to groundwater and underlying weathered shale strongly impact microbial community structure and metabolic potential. Riparian zone microbial communities are compositionally distinct from all hillslope communities. Bacteria from phyla lacking isolated representatives consistently increase in abundance with increasing depth, but only in the riparian zone saturated sediments did we find Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria. Riparian zone microbial communities are functionally differentiated from hillslope communities based on their capacities for carbon and nitrogen fixation and sulfate reduction. Selenium reduction is prominent at depth in weathered shale and saturated riparian zone sediments. We anticipate that the drivers of community composition and metabolic potential identified throughout the studied transect will predict patterns across the larger watershed hillslope system.",

Hopanoid biosynthesis genes are conserved in nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts, and we previously found that the extended (C35) class of hopanoids in Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens are required for efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the tropical legume host Aeschynomene afraspera. Here we demonstrate that the nitrogen fixation defect conferred by extended loss can fully be explained by a reduction in root nodule sizes rather than per-bacteroid nitrogen fixation levels. Using a single-nodule tracking approach to track A. afraspera nodule development, we provide a quantitative model of root nodule development in this host, uncovering both the baseline growth parameters for wild-type nodules and a surprising heterogeneity of extended hopanoid mutant developmental phenotypes. These phenotypes include a delay in root nodule initiation and presence of a subpopulation of nodules with slow growth rates and low final volumes, which are correlated with reduced motility and surface attachment in vitro and lower bacteroid densities in planta, respectively. This work provides a quantitative reference point for understanding the phenotypic diversity of ineffective symbionts in A. afraspera and identifies specific developmental stages affected by extended hopanoid loss for future mechanistic work.",

Our findings indicated that aBL at 405 nm preferentially inactivated antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae over the vaginal epithelial cells. Furthermore, no genotoxicity of aBL to the vaginal epithelial cells was observed at the exposure for inactivating N. gonorrhoeae. aBL also effectively inactivated N. gonorrhoeae that had invaded into the vaginal epithelial cells. No gonococcal resistance to aBL developed after 15 successive cycles of sub-therapeutic inactivation. Endogenous aBL-active photosensitizing chromophores (porphyrins and flavins) in N. gonorrhoeae were identified and quantified using ultra performance liquid chromatography, with coproporphyrin being the most abundant endogenous porphyrin species.

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) contain a nonphotosynthetic plastid organelle called the apicoplast, which houses essential metabolic pathways and is required throughout the parasite life cycle. Hundreds of proteins are imported across 4 membranes into the apicoplast to support its function and biogenesis. The machinery that mediates this import process is distinct from proteins in the human host and may serve as ideal drug targets. However, a significant concern is whether inhibition of apicoplast protein import will result in a \\\"delayed-death\\\" phenotype that limits clinical use, as observed for inhibitors of apicoplast housekeeping pathways. To assess the growth inhibition kinetics of disrupting apicoplast protein import, we targeted a murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR) domain, which is stabilized by the compound WR99210, to the apicoplast to enable inducible blocking of apicoplast-localized protein translocons. We show that stabilization of this apicoplast-targeted mDHFR disrupts parasite growth within a single lytic cycle in an apicoplast-specific manner. Consistent with inhibition of apicoplast protein import, stabilization of this fusion protein disrupted transit peptide processing of endogenous apicoplast proteins and caused defects in apicoplast biogenesis. These results indicate that disruption of apicoplast protein import avoids delayed-death growth inhibition and that target-based approaches to develop inhibitors of import machinery may yield viable next-generation antimalarials.\\n\\nImportanceMalaria is a major cause of global childhood mortality. To sustain progress in disease control made in the last decade, new antimalarial therapies are needed to combat emerging drug resistance. Malaria parasites contain a relict chloroplast called the apicoplast, which harbors new targets for drug discovery, including import machinery that transports hundreds of critical proteins into the apicoplast. Unfortunately, some drugs targeting apicoplast pathways show delayed growth inhibition, which results in a slow onset-of-action that precludes their use as fast-acting, frontline therapies. We used a chemical biology approach to disrupt apicoplast protein import and showed that chemical disruption of this pathway avoids delayed growth inhibition. Our finding indicates that prioritization of proteins involved in apicoplast protein import for target-based drug discovery efforts may aid in the development of novel fast-acting antimalarials.",

In mammals, it has an invariant component, responsible for establishing a mutualistic relationship with the host. It also contains a dynamic fraction which facilitates adaptation in response to changes in the environment. These features have been well described in mammals, but little is known about microbiota stability or plasticity in insects. We assessed changes in microbiota composition and structure in a reared insect after a change in rearing conditions. We reared Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera, Tenebrioninae) larvae for five days in soil samples from two river banks and analyzed their gut microbial communities by a metabarcoding technique, using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the housekeeping gene gyrB. We found that soil-reared insects had a significantly more diverse microbiota than the control insects and that insects reared in soil from different sites had significantly different microbiota. We confirmed this trend by absolute quantification of the two mains fluctuating taxonomic groups: the Enterobacteriaceae family and the Pseudomonas genus, dominant in the soil-reared insects and in the control insects, respectively. Our results suggest the existence of a resident microbiota in T. molitor gut, but indicate that rearing changes can induce rapid and profound changes in the relative abundance of some of the members of this resident microbiota.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can have tissue-specific expression and functions; they can originate from dedicated miRNA genes, from non-canonical miRNA genes, or from mirror-miRNA genes and can also experience post-transcriptional variations. It remains unclear, however, which mechanisms of miRNA production or modification are tissue-specific and the extent of their evolutionary conservation. To address these issues, we developed the software Prost! (PRocessing Of Short Transcripts), which, among other features, allows accurate quantification of mature miRNAs, takes into account post-transcriptional processing, such as nucleotide editing, and helps identify mirror-miRNAs. Here, we applied Prost! to annotate and analyze miRNAs in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a model fish for evolutionary biology reported to have a miRNome larger than most teleost fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a distantly related teleost with a well-known miRNome, served as comparator. Despite reports suggesting that stickleback had a large miRNome, results showed that stickleback has 277 evolutionary-conserved mir genes and 366 unique mature miRNAs (excluding mir430 gene replicates and the vaultRNA-derived mir733), similar to zebrafish. In addition, small RNA sequencing data from brain, heart, testis, and ovary in both stickleback and zebrafish identified suites of mature miRNAs that display organ-specific enrichment, which is, for many miRNAs, evolutionarily-conserved. These data also supported the hypothesis that evolutionarily-conserved, organ-specific mechanisms regulate miRNA post-transcriptional variations. In both stickleback and zebrafish, miR2188-5p was edited frequently with similar nucleotide editing patterns in the seed sequence in various tissues, and the editing rate was organ-specific with higher editing in the brain. In summary, Prost! is a critical new tool to identify and understand small RNAs and can help clarify a species miRNA biology, as shown here for an important fish model for the evolution of developmental mechanisms, and can provide insight into organ-specific expression and evolutionary-conserved miRNA post-transcriptional mechanisms.",

To overcome these limitations, it is important to develop efficient and simple screening assays for hyperactive transposases.\\n\\nResultsTo widen the range of transposase expression normally accessible with inducible promoters, we have constructed a set of vectors based on constitutive promoters of different strengths. We characterized and validated our expression vectors with Hsmar1, a member of the mariner transposon family. We observed the highest rate of transposition with the weakest promoters. We went on to investigate the effects of mutations in the Hsmar1 transposase dimer interface and of covalently linking two transposase monomers in a single-chain dimer.

During four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, participants performed a battery of 26 diverse tasks comprising 47 unique conditions. Using the data from this multi-domain task battery, we derived a comprehensive functional parcellation of the cerebellar cortex, and evaluated it by predicting functional boundaries in a novel set of tasks. The new parcellation successfully identified distinct functional sub-regions, providing significant improvements over existing parcellations derived from task-free data. Lobular boundaries, commonly used to summarize functional data, did not coincide with functional subdivisions.

    "abstract": "In land plants and algae, the Calvin-Benson (CB) cycle takes place in the chloroplast, a specialized organelle in which photosynthesis occurs. Thioredoxins (TRXs) are small ubiquitous proteins, known to harmonize the two stages of photosynthesis through a thiol-based mechanism. Among the 11 enzymes of the CB cycle, the TRX target phosphoribulokinase (PRK) has yet to be characterized at the atomic scale. To accomplish this goal, we determined the crystal structures of PRK from two model species: the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrPRK) and the land plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPRK). PRK is an elongated homodimer characterized by a large central {beta}-sheet of 18 strands, extending between two catalytic sites positioned at its edges. The electrostatic surface potential of the catalytic cavity has both a positive region suitable for binding the phosphate groups of substrates and an exposed negative region to attract positively charged TRX-f. In the catalytic cavity, the regulatory cysteines are 13 [A] apart and connected by a flexible region exclusive to photosynthetic eukaryotes--the clamp loop--which is believed to be essential for oxidation-induced structural rearrangements. Structural comparisons with prokaryotic and evolutionarily older PRKs revealed that both AtPRK and CrPRK have a strongly reduced dimer interface and increased number of random coiled regions, suggesting that a general loss in structural rigidity correlates with gains in TRX sensitivity during the molecular evolution of PRKs in eukaryotes.\n\nSignificance StatementIn chloroplasts, five enzymes of the Calvin-Benson (CB) cycle are regulated by thioredoxins (TRXs). These enzymes have all been structurally characterized with the notable exception of phosphoribulokinase (PRK). Here, we determined the crystal structure of chloroplast PRK from two model photosynthetic organisms. Regulatory cysteines appear distant from each other and are linked by a long loop that is present only in plant-type PRKs and allows disulfide bond formation and subsequent conformational rearrangements. Structural comparisons with ancient PRKs indicate that the presence of flexible regions close to regulatory cysteines is a unique feature that is shared by TRX-dependent CB cycle enzymes, suggesting that the evolution of the PRK structure has resulted in a global increase in protein flexibility for photosynthetic eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular tools adapted from bacterial CRISPR (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems for adaptive immunity have become widely used for plant genome engineering, both to investigate gene functions and to engineer desirable traits. A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called  off-targets by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that  high-fidelity variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants. We present these molecular tools as standardised DNA parts to facilitate their re-use.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a mechanism by which cells permanently withdraw from the cell cycle in response to stresses including telomere shortening, DNA damage, or oncogenic signaling. Senescent cells contribute to both age-related degeneration and hyperplastic pathologies, including cancer. In culture, normal human epithelial cells enter senescence after a limited number of cell divisions, known as replicative senescence. Here, to investigate how metabolic pathways regulate replicative senescence, we used LC-MS-based metabolomics to analyze senescent primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). We did not observe significant changes in glucose uptake or lactate secretion in senescent HMECs. However, analysis of intracellular metabolite pool sizes indicated that senescent cells exhibit depletion of metabolites from nucleotide synthesis pathways. Furthermore, stable isotope tracing with 13C-labeled glucose or glutamine revealed a dramatic blockage of flux of these two metabolites into nucleotide synthesis pathways in senescent HMECs. To test whether cellular immortalization would reverse these observations, we expressed telomerase in HMECs. In addition to preventing senescence, telomerase expression maintained metabolic flux from glucose into nucleotide synthesis pathways. Finally, we investigated whether inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in proliferating HMECs is sufficient to induce senescence. In proliferating HMECs, both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2), a rate-limiting enzyme in dNTP synthesis, induced premature senescence with concomitantly decreased metabolic flux from glucose into nucleotide synthesis. Taken together, our results suggest that nucleotide synthesis inhibition plays a causative role in the establishment of replicative senescence in HMECs.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1 refers to the set of complex neurological disorders characterized by repetitive behaviour. The reported occurrence of abnormal gut bacteria, along with prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in ASD indicate its strong correlation with the gut microflora. Our study aims to understand the role of diet and gut bacteria in ASD via an integrated constraint-based and PBPK model. Genome scale models of five major gut bacteria, which were reported to be associated with ASD, were integrated with the human host, i.e., the combined small intestinal enterocyte and neuronal brain model. Simultaneously, a permeability-limited two sub compartment PBPK model was developed to determine the distribution of bacteria-derived toxins in the body. The important results include, (i) inclusion of probiotics into the diet of autistic case restores gut balance, majorly seen as a result of reduced oxidative stress in the brain and the gut, (ii) microbiome and diet together mediate host metabolism in autism, majorly via the nucleotide, central carbon, amino acid, and reactive oxygen species metabolisms, and (iii) gut bacterial-specific secretions contribute to autistic metabotype. Thus, the presented integrated model is the first ever quantitative model, providing a mechanistic basis for autism pathogenesis, capturing known biomarkers, as well as, highlighting the potential of novel dietary modifications in alleviating the symptoms of autism.",

Here, we present an approach that couples ex vivo high-throughput screenings of cancer biopsies using microfluidics with logic-based modeling to generate patient-specific dynamic models of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. We used the resulting models to investigate heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer patients, showing dissimilarities especially in the PI3K-Akt pathway. Variation in model parameters reflected well the different tumor stages. Finally, we used our dynamic models to efficaciously predict new personalized combinatorial treatments.

The quantity of endosymbionts within the gill-bacteriocytes appears to vary according to the hosts environment. We investigated the hypothesis of a control of the endosymbionts density by apoptosis, a programmed cell death. We used fluorometric TUNEL-method and active Caspase-3-targeting antibodies to visualize and quantify apoptotic cells in mussel gills. To avoid artefacts due to depressurization upon specimen recovery from the deep-sea, we compared the apoptotic rates between mussels recovered unpressurised, versus mussels recovered in a pressure-maintaining device, in two species from hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge: Bathymodiolus azoricus and B. puteoserpentis. Our results show that pressurized recovery had no significant effect on the apoptotic rate in the gill filaments. Apoptotic levels were highest in the ciliated zone and in the circulating hemocytes, compared to the bacteriocyte zone. Apoptotic gill-cells in B. aff. boomerang from the pockmarks off the Gulf of Guinea, show similar distribution patterns. Deep-sea symbiotic mussels have much higher rates of apoptosis in their gills than the coastal mussel Mytilus edulis without chemolithoautotrophic symbionts. We discuss how apoptosis might be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of deep-sea mussels to toxic environments and/or to symbiosis.",

Here, we illustrate how metaecology - the study of spatial interdependencies among ecological systems through fluxes of organisms, energy, and matter - can enhance understanding and improve managing environmental change at multiple spatial scales. We present several case studies illustrating how the framework has leveraged decision-making in conservation, restoration and risk management. Nevertheless, an explicit incorporation of metaecology is still uncommon in the applied ecology literature, and in action guidelines addressing environmental change. This is unfortunate because the many facets of environmental change can be framed as modifying spatial context, connectedness and dominant regulating processes - the defining features of metaecological systems. Narrowing the gap between theory and practice will require incorporating system-specific realism in otherwise predominantly conceptual studies, as well as deliberately studying scenarios of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "We model the evolutionary epidemiology of spore-producing plant pathogens in heterogeneous environments sown with several cultivars carrying quantitative resistances. The model explicitly tracks the infection-age structure and genetic composition of the pathogen population. Each strain is characterized by pathogenicity traits describing its infection efficiency and a time-varying sporulation curve taking into account lesion ageing. We first derive a general expression of the basic reproduction number [R]0 for fungal pathogens in heterogeneous environments. We show that evolutionary attractors of the model coincide with local maxima of [R]0 only if the infection efficiency is the same on all host types. We then study how three basic resistance characteristics (pathogenicity trait targeted, resistance effectiveness, and adaptation cost) in interaction with the deployment strategy (proportion of fields sown with a resistant cultivar) (i) lead to pathogen diversification at equilibrium and (ii) shape the transient dynamics from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives. We show that quantitative resistance impacting only the sporulation curve will always lead to a monomorphic population, while dimorphism (i.e. pathogen diversification) can occur with resistance altering infection efficiency, notably with high adaptation cost and proportion of R cultivar. Accordingly, the choice of quantitative resistance genes operated by plant breeders is a driver of pathogen diversification. From an evolutionary perspective, the emergence time of the evolutionary attractor best adapted to the R cultivar tends to be shorter when the resistance impacts infection efficiency than when it impacts sporulation. In contrast, from an epidemiological perspective, the epidemiological control is always higher when the resistance impacts infection efficiency. This highlights the difficulty of defining deployment strategies of quantitative resistance maximising at the same time epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes.",

We found that the inferior olive encodes contexts of sensory-associated external cues in a graded manner, apparent in the presynaptic activity of their axonal projections in the cerebellar cortex. Further, individual climbing fibers were broadly responsive to different sensory modalities but relayed sensory-related information to the cortex in a lobule-dependent manner. Purkinje cell dendrites faithfully transformed this climbing fiber activity into dendrite-wide Ca2+ signals without a direct contribution from the mossy fiber pathway. These results demonstrate that the size of climbing fiber-evoked Ca2+ signals in Purkinje cell dendrites is largely determined by the firing level of climbing fibers. This coding scheme emphasizes the overwhelming role of the inferior olive in generating salient signals useful for instructing plasticity and learning.",

Multivariate pattern analyses of fMRI data revealed differentiable neural signatures for these processes, which we also replicated in an independent sample of older adults.

To facilitate the protection of bioprocesses, we explored the basis for the susceptibility of CHO cells, the most commonly used cell line in biomanufacturing, to RNA virus infection. Upon infection with certain ssRNA and dsRNA viruses, CHO cells fail to generate a significant interferon (IFN) response. Nonetheless, the downstream machinery for generating IFN responses and its antiviral activity is intact in these cells: treatment of cells with exogenously-added type I IFN or poly I:C prior to infection limited the cytopathic effect from Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and Reovirus-3 virus (Reo-3) in a STAT1-dependent manner. To harness the intrinsic antiviral mechanism, we used RNA-Seq to identify two upstream repressors of STAT1: Gfi1 and Trim24. By knocking out these genes, the engineered CHO cells exhibited increased resistance to the prototype RNA viruses tested. Thus, omics-guided engineering of mammalian cell culture can be deployed to increase safety in biotherapeutic protein production among many other biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "During craniofacial development, cranial neural crest (CNC) cells migrate into the developing face and form bone through intramembranous ossification. Loss of JAGGED1 (JAG1) signaling in the CNC cells is associated with maxillary hypoplasia or maxillary bone deficiency (MBD) in mice and recapitulates the MBD seen in humans with Alagille syndrome. JAGGED1, a membrane-bound NOTCH ligand, is required for normal craniofacial development, and Jagged1 mutations in humans are known to cause Alagille Syndrome, which is associated with cardiac, biliary, and bone phenotypes and these children experience increased bony fractures. Previously, we demonstrated deficient maxillary osteogenesis in Wnt1-cre;Jagged1f/f (Jag1CKO) mice by conditional deletion of Jagged1 in maxillary CNC cells. In this study, we investigated the JAG1 signaling pathways in a CNC cell line. Treatment with JAG1 induced osteoblast differentiation and maturation markers, Runx2 and Ocn, respectively, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) production, as well as classic NOTCH1 targets, Hes1 and Hey1. While JAG1-induced Hes1 and Hey1 expression levels were predictably decreased after DAPT (NOTCH inhibitor) treatment, JAG1-induced Runx2 and Ocn levels were surprisingly constant in the presence of DAPT, indicating that JAG1 effects in the CNC cells are independent of the canonical NOTCH pathway. JAG1 treatment of CNC cells increased Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) phosphorylation, which was refractory to DAPT treatment, highlighting the importance of the non-canonical NOTCH pathway during CNC cells osteoblast commitment. Pharmacologic inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation, with and without DAPT treatment, upon JAG1 induction reduced ALP production and, Runx2 and Ocn gene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that JAK2 is an essential component downstream of a non-canonical JAG1-NOTCH1 pathway through which JAG1 stimulates expression of osteoblast-specific gene targets in CNC cells that contribute to osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization.",

We establish that the olfactory system of Apis dorsata, an Asian species of honeybee as an equivalent model to Apis mellifera to study physiology underlying learning and memory. We created an Atlas of the antennal lobe and counted the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobe of Apis dorsata to be around 165 which is similar to the number in the other honey bee species Apis mellifera and Apis florea. Apis dorsata was found to have five antenno-cerebral tracts namely mACT, lACT and 3 mlACTS which appear identical to Apis mellifera. Intracellular recording showed that the antennal lobe interneurons exhibit temporally patterned odor-cell specific responses. The neuritis of Kenyon cells with cell bodies located in a neighborhood in calyx retain their relative neighborhoods in the peduncle and alpha lobe forming a columnar organization in the mushroom body. Alpha lobe and the calyx of the mushroom body were innervated by extrinsic neurons with cell bodies in the lateral protocerebrum. A set of GABA positive cells in the lateral protocerebrum send their neurites towards alpha-lobe. Apis dorsata was amenable to olfactory conditioning and showed good learning and memory retention at 24 hours. They were amenable to massed and spaced conditioning and could distinguish trained odor from an untrained novel odor.",

    "abstract": "Soil erosion has been widely measured using different approaches based on models, direct runoff and sediment collections. However, most of the methods are, poorly applied due to the cost, the accuracy and their tedious nature. This study aimed to develop and test a new method for runoff characterization, which may be more applicable and adaptable to different situations of soil and crop management. An experiment was carried out on runoff plots under different cropping systems (sole maize, sole soybean and maize intercropped with soybean) and soil amendments (NPK, Biochar, NPK + Biochar and Control) in the Semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana. The study was a two-factor experiment (split-plot) in which cropping systems constituted the main plot whereas soil management the subplot. To assess the quality of the method, different statistical parameters were used: p-values, coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square (RMSE) and, root square ratio (RSR). The NPK + Biochar under each cropping system reduced surface runoff than all other treatments. At p < 0.001, R2 ranged from 0.88 to 0.94 which showed good accuracy of the method developed. The dispersion between the predicted and observed values was low with RMSE varying from 1.68 to 2.66 mm which was less than 10 % of the general mean of the runoff. Moreover, the low variability between parameters was confirmed by the low values of RSR ranging from 0.38 to 0.46 (with 0.00 [&le;] RSR [&le;] 0.50 for perfect prediction). NSE values varied from 0.79 to 0.86 ([&ge;]0.75 being the threshold for excellent prediction). Though the sensitivity analysis showed that the method under high amount of runoff (especially on bare plots) was poorly adapted, the dimensions of runoff plots could be based on runoff coefficient of the region by analyzing the possible limits of an individual rainfall amount of the site. The findings provide alternative approach for monitoring soil degradation.",

    "abstract": "The bitter gourd fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. momordicae (FOM) was a devastating disease in China and leading to great economic losses every year. A total of 152 isolates, which have the typical Fusarium oxysporum characteristics with abundant microconidia and macroconidia on the white or ruby colonies, were obtained from diseased plant tissues with typical fusarium wilt symptoms. The BLASTn analysis of rDNA-ITS showed 99% identity with F.oxysporum species. Among the tested isolates, three isolates infected tower gourd, and five isolates were pathogenic to bottle gourd. However, they were all pathogenic to bitter gourd. Based on the molecular and morphologic results, the isolates were identified as FOM. For genetic variation analysis, forty ISSR primers were screened and eleven primers were used in PCR amplification. Totally, 121 loci were detected, of which 52 loci were polymorphic at rate of 42.98%. The POPGENE analysis showed that Neis gene diversity index (H) and Shannons information index (I) were 0.0902 and 0.1478, respectively, which indicated that the genetic diversity for the tested 152 isolates was relatively low. It also means that each geographical population was a relatively independent unit. While the value of coefficient of gene differentiation (Gst=0.4929 > 0.15) pointed to the genetic differentiation was mainly among populations. The strength of gene flow (Nm=0.5143<1.0) was weaker, indicating that gene exchanges were blocked to some degree. The dendrogram based on ISSR markers showed that the eight geographical populations were clustered into four groups at the threshold of genetic similar coefficient 0.96. Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong populations were clustered into Group I. Group II contained Hunan and Guangxi populations. Group III only had Hainan population. Group IV consisted Shandong and Henan populations. The geographical populations closer to each other grouped together, suggesting a correlationship between geographical origin and genetic differentiation. Two hybridization events were observed between Hainan and Hunan populations and between Guangdong and Guangxi by Structure analysis. Our findings enrich the knowledge on genetic variation characteristics of the FOM populations with helpful of development of effective disease management programs and disease resistance breeding.",

    "abstract": "Pandemics of vector-borne human and plant pathogens often rely on the behaviors of their arthropod vectors. Arboviruses, including many bunyaviruses, manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission to vertebrates, birds, insects, and plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation remains elusive. Here, we report that the non-structural protein NSs of orthotospovirus (order Bunyavirales, family Tospoviridae), is a key viral factor that indirectly modifies vector preference and increases vector performance. NSs suppresses the biosynthesis of volatile monoterpenes, which serve as repellents of the vector Western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis) instead of using its known silencing suppressor activity. NSs directly interacts with and relocalizes the jasmonate (JA) signaling master regulator MYC2 and its two close homologs, MYC3 and MYC4, to disable JA-mediated activation of terpene synthase genes. The dysfunction of the MYCs subsequently attenuates host defenses, increases the attraction of thrips, and improves thrips fitness. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which a bunyavirus manipulates vector behaviors and therefore facilitate disease transmission. Our results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which tospoviruses NSs counteracts host immunity for pathogen transmission.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMost bunyaviruses are transmitted by insect vectors, and some of them can modify the behaviors of their arthropod vectors to increase transmission to mammals, birds, and plants. NSs is a non-structural bunyavirus protein with multiple functions that acts as an avirulence determinant and silencing suppressor. In this study, we identified a new function of NSs as a manipulator of vector behavior, independent of its silencing suppressor activity. NSs manipulates jasmonate-mediated immunity against thrips by directly interacting with several homologs of MYC transcription factors, the core regulators of the jasmonate-signaling pathway. This hijacking by NSs enhances thrips preference and performance. Many human- and animal-infecting members of the Bunyaviridales also encode NSs and could manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that the NSs protein may play conserved roles among various members of the Bunyaviridales in the modification of vector feeding behavior that evolved as a mechanism to enhance virus transmission.",

    "abstract": "In the natural environment, animals often encounter multiple sensory cues that are simultaneously present. The nervous system integrates the relevant sensory information to generate behavioral responses that have adaptive values. However, the signal transduction pathways and the molecules that regulate integrated behavioral response to multiple sensory cues are not well defined. Here, we characterize a collective modulatory basis for a behavioral decision in C. elegans when the animal is presented with an attractive food source together with a repulsive odorant. We show that distributed neuronal components in the worm nervous system and several neuromodulators orchestrate the decision-making process, suggesting that various states and contexts may modulate the multisensory integration. Among these modulators, we identify a new function of a conserved TGF-{beta} pathway that regulates the integrated decision by inhibiting the signaling from a set of central neurons. Interestingly, we find that a common set of modulators, including the TGF-{beta} pathway, regulate the integrated response to the pairing of different foods and repellents. Together, our results provide insights into the modulatory signals regulating multisensory integration and reveal potential mechanistic basis for the complex pathology underlying defects in multisensory processing shared by common neurological diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe present study characterizes the modulation of a behavioral decision in C. elegans when the worm is presented with a food lawn that is paired with a repulsive smell. We show that multiple sensory neurons and interneurons play roles in making the decision. We also identify several modulatory molecules that are essential for the integrated decision when the animal faces a choice between the cues of opposing valence. We further show that many of these factors, which often represent different states and contexts, are common for behavioral decisions that integrate sensory information from different types of foods and repellents. Overall, our results reveal a collective molecular and cellular basis for integration of simultaneously present attractive and repulsive cues to fine-tune decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The midbrain superior colliculus (SC) generates a rapid saccadic eye movement to a sensory stimulus by recruiting a population of cells in its topographically organized motor map. Supra-threshold electrical microstimulation in the SC reveals that the site of stimulation produces a normometric saccade vector with little effect of the stimulation parameters. Moreover, electrically evoked saccades (E-saccades) have kinematic properties that strongly resemble natural, visual-evoked saccades (V-saccades). These findings support models in which the saccade vector is determined by a center-of-gravity computation of activated neurons, while its trajectory and kinematics arise from downstream feedback circuits in the brainstem. Recent single-unit recordings, however, have indicated that the SC population also specifies instantaneous kinematics. These results support an alternative model, in which the desired saccade trajectory, including its kinematics, follows from instantaneous summation of movement effects of all SC spike trains. But how to reconcile this model with microstimulation results? Although it is thought that microstimulation activates a large population of SC neurons, the mechanism through which it arises is unknown. We developed a spiking neural network model of the SC, in which microstimulation directly activates a relatively small set of neurons around the electrode tip, which subsequently sets up a large population response through lateral synaptic interactions. We show that through this mechanism the population drives an E-saccade with near-normal kinematics that are largely independent of the stimulation parameters. Only at very low stimulus intensities the network recruits a population with low firing rates, resulting in abnormally slow saccades.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe midbrain Superior Colliculus (SC) contains a topographically organized map for rapid goal-directed gaze shifts, in which the location of the active population determines size and direction of the eye-movement vector, and the neural firing rates specify the eye-movement kinematics. Electrical microstimulation in this map produces eye movements that correspond to the site of stimulation with normal kinematics. We here explain how intrinsic lateral interactions within the SC network of spiking neurons sets up the population activity profile in response to local microstimulation to explain these results.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) shuttle from the cytoplasm (cy) to the nucleus (nu) when bound with glucocorticoids (i.e. GR internalization) and alter transcriptional activity. GR activation within the fear circuit has been implicated in fear memory and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no study to date has characterized GR internalization within the fear circuit during fear memory formation or examined how traumatic stress impacts this process. To address this, we assayed cy and nu GR levels at baseline and after auditory fear conditioning (FC) in the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of PTSD. Cy and nu GRs within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus (dHipp), ventral hippocampus (vHipp), and amygdala (AMY) were assayed using western blot. The distribution of GR in the cy and nu (at baseline and after FC) was varied across individual nodes of the fear circuit. At baseline, SPS enhanced cyGRs in the dHipp, but decreased cyGRs in the AMY. FC only enhanced GR internalization in the AMY and this effect was attenuated by SPS exposure. SPS also decreased cyGRs in the dHipp after FC. The results of this study suggests that GR internalization is varied across the fear circuit, which in turn suggests GR activation is selectively regulated within individual nodes of the fear circuit. The findings also suggest that changes in GR dynamics in the dHipp and AMY modulate the enhancing effect SPS has on fear memory persistence.",

    "abstract": "Remodeling of spatially heterogeneous arterial trees is routinely quantified on tissue sections by averaging linear dimensions, with lack of comparison between different organs and models. The impact of experimental models or hypertension treatment modalities on organ-specific vascular remodeling remains undefined. A wide variety of arterial remodeling types has been demonstrated for hypertensive models, which include differences across organs. The purpose of this study was to reassess methods for measurement of arterial remodeling and to establish a morphometric algorithm for standard and comparable quantification of vascular remodeling in hypertension in different vascular beds. We performed a novel and comprehensive morphometric analysis of terminal arteries in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, intestine, skin, skeletal muscle, and adrenal glands of control and Goldblatt hypertensive rats on routinely processed tissue sections. Mean dimensions were highly variable but grouping them into sequential 5 m intervals permitted creation of reliable linear regression equations and complex profiles. Averaged arterial dimensions demonstrated seven remodeling patterns that were distinct from conventional inward-outward and hypertrophic-eutrophic definitions. Numerical modeling predicted at least twenty variants of arterial spatial conformations. Recognition of remodeling variants was not possible using averaged dimensions, their ratios, or the remodeling and growth index. To distinguish remodeling patterns, a three-dimensional modeling was established and tested. The proposed algorithm permits quantitative analysis of arterial remodeling in different organs and may be applicable for comparative studies between animal hypertensive models and in human hypertension. Arterial wall tapering is the most important factor to consider in arterial morphometry, while perfusion fixation with vessel relaxation is not necessary. Terminal arteries in organs undergo the same remodeling pattern in Goldblatt rats, except for organs with hemodynamics affected by the arterial clip. The existing remodeling nomenclature should be replaced by a numerical classification applicable to any type of arterial remodeling.\\n\\nAuthor summaryArterial hypertension effects modern nations and is characterised by systemic hypertensive angiopathy that affects all organs. Arterial remodeling is a main factor to be analyzed in animal models and human. Despite abundant data, there is a significant lack of comparative analysis on arterial remodeling. The data from the present study have established a novel methodological approach to assess and compare arterial remodeling in hypertension. We have developed an effective algorithm for morphometry of intra-organ arteries to standardize remodeling assessment and allow comparisons between different hypertensive models, organs and species. Our study opens the possibility to assess remodeling using conventional widely used histological tissue sections with no need for special perfusion-fixation. The method will elucidate the improvement and development of animal models of hypertension, and enhance the assessment of experimental therapeutic modalities.",

    "abstract": "Proper regulation of inflammatory responses is critical for effective function of microglia, in both physiological and disease states. While the mechanisms that drive microglia activation are well characterized, the pathways leading to inflammatory resolution and immune homeostasis have yet to be fully elucidated. Using RNA interference, pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout mouse model approaches, we show that exosome release promotes immune homeostasis in activated and aged microglia. We demonstrate that induction of anti-inflammatory pathways enhances release of exosomes containing immune proteins and microRNAs. Functionally, inhibition of exosome release alters trafficking of exosome cargo, such as miR-155, in activated microglia resulting in increased cellular retention of these cargo molecules. Concordantly, we identify increased miR-155 activity leading to sustained activation of pro-inflammatory pathways as a potential mechanism underlying impaired inflammatory resolution due to inhibition of microglia exosome release. Similarly, inhibition of augmented exosome release in aged microglia exacerbates inflammatory activation, demonstrating conservation of the immune modulatory effects of exosome release in microglia. Taken together, our study identifies exosomes as novel components of an anti-inflammatory mechanism utilized by activated and aged microglia to restore immune homeostasis.",

We present a simple and reliable protocol for tissue clearing along with a quantitative assessment of the effect of tissue clearing upon morphology. Tissue clearing caused tissue swelling (compared to conventional methods), but this swelling was shown to be similar across spatial scales and the variation was within limits acceptable to the field.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychosis onset typically occurs in adolescence, and subclinical psychotic experiences peak in adolescence as well. Adolescence is also a time of critical neural and cognitive maturation. Using cross-sectional data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examine whether regional white matter (WM) development is disrupted in psychosis spectrum (PS) youth whether WM maturation mediates the relationship between age and cognition in typically developing (TD) and PS youth. A third group with intermediate symptom severity (limited PS [LPS]) was included in follow-up analyses to determine whether age-related disruptions in WM scaled with symptom severity.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined WM microstructure, as assessed via diffusion tensor imaging, in 707 individuals (aged 10-22 years; 499 TD, 171 PS, 37 LPS) by using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Multiple regressions were used to evaluate age x group interactions on regional WM indices. Mediation analyses were conducted using a bootstrapping approach.\\n\\nResultsThere were age x group interactions on fractional anisotropy (FA) in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and retrolenticular internal capsule (RLIC). SLF FA mediated the relationship between age and Complex Cognition in TD, but not PS. Further, inclusion of LPS youth showed that the relationship between age and SLF FA decreased with increasing symptom severity\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show aberrant age-related changes in SLF and RLIC FA in PS youth. SLF development supports emergence of specific higher-order cognitive functions in TD youth, but not in PS. Future mechanistic explanations for these relationships could facilitate development of earlier and refined targets for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCu/PCC) are key components of a midline network, activated during rest but also in tasks that involve construction of scene or situation models. Despite growing interest in PCu/PCC functional alterations in disease, the underlying neurochemical modulators of PCu/PCCs task-induced activity are largely unstudied. Here, a multimodal imaging approach was applied to investigate whether inter-individual differences in PCu/PCC fMRI activity, elicited during perceptual discrimination of scene stimuli, were correlated with local brain metabolite levels, measured during resting-state 1H-MRS. Forty healthy young adult participants (12 male) completed an fMRI perceptual odd-one-out task for scenes, objects and faces. 1H-MRS metabolites N-acetyl-aspartate (tNAA), glutamate (Glx) and {gamma}-amino-butyric acid (GABA+) were quantified via PRESS and MEGA-PRESS scans in a PCu/PCC voxel and an occipital (OCC) control voxel. Whole brain fMRI revealed a cluster in right dorsal PCu/PCC that showed a greater BOLD response to scenes versus faces and objects. When extracted from an independently defined PCu/PCC region of interest, scene activity (versus faces and objects and also versus baseline) was positively correlated with PCu/PCC, but not OCC, tNAA. A complementary fMRI analysis restricted to the PCu/PCC MRS voxel area identified a significant PCu/PCC cluster, confirming the positive correlation between scene-related BOLD activity and PCu/PCC tNAA. There were no correlations between PCu/PCC fMRI activity and Glx or GABA+ levels. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that scene activity in PCu/PCC is linked to local tNAA levels, identifying a neurochemical influence on inter-individual differences in the task-driven activity of a key brain hub.",

    "abstract": "Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that generates high-resolution volumetric images. This modality finds widespread usage in ophthalmology for the diagnosis and management of various ocular conditions. The volumes generated can contain 200 or more B-scans. Manual inspection of such large quantity of scans is time consuming and error prone in most clinical settings. Here, we present a method for the generation of visual summaries of SDOCT volumes, wherein a small set of B-scans that highlight the most clinically relevant features in a volume are extracted. The method was trained and evaluated on data acquired from age-related macular degeneration patients, and \\\"relevance\\\" was defined as the presence of visibly discernible structural abnormalities. The summarisation system consists of a detection module, where relevant B-scans are extracted from the volume, and a set of rules that determines which B-scans are included in the visual summary. Two deep learning approaches are presented and compared for the classification of B-scans - transfer learning and de novo learning. Both approaches performed comparably with AUCs of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, obtained on an independent test set. The de novo network, however, was 98% smaller than the transfer learning approach, and had a run-time that was also significantly shorter.",

    "abstract": "Many animals exhibit morning and evening peaks of locomotor behavior. In Drosophila, previous studies identified two corresponding circadian neural oscillators: M (morning) cells which exhixbit a morning neural activity peak, and E (evening) cells which exhibit a corresponding evening peak of activity. Yet we know little of how these distinct circadian oscillators produce specific outputs that regulate pre-motor circuits to precisely control behavioral episodes. Here we show that the Ring Neurons of the Ellipsoid Body (EB-RNs), a defined pre-motor center, display a spontaneous in vivo neural activity rhythm, with peaks in the morning and in the evening. The two EB-RN activity peaks coincide with the major bouts of locomotor activity and result from independent activation by M and E cells, respectively. Further, M and E cells regulate EB-RNs via two identified dopaminergic neurons PPM3-EB, which project to the EB and which are normally co-active with EB-RNs. Blocking the dopaminergic modulation onto EB-RNs prevents the daily two-peak pattern of neural activity in the EB-RN and greatly impairs circadian locomotor activity. These in vivo findings establish the fundamental elements of a circadian neuronal output pathway: distinct circadian oscillators independently drive a common pre-motor center through the agency of specific dopaminergic interneurons.",

    "abstract": "In many cases, axon growth and guidance are driven by pioneer axons, the first axons to grow in a particular region. Despite their dynamic pathfinding capabilities and developmental importance, there are very few pioneer neuron specific markers and thus their in vivo identification and functional interrogation have been difficult. We found that a Ret receptor isoform, Ret51, is highly enriched in peripheral sensory pioneer neurons and is required for pioneer axon outgrowth. Ret null mutant pioneer neurons differentiate normally; however, they displayed defects in growth cone morphology and formation of filopodia before pioneer axon extension prematurely halts. We also demonstrate loss-of-function of a retrograde cargo adaptor, JNK-interacting protein 3 (Jip3), phenocopied many of these axonal defects. We further found that loss of Jip3 led to accumulation of activated Ret receptor in pioneer growth cones, indicating a failure in the clearance of activated Ret from growth cones. Using an axon sever approach as well as in vivo analysis of axonal transport, we showed Jip3 specifically mediates retrograde, but not anterograde, transport of activated Ret51. Finally, live imaging revealed that Jip3 and Ret51 were retrogradely co-transported in pioneer axons, suggesting Jip3 functions as an adapter for retrograde transport of Ret51. Taken together, these results identify Ret51 as a molecular marker of pioneer neurons and elucidate an important isoform-specific role for Ret51 in axon growth and growth cone dynamics during development.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila larval neuromuscular system provides an ideal context in which to study synaptic partner choice, because it contains a small number of pre- and postsynaptic cells connected in an invariant pattern. The discovery of interactions between two subfamilies of IgSF cell surface proteins, the Dprs and the DIPs, provided new candidates for cellular labels controlling synaptic specificity. Here we show that DIP- is expressed by two identified motor neurons, while its binding partner Dpr10 is expressed by postsynaptic muscle targets. Removal of either DIP- or Dpr10 results in loss of specific axonal branches and NMJs formed by one motor neuron, MNISN-1s, while other branches of the MNISN-1s axon develop normally. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of dpr10 correlates with muscle innervation by MNISN-1s during embryonic development. We propose a model whereby DIP- and Dpr10 on opposing synaptic partners interact with each other to generate proper motor neuron connectivity.",
