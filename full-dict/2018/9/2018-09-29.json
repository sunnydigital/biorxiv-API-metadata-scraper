    "abstract": "The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) provides a framework to predict how habitat modifications related to the distribution of resources over patches should impact the realized fitness of individuals and their optimal rate of movement (or patch residence times) across the habitat. Most MVT theory has focused on the consequences of changing the shape of the gain functions in some patches, describing for instance patch enrichment. However an alternative form of habitat modification is habitat conversion, whereby patches are converted from one existing type to another (e.g. closed habitat to open habitat). In such a case the set of gain functions existing in the habitat does not change, only their relative frequencies does. This has received comparatively very little attention in the context of the MVT. Here we analyze mathematically the consequences of habitat conversion under the MVT. We study how realized fitness and the average rate of movement should respond to changes in the frequency distribution of patch-types, and how they should covary. We further compare the response of optimal and non-plastic foragers. We find that the initial pattern of patch-exploitation in a habitat, characterized by the regression slope of patch yields over residence times, can help predict the qualitative responses of fitness and movement rate following habitat conversion. We also find that for some habitat conversion patterns, optimal and non-plastic foragers exhibit qualitatively different responses, and that adaptive foragers can have opposite responses in the early and late phases following habitat conversion. We suggest taking into account behavioral responses may help better understand the ecological consequences of habitat conversion.",

    "abstract": "The pupil aperture of the iris is subject to refraction by the cornea, and thus an outside observer sees a virtual image: the \\\"entrance pupil\\\" of the eye. When viewed off-axis, the entrance pupil has an elliptical form. The precise appearance of the entrance pupil is the consequence of the anatomical and optical properties of the eye, and the relative positions of the eye and the observer. This paper presents a ray-traced, exact model eye that provides the parameters of the entrance pupil ellipse for an observer at an arbitrary location. The model is able to reproduce empirical measurements of the shape of the entrance pupil with good accuracy. I demonstrate that accurate specification of the entrance pupil of a stationary eye requires modeling of corneal refraction, the misalignment of the visual and optical axes, and the non-circularity of the pupil aperture. The model, including a three-dimensional ray-tracing function through quadric surfaces, is implemented in open-source MATLAB code.",

    "abstract": "The impact of infectious disease is often very different in juveniles and adults, but theory has focused on the drivers of stage-dependent defense in hosts rather than the potential for stage-dependent virulence evolution. Stage-structure has the potential to be important to the evolution of pathogens because it exposes parasites to heterogeneous environments in terms of both host characteristics and transmission routes. We develop a stage-structured (juvenile-adult) epidemiological model and examine the evolutionary outcomes of stage-specific virulence under the classic assumption of a transmission-virulence trade-off. We show that selection on virulence against adults remains consistent with the classic theory. However, the evolution of juvenile virulence is sensitive to both demography and transmission pathway with higher virulence against juveniles being favored either when the transmission pathway is assortative (juveniles preferentially interact together) and the juvenile stage is short, or in contrast when the transmission pathway is disassortative and the juvenile stage is long. These results highlight the potentially profound effects of host stage-structure on determining parasite virulence in nature. This new perspective may have broad implications for both understanding and managing disease severity.\n\nImpact summaryUnderstanding the evolution of parasite virulence remains one of the most important questions in evolutionary ecology. Virulence is often very different in young and old hosts, but previous theory has presumed that these differences are attributed to adaptation in host defense rather than parasite adaptation. However, stage-structure within host populations can expose parasites to heterogeneous environments, which may lead to differential selection on parasite virulence (stage-specific virulence). Surprisingly, no study has investigated the effects of hosts stage-structure on the evolution of stage-specific virulence. We present a theoretical analysis to examine when selection can favor higher virulence against juveniles (juvenile-virulence) versus adults (adult-virulence). Our key result is that higher juvenile-virulence is selected for either when the transmission is assortative within age classes and maturation is slow, or when the transmission is disassortative (occurring predominantly between-classes) and maturation is relatively fast. These at first sight contrasting outcomes can be understood as adaptation to the exploitation of the more available host stage. Although the data on assortativity in infectious disease systems is limited, empirical studies for the virulence of Great Island Virus in guillemots (Uria aalge) and for salmon louse in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are consistent with our predictions. Our work provides testable predictions for stage-specific virulence and presents a novel mechanism that may explain variation in virulence in nature. There are also management implications for conservation, public health, vaccination programs, and farming to understanding the drivers of stage dependent virulence.",

The distal axon of these neurons branches in the skin and innervates many mechanoreceptors, yielding spatially-complex receptive fields. Here we show that synaptic integration across the complex signals from the first-order neuronal population could underlie human ability to accurately (< 3{degrees}) and rapidly process the orientation of edges moving across the fingertip. We first derive spiking models of human first-order tactile neurons that fit and predict responses to moving edges with high accuracy. We then use the model neurons in simulating the peripheral neuronal population that innervates a fingertip. We use machine learning to train classifiers performing synaptic integration across the neuronal population activity, and show that synaptic integration across first-order neurons can process edge orientations with high acuity and speed. In particular, our models suggest that integration of fast-decaying (AMPA-like) synaptic inputs within short timescales is critical for discriminating fine orientations, whereas integration of slow-decaying (NMDA-like) synaptic inputs refine discrimination and maintain robustness over longer timescales. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the computations occurring in the earliest stages of the human tactile processing pathway and how they may be critical for supporting hand function.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOur ability to manipulate objects relies on tactile inputs signaled by first-order neurons that innervate mechanoreceptors in the skin of the hand and have spatially-complex receptive fields.

    "abstract": "Since the turn of the century, researchers have sought to diagnose cancer based on gene expression signatures measured from the blood or biopsy as biomarkers. This task, known as classification, is typically solved using a suite of algorithms that learn a mathematical rule capable of discriminating one group (e.g., cases) from another (e.g., controls). However, discriminatory methods can only identify cancerous samples that resemble those that the algorithm already saw during training. As such, we argue that discriminatory methods are fundamentally ill-suited for the classification of cancer: because the possibility space of cancer is definitively large, the existence of a one-of-a-kind gene expression signature becomes very likely. Instead, we propose using an established surveillance method that detects anomalous samples based on their deviation from a learned normal steady-state structure. By transferring this method to transcriptomic data, we can create an anomaly detector for tissue transcriptomes, a \\\"tissue detector\\\", that is capable of identifying cancer without ever seeing a single cancer example. Using models trained on normal GTEx samples, we show that our \\\"tissue detector\\\" can accurately classify TCGA samples as normal or cancerous and that its performance is further improved by including more normal samples in the training set. We conclude this report by emphasizing the conceptual advantages of anomaly detection and by highlighting future directions for this field of study.",

    "abstract": "Human hepatitis D virus (hHDV) forms the genus Deltavirus which has not been assigned to any virus family. hHDV is a satellite virus and needs hepatitis B virus (HBV) to make infectious particles. Deltaviruses are thought to have evolved in humans, since they have thus far not been identified elsewhere. Herein we report, prompted by a recent observation of HDV-like agent in birds, the identification of a deltavirus in a snake (Boa constrictor) designated as snake-HDV (sHDV). The circular 1711 nt RNA genome of the newly identified virus resembles hHDV in its coding strategy and size. We discovered sHDV when performing a meta-transcriptomic study on brain samples of two boas with central nervous system signs. We did not identify accompanying HBV-like sequences in the samples. By sequence comparison, the putative hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) of sHDV, encoded by one of the two open reading frames (ORFs), is roughly 50% identical to the previously known HDAgs. We used antiserum raised against recombinant snake HDAg to demonstrate a broad viral target cell spectrum, ranging from neurons over epithelial cells to leukocytes. Using RT-PCR, we detected sHDV RNA also in the liver and blood of the two snakes and could show sHDV infection not only in two of their juvenile offspring, but also in a water python (Liasis mackloti savuensis) in the same snake colony, indicating potentially vertical and horizontal transmission. The finding of abundant sHDAg in several tissues suggests that sHDV actively replicated in the studied animals. Our findings suggest that sHDV spread may not be restricted to hepadnavirus co-infection. This would imply that deltaviruses may employ other enveloped viruses for producing infectious particles.",

AbstractThe C4 grass Sorghum bicolor is an important grain and subsistence crop, animal forage, and cellulosic biofuel feedstock that is tolerant of abiotic stresses and marginal soils. Sorghum is short-day flowering, an obstacle for adaptation as a grain crop but a benefit as a biofuel feedstock. To identify genes underlying sorghum photoperiodic flowering behavior this study characterized the Sbgi-ems1 nonsense mutation in the sorghum GIGANTEA (SbGI) gene from a sequenced M4 EMS-mutagenized BTx623 population. Sbgi-ems1 plants had reduced stature and leaf blades exhibiting increased lateral growth combined with reduced proximal-distal growth. Mutant plants flowered later than normal siblings under long-day conditions provided by greenhouse or field. Delayed flowering in Sbgi-ems1 plants accompanied by an increase in internode number, indicating an extended vegetative growth phase prior to flowering. Sbgi-ems1 plants had reduced expression of floral activator genes SbCO and SbEhd1 and downstream FT-like florigen genes SbFT, SbCN8, and SbCN12. Therefore, SbGI accelerates flowering by promotion of SbCO and SbEhd1 expression. Circadian clock-associated genes SbTOC1 and SbLHY had disrupted expression in Sbgi-ems1 plants. This work demonstrates SbGI is a key upstream activator in the regulatory networks dictating sorghum flowering time and growth, as well as gene expression regulation within the circadian clock.\\n\\nSummary StatementSorghum GIGANTEA contributes to flowering time, growth, and the circadian clock with activities opposite to its maize homolog. GI occupies a conserved position within regulatory networks but has plastic activity.",

No study to date has investigated the possible role of host genetics in shaping the gut microbiota in HIV-1 infected subjects. With the aim of generating preliminary data to inform future host genetic studies, we performed an exploratory host exome analysis of 147 subjects either infected or at risk of becoming infected with HIV-1 from the MetaHIV cohort in Barcelona. Using a DNA microarray chip, we sought to identify host genetic variants associated to three specific microbial features with a potentially inheritable component, and which were previously found to be associated with gut dysbiosis in HIV infection, i.e.: gut enterotype, presence of methanogenic archaea and microbial gene richness. After correction for multiple comparisons, we did not observe any statistically significant association between the hosts genetic landscape and the explored gut microbiome traits. These findings will help design future, adequately-powered studies to assess the influence of host genetics in the microbiome of HIV-1-infected subjects.",

    "abstract": "Genetic changes acquired during in vitro culture pose a potential risk for the successful application of stem cells in regenerative medicine. To assess mutation accumulation risks induced by culturing, we determined genetic aberrations in individual human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) and adult stem cells (ASCs) by whole genome sequencing analyses. Individual iPS cells, intestinal ASCs and liver ASCs accumulated 3.5{+/-}0.5, 7.2{+/-}1.0 and 8.4{+/-}3.6 base substitutions per population doubling, respectively. The annual in vitro mutation accumulation rate of ASCs adds up to [~]1600 base pair substitutions, which is [~]40-fold higher than the in vivo rate of [~]40 base pair substitutions per year. Mutational analysis revealed a distinct in vitro induced mutational signature that is irrespective of stem cell type and distinct from the in vivo mutational signature. This in vitro signature is characterized by C to A changes that have previously been linked to oxidative stress conditions. Additionally, we observed stem cell-specific mutational signatures and differences in transcriptional strand bias, indicating differential activity of DNA repair mechanisms between stem cell types in culture. We demonstrate that the empirically defined mutation rates, spectra, and genomic distribution enable risk assessment by modelling the accumulation of specific oncogenic mutations during typical in vitro expansion, manipulation or screening experiments using human stem cells. Taken together, we have here for the first time accurately quantified and characterized in vitro mutation accumulation in human iPS cells and ASCs in a direct comparison. These results provide insights for further optimization of culture conditions for safe in vivo utilization of these cell types for regenerative purposes.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication requires strategies to cope with nucleoprotein barriers that impair the efficient translocation of the replisome. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate accessory helicases play essential roles in continuity of replication in the presence of nucleoprotein barriers, but how they operate in the native cellular environment is unclear. With high-speed single-molecule microscopy we determine the dynamic patterns of localization of genomically-encoded fluorescent protein constructs of the bacterial accessory helicase Rep and core replisome protein DnaQ in live E. coli cells. We demonstrate that Rep colocalizes with 70% of replication forks. Colocalisation is dependent upon interaction with replicative helicase DnaB, with an underlying hexameric stoichiometry of Rep indicating maximal occupancy of the single DnaB hexamer within the replisome. We find that Rep associates dynamically with the replisome with an average dwell time of 6.5 ms dependent on ATP hydrolysis, indicating rapid binding then translocation away from the fork. We also imaged the PriC replication restart factor given the known Rep-PriC functional interaction and observe Rep-replisome association is also dependent on the presence of PriC. Our findings suggest two Rep-replisome populations in vivo: one involving Rep continually associating with DnaB then translocating away to aid nucleoprotein barrier removal ahead of the fork, another assisting PriC-dependent reloading of DnaB if replisome progression fails. These new findings reveal how a single type of helicase is recruited to the replisome to provide two independent ways of underpinning replication of protein-bound DNA, a problem that all organisms face as they replicate their genomes.\\n\\nSignificance statementAll organisms face the challenge of proteins bound to DNA acting as barriers to prevent DNA replication. We have performed fluorescence imaging experiments on living bacteria to track the positions of the replication machinery, a protein called Rep which is involved in removing these barriers, and a protein called PriC believed to be involved with reloading the replication machinery if the original replication machinery breaks down. We find that Rep is very dynamic with continual binding and movement away from the replication machinery. Association with the replication machinery depends on both binding to the replication machinery directly and on PriC. Thus Rep can circumvent barriers in two independent ways: a strategy which may be relevant to all organisms.",

Disease outcomes are often defined not only by the main pathogen but are influenced by diverse microbial communities known as the microbiome at sites of infection. Here we present the first use of whole genome sequencing from a portable DNA sequencing device as a method for detection of fungal pathogens from wheat (Triticum aestivum). The data revealed that our method is robust and applicable to the diagnosis of fungal diseases including wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici), septoria tritici blotch (caused by Zymoseptoria tritici) and yellow leaf spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici repentis). We also identified a bacterial genus Pseudomonas co-present with Puccinia and Zymoseptoria infections but not Pyrenophora infections. One limitation of the method is the over-representation of redundant wheat genome sequences in the sample. This could be addressed by amplicon-based sequencing approaches in future studies. Our work outlines a new approach for the detection of a broad range of plant pathogens and associated microbes using a portable sequencer, providing the basis for future development of a system for on-site disease monitoring.",

Fly larvae mount a coordinated cellular immune response following infection by endoparasitoid wasps, characterized by the production of specialized blood cells called lamellocytes that form a tight capsule around wasp eggs in their hemolymph. The conserved JAK/Stat signaling pathway has been implicated in lamellocyte proliferation and is required for successful encapsulation of wasp eggs. Here we show that activity of Stat92E, the D. melanogaster Stat ortholog, is induced in the fat body and hemocytes following wasp infection. Virulent wasp species are able to suppress activation of a Stat92E activity reporter during infection, suggesting they target upstream activation of this pathway as part of their virulence strategies. Furthermore, two wasp species (Leptopilina guineaensis and Ganaspis xanthopoda) suppress phenotypes associated with gain-of-function mutations in hopscotch, the D. melanogaster JAK ortholog, showing that they inhibit JAK/Stat activity downstream of JAK. Our data demonstrate that endoparasitoid wasp virulence factors block JAK/Stat signaling to overcome fly immune defenses.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response depends on ubiquitin signalling to orchestrate DNA repair. The Fanconi Anemia pathway for interstrand crosslink repair, and the translesion synthesis pathway for DNA damage tolerance, both require cycles of monoubiquitination and deubiquitination. The ubiquitin specific protease USP1 regulates both these pathways by deubiquitinating monoubiquitinated PCNA, FANCD2 and FANCI. Loss of USP1 activity gives rise to chromosomal instability. While many USPs hydrolyse ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages, USP1 targets ubiquitin-substrate conjugates at specific sites. The molecular basis of USP1s specificity for multiple substrates is poorly understood. Here we show that the molecular determinants for substrate deubiquitination by USP1 reside within the highly conserved and extended N-terminus. We find that the N-terminus of USP1 harbours a FANCD2-specific binding sequence required for deubiquitination of K561 on FANCD2. In contrast, the N-terminus is not required for PCNA or FANCI deubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminus of USP1 is sufficient to engineer specificity in a more promiscuous USP.",

Here, using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we show that PAKRP2 exhibits processive plus-end-directed motility on single microtubules as individual homodimers despite having an exceptionally long (32 residues) neck linker. Furthermore, using high-resolution nanoparticle tracking to visualize motor stepping dynamics, we find that PAKRP2 achieves processivity via a noncanonical stepping mechanism that includes small step sizes and frequent lateral steps to adjacent protofilaments. We propose that the small steps sizes are due to a transient intermediate step that involves a prolonged diffusional search of the tethered head due to its long neck linker. Despite this different stepping behavior, ATP is tightly coupled to each 8-nm step. Collectively, this study reveals PAKRP2 as the first orphan kinesin to demonstrate processive motility and broadens our understanding of the diverse kinesin stepping mechanisms.",

Eighteen healthy volunteers had liver scanned twice in the same session, and then once again in another session. Region of interest (ROI)-based measurements were processed with bi-exponential model full fitting and segmented fitting (threshold b-value = 80 s/mm2), as well as tri-exponential model full fitting and segmented fitting (threshold b-value = 200 s/mm2).\\n\\nResultsWith all scans signal averaged, bi-exponential model full fitting showed Dslow=1.14, Dfast=193.6x10-3 mm2/s, and PF=16.9%, and segmented fitting showed Dslow=1.03, Dfast=56.7x10-3 mm2/s, and PF=21.3%. IVIM parameters derived from tri-exponential model were similar for full fitting and segmented fitting, with a slow (Dslow=0.98x10-3 mm2/s; Fslow=76.4 or 76.6%), a fast (Dfast=15.1 or 15.4x10-3 mm2/s; Ffast=11.8 or 11.7%) and a very fast (DVfast=445.0 or 448.8x10-3 mm2/s; FVfast=11.8 or 11.7 %) diffusion compartments. Tri-exponential model provided an overall better fit than bi-exponential model. For bi-exponential model, full fitting provided better fit at very low and low b-values compared with segmented fitting with the later tended to underestimate Dfast, however, segmented method demonstrated lower error in signal prediction for high b-values. Compared with full fitting, tri-exponential segmented fitting offered better scan-rescan reproducibility.\\n\\nConclusionFor healthy liver, tri-exponential modelling is preferred than bi-exponential modelling. For bi-exponential model, segmented fitting underestimates Dfast, but offers more accurate estimation of Dslow.",

While the overall survival rate can be relatively high, current treatments combining surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy are very destructive for patient development and quality of life. Moreover, aggressive forms and recurrences of MB cannot be controlled by classical therapies. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches yielding good efficacy and low toxicity for healthy tissues are required to improve patient outcome. Cancer cells sustain their proliferation by optimizing their nutrient uptake capacities. The L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is an essential amino acid carrier overexpressed in aggressive human cancers that was described as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of JPH203, a LAT1-specific pharmacological inhibitor, on two independent MB cell lines belonging to subgroups 3 (HD-MB03) and Shh (DAOY). We show that while displaying low toxicity towards normal cerebral cells, JPH203 disrupts AA homeostasis, mTORC1 activity, proliferation and survival in MB cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that a long-term treatment with JPH203 does not lead to resistance in MB cells. Therefore, the present study suggests that targeting LAT1 with JPH203 is a promising therapeutic approach for MB treatment.",

Sulf2 is expressed in ventral spinal progenitors at initiation of gliogenesis, including in Olig2-expressing cells of the pMN domain known to generate most spinal cord oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). We found that Sulf2 is dispensable for OPC development but required for proper generation of an as-yet-unidentified astrocyte precursor cell (AP) subtype. These cells, like OPCs, express Olig2 while populating the spinal parenchyma at embryonic stages but also retain Olig2 expression as they differentiate into mature astrocytes.

The FGFR2b ligands, FGF3 and FGF10, are expressed throughout otic development and are required individually for normal morphogenesis, but their prior and redundant roles in otic placode induction complicates investigation of subsequent combinatorial functions in morphogenesis. To interrogate these roles and identify new effectors of FGF3 and FGF10 signaling at the earliest stages of otic morphogenesis, we used conditional gene ablation after otic placode induction and temporal inhibition of signaling with a secreted, dominant-negative FGFR2b ectodomain. We show that both ligands are required continuously after otocyst formation for maintenance of the otic ganglion and patterning and proliferation of the epithelium, leading to normal morphogenesis of both the cochlear and vestibular domains. Furthermore, the first genomewide identification of proximal targets of FGFR2b signaling in the early otocyst reveals novel candidate genes for inner ear development and function.",

We recently reported that such signals critically require modification of DLK by the fatty acid palmitate, via a process called palmitoylation. Compounds that inhibit DLK palmitoylation could thus reduce neurodegeneration, but identifying such inhibitors requires a suitable assay. Here we report that DLK subcellular localization in non-neuronal cells is highly palmitoylation-dependent and can be used as a proxy readout to identify inhibitors of DLK palmitoylation by High Content Screening (HCS). We exploited this highly specific localization of DLK-GFP as the basis for a screen of the Prestwick Compound Library. We found that ketoconazole, a Prestwick Library compound that most dramatically affected DLK subcellular localization in our primary screen, inhibited DLK palmitoylation in a dose-dependent manner in follow-up biochemical assays. Moeroever, ketoconazole significantly blunted phosphorylation of c-Jun in primary sensory neurons subjected to Trophic Deprivation, a well known model of DLK-dependent pro-degenerative signaling. These findings suggest that our HCS platform is capable of identifying novel inhibitors of DLK palmitoylation and signalling that may have considerable therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Symmetry breaking, a central principle of physics, has been hailed as the driver of self-organization in biological systems in general and biogenesis of cellular organelles in particular, but the molecular mechanisms of symmetry breaking only begin to become understood. Centrioles, the structural cores of centrosomes and cilia, must duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful inheritance through cellular divisions. Work in model organisms identified conserved proteins required for centriole duplication and found that altering their abundance affects centriole number. However, the biophysical principles that ensure that, under physiological conditions, only a single procentriole is produced on each mother centriole remain enigmatic. Here we propose a mechanistic biophysical model for the initiation of procentriole formation in mammalian cells. We posit that interactions between the master regulatory kinase PLK4 and its activator-substrate STIL form the basis of the procentriole initiation network. The model faithfully recapitulates the experimentally observed transition from PLK4 uniformly distributed around the mother centriole, the \\\"ring\\\", to a unique PLK4 focus, the \\\"spot\\\", that triggers the assembly of a new procentriole. This symmetry breaking requires a dual positive feedback based on autocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4-STIL complexes by phosphorylated STIL. We find that, contrary to previous proposals, in situ degradation of active PLK4 is insufficient to break symmetry. Instead, the model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for PLK4-STIL complexes explains both the instability of the PLK4 ring and formation of the unique PLK4 spot. In the model, strong competition at physiologically normal parameters robustly produces a single procentriole, while increasing overexpression of PLK4 and STIL weakens the competition and causes progressive addition of procentrioles in agreement with experimental observations.",

To control glycemia, they require hyperinsulinemia that then overdrives ERK and hepatic de-novo lipogenesis. We recently reported that NADPH oxidase-4 regulates balanced insulin action. Here, we show that NADPH oxidase-4 is part of a new limb of insulin signaling that we abbreviate \\\"NSAPP\\\" after its five major proteins. The NSAPP pathway is an oxide transport chain that begins when insulin stimulates NADPH oxidase-4 to generate [Formula]. NADPH oxidase-4 hands [Formula] to superoxide dismutase-3 for conversion into H2O2. The pathway ends when aquaporin-3 channels H2O2 across the membrane to inactivate PTEN. Disruption of any component of the NSAPP chain, from NADPH oxidase-4 up to PTEN, leaves PTEN persistently active, thereby producing the same deadly pattern of imbalanced insulin action seen clinically. Unraveling the molecular basis for NSAPP dysfunction in overnutrition has now become a top priority.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to animals, postembryonic development in plants is modular, and aerial organs originate from stem cells in the center of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) throughout life. Descendants of SAM stem cells in the subepidermal layer (L2) give also rise to male and female gametes (reviewed in 1) and are therefore considered primordial germ cells. In these cells, transmission of somatic mutations including virus and TE insertions must be avoided. Despite their essential role for plant development and intergenerational continuity, no comprehensive molecular analysis of SAM stem cells exists, due to their low number, deep embedding among non-stem cells, and difficult isolation. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of stage-specific gene expression and DNA methylation dynamics in Arabidopsis SAM stem cells. Stem cell expression signatures are mostly defined by development, but we also identified a core set of differentially expressed stemness genes. Surprisingly, vegetative SAM stem cells showed increased expression of transposable elements (TEs) relative to surrounding cells, despite high expression of genes connected to epigenetic silencing. We also find increasing methylation at CHG and a drop in CHH methylation at TEs before stem cells enter the reproductive lineage, indicating an onset of epigenetic reprogramming at an early stage. Transiently elevated TE expression is reminiscent of that in animal primordial germ cells (PGCs) 2 and demonstrates commonality of transposon biology. Our results connect SAM stem cells with germline development and transposon evolution and will allow future experiments to determine the degree of epigenetic heritability between generations.",

This ability relies on the sensitive detection of optically trapped particles, typically accomplished using laser-based interferometric methods. Recently, precise and fast image-based particle tracking techniques have garnered increased interest as a potential alternative to laser-based detection, however successful integration of image-based methods into optical trapping instruments for biophysical applications and force measurements has remained elusive. Here we develop a camera-based detection platform that enables exceptionally accurate and precise measurements of biological forces and interactions in a dual optical trap. In demonstration, we stretch and unzip DNA molecules while measuring the relative distances of trapped particles from their trapping centers with sub-nanometer accuracy and precision, a performance level previously only achieved using photodiodes. We then use the DNA unzipping technique to localize bound proteins with extraordinary sub-base-pair precision, revealing how thermal DNA fluctuations allow an unzipping fork to sense and respond to a bound protein prior to a direct encounter. This work significantly advances the capabilities of image tracking in optical traps, providing a state-of-the-art detection method that is accessible, highly flexible, and broadly compatible with diverse experimental substrates and other nanometric techniques.",

Here we report the folding of atomistic, implicitly solvated protein systems with folding times {tau}f ranging from ~100 s to ~10s using the weighted ensemble (WE) strategy in combination with GPU computing. Starting from an initial structure or set of structures, WE organizes an ensemble of GPU-accelerated MD trajectory segments via intermittent pruning and replication events to generate statistically unbiased estimates of rate constants for rare events such as folding; no biasing forces are used. Although the variance among atomistic WE folding runs is significant, multiple independent runs are used to reduce and quantify statistical uncertainty. Three systems were examined: NTL9 at low solvent viscosity (yielding {tau}f ~ 5s), NTL9 at water-like viscosity ({tau}f ~ 40s), and Protein G at low viscosity ({tau}f ~ 10s). In all cases the folding time, uncertainty, and ensemble properties could be estimated from WE simulation; for protein G, this characterization required significantly less overall computing than would be required to observe a single folding event with conventional MD simulations. Our results suggest discrepancies with experimental folding times that should enable improvement of force fields and solvent models.",

    "abstract": "Sexual conflict may result in the escalating coevolution of sexually antagonistic traits. However, our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic traits and their role in association with sex-specific escalation remains limited. Here we study sexually antagonistic coevolution in a genus of water striders called Rhagovelia. We identified a set of male grasping traits and female anti-grasping traits used during pre-mating struggles and show that natural variation of these traits is associated with variation in mating performance in the direction expected for antagonistic co-evolution. Phylogenetic mapping detected signals of escalation of these sexually antagonistic traits suggesting an ongoing arms race. Moreover, their escalation appears to be constrained by a trade-off with dispersal through flight in both sexes. Altogether our results highlight how sexual interactions may have shaped sex-specific antagonistic traits and how constraints imposed by natural selection may have influenced their evolution.",

    "abstract": "The nervous system confronts challenges during development and experience that can destabilize information processing. To adapt to these perturbations, synapses homeostatically adjust synaptic strength, a process referred to as homeostatic synaptic plasticity. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors activates retrograde signaling that precisely increases presynaptic neurotransmitter release to restore baseline synaptic strength. However, the nature of the underlying postsynaptic induction process remains enigmatic. Here, we designed a forward genetic screen to identify factors necessary in the postsynaptic compartment to generate retrograde homeostatic signaling. This approach identified insomniac (inc), a gene that encodes a putative adaptor for the Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is essential for normal sleep regulation. Intriguingly, we find that Inc rapidly traffics to postsynaptic densities and is required for increased ubiquitination following acute receptor inhibition. Our study suggests that Inc-dependent ubiquitination, compartmentalized at postsynaptic densities, gates retrograde signaling and provides an intriguing molecular link between the control of sleep behavior and homeostatic plasticity at synapses.",

The I-BAR-domain protein IRSp53 is an essential regulator of filopodia dynamics that couples Rho-GTPase signaling to cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling, playing essential roles in neuronal development and cell motility. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of IRSp53 by 14-3-3 counters membrane binding and activation by Cdc42 or downstream cytoskeletal effectors. Phosphoproteomics, quantitative binding studies and crystal structures show that 14-3-3 binds to two pairs of phosphorylation sites in IRSp53. Using bicistronic expression we obtained a heterodimer of IRSp53 in which only one subunit is phosphorylated, and show that each subunit of the IRSp53 dimer independently binds a 14-3-3 dimer. A FRET-sensor assay developed using natively phosphorylated and 14-3-3-binding competent IRSp53 purified from mammalian cells reveals opposite conformational changes in IRSp53 upon binding of activatory (Cdc42, Eps8) vs. inhibitory (14-3-3) inputs.",

    "abstract": "Humans differ in many respects from other primates, but perhaps no derived human feature is more striking than our naked skin. Long purported to be adaptive, humans unique external appearance is characterized by changes in both the patterning of hair follicles and eccrine sweat glands, producing decreased hair cover and increased sweat gland density. Despite the conspicuousness of these features and their potential evolutionary importance, there is a lack of clarity regarding how they evolved within the primate lineage. We thus collected and quantified the density of hair follicles and eccrine sweat glands from five regions of the skin in three species of primates: macaque, chimpanzee and human. Although human hair cover is greatly attenuated relative to that of our close relatives, we find that humans have a chimpanzee-like hair density that is significantly lower than that of macaques. In contrast, eccrine gland density is on average 10-fold higher in humans compared to chimpanzees and macaques, whose density is strikingly similar. Our findings suggest that a decrease in hair density in the ancestors of humans and apes was followed by an increase in eccrine gland density and a reduction in fur cover in humans. This work answers longstanding questions about the traits that make human skin unique and substantiates a model in which the evolution of expanded eccrine gland density was exclusive to the human lineage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNA interference (RNAi) related pathways provide defense against viruses and transposable elements, and have been implicated in the suppression of meiotic drive elements. Genes in these pathways often exhibit high levels of adaptive substitution, and over longer timescales show frequent gene duplication and loss-- most likely as a consequence of their role in mediating conflict with these parasites. This is particularly striking for Argonaute 2 (Ago2), which is ancestrally the key effector of antiviral RNAi in insects, but has repeatedly formed new testis-specific duplicates in the recent history of the Drosophila obscura group.\\n\\nResultsHere we take advantage of publicly available genomic and transcriptomic data to identify six further RNAi-pathway genes that have duplicated in this clade of Drosophila, and examine their evolutionary history. As seen for Ago2, we observe high levels of adaptive amino-acid substitution and changes in sex-biased expression in many of the paralogs. However, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that co-duplications of the RNAi machinery were not synchronous, and our expression analysis fails to identify consistent male-specific expression.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results confirm that RNAi genes, including genes of the antiviral and piRNA pathways, undergo frequent independent duplications and that their history has been particularly labile within the Drosophila obscura group. However, they also suggest that the selective pressures driving these changes have not been consistent, implying that more than one selective agent may be responsible.",

    "abstract": "Miltefosine is an FDA approved oral drug for treating cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania is a flagellated protozoa, which infects and differentiates in macrophages. Here, we studied the effects of Miltefosine on macrophages lipid homeostasis, autophagy, and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly/activity. Miltefosine treatment conferred multiple effects on macrophage lipid homeostasis leading to increased cholesterol release from cells, increased lipid-raft disruption, decreased phosphatidylserine (PS) flip from the cell-surface, and redistribution of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from the plasma membrane to actin rich regions in the cells. Enhanced basal autophagy, lipophagy and mitophagy was observed in cells treated with Miltefosine vs. control. Miltefosine treated cells showed marked increased in phosphorylation of kinases involved in autophagy induction such as; Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1). The Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway was blunted by Miltefosine treatment, resulting in decreased TLR4 recruitment to cell-surface and ~75% reduction in LPS induced pro-IL-1{beta} mRNA levels. Miltefosine reduced endotoxin-mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and protected the mitochondrial membrane potential. Miltefosine treatment induced mitophagy and dampened NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Collectively, our data shows that Miltefosine induced ABCA1 mediated cholesterol release, induced AMPK phosphorylation and mitophagy, while dampening NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1{beta} release.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAtherosclerosis is driven by cholesterol accumulation and inflammation, and the arterial macrophage is a key cell type in both of these processes. The macrophage characteristics that protect against atherosclerosis include increased cholesterol efflux/reverse cholesterol transport, increased autophagy, and deceased inflammatory cytokine production and signaling.

Miltefosine activated cholesterol release and autophagy while inhibiting pro IL-1{beta} gene expression and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Miltefosine activated AMPK signaling pathway and mitophagy, leading to reduced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1{beta} release.",

    "abstract": "Cell state transitions are often triggered by large changes in the absolute concentrations of transcription factors and therefore large differences in the stoichiometric ratios between these factors. Whether cells can elicit state transitions using modest changes in the relative ratios of co-expressed factors is unclear. In this study we investigate how cells in the Drosophila eye resolve cell state transitions by quantifying the expression dynamics of the ETS transcription factors Pnt and Yan. We find that eye progenitor cells maintain a relatively constant ratio of Pnt/Yan protein despite expressing both proteins with pulsatile dynamics. A rapid and sustained two-fold increase in the Pnt/Yan ratio accompanies transitions to photoreceptor fates. Genetic perturbations that modestly disrupt the Pnt/Yan ratio produce fate transition defects consistent with the hypothesis that transitions are normally driven by a two-fold shift in the ratio. A biophysical model based on cooperative Yan-DNA binding coupled with non-cooperative Pnt-DNA binding illustrates how two-fold ratio changes could generate ultrasensitive changes in target gene transcription to drive fate transitions. In this way, coupling cell state transitions to the Pnt/Yan stoichiometric ratio sensitizes the system to modest fold-changes, conferring both robustness and ultrasensitivity to the developmental program.",

    "abstract": "Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a vital role in a broad range of biological processes both in health and disease. A comprehensive quantitative reference of small ncRNA expression would significantly advance our understanding of ncRNA roles in shaping tissue functions. Here, we systematically profiled the levels of five ncRNA classes (miRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, scaRNA and tRNA fragments) across eleven mouse tissues by deep sequencing. Using fourteen biological replicates spanning both sexes, we identified that ~ 30% of small ncRNAs are distributed across the body in a tissue-specific manner with some are also being sexually dimorphic. We found that miRNAs are subject to \"arm switching\" between healthy tissues and that tRNA fragments are retained within tissues in both a gene- and a tissue-specific manner. Out of eleven profiled tissues we confirmed that brain contains the largest number of unique small ncRNA transcripts, some of which were previously annotated while others are identified for the first time in this study. Furthermore, by combining these findings with single-cell ATAC-seq data, we were able to connect identified brain-specific ncRNA with their cell types of origin. These results yield the most comprehensive characterization of specific and ubiquitous small RNAs in individual murine tissues to date, and we expect that this data will be a resource for the further identification of ncRNAs involved in tissue-function in health and dysfunction in disease.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS- An atlas of tissue levels of multiple small ncRNA classes generated from 14 biological replicates of both sexes across 11 tissues\n- Distinct distribution patterns of miRNA arms and tRNA fragments across tissues suggest the existence of tissue-specific mechanisms of ncRNA cleavage and retention\n- miRNA expression is sex specific in healthy tissues\n- Small RNA-seq and scATAC-seq data integration produce a detailed map of cell-type specific ncRNA profiles in the mouse brain",

We performed calcium imaging in the larval zebrafish to discover a range of responses surrounding spontaneous saccades, from cells that displayed tonic discharge only during fixations to neurons whose activity rose in advance of saccades by multiple seconds. We lesioned cells in these populations and found that ablation of neurons with pre-saccadic rise delayed saccade initiation. We analyzed spontaneous saccade initiation using a ramp-to-threshold model and were able to predict the times of upcoming saccades using pre-saccadic activity. These findings suggest that ramping of neuronal activity to a bound is a critical component of self-initiated saccadic movements.",

    "abstract": "Colibactins are genotoxic secondary metabolites produced in select Enterobacteriaceae, which induce downstream DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cell lines and are thought to promote the formation of colorectal tumors. Although key structural and functional features of colibactins have been elucidated, the full molecular mechanisms regulating these phenotypes remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that free model colibactins induce DSBs in human cell cultures and do not require delivery by host bacteria. Through domain-targeted editing, we demonstrate that a subset of native colibactins generated from observed module skipping in the nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) biosynthetic assembly line share DNA alkylation phenotypes with the model colibactins in vitro. However, module skipping eliminates the strong DNA interstrand cross-links formed by the wildtype pathway in cell culture. This product diversification during the modular NRPS-PKS biosynthesis produces a family of metabolites with varying observed mechanisms of action - DNA alkylation versus crosslinking - in cell culture. The presence of membranes separating human cells from model colibactins attenuated genotoxicity, suggesting that membrane diffusion limits colibactin activity and could account for the observed bacteria-human cell-to-cell contact phenotype. Additionally, extracellular supplementation of the colibactin resistance protein ClbS was able to intercept colibactins in an E. coli-human cell transient infection model. Our studies demonstrate that free model colibactins recapitulate cellular phenotypes associated with moduleskipped products in the native colibactin pathway and define specific protein domains that are required for efficient DNA interstrand crosslinking in the native pathway.",

    "abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis emerges from coordinated cell shape changes driven by actomyosin contraction1, 2. Spatial patterns of gene expression regionalize and polarize cell behaviours, such as apical constriction in the ventral mesoderm and cell intercalation in the lateral ectoderm of Drosophila3. Thus, tissue dynamics is largely governed genetically. Actomyosin contractile networks drive cell and tissue-level shape changes and can respond to mechanical stimuli 4-9. However how genetic information and mechanical control drive tissue-level morphogenesis is not well understood.\n\nHere we report two phases and modalities of Rho1 and non-muscle MyosinII (MyoII) activation in the Drosophila posterior endoderm. First, Rho1/MyoII are induced apically in a spatially restricted primordium region via localized transcription of the GPCR ligand Fog. Second, a tissue-scale travelling wave of Rho1/MyoII activation and cell invagination progresses anteriorly across the dorsal epithelium at a constant speed of 1 cell every 3 minutes. Remarkably, the MyoII wave does not require sustained gene transcription, and is also insensitive to perturbations in the level and pattern of Fog expression. Thus, while fog transcription initiates Rho1/MyoII activation in the primordium, Fog delivery does not govern wave dynamics. Instead, perturbing the mechanical environment of the endoderm impaired MyoII wave dynamics. MyoII inhibition blocked acute Rho1 activation and propagation, suggesting that MyoII contractility provides both local feedback amplification and spatial coupling necessary for wave progression. Finally, we identify a cycle of 3D cell deformations that link MyoII activation and invagination in one row of cells to vitelline membrane attachment, apical spreading, MyoII activation and invagination in the next row, to drive anterior progression of the invagination wave. Thus endoderm morphogenesis emerges from local transcriptional initiation and a mechanically driven travelling cycle of cell contraction and deformation.",

Found in benthic habitats across all latitudes, echinoids are key components of marine communities such as coral reefs and kelp forests. A little over 1,000 species inhabit the oceans today, a diversity that traces its roots back at least to the Permian. Although much effort has been devoted to elucidating the echinoid tree of life using a variety of morphological data, molecular attempts have relied on only a handful of genes. Both of these approaches have had limited success at resolving the deepest nodes of the tree, and their disagreement over the positions of a number of clades remains unresolved.\\n\\nResultsWe performed de novo sequencing and assembly of 17 transcriptomes to complement available genomic resources of sea urchins and produce the first phylogenomic analysis of the clade. Multiple methods of probabilistic inference recovered identical topologies, with virtually all nodes showing maximum support. In contrast, the coalescent-based method ASTRAL-II resolved one node differently, a result apparently driven by gene tree error induced by evolutionary rate heterogeneity. Regardless of the method employed, our phylogenetic structure deviates from the currently accepted classification of echinoids, with neither Acroechinoidea (all euechinoids except echinothurioids), nor Clypeasteroida (sand dollars and sea biscuits) being monophyletic as currently defined. We demonstrate the strength and distribution of phylogenetic signal throughout the genome for novel resolutions of these lineages and rule out systematic biases as possible explanations.\\n\\nConclusionsOur investigation substantially augments the molecular resources available for sea urchins, providing the first transcriptomes for many of its main lineages. Using this expanded genomic dataset, we resolve the position of several clades in agreement with early molecular analyses but in disagreement with morphological data. Our efforts settle multiple phylogenetic uncertainties, including the position of the enigmatic deep-sea echinothurioids and the identity of the sister clade to sand dollars. We offer a detailed assessment of evolutionary scenarios that could reconcile our findings with morphological evidence, opening up new lines of research into the development and evolutionary history of this ancient clade.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon, whereby dual chromatin states lead to expression of one, and silencing of the other parental allele. Recently, we identified a nucleoporin-mediated mechanism of Kcnq1ot1 imprinted domain regulation in extraembryonic endoderm stem cells by nucleoporins NUP107, NUP62 and NUP153. Here, we investigate their role in Kcnq1ot1 imprinted domain regulation in embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Nucleoporin depletion in both lineages reduced Kcnq1ot1 noncoding RNA expression and volume, reduced Kcnq1ot1 paternal domain positioning at the nuclear periphery, and altered histone modifications along with histone modifier enrichment at the imprinting control region. However, while CTCF and cohesin were enriched at nucleoporin binding sites in the imprinting control region in embryonic stem cells, with reduction upon nucleoporin depletion, neither CTCF or cohesin occupied these sites in trophoblast stem cells. Finally, different subsets of silent paternal alleles were reactivated via altered histone modification upon nucleoporin depletion in embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. These results demonstrate a conserved mechanism with divergent regulation of the Kcnq1ot1 imprinted domain by NUP107, NUP62 and NUP153 in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages.\\n\\nSummary StatementInvestigation of nucleoporins, NUP107, NUP62, and NUP153, revealed a conserved nucleoporin-dependent mechanism that mediates Kcnq1ot1 imprinted domain regulation in ES and TS cells, although notable lineage-specific divergence was also observed.",

To better understand the epigenetic state associated with AD represented as variation in DNA methylation (DNAm), we surveyed 420,852 DNAm sites from neurotypical controls (N=49) and late-onset AD patients (N=24) across four brain regions (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum).\\n\\nResultsWe identified 858 sites with robust differential methylation, collectively annotated to 772 possible genes (FDR<5%, within 10kb). These sites were overrepresented in AD genetic risk loci (p=0.00655), and nearby genes were enriched for processes related to cell-adhesion, immunity, and calcium homeostasis (FDR<5%). We analyzed corresponding RNA-seq data to prioritize 130 genes within 10kb of the differentially methylated sites, which were differentially expressed and had expression levels associated with nearby DNAm levels (p<0.05). This validated gene set includes previously reported (e.g. ANK1, DUSP22) and novel genes involved in Alzheimers disease, such as ANKRD30B.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results highlight DNAm changes in Alzheimers disease that have gene expression correlates, implicating DNAm as an epigenetic mechanism underlying pathological molecular changes associated with AD.

Selection still depends on incomplete mathematical instantiations, but the implicit expectation is that ranking is robust to their details. Here we highlight a contrary finding of \\\"brittleness,\\\" where data matching one theory conceptually are ranked closer to an instance of another. In particular, selection between recent models of decision making is conceptually misleading when data are simulated with minor distributional mismatch, with mixed secondary signals, or with non-stationary parameters; and decision-related responses in macaque cortex show features suggesting that these effects may impact empirical results.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that slow cortical potentials in archi-, paleo- and neocortex, can phase-lock with nasal respiration. In some of these areas, gamma activity ({gamma}: 30-100 Hz) is also coupled to the animals respiration. It has been hypothesized that this interaction plays a role in coordinating distributed neural activity. In a similar way, inter-cortical interactions at {gamma} frequency has been also associated as a binding mechanism by which the brain generates temporary opportunities necessary for implementing cognitive functions. The aim of the present study is to explore if nasal respiration entrains inter-cortical interactions at {gamma} frequency.\\n\\nSix adult cats chronically prepared for electrographic recordings were employed in this study. Our results show that slow cortical respiratory potentials are present in several areas of the neocortex and olfactory bulb during wakefulness. Also, we found cross-frequency coupling between the respiratory phase and the amplitude of {gamma} activity in all recorded areas. These oscillatory entrainments are independent of muscular activity, because are maintained during cataplexy induced by carbachol microinjection into the nucleus pontis oralis. Importantly, we observed that respiratory phase modulates the inter-cortical gamma coherence between neocortical pairs of electrodes during wakefulness. However, during NREM and REM sleep, breathing was unable to entrain the oscillatory activity, neither in the olfactory bulb nor in the neocortex. These results suggest a single unified phenomenon involving cross frequency coupling and long-range {gamma} coherence across the neocortex. This fact could be related to a temporal binding process necessary for cognitive functions during wakefulness.",

These functionally conserved proteins play significant roles in diverse cellular processes besides their central role in ignition of DNA replication at origins. While Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen, is an ascomycetous, asexual, diploid budding yeast but it is significantly diverged from a much better studied model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The components of the DNA replication machinery in C. albicans remain largely uncharacterized. Identification of factors required for DNA replication is essential for understanding the evolution of the DNA replication machinery. We identified the putative ORC homologs in C. albicans and determined their relatedness with those of other eukaryotes including several yeast species. Our extensive in silico studies demonstrate that the domain architecture of CaORC proteins share similarities with the ORC proteins of S. cerevisiae. We dissect the domain organization of ORC (trans-acting factors) proteins that seem to associate with DNA replication origins in C. albicans.

The induction of human Sertoli cells from fibroblasts could provide cellular sources for fertility and transplantation treatments. Here, we report the in vitro reprogramming of human fibroblasts to Sertoli cells and characterize these human induced Sertoli cells (hiSCs). Initially, five transcriptional factors (NR5A1, GATA4, WT1, SOX9 and DMRT1) and a gene reporter carrying the AMH promoter were utilized to obtain the hiSCs. We further reduce the number of reprogramming factors to two, i.e., NR5A1 and GATA4, and show that these hiSCs have transcriptome profiles that are similar to those of primary human Sertoli cells. Consistent with the known cellular properties of Sertoli cells, hiSCs attract endothelial cells and exhibit high number of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. More importantly, hiSCs can sustain the viability of spermatogonia cells harvested from mouse seminiferous tubules. In addition, hiSCs suppress the production of IL-2 and proliferation of human T lymphocytes. When hiSCs were cotransplanted with human embryonic kidney cells, these xenotransplanted human cells survived longer in mice with normal immune systems. hiSCs also allow us to determine a gene associated with Sertoli-only syndrome (SCO), CX43, is indeed important in regulating the maturation of Sertoli cells.",

    "abstract": "The evidence regarding BMAA occurrence in the Baltic Sea is contradictory, with benthic sources appearing to be more important than pelagic ones. The latter is counterintuitive considering that pelagic primary producers, such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria, are the only plausible source of this compound in the food webs. To elucidate BMAA distribution in trophic pathways, we analyzed BMAA in the pelagic and benthic food webs sampled in summer 2010 in the Northern Baltic Proper. As potential BMAA sources, phytoplankton communities in early and late summer were used. As pelagic consumers, zooplankton, mysids and zooplanktivorous fish (herring) were used, whereas benthic invertebrates (amphipods, priapulids, polychaetes, and clams) and benthivorous fish (perch and flounder) represented the benthic food chain. To establish the trophic structure of the system, the stable isotope ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) composition of its components was determined. Contrary to the reported ubiquitous occurrence of BMAA in the Baltic food webs, only phytoplankton and lower consumers (zooplankton and mysids) of the pelagic food chain tested positive. Given that our analytical approaches were adequate, we conclude that no measurable levels of this compound occurred in the benthic invertebrates and any of the tested fish species in the study area. These findings indicate that widely assumed presence and transfer of BMAA to the top consumers in the food webs of the Baltic Sea and, possibly, other systems remain an open question. More controlled experiments and field observations are needed to understand the transfer and possible transformation of BMAA in the food web under various environmental settings.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) proposed seven criteria for expanded carrier screening (ECS) panel design. To ensure that screening for a condition is sufficiently sensitive to identify carriers and reduce residual risk of non-carriers, one criterion requires a per-condition carrier rate greater than 1-in-100. However, it is unestablished whether this threshold corresponds with a loss in clinical detection. The impact of the proposed panel-design criteria on at-risk couple detection warrants data-driven evaluation.\\n\\nMethodsCarrier rates and at-risk couple rates were calculated in 56,281 patients who underwent a 176-condition ECS and evaluated for panels satisfying various criteria. Condition-specific clinical detection rate was estimated via simulation.\\n\\nResultsDifferent interpretations of the 1-in-100 criterion have variable impact: a compliant panel would include between 3 and 38 conditions, identify 11%-81% fewer at-risk couples, and detect 36%-79% fewer carriers than a 176-condition panel. If the carrier-rate threshold must be exceeded in all ethnicities, ECS panels would lack prevalent conditions like cystic fibrosis. Simulations suggest that clinical detection rate remains >84% for conditions with carrier rates as low as 1-in-1000.\\n\\nConclusionsThe 1-in-100 criterion limits at-risk couple detection and should be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently encounters microbes that produce bioactive metabolites including ethanol. At concentrations that do not affect growth, we found that ethanol reduces P. aeruginosa motility by 30% in a swim agar assay and this decrease is accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in levels of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), a second messenger that represses motility, in planktonic cells. A screen of mutants lacking genes involved in c-di-GMP metabolism identified SadC and GcbA as diguanylate cyclases involved in swim zone reduction by ethanol and ethanol-induced c-di-GMP production. The reduction of swimming in response to ethanol also required the stator set, MotAB, two PilZ-domain proteins (FlgZ and PilZ), PilY1-a proposed surface-sensing protein, and PilMNOP, which comprises the pilus alignment complex and these proteins have been previously implicated in the control of motility on agar surfaces. Microscopic analysis of the fraction of quiescent cells in swim medium showed that ethanol decreased the portion of motile cells in the wild type, but had opposite effects in the {triangleup}pilY1, {triangleup}pilMNOP, {triangleup}motAB, and {triangleup}pilZ{triangleup}flgZ mutants. Together, these data indicate ethanol induces a regulated change in motility in planktonic cells at concentrations similar to those produced by other microbes. We propose that this ethanol-responsiveness may contribute to the co-localization of P. aeruginosa with ethanol-producing microbes.",

The current study investigated differences in baseline frontal gamma power and its association with language development in toddlers at high versus low familial risk for autism. EEG recordings as well as cognitive and behavioral assessments were acquired at 24-months as part of prospective, longitudinal study of infant siblings of children with and without autism. Diagnosis of autism was determined at 24-36 months, and data was analyzed across three outcome groups - low risk without ASD (n=43), high-risk without ASD (n=42), and high-risk with ASD (n=16). High-risk toddlers without ASD had reduced baseline frontal gamma power (30-50Hz) compared to low-risk toddlers. Among high-risk toddlers increased frontal gamma was only marginally associated with ASD diagnosis (p=0.06), but significantly associated with reduced expressive language ability (p=0.007). No association between gamma power and language was present in the low-risk group. These findings suggest that differences in gamma oscillations in high-risk toddlers may represent compensatory mechanisms associated with improved developmental outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow waves occurring under anesthesia present no positive effects on memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro, and computational models. We find two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive slow-wave events. The first type is consistently observed in natural slow-wave sleep, while the second is shown to be ubiquitous under anesthesia. Network models of spiking neurons predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.",

For this purpose, seedlings of two thyme species (Thymus vulgaris and Thymus daenensis) were sown in pots and exposed to different levels of Thiobacillus and superabsorbent. Results of Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) revealed that the main compounds detected for T. vulgaris were thymol (31.5%), p-cymene (23.4%),{gamma} -terpinene (13.9%), linalool (38.3%) and carvacrol (2.7%) while the main compounds of T. daenensis were thymol (51.2%), o-cymene (12.9%),{gamma} -terpinene (4.5%), linalool (1.7%) and borneol (3.1%). Furthermore, the application of Thiobacillus had a significant effect on -pinene content (p = 0.05). Moreover, the interaction between superabsorbent and Thiobacillus significantly changed the percentage of thymol, borneol, and caryophyllene. In conclusion, the mean of essence components in T. vulgaris was more than T. daenensis with the exception of thymol and caryophyllene.",

    "abstract": "Cholera is a life-threatening diarrhoeal disease caused by the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Infection occurs after ingestion of the bacteria, which colonize the human small intestine and secrete their major virulence factor - the cholera toxin (CT). Recent studies suggest that the GM1 receptor may not be the only target of the CT, and that fucosylated receptors such as Lewisx (Lex) and histo-blood group antigens may also be important for cellular uptake and toxicity. However, where and how Lex binds to the CT remains unclear. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure (1.5 [A]) of the receptor-binding B-subunit of the CT bound to the Lex trisaccharide, and present matching SPR data for CT holotoxins. Lex, and also O_SCPCAPLC_SCPCAP-fucose alone (at 500-fold molar excess), bind to the secondary binding site of the toxin, distinct from the GM1 binding site. In contrast, fucosyl-GM1 mainly binds to the primary binding site due to high-affinity interactions of its GM1 core. The two binding sites are likely connected by allosteric cross-talk, potentially affecting toxin uptake. We also discuss why secretors are protected from severe cholera.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCholera is a severe diarrhoeal disease that is still a major killer in many parts of the world, especially in regions struck by natural disasters and wars. However, some individuals experience milder cholera symptoms. These so-called  secretors, who have blood group antigens also in their bodily fluids like their saliva and the slimy mucus layer covering their stomach and intestines, appear to be somewhat protected. Here we present detailed atomic structures of cholera toxin and quantitative binding data that give clues of the protective mechanisms. Interactions of the protein toxin with sugar molecules are of crucial importance both for toxicity and protection. In addition, we identify a new tool for biochemical studies, and lay the groundwork for the design of cholera drugs and vaccines that may save countless human lives.",

    "abstract": "Yeast metabolism is highly regulated, in part via coordinated reprogramming of metabolism on a transcriptional level, for example in response to environmental changes. Furthermore, regulation occurs on the protein level via posttranslational modifications directly affecting enzymatic activity - a mode of regulation that has the benefit of being very fast in response to environmental changes. One group of posttranslational modification that has been suggested to have a high impact on regulation of metabolism are acetylations. Around 4000 distinct protein acetylation sites have been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many of which are located in central metabolic enzymes. However, reports on the verification of regulatory roles of specific acetylation sites on these metabolic enzymes have yet to emerge. This study investigates putative regulatory acetylation sites on Fas2p, which in concert with Fas1p is responsible for cytosolic fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. Fas2p stands out as one of the most highly acetylated proteins in yeast and is located at a branchpoint of acetyl-CoA metabolism. The amino acids (AAs) glutamine (Q) and arginine (R) were introduced to mimic a constitutively acetylated or non-acetylatable state at three separate lysine sites (K) (K83, K173 and K1551) confirmed to be acetylated in two independent studies, either separately or simultaneously. The results suggest that the residue replacement system in the specific case interferes with the enzymatic function of the fatty acid synthase (FAS), as QQQ and RRR triple mutants both reduce the amount of secreted free fatty acids (FFAs) in a faa1{Delta} faa4{Delta} yeast deletion mutant. The K173Q substitution significantly decreased C16 FA species at the expense of C18 FAs, while no such change could be observed for the corresponding K173R modification.",

Notch2-ablation induces cell cycle genes and markers of active NSCs. Conversely, quiescent NSC-associated genes, including Id4, are down regulated after Notch2 deletion. We found that Notch2 binds the Id4 promoter and positively regulates transcription. Similar to Notch2, Id4 overexpression promotes DG NSC quiescence and Id4 knockdown rescues proliferation, even when Notch2 signaling is activated. We show that Notch2 regulates age-dependent DG NSC dormancy and Notch2 inhibition rejuvenates neurogenesis in the DG of aged mice.

Examination of these biological trade-offs can provide invaluable information regarding the biophysical and biochemical bases behind observed cellular phenotypes. A quantitative knowledge of a cell systems critical objectives is also needed for engineering of cellular metabolism, where there is interest in mitigating the fitness costs that may result from human manipulation.\\n\\nResultsTo study metabolism in photoheterotrophs, we developed and validated a genome-scale model of metabolism in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile gram-negative purple non-sulfur bacterium capable of growing phototrophically on various carbons sources, including inorganic carbon and aromatic compounds. To quantitatively assess trade-offs among a set of important biological objectives during different metabolic growth modes, we used our new model to conduct an 8-dimensional multi-objective flux analysis of metabolism in R. palustris. Our results revealed that phototrophic metabolism in R. palustris is a light-limited growth mode under anaerobic conditions, regardless of the available carbon source. Under photoheterotrophic conditions, R. Palustris prioritizes the optimization of carbon efficiency, followed by ATP production and biomass production rate, in a Pareto-optimal manner. To achieve maximum carbon fixation, cells appear to divert limited energy resources away from growth and toward CO2 fixation, even in presence of excess reduced carbon. We also found that to achieve the theoretical maximum rate of biomass production, anaerobic metabolism requires import of additional compounds (such as protons) to serve as electron acceptors. Finally, we found that production of hydrogen gas, of potential interest as a candidate biofuel, lowers the cellular growth rates under all circumstances.\\n\\nConclusionsPhotoheterotrophic metabolism of R. palustris is primarily regulated by the amount of light it can absorb and not the availability of carbon. However, despite carbons secondary role as a regulating factor, R. palustris metabolism strives for maximum carbon efficiency, even when this increased efficiency leads to slightly lower growth rates.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in modeling single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is to capture the diverse gene expression states regulated by different transcriptional regulatory inputs across single cells, which is further complicated by a large number of observed zero and low expressions. We developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) model that stems from the kinetic relationships between the transcriptional regulatory inputs and metabolism of mRNA and gene expression abundance in a cell. LTMG infers the expression multi-modalities across single cell entities, representing a genes diverse expression states; meanwhile the dropouts and low expressions are treated as left truncated, specifically representing an expression state that is under suppression. We demonstrated that LTMG has significantly better goodness of fitting on an extensive number of single-cell data sets, comparing to three other state of the art models. In addition, our systems kinetic approach of handling the low and zero expressions and correctness of the identified multimodality are validated on several independent experimental data sets. Application on data of complex tissues demonstrated the capability of LTMG in extracting varied expression states specific to cell types or cell functions. Based on LTMG, a differential gene expression test and a co-regulation module identification method, namely LTMG-DGE and LTMG-GCR, are further developed. We experimentally validated that LTMG-DGE is equipped with higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting differentially expressed genes, compared with other five popular methods, and that LTMG-GCR is capable to retrieve the gene co-regulation modules corresponding to perturbed transcriptional regulations.

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome scale metabolic models (GSMMs) are increasingly important for systems biology and metabolic engineering research as they are capable of simulating complex steady-state behaviour. Constraints based models of this form can include thousands of reactions and metabolites, with many crucial pathways that only become activated in specific simulation settings. However, despite their widespread use, power and the availability of tools to aid with the construction and analysis of large scale models, little methodology is suggested for the continued management of curated large scale models. For example, when genome annotations are updated or new understanding regarding behaviour of is discovered, models often need to be altered to reflect this. This is quickly becoming an issue for industrial systems and synthetic biotechnology applications, which require good quality reusable models integral to the design, build and test cycle.\\n\\nResultsAs part of an ongoing effort to improve genome scale metabolic analysis, we have developed a test-driven development methodology for the continuous integration of validation data from different sources. Contributing to the open source technology based around COBRApy, we have developed the gsmodutils modelling framework placing an emphasis on test-driven design of models through defined test cases. Crucially, different conditions are configurable allowing users to examine how different designs or curation impact a wide range of system behaviours, minimising error between model versions.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software framework described within this paper is open source and freely available from http://github.com/SBRCNottingham/gsmodutils",

    "abstract": "Analyses of large somatic mutation datasets, using advanced computational algorithms, have revealed at least 30 independent mutational signatures in tumor samples. These studies have been instrumental in identification and quantification of responsible endogenous and exogenous molecular processes against cancer. The quantitative approach used to deconvolute mutational signatures is becoming an integral part of cancer research. Therefore, development of a stand-alone tool with a user-friendly graphical interface for analysis of cancer mutational signatures is necessary. In this manuscript, we introduce CANCERSIGN as an open access1 bioinformatics tool that uses raw mutation data (BED files) as input, and generates 3-mer and 5-mer mutational signatures. Additionally, this tool enables users to perform clustering on tumor samples based on the raw mutation counts as well as using the proportion of mutational signatures in each sample. Using this tool, we analysed all the whole genome somatic mutation datasets of International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) samples and identified a number of novel signatures.",

    "abstract": "In bilaterians and cnidarians, embryonic and epithelial cell-polarity are regulated by the interactions between Par proteins, Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, and cell-cell adhesion. Par proteins are highly conserved across Metazoa, including ctenophores. But strikingly, ctenophore genomes lack components of the Wnt/PCP pathway and cell-cell adhesion complexes; raising the question if ctenophore cells are polarized by mechanisms involving Par proteins. Here, by using immunohistochemistry and live-cell imaging overexpression of specific mRNAs, we describe for the first time the subcellular localization of selected Par proteins in blastomeres and epithelial cells during the embryogenesis of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. We show that these proteins distribute differently compared to what has been described for other animals, even though they segregate in a host-specific fashion when expressed in cnidarian embryos. This differential localization might be related to the emergence of different junctional complexes during metazoan evolution. Data obtained here challenge the ancestry of the apicobasal cell polarity and raise questions about the homology of epithelial tissue across the Metazoa.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the impacts of climate change on animal populations and communities requires understanding of feedbacks between direct physiological responses and indirect effects via ecological interactions. Food-dependent body growth and within-species size variation have major effects on dynamics of populations and communities through feedbacks between individual performance and population size structure. Moreover, evidence suggests a link between temperature and population size structure, but we lack an understanding of how this is mediated by species interactions when life history processes are food-dependent. Here, we use a dynamic stage-structured biomass model with food-, size- and temperature-dependent life history processes to assess how temperature affects coexistence, stability and size structure in a tri-trophic food chain. We show that predator biomass densities decline with warming either gradually or in the form of collapses, depending on which consumer life stage they predominantly feed on. Collapses occur when warming destabilizes the community and induces alternative stable states via Allee effects, which emerge when predators promote their own food source through predation. By contrast, warming at low temperatures stabilizes the community as limit cycles turn to fixed point dynamics, unless predators feed only on juveniles. Elevated costs of being large in warmer environments accelerate the decline in predator persistence and mean body size of the community. These results suggest that predator persistence in warmer climates may be lower than previously acknowledged when accounting for size- and food-dependence of life history processes, and that interactions within and between species can mediate the effects of warming on food web stability.\\n\\nSignificanceClimate warming is altering the dynamics and structure of aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Predicting food web reorganization under rising temperatures requires an understanding of physiological responses and ecological interactions of organisms, both of which depend on body size. We show that size variation within species, food-dependent growth and ecological interactions critically affect how food chains respond to warming. Specifically, warming can stabilize or destabilize food chains and expose predators to increased risk of sudden collapses, resulting in alternative stable food web states. Increasing temperatures can cause abrupt reductions in mean community body size, primarily due to loss of top predators. The potential loss of biodiversity and shifts in ecosystem stability are among the major challenges caused by a warming climate.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a highly conserved process that has profound effects on genome evolution. Recombination rates can vary drastically at a fine-scale across genomes and often localize to small recombination \\\"hotspots\\\" with highly elevated rates surrounded by regions with little recombination. Hotspot targeting to specific genomic locations is variable across species. In some mammals, hotspots have divergent landscapes between closely related species which is directed by the binding of the rapidly evolving protein, PRDM9. In many species outside of mammals, hotspots are generally conserved and tend to localize to regions with open chromatin such as transcription start sites. It remains unclear if the location of recombination hotspots diverge in taxa outside of mammals. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model to examine the evolution of recombination over short evolutionary timescales. Using an LD-based approach, we found recombination rates varied at a fine-scale across the genome, with many regions organized into narrow hotspots. Hotspots had divergent landscapes between stickleback populations, where only ~15% were shared, though part of this divergence could be due to demographic history. Additionally, we did not detect a strong association of PRDM9 with recombination hotspots in threespine stickleback fish. Our results suggest fine-scale recombination rates may be diverging between closely related populations of threespine stickleback fish and argue for additional molecular characterization to verify the extent of the divergence.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) provide a non-invasive way to evaluate the intraspecific genetic diversity of aquatic macroorganisms. However, erroneous sequences present in HTS data can result in false positive haplotypes; therefore, reliable strategies are necessary to eliminate such erroneous sequences when evaluating intraspecific genetic diversity using eDNA metabarcoding. In this study, we propose an approach combining denoising using amplicon sequence variant (ASV) method and the removal of haplotypes with low detection rates. A mixture of rearing water of Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) was used as an eDNA sample. In total, nine haplotypes of Ayu mitochondrial D-loop region were contained in the sample and amplified by two-step tailed PCR. The 15 PCR replicates indexed different tags were prepared from the eDNA sample to compare the detection rates between true haplotypes and false positive haplotypes. All PCR replications were sequenced by HTS, and the total number of detected true haplotypes and false positive haplotypes were compared with and without denoising using the two types of ASV methods, Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA2) and UNOISE3. The use of both ASV methods considerably reduced the number of false positive haplotypes. Moreover, all true haplotypes were detected in all 15 PCR, whereas false positive haplotypes had detection rates varying from 1/15 to 15/15. Thus, by removing haplotypes with lower detection rates than 15/15, the number of false positive haplotypes were further reduced. The approach proposed in this study successfully eliminated most of false positive haplotypes in the HTS data obtained from eDNA samples, which allowed us to improve the detection accuracy for evaluating intraspecific genetic diversity using eDNA analysis.",

It can lead to the expression of multiple protein isoforms originating from the same mRNA. Here we show that a novel, abundant and long isoform of the stress/p38MAPK-activated kinase MK2, a key regulator of transcription, migration, death signaling and post-transcriptional gene regulation, is constitutively translated from an alternative CUG translation initiation start site located in the 5'UTR of its mRNA. GC-rich sequences and putative G-quadruplex structures influence the usage of that codon as a translation initiation start site and the RNA helicase eIF4A1 is needed to ensure alternative isoform translation. We recapitulated the usage of the alternative start codon and determined the molecular properties of the short and a long MK2 isoforms. Phenotypically, only the short isoform phosphorylated Hsp27, supported migration and stress-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression. Interaction profiling by quantitative mass-spectrometry revealed short isoform-specific binding partners that were associated with migration. In contrast, the long isoform contains additional putative phosphorylation sites in its unique N-terminus. In sum, our data reveal a longer and previously non-described isoform of MK2 with distinct physiological properties originating from alternative translation.",

Despite extensive efforts, most findings are difficult to reproduce due to high levels of individual variance in phenotypic expression. To quantify individual differences in brain morphometry in ASD, we implemented a novel subject-level, distance-based method on subject-specific attributes. In a large multi-cohort sample, each subject with ASD (n=100; n=84 males; mean age: 11.43 years; mean IQ: 110.58) was strictly matched to a control participant (n=100; n=84 males; mean age: 11.43 years; mean IQ: 110.70). Intrapair Euclidean distance of MRI brain morphometry and symptom severity measures were entered into a regularised machine learning pipeline for feature selection, with rigorous out-of-sample validation and bootstrapped permutation testing. Subject-specific structural morphometry features significantly predicted individual variation in ASD symptom severity (19 cortical thickness features, p=0.01, n=5000 permutations; 10 surface area features, p=0.006, n=5000 permutations). Findings remained robust across subjects and were replicated in validation samples. Identified cortical regions implicate key hubs of the salience and default mode networks as neuroanatomical features of social impairment in ASD. Present results highlight the importance of subject-level markers in ASD, and offer an important step forward in understanding the neurobiology of heterogeneous disorders.",

We previously reported selective antifungal 14-helical {beta}-peptides, but the mechanism of antifungal toxicity of {beta}-peptides remains unknown. To provide insight into the mechanism, we studied antifungal {beta}-peptide binding to artificial membranes and living Candida albicans cells. We investigated the ability of {beta}-peptides to interact with and permeate small unilamellar vesicle models of fungal and bacterial membranes. The partition coefficient supported a pore-mediated mechanism characterized by the existence of a critical {beta}-peptide concentration separating low and high partition coefficient regimes. Live cell intracellular tracking of {beta}-peptides showed that {beta}-peptides translocated into the cytoplasm, and then disrupted the nucleus and vacuole sequentially, leading to cell death. This understanding of the mechanisms of antifungal activity will facilitate design and development of peptidomimetic AMPs, including 14-helical {beta}-peptides, for antifungal applications.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=46 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/430850_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (14K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ee335org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66da40org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82d132org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7429e1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Markov state models (MSMs) are quantitative models of protein dynamics that are useful for uncovering the structural fluctuations that proteins undergo, as well as the mechanisms of these conformational changes. Given the enormity of conformational space, there has been ongoing interest in identifying a small number of states that capture the essential features of a protein. Generally, this is achieved by making assumptions about the properties of relevant features--for example, that the most important features are those that change slowly. An alternative strategy is to keep as many degrees of freedom as possible and subsequently learn from the model which of the features are most important. In these larger models, however, traditional approaches quickly become computationally intractable. In this paper, we present enspara, a library for working with MSMs that provides several novel algorithms and specialized data structures that dramatically improve the scalability of traditional MSM methods. This includes ragged arrays for minimizing memory requirements, MPI-parallelized implementations of compute-intensive operations, and a flexible framework for model estimation.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fischeri is closely related to Aspergillus fumigatus, the major cause of invasive mold infections. Even though A. fischeri is commonly found in diverse environments, including hospitals, it rarely causes invasive disease; why that is so is unclear. Comparison of A. fischeri and A. fumigatus for diverse pathogenic, genomic, and secondary metabolic traits revealed multiple differences for pathogenesis-related phenotypes, including that A. fischeri is less virulent than A. fumigatus in multiple animal models of disease, grows slower in low oxygen environments, and is more sensitive to oxidative stress. In contrast, the two species exhibit high genomic similarity; ~90% of the A. fumigatus proteome is conserved in A. fischeri, including 48/49 genes known to be involved in A. fumigatus virulence. However, only 10/33 A. fumigatus biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) likely involved in secondary metabolite production are conserved in A. fischeri and only 13/48 A. fischeri BGCs are conserved in A. fumigatus. Detailed chemical characterization of A. fischeri cultures grown on multiple substrates identified multiple secondary metabolites, including two new compounds and one never before isolated as a natural product. Interestingly, an A. fischeri deletion mutant of laeA, a master regulator of secondary metabolism, produced fewer secondary metabolites and in lower quantities, suggesting that regulation of secondary metabolism is at least partially conserved. These results suggest that the non-pathogenic A. fischeri possesses many of the genes important for A. fumigatus pathogenicity but is divergent with respect to its ability to thrive under host-relevant conditions and its secondary metabolism.\\n\\nImportanceAspergillus fumigatus is the primary cause of aspergillosis, a devastating ensemble of diseases associated with severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. A. fischeri is a close relative of A. fumigatus, but is not generally observed to cause human disease. To gain insights into the underlying causes of this remarkable difference in pathogenicity, we compared two representative strains (one from each species) for a range of host-relevant biological and chemical characteristics. We found that disease progression in multiple A. fischeri mouse models was slower and caused less mortality than A. fumigatus. The two species also exhibited different growth profiles when placed in a range of stress-inducing conditions encountered during infection, such as low levels of oxygen and the presence of reactive oxygen species-inducing agents. Interestingly, we also found that the vast majority of A. fumigatus genes known to be involved in virulence are conserved in A. fischeri, whereas the two species differ significantly in their secondary metabolic pathways.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeficient regulation of stress plays an important role in the escalation of substance use, addiction and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests dysregulations in cognitive and reward-related processes and the underlying neural circuitry in cannabis dependence. However, despite the important regulatory role of the endocannabinoid system in the stress response, associations between chronic cannabis use and altered stress processing on the neural level have not been systematically examined.\n\nMethodsAgainst this background, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)study examined psycho-social stress processing in cannabis-dependent males (n = 28) and matched controls (n = 23) using an established stress-induction paradigm (Montreal Imaging Stress Task) that combines computerized (adaptive) mental arithmetic challenges with social evaluative threat.\n\nResultsDuring psycho-social stress exposure, but not the no-stress condition, cannabis users demonstrated impaired performance relative to controls. In contrast, levels of experienced stress and cardiovascular stress responsivity did not differ from controls. Functional MRI data revealed that stress-induced performance deteriorations in cannabis users were accompanied by decreased precuneus activity and increased connectivity of this region with the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex.\n\nLimitationsOnly male cannabis-dependent users were examined, the generalizability in female users remains to be determined.\n\nConclusionTogether, the present findings provide first evidence for exaggerated stress-induced cognitive performance deteriorations in cannabis users. The neural data suggest that deficient stress-related dynamics of the precuneus may mediate the deterioration of performance on the behavioral level.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a major health burden, calling for new mechanistic and therapeutic insights. CRISPR-mediated gene editing shows promise to cure genetic pathologies, although hitherto it has mostly been applied ex-vivo. Its translational potential for treating non-genetic pathologies is still unexplored. Furthermore, neurological diseases represent an important challenge for the application of CRISPR, because of the need in many cases to manipulate gene function of neurons in situ. A variant of CRISPR, CRISPRa, offers the possibility to modulate the expression of endogenous genes by directly targeting their promoters. We asked if this strategy can effectively treat acquired focal epilepsy, focusing on ion channels because their manipulation is known be effective in changing network hyperactivity and hypersynchronisation. We applied a doxycycline-inducible CRISPRa technology to increase the expression of the potassium channel gene Kcna1 (encoding Kv1.1) in mouse hippocampal excitatory neurons. CRISPRa-mediated Kv1.1 upregulation led to a substantial decrease in neuronal excitability. Continuous video-EEG telemetry showed that AAV9-mediated delivery of CRISPRa, upon doxycycline administration, decreased spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, and rescued cognitive impairment and transcriptomic alterations associated with chronic epilepsy. The focal treatment minimizes concerns about off-target effects in other organs and brain areas. This study provides the proof of principle for a translational CRISPR-based approach to treat neurological diseases characterized by abnormal circuit excitability.",

Building on our recent work [J Theor Biol 389, 146-158 (2016)] we develop a 3D agent-based model, capable of tracking hundreds of thousands of interacting cells, over time scales ranging from seconds to years. Cell dynamics is driven by a Monte Carlo solver, incorporating partial differential equations to describe chemical pathways and the activation/repression of \\\"genes\\\", leading to the up- or down-regulation of specific cell markers. Each cell-agent of different kind (stem, cancer, stromal etc.) runs through its cycle, undergoes division, can exit to a dormant, senescent, necrotic state, or apoptosis, according to the inputs from their systemic network. The basic network at this stage describes glucose/oxygen/ATP cycling, and can be readily extended to cancer-cell specific markers. Eventual accumulation of chemical/radiation damage to each cells DNA is described by a Markov chain of internal states, and by a damage-repair network, whose evolution is linked to the cell systemic network. Aimed at a direct comparison with experiments of tumorsphere growth from stem cells, the present model will allow to quantitatively study the role of transcription factors involved in the reprogramming and variable radio-resistance of simulated cancer-stem cells, evolving in a realistic computer simulation of a growing multicellular tumorsphere.",

Similar observations, sometimes implicating other sections of the hippocampus, have been made for aging populations and for people with neurodegenerative diseases that affect the hippocampus. These data support the hypothesis that hippocampal volume relates to navigation ability. However, the support for this hypothesis is mixed in healthy, young adults, who range widely in their navigation ability. Here, we administered a naturalistic navigation task that measures cognitive map accuracy to a sample of 90 healthy, young adults who also had MRI scans. Using a sequential analysis design with a registered analysis plan, we did not find that navigation ability related to hippocampal volume (total, right only, right posterior only). We conclude that navigation ability in a typical population does not correlate with variations in hippocampal size, and consider possible explanations for this null result.",

Here, we use single-cell analysis to identify distinct mechanisms through which breast composition and cell state affect hormone signaling. We show that prior pregnancy reduces the transcriptional response of hormone-responsive (HR+) epithelial cells, whereas high body mass index (BMI) reduces overall HR+ cell proportions. These distinct changes both impact neighboring cells by effectively reducing the magnitude of paracrine signals originating from HR+ cells. Because pregnancy and high BMI are known to protect against hormone-dependent breast cancer in premenopausal women, our findings directly link breast cancer risk with person-to-person heterogeneity in hormone responsiveness. More broadly, our findings illustrate how cell proportions and cell state can collectively impact cell communities through the action of cell-to-cell signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Reintroductions are essential to many conservation programmes, and thus much research has focussed on understanding what determines the success of these translocation interventions. However, while reintroductions disrupt both the abiotic and social environments, there has been less focus on the consequences of social disruption. Therefore, here we investigate if moving familiar social groups may help animals (particularly naive juveniles) adjust to their new environment and increase the chances of population establishment. We used social network analysis to study changes in group composition and individual sociality across a reintroduction of 40 juvenile hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a threatened New Zealand passerine. We collected observations of groups before a translocation to explore whether social behaviour before the reintroduction predicted associations after, and whether reintroduction influenced individual sociality (degree). We also assessed whether grouping familiar birds during temporary captivity in aviaries maintained group structure and individual sociality, compared to our normal translocation method (aviaries of random familiarity). Following release, we measured if survival depended on how individual sociality had changed. By comparing these analyses with birds that remained at the source site, we found that translocation lead to re-assortment of groups: non-translocated birds maintained their groups, but translocated juveniles formed groups with both familiar and unfamiliar birds. Aviary holding did not improve group cohesion; instead, juveniles were less likely to associate with aviary-mates. Finally, we found that translocated juveniles that lost the most associates experienced a small but significant tendency for higher mortality. This suggests sociality loss may have represented a disruption that affected their ability to adapt to a new site.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing methods have been increasingly used to understand cellular heterogeneity. Nevertheless, most of these methods suffer from one or more limitations, such as focusing only on polyadenylated RNA, sequencing of only the 3 end of the transcript, an exuberant fraction of reads mapping to ribosomal RNA, and the unstranded nature of the sequencing data. Here, we developed a novel single cell strand-specific total RNA library preparation method addressing all the aforementioned shortcomings. Our method was validated on a microfluidics system using three different cancer cell lines undergoing a chemical or genetic perturbation. We demonstrate that our total RNA-seq method detects an equal or higher number of genes compared to classic polyA[+] RNA-seq, including novel and non-polyadenylated genes. The obtained RNA expression patterns also recapitulate the expected biological signal. Inherent to total RNA-seq, our method is also able to detect circular RNAs. Taken together, SMARTer single cell total RNA sequencing is very well suited for any single cell sequencing experiment in which transcript level information is needed beyond polyadenylated genes.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the last decades, vaccination has been key to prevent and eradicate infectious diseases. However, many pathogens (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, dengue and others) have resisted vaccine development efforts, largely due to the failure to induce potent antibody responses targeting conserved epitopes. Deep profiling of human B-cells often reveals potent neutralizing antibodies that emerge from natural infection, but these specificities are generally subdominant (i.e., are present in low titers). A major challenge for next-generation vaccines is to overcome established immunodominance hierarchies and focus antibody responses on crucial neutralization epitopes. Here, we show that a computationally designed epitope-focused immunogen presenting a single RSV neutralization epitope elicits superior epitope-specific responses compared to the viral fusion protein. In addition, the epitope-focused immunogen efficiently boosts antibodies targeting the Palivizumab epitope, resulting in enhanced neutralization. Overall, we show that epitope-focused immunogens can boost subdominant neutralizing antibody responses in vivo and reshape established antibody hierarchies.",

    "abstract": "Both reciprocity and positive assortment (like with like) are predicted to promote the evolution of cooperation, yet how partners influence each others behavior within dynamic networks is not well understood. One way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behavior (the \\\"direct effect\\\"), and plasticity within individuals in response to the social environment (the \\\"indirect effect\\\"). A positive correlation between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate social contagion and selection on cooperative behavior. Testing this hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated measures of behavior across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an automated data-logging system to quantify the behavior of 179 wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions, and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in cooperative behavior. Our results show strong positive correlations between a birds own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners, consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation. These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can facilitate selection for cooperative behavior within social networks.",

    "abstract": "Brain functional networks identified from fMRI data can provide potential biomarkers for brain disorders. Group independent component analysis (GICA) is popular for extracting brain functional networks from multiple subjects. In GICA, different strategies exist for reconstructing subject-specific networks from the group-level networks. However, it is unknown whether these strategies have different sensitivities to group differences and abilities in distinguishing patients. Among GICA, spatio-temporal regression (STR) and spatially constrained ICA approaches such as group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA) can be used to propagate components (indicating networks) to a new subject that is not included in the original subjects. In this study, based on the same a priori network maps, we reconstructed subject-specific networks using these two methods separately from resting-state fMRI data of 151 schizophrenia patients (SZs) and 163 healthy controls (HCs). We investigated group differences in the estimated functional networks and the functional network connectivity (FNC) obtained by each method. The networks were also used as features in a cross-validated support vector machine (SVM) for classifying SZs and HCs. We selected features using different strategies to provide a comprehensive comparison between the two methods. GIG-ICA generally showed greater sensitivity in statistical analysis and better classification performance (accuracy 76.45{+/-}8.9%, sensitivity 0.74{+/-}0.11, specificity 0.79{+/-}0.11) than STR (accuracy 67.45{+/-}8.13%, sensitivity 0.65{+/-}0.11, specificity 0.71{+/-}0.11). Importantly, results were also consistent when applied to an independent dataset including 82 HCs and 82 SZs. Our work suggests that the functional networks estimated by GIG-ICA are more sensitive to group differences, and GIG-ICA is promising for identifying image-derived biomarkers of brain disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent research shows that shared access to belowground resources drives plants to overproliferate fine roots competitively, limiting community-level aboveground biomass. Models of this phenomenon are commonly based on an assumption that belowground resources and fine roots are thoroughly well mixed. In reality, of course, fine roots are spatially structured by individual. Here we investigate how costs of sending roots through horizontal space influence incentives for fine-root overproliferation. We find that these costs restrain overproliferation to the net benefit of community aboveground biomass. And further, the costs eliminate incentives for individuals to grow fine roots beyond their closest neighbors. Plants that interact with the fewest competitors benefit the most in relative fitness from overproliferation of fine roots. Effectively, individual-based optimization of root allocation in space increases the effects of competition while decreasing the number of individual competitors for each individual.\\n\\nBecause an individuals optimal competitive network consists of only the closest neighbors, we predict the full effects of competition are achieved just shortly after disturbance, making competition belowground an almost inescapable pressure on plants. Together these results have important implications for predicting plant interaction networks, patterns of carbon allocation, and ecosystem carbon storage.",

    "abstract": "The first few months of juvenile independence is a critical period for survival as young must learn new behaviours to forage efficiently. Social learning by observing parents (vertical transmission) or others (horizontal/oblique transmission) may be important to overcome naivety, but these tutors are likely to differ in their reliability due to variation in their own experience. How young animals use different social information sources, however, has received little attention. Here we tested if wild juvenile hihi (Notiomystis cincta, a New Zealand passerine) retained foraging behaviours learned from parents, or if behaviour changed after independence in response to peers. We first trained parents with feeders during chick rearing: one-third could access food from any direction, one-third could access food from one side only, and the remaining third had no feeder. During post-fledge parental care, juveniles chose the same side as their parents. Once independent, juveniles formed mixed-treatment groups naturally so we then presented feeders with two equally profitable sides. Juveniles with natal feeder experience were quicker to use these feeders initially, but side choice was now random. Over time, however, juveniles converged on using one side of the feeder (which differed between groups). This apparent conformity was because juvenile hihi paid attention to the behaviour of their group and were more likely to choose the locally-favoured side as the number of visits to that side increased. They did not copy the choice of specific individuals, even when they were more social or more familiar with the preceding bird. Our study shows that early social experiences with parents affect foraging decisions, but later social environments lead juveniles to modify their behaviour.",
