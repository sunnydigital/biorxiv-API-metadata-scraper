    "abstract": "We present ampliCan, an analysis tool for genome editing that unites highly precise quantification and visualization of genuine genome editing events. ampliCan features nuclease-optimized alignments, filtering of experimental artifacts, event-specific normalization, off-target read detection and quantifies insertions, deletions, HDR repair as well as targeted base editing. It is scalable to thousands of amplicon sequencing-based experiments from any genome editing experiment, including CRISPR. It enables automated integration of controls and accounts for biases at every step of the analysis. We benchmarked ampliCan on both real and simulated datasets against other leading tools, demonstrating that it outperformed all in the face of common confounding factors.",

    "abstract": "Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA-seq has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. While most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, we focus on three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. While each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments is an essential goal of population and quantitative genetics. While technological advances now allow interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation is still limited. To address this limitation, we use extensive forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of variation in demography, trait genetics, and selection on the rate and mode of adaptation and the resulting genetic architecture. We simulate a population adapting to an optimum shift, modeling sequence variation for 20 QTL for each of 12 different demographies for 100 different traits varying in the effect size distribution of new mutations, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the contribution of the genomic background. We then use random forest regression approaches to learn the relative importance of input parameters in determining a number of aspects of the process of adaptation including the speed of adaptation, the relative frequency of hard sweeps and sweeps from standing variation, or the final genetic architecture of the trait. We find that selective sweeps occur even for traits under relatively weak selection and where the genetic background explains most of the variation. Though most sweeps occur from variation segregating in the ancestral population, new mutations can be important for traits under strong stabilizing selection that undergo a large optimum shift. We also show that population bottlenecks and expansion impact overall genetic variation as well as the relative importance of sweeps from standing variation and the speed with which adaptation can occur. We then compare our results to two traits under selection during maize domestication, showing that our simulations qualitatively recapitulate differences between them. Overall, our results underscore the complex population genetics of individual loci in even relatively simple quantitative trait models, but provide a glimpse into the factors that drive this complexity and the potential of these approaches for understanding polygenic adaptation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMany traits are controlled by a large number of genes, and environmental changes can lead to shifts in trait optima. How populations adapt to these shifts depends on a number of parameters including the genetic basis of the trait as well as population demography. We simulate a number of trait architectures and population histories to study the genetics of adaptation to distant trait optima. We find that selective sweeps occur even in traits under relatively weak selection and our machine learning analyses find that demography and the effect sizes of mutations have the largest influence on genetic variation after adaptation. Maize domestication is a well suited model for trait adaptation accompanied by demographic changes. We show how two example traits under a maize specific demography adapt to a distant optimum and demonstrate that polygenic adaptation is a well suited model for crop domestication even for traits with major effect loci.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative evaluation of binding affinity changes upon mutations is crucial for protein engineering and drug design. Machine learning-based methods are gaining increasing momentum in this field. Due to the limited number of experimental data, using a small number of sensitive predictive features is vital to the generalization and robustness of such machine learning methods. Here we introduce a fast and reliable predictor of binding affinity changes upon single point mutation, based on a random forest approach. Our method, iSEE, uses a limited number of interface Structure, Evolution and Energy-based features for the prediction. iSEE achieves, using only 31 features, a high prediction performance with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.80 and a root mean square error of 1.41 kcal mol-1 on a diverse training dataset consisting of 1102 mutations in 57 protein-protein complexes. It competes with existing state-of-the-art methods on two blind test datasets. Predictions for a new dataset of 540 mutations in 58 protein complexes from the recently published SKEMPI 2.0 database reveals that none of the current methods perform well (PCC<0.4), although their combination does improve the predictions. Feature analysis for iSEE underlines the significance of evolutionary conservations for quantitative prediction of mutation effects.",

Although the rates at which mutations occur vary considerably between species, little is known about differences within species, or the genetic and molecular basis of these differences. Here we leveraged the power of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to uncover natural genetic variants that underlie variation in mutation rate. We developed a high-throughput fluctuation assay and used it to quantify mutation rates in natural yeast isolates and in 1040 segregant progeny from a cross between BY, a lab strain, and RM, a wine strain. We observed that mutation rate varies among yeast strains and is highly heritable (H2=0.46). We performed linkage mapping in the segregants and identified four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying mutation rate variation in the cross. We fine-mapped two QTLs to the underlying causal genes, RAD5 and MKT1, that contribute to mutation rate variation. These genes also underlie sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents 4NQO and MMS, suggesting a connection between spontaneous mutation rate and mutagen sensitivity.",

Our workflow identifies a random forest as the best algorithm for these targets over more sophisticated neural network-based models. The top 250 predictions from our selected random forest recover 37 of the 54 active compounds from a library of 22,434 new molecules assayed on PriA-SSB.

    "abstract": "By combining the classic Golgi method and the electron microscope, we have gained a better understanding of the anastomosis of CNS blood capillaries. The participation of growing capillary leading endothelial cells filopodia in the anastomotic process is described. The two approaching capillaries leading endothelial cells filopodia intermingle and interact forming complex conglomerates with narrow spaces filled with proteinaceous material (possibly basal lamina) secreted by them. The presence of tight junctions among the filopodia corroborates their vascular nature. Their presence also suggests a different endothelial cells origin as will those from the two approaching capillaries. The original narrow spaces coalesce into larger ones leading to the eventual formation of a single one that will interconnect (anastomose) the two capillaries. The newly formed post-anastomotic CNS capillaries are rather small with irregular and narrow lumina that might permit the passage of fluid but not yet of blood cells. Eventually, the new capillaries lumina will enlarge permitting the passage of blood cells.\\n\\nFunding informationThe M. M-P.

    "abstract": "Odorants of behaviorally relevant objects (e.g., food sources) intermingle with those from other sources. Therefore, to sniff out whether an odor source is good or bad - without actually visiting it - animals first need to segregate the odorants from different sources. To do so, animals could use temporal cues, since odorants from one source exhibit correlated fluctuations, while odorants from different sources are less correlated. However, it remains unclear whether animals can rely solely on temporal cues for odor source segregation. Here we show that 1) flies can use a few milliseconds differences in odorant arrival to segregate a target odorant from a binary mixture, 2) segregation does not improve when the target odorant arrives first, and 3) segregation works for odorants with innate, as well as learned valences. These properties of odor segregation parallel those of concurrent sound segregation and figure-ground segregation by onset asynchrony in humans.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing the quality of proteomics data collected from a mass spectrometer (MS) requires careful selection of acquisition parameters and proper assessment of instrument performance. Software tools capable of extracting a broad set of information from raw files, including meta, scan, quantification, and identification data are needed to provide guidance for MS system management. In this work, direct extraction and utilization of these data from Thermo Orbitrap raw files is demonstrated using the RawTools software. RawTools is a standalone tool for extracting meta and scan data directly from raw MS files generated on Thermo Orbitrap instruments. RawTools generates summarized and detailed plain text outputs after parsing individual raw files, including scan rates and durations, duty cycle characteristics, precursor and reporter ion quantification, and chromatography performance. RawTools also contains a diagnostic module that includes an optional  preview database search for facilitating informed decision-making related to optimization of MS performance based on a variety of metrics. RawTools has been developed in C# and utilizes the Thermo RawFileReader library, and thus can process raw MS files with high speed and high efficiency on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). To demonstrate the utility of RawTools, extraction of meta and scan data from both individual and large collections of raw MS files was carried out to identify problematic characteristics of instrument performance. Taken together, the combined rich feature-set of RawTools with the capability for interrogation of MS and experiment performance makes this software a valuable tool for proteomics researchers.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have brought a breakthrough in our understanding of the process of eukaryotic DNA replication termination. We have shown that the process of replication machinery (replisome) disassembly at the termination of DNA replication forks in S-phase of the cell cycle is driven through polyubiquitylation of one of the replicative helicase subunits Mcm7. Our previous work in C.elegans embryos suggested also an existence of a back-up pathway of replisome disassembly in mitosis. Here we show, that in Xenopus laevis egg extract, any replisome retained on chromatin after S-phase is indeed removed from chromatin in mitosis. This mitotic disassembly pathway depends on formation of K6 and K63 ubiquitin chains on Mcm7 by TRAIP ubiquitin ligase and activity of p97/VCP protein segregase. The mitotic replisome pathway is therefore conserved through evolution in higher eukaryotes. However, unlike in lower eukaryotes it does not require SUMO modifications. This process can also remove any helicases from chromatin, including \\\"active\\\" stalled ones, indicating a much wider application of this pathway than just a \\\"back-up\\\" for terminated helicases.",

However, we still lack a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms and in particular, of the epigenetic basis for these changes. We have examined genome-wide distribution maps of H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 by ChIP-seq and the transcriptome by RNA-seq, of midguts from Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes infected with natural isolates of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in Burkina Faso. We report 15,916 regions containing differential histone modification enrichment, of which 8,339 locate at promoters and/or intersect with genes. The functional annotation of these regions allowed us to identify infection responsive genes showing differential enrichment in various histone modifications, such as CLIP pro-teases, anti-microbial peptides encoding genes, and genes related to melanization responses and the complement system. Further, the motif analysis of regions differentially enriched in various histone modifications predicts binding sites that might be involved in the cis-regulation of these regions such as Deaf1, Pangolin and Dorsal transcription factors (TFs). Some of these TFs are known to regulate immunity gene expression in Drosophila and are involved in the Notch and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. The analysis of malaria infection-induced chromatin changes in mosquitoes is important not only to identify regulatory elements and genes underlying mosquito responses to a P. falciparum infection but also for possible applications to the genetic manipulation of mosquitoes and to other mosquito-borne systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundElectronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, e-cigarettes) are increasingly used for the self-administration of nicotine by various human populations, including previously nonsmoking adolescents. Studies in preclinical models are necessary to evaluate health impacts of ENDS including the development of nicotine addiction, effects of ENDS vehicles, flavorants and co-administered psychoactive substances such as {triangleup}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This study was conducted to validate a rat model useful for the study of nicotine effects delivered by inhalation of vapor created by ENDS.\n\nMethodsMale Sprague-Dawley rats (N=8) were prepared with radiotelemetry devices for the reporting of temperature and activity. Experiments subjected rats to inhalation of vapor generated by an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) adapted for rodents. Inhalation conditions included vapor generated by the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, Nicotine (1, 10, 30 mg/mL in the PG) and THC (12.5, 25 mg/mL).\n\nResultsNicotine inhalation increased spontaneous locomotion and decreased body temperature of rats. Pretreatment with the nicotinic cholinergic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented stimulant effects of nicotine vapor inhalation and attenuated the hypothermic response. Combined inhalation of nicotine and THC resulted in apparently independent effects which were either additive (hypothermia) or opposed (activity).\n\nConclusionsThese studies provide evidence that ENDS delivery of nicotine via inhalation results in nicotine-typical effects on spontaneous locomotion and thermoregulation in male rats. Effects were blocked by a nicotinic antagonist, demonstrating mechanistic specificity. This system will therefore support additional studies of the contribution of atomizer/wick design, vehicle constituents and/or flavorants to the effects of nicotine administered by ENDS.",

Yet, accessing the localized strategies preserving chromatin domain inheritance, specifically the transfer of parental, pre-existing nucleosomes with their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs) during DNA replication is challenging in living cells. We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at single desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells such that their fate after DNA replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through the local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation. Notably, altering cell fate leads to an adjustment in the positional inheritance of parental nucleosomes that reflects the corresponding changes in chromatin structure. These findings point to important mechanisms that contribute to parental nucleosome segregation to preserve cellular identity.",

However, its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or \\\"nonWF\\\" model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use. These two key features allow SLiM 3 models to go beyond the Wright-Fisher model, opening up new horizons for forward genetic modeling.",

    "abstract": "To infer the sequence and RNA structure specificities of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) from experiments that enrich for bound sequences, we introduce a convolutional residual network which we call ResidualBind. ResidualBind significantly outperforms previous methods on experimental data from many RBP families. We interrogate ResidualBind to identify what features it has learned from high-affinity sequences with saliency analysis along with 1st-order and 2nd-order in silico mutagenesis. We show that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that includes the number of motifs, their spacing, and both positive and negative effects of RNA structure context. Strikingly, ResidualBind learns RNA structure context, including detailed base-pairing relationships, directly from sequence data, which we confirm on synthetic data. ResidualBind is a powerful, flexible, and interpretable model that can uncover cis-recognition preferences across a broad spectrum of RBPs.",

    "abstract": "Control of chronic CNS infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii requires an ongoing T cell response in the brain. Immunosuppressive cytokines are also important for preventing lethal immunopathology during chronic infection. To explore the loss of suppressive cytokine exclusively during the chronic phase of infection we blocked IL-10 receptor (IL-10R). Blockade was associated with widespread changes in the inflammatory response, including increased antigen presenting cell (APC) activation, expansion of CD4+ T cells, and increased neutrophil recruitment to the brain, consistent with previous reports. We then sought to identify regulatory mechanisms contributing to IL-10 production, focusing on ICOS (inducible T cell costimulator), a molecule that promotes IL-10 production in many systems. Unexpectedly, ICOS-ligand (ICOSL) blockade led to a local expansion of effector T cells in the inflamed brain without affecting IL-10 production or APC activation. Instead, we found that ICOSL blockade led to changes in T cells associated with their proliferation and survival. Specifically, we observed increased expression of IL-2 associated signaling molecules, including CD25, STAT5 phosphorylation, Ki67, and Bcl-2 in T cells in the brain. Interestingly, increases in CD25 and Bcl-2 were not observed following IL-10R blockade. Also unlike IL-10R blockade, ICOSL blockade led to an expansion of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the brain, with no expansion of peripheral T cell populations or neutrophil recruitment to the brain Overall, these results suggest that IL-10 and ICOS differentially regulate T cell responses in the brain during chronic T. gondii infection.",

A following in-silico characterization showed that when trying to estimate forces form the forearm muscles acting around the wrist joint, our novel estimator is able to decrease the mean estimation bias by about 25% of the true value of muscle force.

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuiescence (G0) is a transient, cell cycle-arrested state. By entering G0, cancer cells survive unfavorable conditions such as chemotherapy and cause relapse. While G0 cells have been studied at the transcriptome level, how post-transcriptional regulation contributes to their chemoresistance remains unknown.\\n\\nResultsWe induced chemoresistant and quiescent (G0) leukemic cells by serum-starvation or chemotherapy treatment. To study post-transcriptional regulation in G0 leukemic cells, we systematically analyzed their transcriptome, translatome, and proteome. We find that our resistant G0 cells recapitulate gene expression profiles of in vivo chemoresistant leukemic and G0 models. In G0 cells, canonical translation initiation is inhibited; yet we find that inflammatory genes are highly translated, indicating alternative post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, AU-rich elements (AREs) are significantly enriched in the up-regulated G0 translatome and transcriptome. Mechanistically, we find the stress-responsive p38 MAPK-MK2 signaling pathway stabilizes ARE mRNAs by phosphorylation and inactivation of mRNA decay factor, tristetraprolin (TTP) in G0. This permits expression of ARE-bearing TNF and DUSP1 that promote chemoresistance. Conversely, inhibition of TTP phophorylation by p38 MAPK inhibitors and non-phosphorylatable TTP mutant decreases ARE mRNAs and sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, co-inhibiting p38 MAPK and TNF--prior to or along with chemotherapy--substantially reduced chemoresistance in primary leukemic cells ex vivo and in vivo.\\n\\nConclusionsThese studies uncover post-transcriptional regulation underlying chemoresistance in leukemia. Our data reveal the p38 MAPK-MK2-TTP axis as a key regulator of expression of ARE bearing mRNAs that promote chemoresistance. By disrupting this pathway, we developed an effective combination therapy against chemosurvival.",

    "abstract": "Many protein homeostasis stressors induce the formation of membraneless cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) that contain large assemblies of repressed mRNAs and associated RNA binding proteins. Similar stressors have been shown to globally alter the function of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that ubiquitin and specific UPS components co-localize with SGs and that reducing the abundance or activity of ubiquitin pathway proteins can inhibit SG formation. These studies suggest that SG dynamics and composition may be regulated by ubiquitylation of SG resident proteins. Using ubiquitin-specific proteomic approaches, we demonstrate that many proteins, including some SG proteins are dynamically ubiquitylated upon SG-inducing sodium arsenite treatment. We utilized potent and selective inhibitors of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (UAE) or the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) to directly test if active protein ubiquitylation or neddylation was required for SG dynamics. Using ubiquitin-site specific proteomics, we establish that UAE inhibition results in the rapid loss of nearly all protein ubiquitylation regardless of ubiquitin chain type. Addition of UAE or NAE inhibitors to cells did not alter arsenite-induced SG formation or dissolution. While we confirmed that ubiquitin co-localizes with both sodium arsenite and thapsigargin-induced SGs, antibodies that recognize all forms of ubiquitin more strongly co-localize with SGs compared to antibodies that preferentially recognize polyubiquitin or specific polyubiquitin-linkages. Interestingly, ubiquitin itself co-localizes with SGs in a UAE independent manner suggesting that the ubiquitin present within SGs is likely unconjugated ubiquitin. Our findings clearly demonstrate that active protein ubiquitylation or neddylation is not required for SG dynamics. These results suggest that ubiquitin-binding SG proteins may recruit free ubiquitin into SGs to modulate SG protein interactions.",

We have demonstrated that rat bone marrow derived MSCs are able to differentiate into germ-line cells in vitro which has an enormous scope in the advancement of fertility research. In future, this technique can be utilized in different domestic animal species for propagation of elite germ plasm.\\n\\nAbstractGerm cells undergo distinctive male or female pathways to produce spermatozoa or oocyte respectively essential for sexual reproduction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the capacity of trans-differentiation to form the multiple lineages of cells of mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm origin. Herein, MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and characterized by their morphological features, expression of surface markers by immunophenotyping and molecular biology tools as well as self renewal and differentiation capability. Thereafter, by inducing these cells with retinoic acid we could able to show that bone marrow derived MSCs are able to trans-differentiate into male germ cell-like cells which were further characterized by the expressions of germ cell specific markers. This in vitro study for the generation of germ-like cells suggests that bone marrow MSCs can be a potential source of germ cells that could be a sustainable source of sperm / oocyte production for potential therapeutic applications in future. Moreover, this technique can be applied in different domestic animal species for propagation of elite germ plasm.",

    "abstract": "Gastrulation is the first major morphogenetic event during animal embryogenesis. Ascidian gastrulation starts with the invagination of 10 endodermal precursor cells between the 64- and late 112-cell stages. This process occurs in the absence of endodermal cell division and in two steps, driven by myosin-dependent contractions of the acto-myosin network. First, endoderm precursors constrict their apex. Second, they shorten apico-basally, while retaining small apical surfaces, thereby causing invagination. The mechanisms controlling the endoderm mitotic delay, the step 1 to step 2 transition, and apico-basal shortening have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the conserved role during invagination of Nodal and Eph signalling in two distantly related ascidian species (Phallusia mammillata and Ciona intestinalis). We show that the transition to step 2 is controlled by Nodal relayed by Eph signalling and that Eph signalling has a Nodal-independent role in mitotic delay. Interestingly, both Nodal and Eph signals are dispensable for endodermal germ layer fate specification.\n\nSummary statementIdentification of a regulatory developmental signalling sub-network driving endoderm cell shape changes during ascidian endoderm invagination, not involved in cell fate specification.",

    "abstract": "We show that the looping mediated transcription activation by the combinatorial transcription factors (TFs) can be achieved via directional-dependent propulsion, tethered sliding and tethered binding-sliding-unbinding modes. In the propulsion mode, the first arrived TF at the cis-regulatory motifs (CRMs) further recruits other TFs via protein-protein interactions. Such TFs complex has two different types of DNA binding domains (DBDs) viz. DBD1 which forms tight site-specific complex with CRMs via hydrogen bonding network and the promoter specific DBD2s which form nonspecific interactions around CRMs. When the sum of these specific and cumulative nonspecific interactions is sufficient, then the flanking DNA of CRMs will be bent into a circle over the TFs complex. The number of TFs involved in the combinatorial regulation plays critical role here. When the site-specific interactions and the cumulative nonspecific interactions are strong enough to resist the dissociation, then the sliding of DBD2s well within the Onsager radius associated with the DBD2s-DNA interface towards the promoter is the only possible way to release the elastic stress of the bent DNA. The DBD2s form tight synaptosome complex upon finding the promoter via sliding. When the number of TFs is not enough to bend the DNA in to a circle, then tethered sliding or tethered binding-sliding-unbinding modes are the possibilities. In tethered sliding, the CRMs-TFs complex forms nonspecific contacts with DNA via dynamic loops and then slide along DNA towards promoter without dissociation. In tethered binding-sliding-unbinding, the CRMs-TFs performs several cycles of nonspecific binding-sliding-unbinding before finding the promoter. Elastic and entropic energy barriers associated with the looping of DNA shape up the distribution of distances between CRMs and promoters. The combinatorial regulation of TFs in eukaryotes has evolved to overcome the looping energy barrier.",
