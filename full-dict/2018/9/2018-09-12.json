    "abstract": "The Ras-Map kinase (MAPK) cascade underlies functional decisions in a wide range of cell types and organisms. In B cells, positive feedback-driven Ras activation is the proposed source of the digital (all-or-none) MAPK responses following antigen stimulation. However, an inability to measure endogenous Ras activity in living cells has hampered our ability to test this model directly. Here we leverage biosensors of endogenous Ras and ERK activity to revisit this question. We find that BCR ligation drives switch-like Ras activation and that lower BCR signaling output is required for the maintenance versus the initiation of Ras activation. Surprisingly, digital ERK responses persist in the absence of positive feedback-mediated Ras activation, and digital ERK is observed at a threshold level of Ras activation. These data suggest an independent analog-to-digital switch downstream of Ras activation, and reveals that multiple sources of signal amplification exist within the Ras-ERK module of the BCR pathway.",

    "abstract": "Stringent regulation of TNF signaling prevents aberrant inflammation. TNF engages the canonical NF-{kappa}B pathway for activating the RelA:p50 heterodimer, which mediates specific expressions of pro-inflammatory and immune response genes. Importantly, the NF-{kappa}B system discriminates between time-varied TNF inputs. Negative feedback regulators of the canonical pathway, including I{kappa}B, are thought to ensure transient RelA:p50 responses to brief TNF stimulations. The noncanonical NF-{kappa}B pathway controls a separate RelB activity associated with immune differentiation. In a systems modeling approach, we uncovered an unexpected role of p100, a constituent of the noncanonical pathway, in TNF signaling. Brief TNF stimulation of p100-deficient cells produced an additional late NF-{kappa}B activity consisted of the RelB:p50 heterodimer, which distorted the TNF-induced gene-expression program. Periodic TNF pulses augmented this RelB:p50 activity, which was reinforced by NF-{kappa}B-dependent RelB synthesis. In sum, the NF-{kappa}B system seems to engage distantly related molecules for enforcing dynamical and gene controls of immune-activating TNF signaling.",

    "abstract": "Sporopollenin is a ubiquitous and extremely chemically inert biopolymer that constitutes the outer wall of all land-plant spores and pollen grains. Sporopollenin protects the vulnerable plant gametes against a wide range of environmental assaults, and is considered as a prerequisite for the migration of early plants onto land. Despite its importance, the chemical structure of plant sporopollenin has remained elusive. Using a newly developed thioacidolysis degradative method together with state-of-the-art solid-state NMR techniques, we determined the detailed molecular structure of pine sporopollenin. We show that pine sporopollenin is primarily composed of aliphatic-polyketide-derived polyvinyl alcohol units and 7-O-p-coumaroylated C16 aliphatic units, crosslinked through a distinctive m-dioxane moiety featuring an acetal. Naringenin was also identified as a minor component of pine sporopollenin. This discovery answers the long-standing question about the chemical makeup of plant sporopollenin, laying the foundation for future investigations of sporopollenin biosynthesis and for design of new biomimetic polymers with desirable inert properties.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAchilles tendon ruptures lead to reduced ankle function and often limits recreational activity. Single-leg heel raises are often used clinically to characterize patient function. However, it is unclear how the structure of the Achilles tendon and plantarflexor muscles affects single-leg heel raise function. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a musculoskeletal model in order to simulate the effects of muscle-tendon unit (MTU) parameters on peak plantarflexion during this clinically-relevant task. The ankle joint was plantarflexed by two MTUs that represented the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. The optimal fiber length, maximal muscle force, muscle pennation, tendon stiffness, and resting ankle angle - a surrogate measure of tendon slack length - were iteratively adjusted to test the combined effects of each of these MTU parameters. Single-leg heel raises were simulated by maximally exciting the two plantarflexor MTUs for each model configuration (N = 161,051 simulations). Optimal muscle fiber and tendon slack lengths had the greatest effect on peak plantarflexion during simulated single-leg heel raises. Simulations that were unable to produce at least 30 degrees of plantarflexion had muscle fibers that were shorter than healthy muscle and longer tendon slack lengths. These findings highlight the importance of preserving muscle fascicle and tendon length following Achilles tendon injuries.\\n\\nFunding no funding has been provided for this research\\n\\nAcknowledgements the Authors have no acknowledgements\\n\\nConflict of interest the Authors have no conflicts of interest that are relevant to this work",

    "abstract": "Black pepper plants maintain synchronous vegetative growth and flowering during their lifetimes, even in the juvenile phase. How to limit the duration of flowering, facilitate a return to vegetative development should be studied. Light intensity has been reported to affect the levels of stored carbohydrates in some horticultural trees. However, it is unclear whether increased flowering intensity in adaptable light intensity is due to the regulation of carbohydrates in black pepper. Here, we report the characterization of carbohydrates and enzyme turnover in major source leaves under shading treatments during the juvenile phase of pepper. In addition to the previous finding that carbohydrate levels are correlated with flowering time, we report the novel finding that carbohydrate contents in the leaves control floral quantity. To gain insights into the underlying physiological mechanisms, we analyzed the effect of shading on sugar contents and floral transition, which revealed that shading regulated carbohydrate levels, an increase in starch accumulation improved floral quantity, and sucrose-starch ratio played a negative role in inflorescence quantity. Based on this analysis, we characterized the changes in enzyme activities in the leaves that affect carbohydrate dynamics and identified the key indicator enzymes and optimal shading intensity for the five developmental periods.\\n\\nHighlightWe identified the key carbohydrates, indicator enzymes and optimal shading intensity to control inflorescence quantity during the juvenile phase in black pepper for labor-saving.",

Here we show that T-antigen in Drosophila melanogaster macrophages is involved in their developmentally programmed tissue invasion. Higher macrophage T-antigen levels require an atypical major facilitator superfamily (MFS) member that we named Minerva which enables macrophage dissemination and invasion. We characterize for the first time the T and Tn glycoform O-glycoproteome of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo, and determine that Minerva increases the presence of T-antigen on protein pathways previously linked to cancer, most strongly on the protein sulfhydryl oxidase Qsox1 which we show is required for macrophage invasion. Minervas vertebrate ortholog, MFSD1, rescues the minerva mutants migration and T-antigen glycosylation defects. We thus identify a key conserved regulator that orchestrates O-glycosylation on a protein subset to activate a program governing migration steps important for both development and cancer metastasis.",

Here, we show that dermal condensates (DC), signaling niches for epithelial progenitors in hair placodes, are specified before niche formation and function. With 3D/4D microscopy we identify unclustered DC precursors. With population-based and single-cell transcriptomics we define a molecular time-lapse of dynamic niche signatures and the developmental trajectory as the DC lineage emerges from fibroblasts. Co-expression of downregulated fibroblast and upregulated DC genes in niche precursors reveals a transitory molecular state following a proliferation shutdown. Waves of transcription factor and signaling molecule expression then consolidate DC niche formation. Finally, ablation of epidermal Wnt signaling and placode-derived FGF20 demonstrates their requirement for DC-precursor specification.

    "abstract": "About 15,000 angiosperm species ([~]6%) have separate sexes, a phenomenon known as dioecy. Early work reported a lower species richness in dioecious compared to non-dioecious sister clades, which was taken to suggest that dioecy might be an evolutionary dead end. More recently, phylogenetic analyses using different methodologies have challenged this conclusion. Here, we used a population genomics approach to look for evidence of evolutionary handicaps of dioecy in the Silene genus at the molecular level. We obtained RNA-seq data of individuals from several populations in 13 closely related species with different breeding systems: seven dioecious, three hermaphroditic and three gynodioecious species. We show that dioecy is associated with increased genetic diversity and a higher selection efficacy both against deleterious and for beneficial mutations while controlling for differences in population size. We conclude that, in the Silene genus, dioecious species bear no sign of mutational burden or upcoming extinction. On the contrary, dioecious species harbor a higher potential for adaptation than their non-dioecious relatives. Our results do not support the evolutionary dead end hypothesis and re-open the question why dioecy is rare in angiosperms.\\n\\nSignificance statementDioecy (=separate sexes) is much rarer in flowering plants compared to animals and other organisms. The \\\"dead-end hypothesis\\\" states that dioecious plant populations might experience evolutionary handicaps such as low seed dispersal (as only 50% of the individuals, the females, contribute), which might cause high genetic drift, low adaptation and ultimately extinction. Here we tested this hypothesis by focusing on the genus Silene and by comparing the population genetics of 13 dioecious and non-dioecious species. We found that dioecious Silene species exhibit lower genetic drift and more adaptation compared to their non-dioecious relatives. Our results thus reject the dead-end hypothesis and re-open the question of why dioecy is rare in flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "Larger numbers of germline cell divisions can increase the number of mutations inherited by offspring. Therefore, in systems where the number of offspring is dependent on the number of germline cell divisions, a higher overall rate of molecular evolution may be expected. Here I examine whether colony size in social insects, which varies from tens to millions, influences molecular evolutionary rates by analyzing several recently collected datasets. First, I find that colony size is negatively correlated with GC-content across 115 ant genera, indicative of a positive relationship between substitution rate and colony size. Second, genome-wide rates of molecular evolution are positively correlated with colony size in three clades of social insects including eight species in the ant genus Pseudomyrmex, seven fungus-growing ants, and 11 bee species. The additional germline cell divisions necessary to maintain large colony sizes might lead to mutation accumulation in the germlines of queens of these species, a process similar to that which occurs in aging human males. I also find intensified constraint on DNA repair genes in species with large colonies, suggesting that the additional mutations that occur in these taxa increase selective pressure for improved replication fidelity. Colony size, a fundamental facet of eusociality, plays a previously unappreciated role in genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia bacteria have been identified as a tool for reducing the transmission of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti. Research groups around the world are now mass rearing Wolbachia infected Ae. aegypti for deliberate release. We investigated the fitness impact of a crucial element of mass rearing: the blood meal required by female Ae. aegypti to lay eggs. Although Ae. aegypti almost exclusively feed on human blood, it is often difficult to use human blood in disease-endemic settings. When females were fed on sheep or pig blood rather than human blood, egg hatch rates decreased in all three lines tested (uninfected, or infected by wMel, or wAlbB Wolbachia). This finding was particularly pronounced when fed on sheep blood, although fecundity was not affected. Some of these effects persisted after an additional generation on human blood. Attempts to keep populations on sheep and pig blood sources only partly succeeded, suggesting that strong adaptation is required to develop a stably infected line on an alternative blood source. There was a decrease in Wolbachia density when Wolbachia Ae. aegypti were fed on non-human blood sources, although density was higher again in lines kept for multiple generations on the alternate sources. These findings suggest that sheep and pig blood will entail a cost when used as alternative blood sources which needs to be taken into account when considering mass release.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin acetyltransferases Esco1 and Esco2 play a vital role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion. How Esco1 and Esco2 are controlled to achieve this in a DNA replication-coupled manner remains unclear in higher eukaryotes. Here we show that Cul4-RING ligases (CRL4s) play a critical role in sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. Depletion of Cul4A, Cul4B or Ddb1 subunits substantially reduces normal cohesion efficiency. We also show that Mms22L, a vertebrate ortholog of yeast Mms22, is one of Ddb1 and Cul4-associated factors (DCAFs) involved in cohesion. Several lines of evidence suggest a selective interaction of CRL4s with Esco2, but not Esco1. Depletion of either CRL4s or Esco2 causes a defect in Smc3 acetylation which can be rescued by HDAC8 inhibition. More importantly, both CRL4s and PCNA act as mediators for efficiently stabilizing Esco2 on chromatin and catalyzing Smc3 acetylation. Taken together, we propose an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which CRL4s and PCNA regulate Esco2-dependent establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe identified human Mms22L as a substrate specific adaptor of Cul4-Ddb1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Downregulation of Cul4A, Cul4B or Ddb1 subunit causes reduction of acetylated Smc3, via interaction with Esco2 acetyltransferase, and then impairs sister chromatid cohesion in 293T cells. We found functional complementation between Cul4-Ddb1-Mms22L E3 ligase and Esco2 in Smc3 acetylation and sister chromatid cohesion. Interestingly, both Cul4-Ddb1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and PCNA contribute to Esco2 mediated Smc3 acetylation. To summarise, we demonstrated an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in which Cul4-Ddb1 E3 ubiquitin ligases and PCNA regulate Esco2-dependent establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.",

Over many years, artificial selection has substantially improved milk production by cows. However, the genes underlying milk production quantitative trait loci (QTL) remain relatively poorly characterised. Here, we investigate a previously-reported QTL located at the CSF2RB locus, for several milk production phenotypes, to better understand its underlying genetic and molecular causes.\\n\\nResultsUsing a population of 29,350 taurine dairy cattle, we conducted association analyses for milk yield and composition traits, and identified highly significant QTL for milk yield, milk fat concentration, and milk protein concentration. Strikingly, protein concentration and milk yield appear to show co-located yet genetically distinct QTL. To attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that might be mediating these effects, gene expression data were used to investigate eQTL for eleven genes in the broader interval. This analysis highlighted genetic impacts on CSF2RB and NCF4 expression that share similar association signatures to those observed for lactation QTL, strongly implicating one or both of these genes as the cause of these effects. Using the same gene expression dataset representing 357 lactating cows, we also identified 38 novel RNA editing sites in the 3' UTR of CSF2RB transcripts. The extent to which two of these sites were edited also appears to be genetically co-regulated with lactation QTL, highlighting a further layer of regulatory complexity implicating the CSF2RB gene.\\n\\nConclusionsThis chromosome 5 locus presents a diversity of molecular and lactation QTL, likely representing multiple overlapping effects that, at a minimum, highlight the CSF2RB gene as having a causal role in these processes.",

    "abstract": "A common aim in high-dimensional association studies is the identification of the subset of investigated variables associated with a trait of interest. Using association statistics on the same variables for a second related trait can improve power. An important quantity in such analyses is the conditional false-discovery rate (cFDR), the probability of non-association with the trait of interest given p-value thresholds for both traits. The cFDR can be used for hypothesis testing and as a posterior probability in its own right. In this paper, we propose new estimators for the cFDR based on kernel density estimates and mixture-Gaussian models of effect sizes, the latter also allowing estimation of a  local form of cFDR (cfdr). We also propose a general non-parametric improvement to existing estimators based on estimating a posterior probability previously estimated at 1. We find that new estimators have the desirable property of smooth rejection regions, but, unexpectedly, do not improve the power of the method, even when distributional assumptions are true. Furthermore, we find that although the local cfdr represents a theoretically optimal decision boundary, noisiness in its estimation means it is less powerful than corresponding cFDR estimates. We find, however, that the non-parametric adjustment increases power for every estimator. We demonstrate the best method on transcriptome-wide association study datasets for breast and ovarian cancers. The findings from this analysis are of both theoretical and pragmatic interest, giving insight into the nature of cFDR and the behaviour of false-discovery rates in a two-dimensional setting. Our methods allow improved control over the behaviour of the cFDR estimator and improved power in high-dimensional hypothesis testing.",

    "abstract": "High-dose alkylator-based conditioning followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is a therapeutic mainstay for eligible patients with multiple myeloma. However, post-transplant relapses are common and prognostic biomarkers are scarce. Relapses are characterized by the influx of regulatory myeloid cells and dysfunctional T effectors. We have shown that myeloma-infiltrating myeloid cells produce versican (VCAN), a large matrix proteoglycan with tolerogenic activities. VCAN proteolysis by a-disintegrin-and-metalloproteinase-with-thrombospondin-motifs (ADAMTS) proteases generates versikine, a bioactive fragment (\\\"matrikine\\\") that regulates Batf3-dendritic cells, known to control CD8+-attracting chemokine networks. Here we demonstrate that intense VCAN proteolysis predicts CD8+ infiltration post-transplant and paradoxically portends significantly inferior survival outcomes. Our data suggest that VCAN proteolysis promotes the influx of CD8+ effectors that are rendered overwhelmingly dysfunctional and/or frankly immunoregulatory (CD8+ Treg) at the tumor site. Thus, complex immunosuppressive circuits orchestrated through VCAN accumulation and turnover generate conditions favorable for myeloma tumor regrowth and point to a readily-assayed biomarker to identify the patients at risk for relapse and early death. The dismal outcomes associated with VCAN proteolysis may be rationally overcome through immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibition (e.g., anti-TIGIT), tumor vaccines or anti-myeloid (e.g., anti-CSF-1R) approaches.",

    "abstract": "The Methanosarcinales, a lineage of cytochrome-containing methanogens, have recently been proposed to participate in direct extracellular electron transfer interactions within syntrophic communities. To shed light on this phenomenon, we applied electrochemical techniques to measure electron uptake from cathodes by Methanosarcina barkeri, which is an important model organism that is genetically tractable and utilizes a wide range of substrates for methanogenesis. Here we confirm the ability of M. barkeri to perform electron uptake from cathodes and show that this cathodic current is linked to quantitative increases in methane production. The underlying mechanisms we identified include, but are not limited to, a recently proposed association between cathodes and methanogen-derived extracellular enzymes (e.g. hydrogenases) that can facilitate current generation through the formation of reduced and diffusible methanogenic substrates (e.g. hydrogen). However, after minimizing the contributions of such extracellular enzymes and using a mutant lacking hydrogenases, we observe a lower potential hydrogen-independent pathway that facilitates cathodic activity coupled to methane production in M. barkeri. Our electrochemical measurements of wild-type and mutant strains point to a novel and extracellular-enzyme-free mode of electron uptake able to take up electrons at potentials lower than - 498 mV vs. SHE (over 100 mV more reduced than the observed hydrogenase midpoint potential under these conditions). These results suggest that M. barkeri can perform multiple modes (hydrogenase-mediated and free extracellular enzyme-independent) of electrode interactions on cathodes including a mechanism pointing to a direct interaction, which has significant applied and ecological implications.\\n\\nImportanceMethanogenic Archaea are of fundamental applied and environmental relevance. This is largely due to their activities in a wide range of anaerobic environments, generating gaseous reduced carbon that can be utilized as a fuel source. While the bioenergetics of a wide variety of methanogens has been well studied with respect to soluble substrates, mechanistic understanding of their interaction with solid phase redox active compounds is limited. This work provides insight into solid phase redox interactions in Methanosarcina using electrochemical methods. We highlight a previously undescribed mode of electron uptake from cathodes, that is potentially informative of direct interspecies electron transfer interactions in the Methanosarcinales.",

Cells begin committing to sporulation at 24-30 h poststarvation, but the mechanisms governing commitment are unknown. FruA and MrpC are transcription factors that are necessary for commitment. They bind cooperatively to promoter regions and activate developmental gene transcription, including that of the dev operon. Leading up to and during the commitment period, dev mRNA increased in wild type, but not in a mutant defective in C-signaling, a short-range signaling interaction between cells that is also necessary for commitment. The C-signaling mutant exhibited [~]20-fold less dev mRNA than wild type at 30 h poststarvation, despite a similar level of MrpC and only twofold less FruA. Boosting the FruA level twofold in the C-signaling mutant had little effect on the dev mRNA level, and dev mRNA was not less stable in the C-signaling mutant. Neither did high cooperativity of MrpC and FruA binding upstream of the dev promoter explain the data. Rather, our systematic experimental and computational analyses support a model in which C-signaling activates FruA at least ninefold posttranslationally in order to commit a cell to spore formation.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=169 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/415331_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c16410org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@909252org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17668a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d126c3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Abbreviated summaryStarvation promotes MrpC accumulation, whereas nutrients favor proteolysis.

    "abstract": "The ability of neurons to distinguish appropriate from inappropriate synaptic partners in their local environment is fundamental to the proper assembly and function of neural circuits. How synaptic partner selection is regulated is a longstanding question in Neurobiology. A prevailing hypothesis is that appropriate partners express complementary molecules that match them together and promote synaptogenesis. Dpr and DIP IgSF proteins bind heterophilically and are expressed in a complementary manner between synaptic partners in the Drosophila visual system. Here, we show that in the lamina, DIP mis-expression is sufficient to promote synapse formation with Dpr-expressing neurons, and that DIP proteins are not necessary for synaptogenesis but rather function to prevent ectopic synapse formation. These findings indicate that Dpr-DIP interactions regulate synaptic specificity by biasing synapse formation towards specific cell-types. We propose that synaptogenesis occurs independent of synaptic partner choice, and that precise synaptic connectivity is established by limiting promiscuous synapse formation.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to asparaginase, an antileukemic enzyme that depletes asparagine, is a common clinical problem. Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we found a synthetic lethal interaction between Wnt pathway activation and asparaginase in acute leukemias resistant to this enzyme. Wnt pathway activation induced asparaginase sensitivity in distinct treatment-resistant subtypes of acute leukemia, including T-lymphoblastic, hypodiploid B-lymphoblastic, and acute myeloid leukemias, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Sensitization to asparaginase was mediated by Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which inhibits GSK3-dependent protein ubiquitination and degradation. Inhibiting the alpha isoform of GSK3 phenocopied this effect, and pharmacologic GSK3 inhibition profoundly sensitized drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase. Our findings provide a molecular rationale for activation of Wnt/STOP signaling to improve the therapeutic index of asparaginase.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe intensification of asparaginase-based therapy has improved outcomes for several subtypes of acute leukemia, but the development of treatment resistance has a poor prognosis. We hypothesized, from the concept of synthetic lethality, that gain-of-fitness alterations in drug-resistant cells had conferred a survival advantage that could be exploited therapeutically. We found a synthetic lethal interaction between activation of Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP) and asparaginase in acute leukemias resistant to this enzyme. Inhibition of the alpha isoform of GSK3 was sufficient to phenocopy this effect, and the combination of GSK3-selective inhibitors and asparaginase had marked therapeutic activity against leukemias resistant to monotherapy with either agent. These data indicate that drug-drug synthetic lethal interactions can improve the therapeutic index of cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Correct identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and differentiation from the closely related species of the Mitis group of the genus Streptococcus, as well as serotype identification, is important for monitoring disease epidemiology and assessing the impacts of pneumococcal vaccines. In this study, we assessed the taxonomic identifications of 422 publicly available genome sequences of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis, using different methods. Identification of S. pneumoniae, by comparative analysis of the groEL partial sequence, was possible and accurate, whereas S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis could be misclassified as S. pneumoniae, suggesting that groEL is unreliable as a biomarker for differentiating S. pneumoniae from its closest related species. The genome sequences of S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae fulfilled the suggested thresholds of average nucleotide identity (ANI), i.e., > 95% genome sequence similarity to the sequence of respective type strains for identification of species, whereas none of the S. mitis genome sequences fulfilled this criterion. However, ANI analyses of all sequences versus all sequences allowed discrimination of the different species by clustering, with respect to species type strains. The in silico DNA-DNA distance method was also inconclusive for identification of S. mitis genome sequences, whereas presence of the \\\"Xisco\\\" gene proved to be a reliable biomarker for S. pneumoniae identification. Furthermore, we present an improved sequetyping protocol including two newly-designed internal sequencing primers with two PCRs, as well as an improved workflow for differentiation of serogroup 6 types. The proposed sequetyping protocol generates a more specific product by generating the whole gene PCR-product for sequencing, which increases the resolution for identification of serotypes. Validations of both protocols were performed with publicly available S. pneumoniae genome sequences, reference strains at the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg (CCUG), as well as with clinical isolates. The results were compared with serotype identifications, using real-time Q-PCR analysis, as well as the Quellung reaction or antiserum panel gel-precipitation. Our protocols provide a reliable diagnostic tool for taxonomic identification as well as serotype identification of S. pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent and pernicious pathogen equipped with both extraordinary capabilities to infect the host and to develop antimicrobials resistance (AMR). Monitoring the emergence of AMR high risk clones and understanding the interplay of their pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance is of paramount importance to avoid resistance dissemination and to control P. aeruginosa infections. In this study, we report the identification of a multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strain PA154197 isolated from a blood stream infection in Hong Kong. PA154197 belongs to a distinctive MLST550 clonal complex shared by two international P. aeruginosa isolates VW0289 and AUS544. Comparative genome and transcriptome analysis with the reference strain PAO1 led to the identification of a variety of genetic variations in antibiotic resistance genes and the hyper-expression of three multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexEF-OprN, and MexGHI-OpmD in PA154197. Unlike many resistant isolates displaying an attenuated virulence, PA154197 produces a significantly high level of the P. aeruginosa major virulence factor pyocyanin (PYO) and displays an uncompromised virulence compared to PAO1. Further analysis revealed that the secondary quorum sensing system Pqs which primarily controls the PYO production is hyper-active in PA154197 independent of the master QS systems Las and Rhl. Together, these investigations disclose a unique, uncoupled QS mediated pathoadaptation mechanism in clinical P. aeruginosa which may account for the high pathogenic potentials and antibiotics resistance in the MDR isolate PA154197.",

    "abstract": "Growth rate and yield are fundamental features of micro-bial growth. However, we lack a mechanistic and quantita-tive understanding of the rate-yield relationship. Studies pairing computational predictions with experiments have shown the importance of maintenance energy and proteome allocation in explaining rate-yield tradeoffs and overflow metabolism. Recently, adaptive evolution experiments of Es-cherichia coli reveal a phenotypic diversity beyond what has been explained using simple models of growth rate versus yield. Here, we identify a two-dimensional rate-yield trade-off in adapted E. coli strains where the dimensions are (A) a tradeoff between growth rate and yield and (B) a tradeoff between substrate (glucose) uptake rate and growth yield. We employ a multi-scale modeling approach, combining a previously reported coarse-grained small-scale proteome allocation model with a fine-grained genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression (ME-model), to develop a quantitative description of the full rate-yield relationship for E. coli K-12 MG1655. The multi-scale analysis resolves the complexity of ME-model which hindered its practical use in proteome complexity analysis, and provides a mecha-nistic explanation of the two-dimensional tradeoff. Further, the analysis identifies modifications to the P/O ratio and the flux allocation between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway as potential mechanisms that enable the tradeoff between glucose uptake rate and growth yield. Thus, the rate-yield tradeoffs that govern microbial adaptation to new environments are more complex than previously reported, and they can be understood in mechanistic detail using a multi-scale modeling approach.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different forage-to-concentrate (F:C) ratios (7:3 high-forage, 3:7 high-concentrate) on rumen microflora and fiber degradation mechanism. Compared with the high-concentrate (HC) group, the high-forage(HF) group showed improved fiber degradation and a sustained high level of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCase), {beta}-glucosidase and {beta}-xylosidase activities, but the total VFAs decreased. Among bacteria at the family level, Lachnospiraceae and Succinivibrionaceae in HF groups were 2-fold and 4-fold more abundant than in the HC group, respectively. A KEGG analysis revealed that succinate-CoA synthetase (EC: 6.2.1.5) and propionate-CoA transferase (EC: 2.8.3.1) leading directly to propionate production were more abundant in HC group. Conversely, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC: 1.3.8.1) was directly related to butyrate production and was higher in the HF group. A gene expression analysis showed that the relative content of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was higher in the HF group and contributed more to fiber degradation and VFA production. Prevotella ruminicola, Selenomonas ruminantium, and Veillonella alkalescens contributed more to starch degradation and propionate production, which relative content was higher in the HC group. This research gave a further explanation of the fiber degradation parameters and microbiota under different F:C ration. The fiber-degrading bacteria in the roughage group have a high content level, and the corresponding cellulase activity is also high. These results supported the potential of diets for microbial manipulation, which can increase feed digestibility and explored new fibrinolytic bacteria.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe forage of the cows feed occupies a large proportion. The shortage of high-quality forage in cow breeding has become an important factor limiting the Chinas dairy industry. The effective measure is to improve the utilization of low-quality forage. Based on traditional nutrient metabolism, the reasons for the effects of roughage on the growth and metabolism of dairy cows can be explored, but the metabolic mechanism is not well analyzed, and the further utilization of forage is also limited. Metagenomics has proven to be a powerful tool for studying rumen microbial structures and gene function. This experiment used metagenomics to study the metabolism of cellulose and volatile acids in the rumen. Our research showed that different forage-to-concentrate shifted the composition of microorganisms and the activity of enzymes, resulting in different metabolic pathways of volatile fatty acids. This work provides a background for microbial community composition and further use of forage.",

We report here data analysis workflows that address these challenges and result in reliable identification of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and transcriptomic profiles of tumors from patient derived xenograft models. We validated our analytical approaches using simulated data and by assessing concordance of the genomic properties of xenograft tumors with data from primary human tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

The current approaches to the association detection only claim whether a cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site is associated with the phenotype or not, but they cannot determine the cell type in which the risk-CpG site is affected by the phenotype. Here, we propose a solid statistical method, HIgh REsolution (HIRE), which not only substantially improves the power of association detection at the aggregated level as compared to the existing methods but also enables the detection of risk-CpG sites for individual cell types.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphA hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the compartmentalisation of intracellular processes into specialised membrane-bound compartments known as organelles. Plant cells contain several such organelles including the nucleus, chloroplast, mitochondrion, peroxisome, golgi, endoplasmic reticulum and vacuole. Organelle biogenesis and function is dependent on the concerted action of numerous nuclear-encoded proteins which must be imported from the cytosol (or endoplasmic reticulum) where they are made. Using phylogenomic approaches coupled to ancestral state estimation we show that the rate of change in plant organellar proteome content is proportional to the rate of molecular sequence evolution such that the proteomes of chloroplasts and mitochondria lose or gain ~3.2 proteins per million years. We show that these changes in protein targeting have predominantly occurred in genes with regulatory rather than metabolic functions, and thus altered regulatory capacity rather than metabolic function has been the major theme of plant organellar evolution. Finally we show gain and loss of protein targeting occurs at a higher rate following gene duplication events, revealing that gene and genome duplication are a key facilitator of organelle evolution.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent proteins (FP)s are of vital importance to biomedical research. Many of the currently available fluorescent proteins do not fluoresce when expressed in non-native environments, such as the bacterial periplasm. This strongly limits the options for applications that employ multiple FPs, such as multiplex imaging or FRET. To address this issue, we have engineered a new cyan fluorescent protein based on mTurquoise2 (mTq2). The new variant is dubbed superfolder turquoise 2 ox (sfTq2ox) and is able to withstand challenging, oxidizing environments. sfTq2ox has improved folding capabilities and can be expressed in the periplasm at higher concentrations without toxicity. This was tied to the replacement of native cysteines that may otherwise form promiscuous disulfide-bonds. The improved sfTq2ox has the same spectroscopic properties as mTq2, i.e. high fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield. The sfTq2ox-mNeongreen FRET pair allows the detection of periplasmic protein-protein interactions with energy transfer rates exceeding 40 %. Employing the new FRET pair, we show the direct interaction of two essential periplasmic cell division proteins FtsL and FtsB and disrupt it by mutations, paving the way for in vivo antibiotic screening.",

    "abstract": "Two strikingly distinct types of activity have been observed in various brain structures during delay periods of delayed response tasks: Persistent activity (PA), in which a sub-population of neurons maintains an elevated firing rate throughout an entire delay period; and Sequential activity (SA), in which sub-populations of neurons are activated sequentially in time. It has been hypothesized that both types of dynamics can be  learned by the relevant networks from the statistics of their inputs, thanks to mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. However, the necessary conditions for a synaptic plasticity rule and input statistics to learn these two types of dynamics in a stable fashion are still unclear. In particular, it is unclear whether a single learning rule is able to learn both types of activity patterns, depending on the statistics of the inputs driving the network. Here, we first characterize the complete bifurcation diagram of a firing rate model of multiple excitatory populations with an inhibitory mechanism, as a function of the parameters characterizing its connectivity. We then investigate how an unsupervised temporally asymmetric Hebbian plasticity rule shapes the dynamics of the network. Consistent with previous studies, we find that for stable learning of PA and SA, an additional stabilization mechanism, such as multiplicative homeostatic plasticity, is necessary. Using the bifurcation diagram derived for fixed connectivity, we study analytically the temporal evolution and the steady state of the learned recurrent architecture as a function of parameters characterizing the external inputs. Slow changing stimuli lead to PA, while fast changing stimuli lead to SA. Our network model shows how a network with plastic synapses can stably and flexibly learn PA and SA in an unsupervised manner.",

We identified 165 loci, including 58 insertions absent from the dog reference assembly, and characterized element polymorphism across 332 canids from nine species. Insertions were found throughout the dog genome including within and near gene models. Analysis of 19 proviral sequences identified shared disruptive mutations indicating defective proviruses were spread via complementation. The patterns of ERV polymorphism and sequence variation indicate multiple circulating viruses infected canid ancestors within the last 20 million to within 1.6 million years with a recent bust of germline invasion in the lineage leading to wolves and dogs.",

    "abstract": "By combining the classic Golgi method and the electron microscope, we have gained a better understanding of the anastomosis of CNS blood capillaries. The participation of growing capillary leading endothelial cells filopodia in the anastomotic process is described. The two approaching capillaries leading endothelial cells filopodia intermingle and interact forming complex conglomerates with narrow spaces filled with proteinaceous material (possibly basal lamina) secreted by them. The presence of tight junctions among the filopodia corroborates their vascular nature. Their presence also suggests a different endothelial cells origin as will those from the two approaching capillaries. The original narrow spaces coalesce into larger ones leading to the eventual formation of a single one that will interconnect (anastomose) the two capillaries. The newly formed post-anastomotic CNS capillaries are rather small with irregular and narrow lumina that might permit the passage of fluid but not yet of blood cells. Eventually, the new capillaries lumina will enlarge permitting the passage of blood cells.\\n\\nFunding informationThe M. M-P.

Although defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) may be central to the pathogenesis of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular mechanisms modulating the nuclear pore function are still largely unknown. Here we show that genetic and pharmacological modulation of actin polymerization disrupts nuclear pore integrity, nuclear import, and downstream pathways such as mRNA post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that modulation of actin homeostasis can rescue nuclear pore instability and dysfunction caused by mutant PFN1 as well as by C9ORF72 repeat expansions, the most common mutations in ALS patients. Collectively, our data link NCT defects to ALS-associated pathology and propose the regulation of actin homeostasis as a novel therapeutic strategy for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Yet information on the prevalence, genetic diversity and health burden of -thalassaemia in the region remains limited. We compiled a geodatabase of -thalassaemia prevalence and genetic diversity surveys and, using geostatistical modelling methods, generated the first continuous maps of -thalassaemia mutations in Thailand and sub-national estimates of the number of newborns with severe forms in 2020. We also summarised the current evidence-base for -thalassaemia prevalence and diversity for the region. We estimate that 3,595 (95% credible interval 1,717 - 6,199) newborns will be born with severe -thalassaemia in Thailand in 2020, which is considerably higher than previous estimates. Accurate, fine-scale epidemiological data are necessary to guide sustainable national and regional health policies for -thalassaemia control. Our maps and newborn estimates are an important first step towards this aim.\\n\\nFundingThis work was supported by European Unions Seventh Framework Programme (FP7//2007-2013)/European Research Council [268904 - DIVERSITY]",

    "abstract": "In 2016, Catalonia experienced a pediatric brainstem encephalitis outbreak caused by enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). Conventional testing identified EV in peripheral body sites, but EV was rarely identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RNA was extracted from CSF (n=20), plasma (n=9), stool (n=15) and nasopharyngeal samples (n=16) from 10 children with brainstem encephalitis or encephalomyelitis and 10 contemporaneous pediatric controls with presumed viral meningitis or encephalitis. Unbiased complementary DNA libraries were sequenced, and microbial pathogens were identified using a custom bioinformatics pipeline. Full-length virus genomes were assembled for phylogenetic analyses. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was concordant with qRT-PCR for all samples positive by PCR (n=25). In virus-negative samples (n=35), mNGS detected virus in 28.6% (n=10), including 5 CSF samples. mNGS co-detected EV-A71 and another EV in 5 patients. Overall, mNGS increased the proportion of EV-positive samples from 42% (25/60) to 57% (34/60) (McNemars test; p-value = 0.0077). For CSF, mNGS doubled the number of pathogen-positive samples (McNemars test; p-value = 0.074). Using phylogenetic analysis, the outbreak EV-A71 clustered with a neuroinvasive German EV-A71 isolate. Brainstem encephalitis specific, non-synonymous EV-A71 single nucleotide variants were not identified. mNGS demonstrated 100% concordance with clinical qRT-PCR of EV-related brainstem encephalitis and significantly increased the detection of enteroviruses. Our findings increase the probability that neurologic complications observed were virus-induced rather than para-infectious. A comprehensive genomic analysis confirmed that the EV-A71 outbreak strain was closely related to a neuroinvasive German EV-A71 isolate. There were no clear-cut viral genomic differences that discriminated between patients with differing neurologic phenotypes.",
