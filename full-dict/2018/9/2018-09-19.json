    "abstract": "Population structure leads to systematic patterns in measures of mean relatedness between individuals in large genomic datasets, which are often discovered and visualized using dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA). Mean relatedness is an average of the relationships across locus-specific genealogical trees, which can be strongly affected on intermediate genomic scales by linked selection and other factors. We show how to use local principal components analysis to describe this meso-scale heterogeneity in patterns of relatedness, and apply the method to genomic data from three species, finding in each that the effect of population structure can vary substantially across only a few megabases. In a global human dataset, localized heterogeneity is likely explained by polymorphic chromosomal inversions. In a range-wide dataset of Medicago truncatula, factors that produce heterogeneity are shared between chromosomes, correlate with local gene density, and may be caused by linked selection, such as background selection or local adaptation. In a dataset of primarily African Drosophila melanogaster, large-scale heterogeneity across each chromosome arm is explained by known chromosomal inversions thought to be under recent selection, and after removing samples carrying inversions, remaining heterogeneity is correlated with recombination rate and gene density, again suggesting a role for linked selection. The visualization method provides a flexible new way to discover biological drivers of genetic variation, and its application to data highlights the strong effects that linked selection and chromosomal inversions can have on observed patterns of genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Anti-proliferative agents that target lymphoid cells are common immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of diverse autoimmune, graft versus host and inflammatory diseases. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an anti-proliferative agent that targets lymphoid dependence on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase for the de novo purine synthesis of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) for DNA replication. Here we show that MMF has a distinct and specific in vivo effect on macrophages, in the absence of lymphoid cells. This results in increased macrophage cell death that is dependent on the depletion of cellular GTP, independent of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the macrophage specific effect of MMF treatment causes an increase in susceptibility to the opportunistic fungal infection Cryptococcus neoformans by reducing phagocytosis and increasing the release of intracellular pathogens via macrophage lysis. Our study demonstrates the need for a better mechanistic understanding of immunosuppressive treatments used in clinical practice and of the specific infection risks associated with certain treatment regimens.",

    "abstract": "One of the major transitions in evolution is the step from unicellularity into the brave new world of multicellularity. To understand this feat, one has to fathom two main characteristics of multicellular organisms: differentiation and self-organization. Any explanation concerning this major transition should involve mechanisms that can simultaneously explain the marvellous intricacies manifest in the aforementioned characteristics, and an account of the evolution of such traits. Here we propose a noise-driven differentiation (NDD) model. The reliance on noise, in place of a more mechanistic approach, makes the NDD model a more suitable approach to explain differentiation and self-organization. Furthermore, our model sheds some light on the possible evolutionary origins of these biological innovations. To test the NDD model, we utilize a model of cell aggregation. The behavior of this model of cell aggregation is in concert with the NDD model.",

    "abstract": "The task of automated epileptic seizure detection and prediction by using non-invasive measurements such as scalp EEG signals or invasive, intracranial recordings, has been at the heart of epilepsy studies for at least three decades. By far, the most common approach for tackling this problem is to examine short-length recordings around the occurrence of a seizure - normally ranging between several seconds and up to a few minutes before and after the epileptic event - and identify any significant changes that occur before or during the event. An inherent assumption in these studies is the presence of a relatively constant EEG activity in the interictal period, which is presumably interrupted by the occurrence of a seizure. Here, we examine this assumption by using long-duration scalp EEG data (ranging between 21 and 94 hours) in patients with epilepsy, based on which we construct functional brain networks. Our results suggest that not only these networks vary over time, but they do so in a periodic fashion, exhibiting multiple peaks at periods ranging between around one and 24 hours. The effects of seizure onset on the functional brain network properties were found to be considerably smaller in magnitude compared to the changes due to the inherent periodic cycles of these networks. Importantly, the properties of the identified network periodic components (instantaneous phase, particularly that of short-term periodicities around 3 and 5 h) were found to be strongly correlated to seizure onset. These correlations were found to be largely absent between EEG signal periodicities and seizure onset, suggesting that higher specificity may be achieved by using network-based metrics. In turn, this suggests that to achieve more robust seizure detection and/or prediction, the evolution of the underlying longer term functional brain network periodic variations should be taken into account.\\n\\nHighlights- We have examined the long-term characteristics of EEG functional brain networks and their correlations to seizure onset\\n\\n- We show periodicities over multiple time scales in network summative properties (degree, efficiency, clustering coefficient)\\n\\n- We also show that, in addition to average network properties, similar periodicities exist in network topology using a novel measure based on the graph edit distance, suggesting that specific connectivity patterns recur over time\\n\\n- These periodic patterns were preserved when we corrected for the effects of volume conduction and were found to be of much larger magnitude compared to seizure-induced modulations\\n\\n- For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate that seizure onset occurs preferentially at specific phases of network periodic components that were consistently observed across subjects, particularly for shorter periodicities (around 3 and 5 hours)\\n\\n- These correlations between the phase of network periodic components and seizure onset were nearly absent when examining univariate properties (EEG signal power), suggesting that network-based measures are more tightly coupled with seizure onset compared to EEG signal-based measures\\n\\n- Our findings suggest that seizure detection and prediction algorithms may benefit significantly by taking into account longer-term variations in brain network properties\\n\\n- As we show strong evidence that shorter network-based periodicities (3-5 hours) are tightly coupled with seizure onset, our results pave the way for further investigation into the pathophysiology of seizure generation mechanisms beyond the well-known effects of circadian rhythms",

    "abstract": "Deciphering cis-regulation, the code by which transcription factors (TFs) interpret regulatory DNA sequence to control gene expression levels, is a long-standing challenge. Previous studies of native or engineered sequences have remained limited in scale. Here, we use random sequences as an alternative, allowing us to measure the expression output of over 100 million synthetic yeast promoters. Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94% of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89% from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis-regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin. Such massive-throughput regulatory assays of random DNA provide the diverse examples necessary to learn complex models of cis-regulatory logic.",

    "abstract": "Conservation of DNA sequence over evolutionary time is a strong indicator of function, and gain or loss of sequence conservation can be used to infer changes in function across a phylogeny. Changes in evolutionary rates on particular lineages in a phylogeny can indicate shared functional shifts, and thus can be used to detect genomic correlates of phenotypic convergence. However, existing methods do not allow easy detection of patterns of rate variation, which causes challenges for detecting convergent rate shifts or other complex evolutionary scenarios. Here we introduce PhyloAcc, a new Bayesian method to model substitution rate changes in conserved elements across a phylogeny. The method assumes several categories of substitution rate for each branch on the phylogenetic tree, estimates substitution rates per category, and detects changes of substitution rate as the posterior probability of a category switch. Simulations show that PhyloAcc can detect genomic regions with rate shifts in multiple target species better than previous methods and has a higher accuracy of reconstructing complex patterns of substitution rate changes than prevalent Bayesian relaxed clock models. We demonstrate the utility of PhyloAcc in two classic examples of convergent phenotypes: loss of flight in birds and the transition to marine life in mammals. In each case, our approach reveals numerous examples of conserved non-exonic elements with accelerations specific to the phenotypically convergent lineages. Our method is widely applicable to any set of conserved elements where multiple rate changes are expected on a phylogeny.",

    "abstract": "Flying animals maneuver and hover through environments where wind gusts and flower wakes produce unsteady flow. Although both flight maneuvers and aerodynamic mechanisms have been studied independently, little is known about how these interact in an environment where flow is already unsteady. Moths forage from flowers by hovering in the flowers wake. We investigate hawkmoths tracking a 3D-printed robotic flower in a wind tunnel. We visualize the flow in the wake and around the wings and compare tracking performance to previous experiments in a still air flight chamber. Like in still air, moths flying in the flower wake exhibit near perfect tracking at low frequencies where natural flowers move. However, tracking in the flower wake results in a larger overshoot between 2-5 Hz. System identification of flower tracking reveals that moths also display reduced-order dynamics in wind, compared to still air. Smoke visualization of the flower wake shows that the dominant vortex shedding corresponds to the same frequency band as the increased overshoot. Despite these large effects on tracking dynamics in wind, the leading edge vortex (LEV) remains bound to the wing throughout the wingstroke and does not burst. The LEV also maintains the same qualitative structure seen in steady air. Persistence of a stable LEV during decreased flower tracking demonstrates the interplay between hovering and maneuvering.\\n\\nSummary statementWe examined how moths maneuver in the wake of flowers and discover that flower tracking dynamics are simplified compared to still air, while the leading edge vortex does not burst and extends continuously across the wings and thorax.",

    "abstract": "Here we used mouse models of heart and brain ischemia to compare the inflammatory response to ischemia in the heart, a protein rich organ, to the inflammatory response to ischemia in the brain, a lipid rich organ. We report that ischemia-induced inflammation resolves between 1 and 4 weeks in the heart compared to between 8 and 24 weeks in the brain. Importantly, we discovered that a second burst of inflammation occurs in the brain between 4 and 8 weeks following ischemia, which coincided with the appearance of cholesterol crystals within the infarct. This second wave shares a similar cellular and molecular profile with atherosclerosis and is characterized by high levels of osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In order to test the role of OPN in areas of liquefactive necrosis, OPN-/- mice were subjected to brain ischemia. We found that at 7 weeks following stroke, the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins and MMPs was profoundly reduced in the infarct of the OPN-/- mice, although the number of cholesterol crystals was increased. OPN-/- mice exhibited faster recovery of motor function and a higher number of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) positive cells in the peri-infarct area at 7 weeks following stroke. Based on these findings we propose that the brain liquefies after stroke because phagocytic cells in the infarct are unable to efficiently clear cholesterol rich myelin debris, and that this leads to the perpetuation of an OPN-dependent inflammatory response characterized by high levels of degradative enzymes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe inflammatory response to ischemia in the brain is different to the response to ischemic injury in other organs. In the brain, and for unknown reasons, dead tissue liquefies in response to ischemia by the process of liquefactive necrosis. However, the data we present here demonstrate that there is overlap between the pathophysiology of liquefactive necrosis and atherosclerosis. Specifically, we show that chronic stroke infarcts contain foamy macrophages, cholesterol crystals, high levels of OPN and MMPs, and a similar cytokine profile to atherosclerosis. Therefore, because cholesterol is a central component of myelin, liquefactive necrosis in response to stroke may be caused by an inflammatory response to cholesterol-rich myelin debris that is driven in large part by OPN and MMPs.",

Here, we test the influence of these factors on the dispersal history of the flowering plant genus Erica (Ericaceae) across the Afrotemperate. We quantify similarity of Erica climate niches per biogeographic area using direct observations of species, and test various colonisation scenarios while estimating ancestral areas for the Erica clade using parametric biogeographic model testing. We infer that the overall dispersal history of Erica across the Afrotemperate is the result of infrequent colonisation limited by geographic proximity and niche similarity. However, the Drakensberg Mountains represent a colonisation sink, rather than acting as a \\\"stepping stone\\\" between more distant and ecologically dissimilar Cape and Tropical African regions. Strikingly, the most dramatic examples of species radiations in Erica were the result of single unique dispersals over longer distances between ecologically dissimilar areas, contradicting the rule of phylogenetic biome conservatism. These results highlight the importance of rare biome shifts, in which a unique dispersal event fuels evolutionary radiation.\\n\\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by: Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology (DOI: 10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100065)",

We collect demographics, life history, medical history, genealogy, neuropsychological data and blood samples. Centenarians are followed annually until death. PET-MRI scans and feces donation are optional. Almost 30% of the centenarians agreed to post-mortem brain donation.\\n\\nCOHORT DESCRIPTIONTo date (September 2018), 332 centenarians were included in the study. We analyzed demographic statistics of the first 300 centenarians (25% males) included in the cohort. Centenarians came from higher socio-economic classes and had higher levels of education compared to their birth cohort; alcohol consumption of centenarians was similar, and most males smoked during their lifetime. At baseline, the centenarians had a median MMSE score of 25 points (IQR: 22.0-27.5); the large majority lived independently, retained hearing and vision abilities and was independently mobile. Mortality was associated with cognitive functioning: centenarians with a baseline MMSE score [&ge;]26 and <26 points had a mortality percentage of respectively 17% and 42% per annual year in the second year after baseline (p=0.003). The cohort was 2.1-fold enriched with the neuroprotective APOE-{varepsilon}2 allele relative to 60-80 year-old population controls (p=4.8x10-7), APOE-{varepsilon}3 was unchanged and the APOE-{varepsilon}4 allele was 2.3-fold depleted (p=6.3x10-7).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSComprehensive characterization of the 100-plus cohort of cognitively healthy centenarians might reveal protective factors that explain the physiology of long-term preserved cognitive health.",

Finding general patterns in the expansion of natural populations is a major challenge in ecology and invasion biology. Classical spatio-temporal models predict that the carrying capacity (K) of the environment should have no influence on the speed (v) of an expanding population. We tested the generality of this statement with reaction-diffusion equations, stochastic individual-based models, and microcosms experiments with Trichogramma chilonis wasps. We investigated the dependence between K and v under different assumptions: null model (Fisher-KPP-like assumptions), strong Allee effects, and positive density-dependent dispersal. These approaches led to similar and complementary results. Strong Allee effects, positive density-dependent dispersal and demographic stochasticity in small populations lead to a positive dependence between K and v. A positive correlation between carrying capacity and propagation speed might be more frequent than previously expected, and be the rule when individuals at the edge of a population range are not able to fully drive the expansion.",

    "abstract": "Recently, comprehensive morphological datasets including nearly all the well-recognized Mesozoic birds become available, making it feasible for statistically rigorous methods to unveil finer evolutionary patterns during early avian evolution. However, few quantitative and statistical studies have yet been performed. Here, we exploited the advantage of Bayesian tip dating under relaxed morphological clocks to infer both the divergence times and evolutionary rates while accounting for their uncertainties. We further subdivided the characters into six body regions (i.e., skull, axial skeleton, pectoral girdle and sternum, forelimb, pelvic girdle, and hindlimb) to assess evolutionary rate heterogeneity both along the lineages and across partitions. We observed extremely high rates of morphological character changes during early avian evolution and the clock rates are quite heterogeneous among the six regions. The branch subtending Pygostylia shows extremely high rate in the axial skeleton, while the branches subtending Ornithothoraces and Enantiornithes show very high rates in the pectoral girdle and sternum, and moderately high rates in the forelimb. The extensive modifications in these body regions largely correspond to refinement of the flight capability. The rest of the relatively slow and even rates suggest that there is no dominant selective pressure in favoring of modifications in the skull and pelvis. This study reveals the power and flexibility of Bayesian tip dating implemented in MrBayes to investigate evolutionary dynamics in deep time.",

    "abstract": "In perceptual decision making the brain extracts and accumulates decision evidence from a stimulus over time and eventually makes a decision based on the accumulated evidence. Several characteristics of this process have been observed in human electrophysiological experiments, especially an average build-up of motor-related signals supposedly reflecting accumulated evidence, when averaged across trials. A more direct approach to investigate the representation of decision evidence in brain signals is to correlate the trial-to-trial fluctuations of a model-based prediction of evidence with the measured signals. We here report results for an experiment in which we applied this approach to human magnetoencephalographic recordings. These results consolidate a range of previous findings and suggest that decision evidence is processed in three consecutive phases in the human brain: In an early phase around 120 ms after the evidence became visible on the screen, in a transition phase around 180 ms and a plateau phase roughly from 300 to 500 ms. We located sources of evidence representations in these phases in early visual (early), parietal (transition) and motor (plateau) regions of the brain while signals in posterior cingulate cortex represented decision evidence in all three phases. These findings imply that parietal cortex is only transiently involved in the processing of decision evidence, that motor areas represent accumulated evidence throughout decision making and that posterior cingulate cortex may have a central role in processing and maintaining decision evidence.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system supports stable percepts of object color even though the light that reflects from object surfaces varies significantly with the scene illumination. To understand the computations that support stable color perception, we study how estimating a target objects luminous reflectance factor (LRF; a measure of the light reflected from the object under a standard illuminant) depends on variation in key properties of naturalistic scenes. Specifically, we study how variation in target object reflectance, illumination spectra, and the reflectance of back-ground objects in a scene impact estimation of a target objects LRF. To do this, we applied supervised statistical learning methods to the simulated excitations of human cone photoreceptors, obtained from labeled naturalistic images. The naturalistic images were rendered with computer graphics. The illumination spectra of the light sources and the reflectance spectra of the surfaces in the scene were generated using statistical models of natural spectral variation. Optimally decoding target object LRF from the responses of a small learned set of task-specific linear receptive fields that operate on a contrast representation of the cone excitations yields estimates that are within 13% of the correct LRF. Our work provides a framework for evaluating how different sources of scene variability limit performance on luminance constancy.",

Transcription of the apicoplast genome is polycistronic with extensive RNA processing. Little is known about the mechanism of post-transcriptional processing. In plant chloroplasts, post-transcriptional RNA processing is controlled by multiple pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Here, we present the biochemical characterisation of the single apicoplast-targeted PPR protein. Apicoplast PPR1 is essential, and binds specific RNA sequences corresponding with previously characterized RNA processing sites. We identify the specific binding motif of PPR1. In RNAse protection assays, PPR1 shields apicoplast transcripts from ribonuclease degradation. Our results show that apicoplast RNA processing is under the control of a single protein, thus presenting an Achilles heel for the development of new anti-malarial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Cancer research in the news is often associated with sensationalising and inaccurate reporting, giving rise to false hopes and expectations. The role of study selection for cancer-related news stories is an important but less commonly acknowledged issue, as the outcomes of primary research are generally less reliable than those of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Few studies have investigated the quality of research that makes the news and no previous analyses of the proportions of primary and secondary research in the news have been found in the literature. The main aim of this study was to investigate the nature and quality of cancer research covered in online news reports by four major news sources from USA, UK and Australia. We measured significant variation in reporting quality, and observed biases in many aspects of cancer research reporting, including the types of study selected for coverage, and in the spectrum of cancer types, gender of scientists, and geographical source of research represented. We discuss the implications of these finding for guiding accurate, contextual reporting of cancer research, which is critical in helping the public understand complex science and appreciate the outcomes of publicly funded research, avoid undermining trust in science, and assist informed decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) has been shown to modulate nociception in animals, but no mGlu5 antagonists have been developed commercially as analgesics. The mGlu5 antagonist fenobam [N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4-oxo-1H-imidazole-2-yl)urea] was originally evaluated for development as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Fenobam is analgesic in numerous mouse pain models, acting exclusively via mGlu5 blockade. Furthermore, fenobam showed no signs of analgesic tolerance with up to two weeks of daily dosing in mice. Analgesic effects of fenobam in humans have not been reported. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate fenobam pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects in humans. We first evaluated single-dose oral fenobam disposition in a parallel-group dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. A second investigation tested the analgesic effects of fenobam in an established experimental human pain model of cutaneous sensitization utilizing capsaicin cream and heat, in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome measure was the area of hyperalgesia and allodynia around the area applied with heat/capsaicin. Secondary outcome measures included nociception, measured as pain rating on a visual analog scale, heat-pain detection threshold, and effects on cognition and mood. Fenobam plasma exposures showed considerable inter-individual variability, and were not linear with dose. Fenobam reduced sensitization vs placebo at a single time-point (peak plasma concentration); we found no other difference between fenobam and placebo. Our results suggest highly variable fenobam disposition, and minimal analgesic effects at the dose tested. We suggest that future studies testing analgesic effects of mGlu5 blockade are warranted, but such studies should employ molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles.",

    "abstract": "The adult spermatogonial stem cell population arises from pluripotent primordial germ cells (PGCs) that enter the fetal testis around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). These cells undergo rapid mitotic proliferation, then enter a prolonged period of cell cycle arrest (G1/G0) during which they transition to pro-spermatogonia. In mice homozygous for the Ter mutation in the RNA-binding protein DND1 (DND1Ter/Ter), many germ cells fail to enter G1/G0, and give rise to teratomas, tumors in which many embryonic cell types are represented. To investigate the origin of these tumors, we sequenced the transcriptome of male germ cells in DND1Ter/Ter mutants at E12.5, E13.5, and E14.5, just prior to the formation of teratomas, and correlated this information with direct targets of DND1 identified by DO-RIP-Seq. Consistent with previous results, we found that DND1 controls the down regulation of many genes associated with pluripotency and active cell cycle, including elements of the mTor, Hippo and Bmp/Nodal signaling pathways. However, DND1 targets also include genes associated with male differentiation including a large group of chromatin regulators activated in wild type but not mutant germ cells during the transition between E13.5 and E14.5. These results suggest multiple functions of DND1, and link DND1 to the initiation of epigenetic modifications in male germ cells.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) can generate almost all adult cell lineages. While it is clear that key transcriptional programmes are important elements for maintaining pluripotency, the equally essential requirement for cell adhesion to specific extracellular matrix components remains poorly defined. Our recent observation that hPSC colonies form unusually large \\\"cornerstone\\\" focal adhesions (FA), distinct from parental somatic cells, that are lost following differentiation, emphasises the potential of these atypical FA as gatekeepers of pluripotency. Here, using nanopatterns, we further demonstrate that physical restriction of adhesion size, in hPSC colonies, is sufficient to trigger differentiation. Using superresolution two-colour interfero-metric photo-activated localization microscopy (iPALM), we examined the three-dimensional architecture of these cornerstone adhesions and report vertical lamination of FA proteins with three main structural peculiarities: 1) integrin {beta}5 and talin are present at high density, at the edges of cornerstone FA, adjacent to a vertical kank-rich protein wall. 2) Vinculin localises higher than expected with respect to the substrata and displays a head-above-tail orientation, and 3) surprisingly, actin and -actinin are present in two discrete layers, a previously undescribed localisation for these proteins. Finally, we report that depletion of kanks diminishes FA patterning, and actin organisation within the colony, indicating a key role for kanks in hPSC colony architecture.",

Different species of grass flower at different times, but it is not known how airborne communities of grass pollen change in time and space. Persistence and high mobility of grass pollen could result in increasingly diverse seasonal pollen communities. Conversely, if grass pollen does not persist for an extended time in the air, shifting pollen communities would be predicted throughout the summer months. Here, using targeted high throughput sequencing, we tracked the seasonal progression of airborne Poaceae pollen biodiversity across Britain, throughout the grass allergy season. All grass genera displayed discrete, temporally restricted peaks of pollen incidence which varied with latitude, revealing that the taxonomic composition of grass pollen exposure changes substantially across the allergy season. By developing more refined aeroallergen profiling, we predict that our findings will facilitate the exploration of links between taxon-specific exposure of harmful grass pollen and disease, with concomitant socio-economic benefits.",

The Tibetan hulless barley in China has about 3500 years of cultivation history, mainly produced in Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and other areas. In addition, Tibetan hulless barley has rich nutritional value and outstanding health effects, including the beta glucan, dietary fiber, amylopectin, the contents of trace elements, which are higher than any other cereal crops.\\n\\nFindingsHere, we reported an improved high-quality assembly of Tibetan hulless barley genome with 4.0 Gb in size. We employed the falcon assembly package, scaffolding and error correction tools to finish improvement using PacBio long reads sequencing technology, with contig and scaffold N50 lengths of 1.563Mb and 4.006Mb, respectively, representing more continuous than the original Tibetan hulless barley genome nearly two orders of magnitude. We also re-annotated the new assembly, and reported 61,303 stringent confident putative protein-coding genes, of which 40,457 is HC genes. We have developed a new Tibetan hulless barley genome database (THBGD) to download and use friendly, as well as to better manage the information of the Tibetan hulless barley genetic resources.\\n\\nConclusionsThe availability of new Tibetan hulless barley genome and annotations will take the genetics of Tibetan hulless barley to a new level and will greatly simplify the breeders effort.

Through comprehensive mapping of the proteome, phosphoproteome, transcriptome, and epigenome of mouse embryonic stem cells transitioning from naive to primed pluripotency, we find that rapid, acute, and widespread changes to the phosphoproteome precede ordered changes to the epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome.

    "abstract": "Identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and cis-regulatory motifs (motifs for short) from genomics datasets, provides a powerful view of the rules governing the interactions between TFs and DNA. Existing motif prediction methods however, are limited by high false positive rates in TFBSs identification, contributions from non-sequence-specific binding, and complex and indirect binding mechanisms. High throughput next-generation sequencing data provides unprecedented opportunities to overcome these difficulties, as it provides multiple whole-genome scale measurements of TF binding information. Uncovering this information brings new computational and modeling challenges in high-dimensional data mining and heterogeneous data integration. To improve TFBS identification and novel motifs prediction accuracy in the human genome, we developed an advanced computational technique based on deep learning (DL) and high-performance computing, named DESSO. DESSO utilizes deep neural network and binomial distribution to optimize the motif prediction. Our results showed that DESSO outperformed existing tools in predicting distinct motifs from the 690 in vivo ENCODE ChIP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) datasets for 161 human TFs in 91 cell lines. We also found that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are prevalent among human TFs, and a total of 61 potential tethering binding were identified among the 100 TFs in the K562 cell line. To further expand DESSOs deep-learning capabilities, we included DNA shape features and found that (i) shape information has a strong predictive power for TF-DNA binding specificity; and (ii) it aided in identification of the shape motifs recognized by human TFs which in turn contributed to the interpretation of TF-DNA binding in the absence of sequence recognition. DESSO and the analyses it enabled will continue to improve our understanding of how gene expression is controlled by TFs and the complexities of DNA binding. The source code and the predicted motifs and TFBSs from the 690 ENCODE TF ChIP-Seq datasets are freely available at the DESSO web server: http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/DESSO.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLate stage Alzheimers disease and other dementias are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration. Here we describe a mouse (TauD35) carrying human Tau with the P301L mutation that results in Tau hyperphosphorylation and tangles. Previously we have compared gene expression in TauD35 mice to mice which develop plaques but no tangles. A similar comparison of other pathological features throughout disease progression is made here between amyloid{beta} and Tau mice described in Parts I and II of this study.\\n\\nMethodsIn vitro CA1 patch clamp and field recordings were used to investigate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Plaque load and microglia were investigated with immunohistochemistry. Cognition, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviours were assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field and light/dark box.\\n\\nResultsTransgene copy number in TauD35 mice fell into two groups (HighTAU and LowTAU), allowing assessment of dose-dependent effects of overexpression and resulting in tangle load increasing 100-fold for a 2-fold change in protein levels. Tangles were first detected at 8 (HighTAU) or 13 months (LowTAU) but the effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity and behaviour were subtle. However severe neurodegeneration occurred in HighTAU mice at around 17 months preceded by considerable proliferation but little additional activation of microglia. Proliferation only started as neurodegeneration began at 13 months. Similarly to HighTau mice at 13 months of age, LowTAU mice at 24 months of age showed a comparable tangle load and microglial proliferation. However, LowTAU mice showed no neurodegeneration at this stage and considerable microglial activation, stressing the dependence of these effects on overexpression and/or age.\\n\\nConclusionsComparison of the effects of amyloid{beta} and plaques without tangles in a model of preclinical Alzheimers disease to the effects of tangles without amyloid{beta} plaques in the late stage model described here may clarify the progressive stages of Alzheimers disease. While Tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles are eventually sufficient to cause severe neurodegeneration, initial effects on synaptic transmission and the immune response are subtle. In contrast while even with a heavy plaque load little if any neurodegeneration occurs, considerable effects on synaptic transmission and the immune system result, even before plaques are detectable.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProgression of Alzheimers disease is thought initially to depend on rising amyloid{beta} and its synaptic interactions. Transgenic mice (TASTPM; APPSwe/PSEN1M146V) show altered synaptic transmission, compatible with increased physiological function of amyloid{beta}, before plaques are detected. Recently, the importance of microglia has become apparent in the human disease. Similarly, TASTPM show a close association of plaque load with upregulated microglial genes.\\n\\nMethodsCA1 Synaptic transmission and plasticity were investigated using in vitro electrophysiology. Migroglial relationship to plaques was examined with immunohistochemistry. Behaviour was assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field, light/dark box and elevated plus maze.\\n\\nFindingsThe most striking finding is the increase in microglial numbers in TASTPM, which, like synaptic changes, begins before plaques are detected. Further increases and a reactive phenotype occur later, concurrent with development of larger plaques. Long-term potentiation is initially enhanced at pre-plaque stages but decrements with the initial appearance of plaques. Finally, despite altered plasticity, TASTPM have little cognitive deficit, even with a heavy plaque load, although they show altered non-cognitive behaviours.\\n\\nInterpretationThe pre-plaque synaptic changes and microglial proliferation are presumably related to low, non-toxic amyloid{beta} levels in the general neuropil and not directly associated with plaques. However, as plaques grow, microglia proliferate further, clustering around plaques and becoming phagocytic. Like in humans, even when plaque load is heavy, without development of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, these alterations do not result in cognitive deficits. Behaviours are seen that could be consistent with pre-diagnosis changes in the human condition.\\n\\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere is a large body of research examining many aspects of phenotypes associated with mouse models of Alzheimers disease - a PubMed search for the terms Alzheimer* AND mouse returns in excess of 21000 articles. However, there are few systematic articles pulling together pathological, functional (electrophysiological), and behavioural analyses across the life-span of such models. There is also a number of conflicting outcomes, for example reports of impaired versus enhanced synaptic plasticity; cognitive impairments or not.\\n\\nRecently, the importance of microglia in Alzheimers disease has come to the fore in human Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), with variants of a number of microglial genes identified as risk-factors for developing the disease. Interestingly, we have recently reported that Trem2 and other genes identified as risk-factors in humans are strongly up regulated in close association to plaque development in the mouse model used in this study. Moreover, this previous study predicted two of the most recently identified genes that were identified in GWAS since the publication of our paper.\\n\\nWe have previously used this model to identify the earliest synaptic changes and shown changes in release of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, to occur even before plaques are detectable.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyBy studying this transgenic mouse model of Alzheimers disease, throughout the development of plaques, from prior to detection through to heavy plaque loads, we have been able to identify a clear time course of key phenotypic changes associated with early disease. In particular, this study identifies the very early changes in microglia and can separate the time course of the microglial phenotype. In addition, we detail the changes in synaptic plasticity over time and importantly identify that, like in humans in the absence of Tau tangles or neurodegeneration, considerable synaptic changes can occur and a heavy plaque load without resulting in substantial cognitive loss.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur data indicate that rising amyloid beta prior to detectable plaque deposition results in changes in synaptic function that likely reflects an enhanced physiological effect of amyloid beta. At this stage, microglia proliferate but do not activate. Once plaques begin to appear, microglia migrate to surround the plaque and become phagocytic, likely targeting dystrophic synapses and neurites caused by the cloud of highly-toxic amyloid beta around the plaque. Similarly to humans, who have plaques but no tangles and have yet to develop substantial neurodegeneration, cognitive deficits are not seen, even with a heavy plaque load; behavioural changes are limited to anxiety-like effects.\\n\\nThis investigation of the parallel time-course of events highlights the probability that, if progression of disease can be reversed or slowed early enough, before Tau tangles and substantial neurodegeneration occur, the symptoms of cognitive decline could be very largely avoided. Moreover, it suggests that the substantial increases in microglia number and upregulation of their specific gene expression in association with plaques, is not associated with cognitive loss and may indeed be protective.",

We identified the Insulin-producing Cells (IPCs) can be activated by cold, and receive the cold signal from the 11216 cold-sensing neuron without a direct synaptic connection. Elevation of IPCs sensitivity to cold impairs the sleep-promoting effect of cold while blocking of IPCs enhance the effect mostly on sleep circadian, suggesting that the cold activated IPCs have a compensative role in sleep regulation.

Here we report that the nutrient- and stress-regulated transcription factor Sfp1 is rate-limiting for expression of several large classes of genes involved in yeast cell growth, including ribosomal protein, ribosome biogenesis, and snoRNA genes. Remarkably, the spectrum of Sfp1 transcription effects is concordant with a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromatin endogenous cleavage binding analyses, which together provide evidence for two distinct modes of Sfp1 promoter binding, one requiring a co-factor and the other a specific DNA-recognition motif. In addition to growth-related genes, Sfp1 binds to and regulates the promoters of cell cycle \\\"START\\\" regulon genes, including the key G1/S cyclins CLN1 and CLN2. Our findings suggest that Sfp1 acts as a master regulator of cell growth and cell size by coordinating the expression of genes implicated in mass accumulation and cell division.",

Studies on community assembly over broad temporal and spatial scales in aquatic microorganisms are scarce. Here, we used 16S rDNA sequence data from lake sediments to test for community assembly patterns in cyanobacterial phylogenies across ten European peri-Alpine lakes and over a century of eutrophication and climate warming. We studied phylogenetic similarity in cyanobacterial assemblages over spatial and temporal distance, and environmental gradients, comparing detected patterns with theoretical expectations from deterministic and stochastic processes. We found limited evidence for deviation of lake communities from a random assembly model and no significant effects of geographic distance on phylogenetic similarity, suggesting no dispersal limitation and high levels of stochastic assembly. We did not detect a significant effect of phosphorus and nitrogen levels on deviation of community phylogenies from random. We found however a significant decay of phylogenetic similarity for non-random communities over a gradient of air temperature and water column stability. We show how phylogenetic data from sedimentary archives can improve our understanding of microbial community assembly processes, and support previous evidence that climate warming has been the strongest environmental driver of cyanobacterial community assembly over the Anthropocene.",

We previously reported that learned odor-induced attractive and aversive behaviors accompany activation of the olfactory tubercle (OT) in a domainand cell type-specific manner. Odor cues associated with a sugar reward induced attractive behavior and c-fos expression in the dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons (D1 neurons) in the anteromedial OT.

Mice expressing ChETA (ChR2/E123T)-EYFP in the D1 neurons in the anteromedial OT spent a longer time in the photo-stimulation side of the place preference chamber than the control mice expressing EYFP. On the other hand, upon optogenetic stimulation of the D2 neurons in the anteromedial OT, the mice spent a shorter time in the photo-stimulation side than the control mice. Local neural activation in the anteromedial OT during the RTPP tests was confirmed by c-fos mRNA expression.

    "abstract": "In certain neurons, zinc ions are stored in synaptic vesicles by zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3). Vesicular zinc can then be released synaptically to modulate myriad targets. In vitro evidence indicates that these targets may include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). But the effects of vesicular zinc on BDNF and TrkB in the intact brain are unclear. Studies of mice that lack ZnT3 - and, as a result, vesicular zinc - have shown abnormalities in BDNF and TrkB levels, but results have been mixed and are therefore difficult to interpret. This might be caused by differences in the age or sex of mice tested. In the present study, we measured BDNF and TrkB levels in the hippocampus and neocortex, comparing wild type and ZnT3 knockout mice of both sexes at two ages (5 and 12 weeks). We also examined BDNF mRNA expression and protein levels at an intermediate age (8-10 weeks). We found that, regardless of age or sex, BDNF and TrkB protein levels did not differ between wild type and ZnT3 knockout mice. There were sex-specific differences in BDNF protein and mRNA expression, however. BDNF protein levels increased with age in female mice but not in males. And in females, but not males, ZnT3 KO mice exhibited great hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression than wild type mice. We conclude that, at least in naive mice housed under standard laboratory conditions, elimination of vesicular zinc does not affect BDNF or TrkB protein levels.",

    "abstract": "Pattern separation is a central concept in current theories of episodic memory: this computation is thought to support our ability to avoid confusion between similar memories by transforming similar cortical input patterns of neural activity into dissimilar output patterns before their long-term storage in the hippocampus. Because there are many ways one can define patterns of neuronal activity and the similarity between them, pattern separation could in theory be achieved through multiple coding strategies. Using our recently developed assay that evaluates pattern separation in isolated tissue by controlling and recording the input and output spike trains of single hippocampal neurons, we explored neural codes through which pattern separation is performed by systematic testing of different similarity metrics and various time resolutions. We discovered that granule cells, the projection neurons of the dentate gyrus, can exhibit both pattern separation and its opposite computation, pattern convergence, depending on the neural code considered and the statistical structure of the input patterns. Pattern separation is favored when inputs are highly similar, and is achieved through spike time reorganization at short time scales (< 100 ms) as well as through variations in firing rate and burstiness at longer time scales. These multiplexed forms of pattern separation are network phenomena, notably controlled by GABAergic inhibition, that involve many celltypes with input-output transformations that participate in pattern separation to different extent and with complementary neural codes: a rate code for dentate fast-spiking interneurons, a burstiness code for hilar mossy cells and a synchrony code at long time scales for CA3 pyramidal cells. Therefore, the isolated hippocampal circuit itself is capable of performing temporal pattern separation using multiplexed coding strategies that might be essential to optimally disambiguate multimodal mnemonic representations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPattern separation (the process of disambiguating incoming patterns of neuronal activity) is a central concept in all current theories of episodic memory, as it is hypothesized to support our ability to avoid confusion between similar memories. For the last thirty years, pattern separation has been attributed to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but this has been hard to test experimentally. Moreover, because it is unclear how to define activity patterns in the brain, such a computation could be achieved in many different ways. Here, we demonstrate that pattern separation is performed by hippocampal networks (dentate gyrus and CA3) through a variety of neural codes. By systematically testing different definitions of what it means for spike trains to be similar (using a range of time scales and various standard and innovative metrics that assume different views of the neural code), we assessed how the input-output transformation of multiple hippocampal celltypes relate to pattern separation and found that different celltypes favor complementary coding strategies. This might help storing rich but concise and unambiguous representations of complex events. Finally, we provide the first experimental evidence of the importance of inhibitory signals in mediating pattern separation, and identify through which coding strategies.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a common disabling disease severely affecting the daily life of the patients. There is evidence that rehabilitation therapy can improve the movement function. However, there are no clear guidelines that identify specific, effective rehabilitation therapy schemes, and the development of new rehabilitation techniques has been fairly slow. One informatics translational approach, called ABC model in Literature-based Discovery, was used to mine an existing rehabilitation candidate which is most likely to be repositioned for stroke. As in the classic ABC model originated from Don Swanson, we built the internal links of stroke (A), assessment scales (B), rehabilitation therapies (C) in PubMed relating to upper limb function measurements for stroke patients. In the first step, with E-utility we retrieved both stroke related assessment scales and rehabilitation therapies records, and complied two datasets called Stroke_Scales and Stroke_Therapies, respectively. In the next step, we crawled all rehabilitation therapies co-occurred with the Stroke_Theapies, named as All_Therapies. Therapies that were already included in Stroke_Therapies were deleted from All_Therapies, so that the remaining therapies were the potential rehabilitation therapies, which could be repositioned for stroke after subsequent filtration by manual check. We identified the top ranked repositioning rehabilitation therapy following by subsequent clinical validation. Hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT) ranked the first in our repositioning rehabilitation therapies list, with the most interaction links with Stroke_Scales. HABIT showed a significant improvement in clinical scores on assessment scales of Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Action Research Arm Test in the clinical validation on upper limb function for acute stroke patients. Based on the ABC model and clinical validation of the results, we put forward that HABIT as a promising rehabilitation therapy for stroke, which shows that the ABC model is an effective text mining approach for rehabilitation therapy repositioning. The results seem to be promoted in clinical knowledge discovery.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the present study, we proposed a text mining approach to mining terms related to disease, rehabilitation therapy, and assessment scale from literature, with a subsequent ABC inference analysis to identify relationships of these terms across publications. The clinical validation demonstrated that our approach can be used to identify potential repositioning rehabilitation therapy strategies for stroke. Specifically, we identified a promising rehabilitation method called HABIT previously used in pediatric congenital hemiplegia. A subsequent clinical trial confirmed this as a highly promising rehabilitation therapy for stroke.",

Few studies have investigated tprK directly from clinical samples using deep sequencing.\\n\\nMethods/Principal findingsWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of 14 primary syphilis clinical isolates of T. pallidum via next-generation sequencing to gain better insight into the profile of tprK in primary syphilis patients. Our results based on primary syphilis clinical samples showed that there was a mixture of distinct sequences within each V region of tprK. Except for the predominant sequence for each region as previously reported using the clone-based Sanger approach, there were many minor variants of all strains that were mainly observed at a frequency of 1-5%. Interestingly, the identified distinct sequences within the regions were variable in length and differed only by 3 bp or multiples of 3 bp. In addition, amino acid sequence consistency within each region was found between the 14 strains. Among the regions, the sequence IASDGGAIKH in V1 and the sequence DVGHKKENAANVNGTVGA in V4 showed a high stability of inter-strain redundancy.\\n\\nConclusionsThe seven V regions of the tprK gene in primary syphilis infection demonstrated high diversity; they generally contained a high proportion sequence and numerous low-frequency minor variants, most of which are far below the detection limit of Sanger sequencing. The rampant variation in each region was regulated by a strict gene conversion mechanism that maintained the length difference to 3 bp or multiples of 3 bp. The highly stable sequence of inter-strain redundancy may indicate that the sequences play a critical role in T. pallidum virulence. These highly stable peptides are also likely to be potential targets for vaccine development.\\n\\nAuthor summaryVariations in tprK have been acknowledged to be the major contributors to persistent Treponema pallidum infections. Previous studies were based on the clone-based Sanger approach, and most of them were performed in propagated strains using rabbits, which could not reflect the actual heterogeneous characteristics of tprK in vivo. In the present study, we employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to explore the profile of tprK directly from 14 patients with primary syphilis. Our results showed a mixture of distinct sequences within each V region of tprK in these clinical samples. First, the length of identified distinct sequences within the region was variable, which differed by only 3 bp or multiples of 3 bp. Then, among the mixtures, a predominant sequence was usually observed for each region, and the remaining minor variants were mainly observed at a frequency of 1-5%. In addition, there was a scenario of amino acid sequence consistency within the regions between the 14 primary syphilis strains. The identification of the profile of tprK in the context of human primary syphilis infection contributes to further exploration of the pathogenesis of syphilis.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesRecently an objective measure of speech intelligibility, based on brain responses derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), has been developed using isolated Matrix sentences as a stimulus. We investigated whether this objective measure of speech intelligibility can also be used with natural speech as a stimulus, as this would be beneficial for clinical applications.\n\nDesignWe recorded the EEG in 19 normal-hearing participants while they listened to two types of stimuli: Matrix sentences and a natural story. Each stimulus was presented at different levels of speech intelligibility by adding speech weighted noise. Speech intelligibility was assessed in two ways for both stimuli: (1) behaviorally and (2) objectively by reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG using a linear decoder and correlating it with the acoustic envelope. We also calculated temporal response functions (TRFs) to investigate the temporal characteristics of the brain responses in the EEG channels covering different brain areas.\n\nResultsFor both stimulus types the correlation between the speech envelope and the reconstructed envelope increased with increasing speech intelligibility. In addition, correlations were higher for the natural story than for the Matrix sentences. Similar to the linear decoder analysis, TRF amplitudes increased with increasing speech intelligibility for both stimuli. Remarkable is that although speech intelligibility remained unchanged in the no noise and +2.5 dB SNR condition, neural speech processing was affected by the addition of this small amount of noise: TRF amplitudes across the entire scalp decreased between 0 to 150 ms, while amplitudes between 150 to 200 ms increased in the presence of noise. TRF latency changes in function of speech intelligibility appeared to be stimulus specific: The latency of the prominent negative peak in the early responses (50-300 ms) increased with increasing speech intelligibility for the Matrix sentences, but remained unchanged for the natural story.\n\nConclusionsThese results show (1) the feasibility of natural speech as a stimulus for the objective measure of speech intelligibility, (2) that neural tracking of speech is enhanced using a natural story compared to Matrix sentences and (3) that noise and the stimulus type can change the temporal characteristics of the brain responses. These results might reflect the integration of incoming acoustic features and top-down information, suggesting that the choice of the stimulus has to be considered based on the intended purpose of the measurement.",

    "abstract": "The insulin/IGF-signaling pathway is central in control of nutrient-dependent growth during development, and in adult physiology and longevity. Eight insulin-like peptides (DILP1-8) have been identified in Drosophila and several of these are known to regulate growth, metabolism, reproduction, stress responses and lifespan. However, the functional role of DILP1 is far from understood. Previous work has shown that dilp1/DILP1 is transiently expressed mainly during the non-feeding pupal stage and the first days of adult life. Here we show that mutation of dilp1 diminishes organismal weight during pupal development, whereas overexpression increases it, similar to dilp6 manipulations. No growth effects of dilp1 or dilp6 manipulations were detected during larval development. We next show that dilp1 and dilp6 increase metabolic rate in the late pupa and promote lipids as the primary source of catabolic energy. This lipid mobilization in the pupa is not correlated with transcriptional changes of adipokinetic hormone. The effects of dilp1 manipulations carry over to the adult fly. In newly eclosed flies, survival during starvation is strongly diminished in dilp1 mutants, but not in dilp2 and dilp1-dilp2 double mutants, whereas in older flies only double mutants display reduced starvation resistance. In conclusion, dilp1 and dilp6 promote growth of adult tissues during the non-feeding pupal stage, likely by utilization of stored lipids. This results in larger newly-eclosed flies with reduced stores of pupal-derived nutrients and diminished starvation tolerance and fecundity.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques such as MRI have been widely used to explore the associations between brain areas. Structural connectivity (SC) captures the anatomical pathways across the brain and functional connectivity (FC) measures the correlation between the activity of brain regions. These connectivity measures have been much studied using network theory in order to uncover the distributed organization of brain structures, in particular FC for task-specific brain communication. However, the application of network theory to study FC matrices is often \"static\" despite the dynamic nature of time series obtained from fMRI. The present study aims to overcome this limitation by introducing a network-oriented analysis applied to whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) useful to interpret the brain dynamics. Technically, we tune a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process to reproduce the statistics of the whole-brain resting-state fMRI signals, which provides estimates for MOU-EC as well as input properties (similar to local excitabilities). The network analysis is then based on the Green function (or network impulse response) that describes the interactions between nodes across time for the estimated dynamics. This model-based approach provides time-dependent graph-like descriptor, named communicability, that characterize the roles that either nodes or connections play in the propagation of activity within the network. They can be used at both global and local levels, and also enables the comparison of estimates from real data with surrogates (e.g. random network or ring lattice). In contrast to classical graph approaches to study SC or FC, our framework stresses the importance of taking the temporal aspect of fMRI signals into account. Our results show a merging of functional communities over time (in which input properties play a role), moving from segregated to global integration of the network activity. Our formalism sets a solid ground for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data, including task-evoked activity.",

Brazil has established NTRs, but currently lacks scientific knowledge and understanding of their ecological role, particularly regarding rocky reefs in subtropical regions. Consequently, this study aimed to contrast NTR, from the 30 year old Tupinambas Ecological Station, and comparable fished sites across a coastal biogeographic gradient to investigate the effect of fishing and habitat variability on the abundance and body-size of rocky reef fish. We used Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video (stereo-BRUVs) and Diver Operated stereo-Video (stereo-DOVs) systems to simultaneously sample reef fish and habitat. Model selection and results identified habitat and biogeographic variables, such as distance from shore, as important predictor variables, explaining several aspects of the fish assemblage. The effect of protection was important in determining the abundance and body-size of targeted species, in particular for epinephelids and carangids. Conversely, species richness was correlated with habitat complexity and not with protection status. This is the first study to publish data using these novel survey methods in the Southeastern Atlantic and demonstrate their utility, in combination with an established network of NTRs, to provide benchmarks for conservation and fisheries management.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded, positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to the family of Flaviviridae, and it is mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti). Understanding the interaction of the virus with mosquito vector is vital for devising new strategies for preventing virus transmission. Although protein-coding genes have been the central focus, many reports indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were also involved in virus-host interaction. Recently, the latest version of Ae. aegypti genome (AaegL5) was released, and the assembly was up to chromosome level. This prompted us to perform lncRNA identification and characterization using the latest genome release as reference. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of both protein-coding and lncRNA genes in Aedes aegypti cells upon DENV infection. By combining RNA-seq libraries generated in this study with publicly available datasets, we identified a total of 7,221 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 3,052 and 3,620 were intronic and intergenic respectively, while 549 were antisense to the reference genes. A total of 2,435 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 956 of them were lncRNAs. Overall, the distribution of lncRNA expression and fold change upon virus infection were lower than that of protein-coding genes. We found that the expression of immune-related genes involved in IMD and MAPK signaling pathways were altered. In addition, the expression of major genes involved in RNA-interference (RNAi) pathway that confers antiviral resistance in mosquitoes were found to be unchanged upon DENV infection. Gene ontology analysis suggests that differentially expressed transcripts, either upregulated or downregulated, generally belong to the same functional categories or working in similar signaling pathways. Taken together, besides providing a new set of lncRNA repertoire, the outcomes of our study offer better understanding of Ae. aegypti responses to DENV infection at gene level.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDengue virus (DENV), a single-stranded and positive-strand RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae, is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) mosquitoes. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of dengue virus namely DENV1-4. Our understanding on the interaction of each serotype of DENV with its mosquito vector is still very limited. Since vector-borne viruses pose significant burden to public health, knowledge on the virus-host interaction at the molecular level is essential, especially in developing effective strategies to control virus transmission. In this study, we embarked on investigating the transcriptional response of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and protein-coding genes upon dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) infection. Besides, we also generate a comprehensive list of novel lncRNAs identified from the latest and improved genome version of Ae. aegypti. Similar to protein-coding genes, we discovered that the overall expression of lncRNA was significantly altered, suggesting that lncRNAs were involved in virus-host interaction. The results of this study provide basic understanding on the interaction between DENV1 and Ae. aegypti vector at the transcriptional level.",

    "abstract": "Suppressor of copper sensitivity protein C from Proteus mirabilis (PmScsC) is a homotrimeric disulfide isomerase that plays a role in copper tolerance - a key virulence trait of the uropathogen. Each protomer of the enzyme has an N-terminal trimerisation stem (59 residues) containing a flexible linker (11 residues) connected to a thioredoxin-fold-containing catalytic domain (163 residues). Here, we characterise two PmScsC variants, PmScsC{Delta}N and PmScsC{Delta}Linker. PmScsC{Delta}N, is an N-terminally truncated form of the protomer with two helices of the trimerisation stem removed, generating a protein with dithiol oxidase rather than disulfide isomerase activity. The crystal structure of PmScsC{Delta}N reported here reveals - as expected - a monomer that is structurally similar to the catalytic domain of native PmScsC. The second variant PmScsC{Delta}Linker was designed to remove the 11 amino acid linker and we show that it generates a protein that has neither disulfide isomerase nor dithiol oxidase activity. The crystal structure of PmScsC{Delta}Linker reveals a trimeric arrangement, with the catalytic domains packed together very closely. Small angle X-ray scattering analysis found that native PmScsC is predominantly trimeric in solution even at low concentration, whereas PmScsC{Delta}Linker exists as an equilibrium between monomeric, dimeric and trimeric states, with the monomeric form dominating at low concentrations. These findings increase our understanding of disulfide isomerase activity, showing how (i) oligomerisation, (ii) spacing between, and (iii) dynamic motion of, catalytic domains in PmScsC all contribute to its native function.",

Existing spliced alignment algorithms do not exploit the information on the splicing structure of the input sequences, namely the exon structure of the cDNA sequence and the exon-intron structure of the genomic sequences. Yet, this information is often available for coding DNA sequences (CDS) and gene sequences annotated in databases, and it can help improve the accuracy of the computed spliced alignments. To address this issue, we introduce a new spliced alignment problem and a method called SplicedFamAlign (SFA) for computing the alignment of a spliced CDS against a gene sequence while accounting for the splicing structures of the input sequences, and then the inference of transcript splicing orthology groups in a gene family based on spliced alignments.\\n\\nResultsThe experimental results show that SFA outperforms existing spliced alignment methods in terms of accuracy and execution time for CDS-to-gene alignment. We also show that the performance of SFA remains high for various levels of sequence similarity between input sequences, thanks to accounting for the splicing structure of the input sequences. It is important to notice that unlike all current spliced alignment methods that are meant for cDNA-to-genome alignments and can be used for CDS-to-gene alignments, SFA is the first method specifically designed for CDS-to-gene alignments. We show its usefulness for the comparison of genes and transcripts within a gene family for the purpose of analyzing splicing orthologies. It can also be used for gene structure annotation and alternative splicing analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilitySplicedFamAlign was implemented in Python.

    "abstract": "In laboratory strains of zebrafish, sex determination occurs in the absence of a typical sex chromosome and it is not known what regulates the proportion of animals that develop as male or female. Many sex determination and differentiation genes that act downstream of a sex chromosome are well conserved among vertebrates, but studies that test their contribution to this process have mostly been limited to mammalian models. In mammals, WNT4 is a signaling ligand that is essential for ovary and Mullerian duct development, where it function, in part, to antagonize the male-promoting FGF9 signal. Wnt4 is highly conserved in non-mammalian vertebrates, but it is not known if Wnt4 plays a role in sex determination and/or the differentiation of sex organs outside of mammals. This is an especially interesting question in teleost, such as zebrafish, because they lack an Fgf9 ortholog. Here we show that wnt4a is the ortholog of mammalian Wnt4, and that wnt4b was present in the last common ancestor of humans and zebrafish, but was lost in mammals. We found that wnt4a is expressed in the somatic cells of juvenile gonads during the time sex determination likely occurs. We show that wnt4a loss-of-function mutants develop predominantly as males and conclude that wnt4a activity promotes female sex determination in zebrafish. Additionally, both male and female wnt4a mutants are sterile because their reproductive ducts do not connect to the vent, where wnt4a is normally expressed. Yet when dissected from homozygous wnt4a mutant gonads, both sperm and eggs can produce fertile offspring. Together these results strongly argue that Wnt4a is a conserved regulator of female sex determination and reproductive duct development in non-mammalian vertebrates.\\n\\nSUMMARYWnt4 is a key regulator of ovary development in mammals, but it is not known if it plays a similar role in other vertebrates. Here we show that zebrafish wnt4a is the ortholog of mammalian Wnt4. We show that wnt4a is expressed in zebrafish somatic gonad cells during the time sex determination likely occurs. Through analysis of wnt4a mutants, we show that Wnt4a promotes female sex determination and the development of the male and female reproductive. We conclude that Wnt4/Wnt4a is likely a conserved regulator of ovarian and reproductive duct development in all vertebrates",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases arising from pathogen spillover from mammals to humans comprise a substantial health threat. Tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in One Health disciplines. However, the species that share pathogens most widely with other mammals, and the role of different wildlife groups in sharing viruses with humans remain poorly identified. To address this challenge, we applied network analysis and Bayesian hierarchical models to a global database of mammal-virus associations. We show that domesticated mammals and some primates hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal-virus associations. We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses, while the frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than DNA viruses. Among entire host-virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses with other host species, while network centrality of Primates scored relatively high for sharing DNA viruses. Ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses. Acknowledging the role of domestic species in addition to host and virus traits in patterns of virus sharing is necessary to improve our understanding of virus spread and spillover in times of global change.",

Place cells and grid cells provide evidence for such a map in a spatial context. Emerging evidence suggests analogous cells code for non-spatial information. Further, it has been shown that grid cells resemble the eigenvectors of the relationship between place cells and can be learnt from local inputs. Here we show that these locally-learnt eigenvectors contain not only local information but also global knowledge that can provide both distributions over future states as well as a global distance measure encoding approximate distances between every object in the world. By simply changing the weights in the grid cell population, it is possible to switch between computing these different measures. We demonstrate a simple algorithm can use these measures to globally navigate arbitrary topologies without searching more than one step ahead. We refer to this as intuitive planning.",

    "abstract": "Cytometry is an important single cell analysis technology in furthering our understanding of cellular biological processes and in supporting clinical diagnoses across a variety hematological and immunological conditions. Current data analysis workflows for cytometry data rely on a manual process called gating to classify cells into canonical types. This dependence on human annotation significantly limits the rate, reproducibility, and scope of cytometrys use in both biological research and clinical practice. We develop a novel Bayesian approach for automated gating that classifies cells into different types by combining cell-level marker measurements with an informative prior. The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of biologically-meaningful prior information that captures the domain expertise of human experts. The inference algorithm results in a hierarchically-structured classification of individual cells in a manner that mimics the tree-structured recursive process of manual gating, making the results readily interpretable. The approach can be extended in a natural fashion to handle data from multiple different samples by the incorporation of random effects in the Bayesian model. The proposed approach is evaluated using mass cytometry data, on the problems of unsupervised cell classification and supervised clinical diagnosis, illustrating the benefits of both incorporating prior knowledge and sharing information across multiple samples.",

    "abstract": "The human disease lymphatic filariasis causes the debilitating effects of elephantiasis and hydrocele. Lymphatic filariasis currently affects the lives of 90 million people in 52 countries. There are three nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis, Brugia malayi, B. timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti, but 90% of all cases of lymphatic filariasis are caused solely by W. bancrofti. Here we use population genomics to identify the geographic origin of W. bancrofti and reconstruct its spread. Previous genomic sequencing efforts have suffered from difficulties in obtaining Wb DNA. We used selective whole genome amplification to enrich W. bancrofti DNA from infected blood samples and were able to analyze 47 whole genomes of W. bancrofti from endemic locations in Haiti, Mali, Kenya, and Papua New Guinea. Our results are consistent with a Southeast Asia or East Asia origin for W. bancrofti spread around the globe by infecting migrating populations of humans. Austronesians probably introduced W. ban-crofti to Madagascar where later migrations moved it to continental Africa. From Africa, W. bancrofti spread to the New World during the transatlantic slave trade. The greater genetic diversity of W. bancrofti populations from Haiti are also consistent with genetic admixture from multiple source populations. Genome scans for locally adapted haplotypes identified genes associated with human immune suppression and insecticide sensitivity. Locally adapted haplotypes may provide a foundation to understand the distribution of W. bancrofti compared to that of other filarial nematodes and how populations may differ in response to eradication efforts.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing health burden currently affecting 10-15% of adults worldwide. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of CKD and eGFR or related phenotypes have identified a number of variants associated with kidney function, but these only explain a fraction of the variability in kidney phenotypes attributed to genetic components. To extend these studies, we analyzed data from the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), which is more densely imputed than previous studies, and performed a GWAS meta-analysis of eGFR with publicly available summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identified 147 loci (53 novel loci) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Moreover, genes at these loci show enriched expression in urogenital tissues and highlight gene sets known to play a role in kidney function. In addition, sex-stratified analysis identified three regions (prioritized genes: PPM1J, MCL1, and SLC47A1) with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD but improve detection only modestly compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD.",

    "abstract": "Speakers occasionally cause the verb to agree with an element that is not the subject, a so-called  attractor; likewise, comprehenders occasionally fail to notice agreement errors when the attractor agrees with the verb. Cross-linguistic studies converge in showing that attraction is modulated by the hierarchical position of the attractor in the sentence structure. We report two experiments exploring the link between structural position and memory representations in attraction. The method used is innovative in two respects: we used jabberwocky materials to control for semantic influences and focus on structural agreement processing, and we used a Speed-Accuracy Trade-off (SAT) design combined with a memory probe recognition task, as classically used in list memorization tasks. SAT allowed us to investigate the full time-course of processing and it enabled the joint measurement of retrieval speed and retrieval accuracy. Experiment 1 first established that attraction arises in jabberwocky sentences, to a similar extent and following the same structure-dependency as in natural sentences. Experiment 2 showed a close alignment between the attraction profiles found in Experiment 1 and memory parameters. Results support a content-addressable architecture of memory representations for sentences in which nouns accessibility depends on their syntactic position, while subjects are kept in the focus of attention.",

    "abstract": "For most reef-building corals, the establishment of symbiosis occurs via horizontal transmission, where juvenile coral recruits acquire their algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) from their surrounding environment post-settlement. This transmission strategy allows corals to interact with a diverse array of symbionts, potentially facilitating adaptation to the newly settled environment. We exposed aposymbiotic Pseudodiploria strigosa recruits from the Flower Garden Banks to natal reef sediment (C-S+), symbiotic adult coral fragments (C+S-), sediment and coral fragments (C+S+), or seawater controls (C-S-) and quantified rates of symbiont uptake and Symbiodiniaceae community composition within each recruit using metabarcoding of the ITS2 locus. The most rapid uptake was observed in C+S+ treatments and this combination also led to the highest symbiont alpha diversity in recruits. While C-S+ treatments exhibited the next highest uptake rate, only one individual recruit successfully established symbiosis in the C+S-treatment, suggesting that sediment both serves as a direct symbiont source for coral recruits and promotes (or, potentially, mediates) transmission from adult coral colonies. In turn, presence of adult corals facilitated uptake from the sediment, perhaps via chemical signaling. Taken together, our results reinforce the key role of sediment in algal symbiont uptake by P. strigosa recruits and suggest that sediment plays a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient, role in the life cycle of the algal Symbiodinaceae symbionts.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology for editing and manipulating nucleic acids. However, the occurrence of off-target mutations can limit its applicability. Here, all-atom enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations - using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) - are used to decipher the mechanism of off-target binding at the molecular level. GaMD reveals that base pair mismatches in the target DNA at specific distal sites with respect to the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) induce an extended opening of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex, which leads to newly discovered interactions between the unwound nucleic acids and the protein counterpart. The conserved interactions between the target DNA strand and the L2 loop of the catalytic HNH domain constitute a \\\"lock\\\" effectively decreasing the conformational freedom of the HNH domain and its activation for cleavage. Remarkably, depending on their position at PAM distal sites, DNA mismatches leading to off-target cleavages are unable to \\\"lock\\\" the HNH domain, thereby identifying the ability to \\\"lock\\\" HNH as a key determinant. Consistently, off-target sequences hampering the catalysis have been shown to \\\"trap\\\" somehow the HNH domain in an inactive \\\"conformational checkpoint\\\" state (Dagdas et al. Sci Adv, 2017). As such, this mechanism identifies the molecular basis underlying off-target cleavages and contributes in clarifying a long-lasting open issue of the CRISPR-Cas9 function. It also poses the foundation for designing novel and more specific Cas9 variants, which could be obtained by magnifying the \\\"locking\\\" interactions between HNH and the target DNA in the presence of any incorrect off-target sequence, thus preventing undesired cleavages.",

Currently, such studies are performed largely retrospectively, but to be actionable they need to be carried out prospectively, in which samples are continuously added and compared to previous samples.

The choice of genomic regions to compare, i.e., the core genome, is critical to obtain a good metric.\\n\\nWe propose a novel core genome method that selects conserved sequences in the reference genome by comparing its k-mer content to that of publicly available genome assemblies.

Based on clinical data sets of 3436 S. aureus, 1362 K. pneumoniae and 348 E. faecium samples, we show that the conserved-sequence genome disambiguates same-patient samples better than a core genome consisting of conserved genes. The conserved-sequence genome confirms outbreak samples with high accuracy: in a set of 2335 S. aureus samples, it correctly identifies 44 out of 45 outbreak samples, whereas the conserved gene method confirms 38 out of 45 outbreak samples.",

    "abstract": "Illumina sequencing has revolutionized yeast genomics, with prices for commercial draft genome sequencing now below $200. The popular SPAdes assembler makes it simple to generate a de novo genome assembly for any yeast species. However, whereas making genome assemblies has become routine, understanding what they contain is still challenging. Here, we show how graphing the information that SPAdes provides about the length and coverage of each scaffold can be used to investigate the nature of an assembly, and to diagnose possible problems. Scaffolds derived from mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal DNA, and yeast plasmids can be identified by their high coverage. Contaminating data, such as cross-contamination from other samples in a multiplex sequencing run, can be identified by its low coverage. Scaffolds derived from the bacteriophage PhiX174 and Lambda DNAs that are frequently used as molecular standards in Illumina protocols can also be detected. Assemblies of yeast genomes with high heterozygosity, such as interspecies hybrids, often contain two types of scaffold: regions of the genome where the two alleles assembled into two separate scaffolds and each has a coverage level C, and regions where the two alleles co-assembled (collapsed) into a single scaffold that has a coverage level 2C. Visualizing the data with Coverage-versus-Length (CVL) plots, which can be done using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, provides a simple method to understand the structure of a genome assembly and detect aberrant scaffolds or contigs. We provide a Python script that allows assemblies to be filtered to remove contaminants identified in CVL plots.\\n\\n100-word article summaryWe describe a simple new method, Coverage-versus-Length plots, for examining de novo genome sequence assemblies. These plots enable researchers to detect scaffolds that have unusually high or unusually low coverage, which allows contaminants, and scaffolds that come from atypical parts of the organisms DNA complement, to be detected. We show that contaminants are common in yeast genomes sequenced in multiplex Illumina runs. We provide instructions for making plots using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and software for filtering assemblies to remove contaminants. Contaminants can be detected and removed, even without knowing their source.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an under-recognized public health threat. Even mild brain injury, or concussions, may lead to long-term neurologic impairment. Microglia play a fundamental role in the development and progression of this subsequent neurologic impairment. Despite this, a microglia-specific injury signature has yet to be identified. In the current study we hypothesized that TBI-associated microglia would adopt longitudinal changes in their transcriptional profile associated with pathways linked to the development of motor, cognitive, and behavioral disorders. C57BL/6 mice underwent TBI via a controlled cortical impact and were followed longitudinally. FACSorted microglia from TBI mice were subjected to RNA-sequencing at 7, 30, and 90 days post-injury. We identified 4 major patterns of gene expression corresponding to the host defense response, synaptic potentiation, lipid remodeling, and membrane polarization. In particular, significant upregulation of genes involved in long-term synaptic potentiation including Ptpn5, Shank3, and Sqstm1 were observed offering new insight into a previously unknown role of microglia in the weakening of synaptic efficacy between neurons after brain injury.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParkinson disease is an intractable disorder with heterogeneous clinical presentation that may reflect different underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Surrogate indicators of pathogenic processes correlating with clinical measures may assist in better patients stratification. Mitochondrial function - which is impaired in and central to PD pathogenesis - may represent one of such surrogate indicators.\\n\\nMethodsMitochondrial function was assessed by respirometry experiment in fibroblasts derived from idiopathic patients (n=47) in normal conditions and in experimental settings that do not permit glycolysis and therefore force energy production through mitochondrial function. Respiratory parameters and clinical measures were correlated with bivariate analysis. Machine learning based classification and regression trees were used to classify patients on the basis of biochemical and clinical measures. Effects of mitochondrial respiration on alpha-synuclein stress was assessed monitoring the protein phosphorylation in permitting versus restrictive glycolysis conditions.\\n\\nResultsBioenergetics properties in peripheral fibroblasts correlate with clinical measures in idiopathic patients and correlation is stronger with predominantly non-dopaminergic signs. Bioenergetics analysis under metabolic stress, in which energy is produced solely by mitochondria, shows that patients fibroblasts can augment respiration, therefore indicating that mitochondrial defects are reversible. Forcing energy production through mitochondria, however, favors alpha-synuclein stress in different cellular experimental systems. Machine learning-based classification identified different groups of patients in which increasing disease severity parallels higher mitochondrial respiration.\\n\\nConclusionSuppression of mitochondrial activity in Parkinson disease may be an adaptive strategy to cope with concomitant pathogenic factors. Moreover, mitochondrial measures are potential biomarkers to follow disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates protein and organelle turnover and maintains cellular homeostasis. Autophagosomes transport cargo to lysosomes and their formation is dependent on an appropriate lipid supply. Here, we show that the knockout of the RAB GTPase RAB18 interferes with lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, resulting in an impaired fatty acid mobilization. The reduced LD-derived lipid availability influences autophagy and provokes adaptive modifications of the autophagy network, which include increased ATG2B expression and ATG12-ATG5 conjugate formation as well as enhanced ATG2B and ATG9A phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ATG9A directs this transmembrane protein to the site of autophagosome formation and this particular modification is sufficient to rescue autophagic activity under basal conditions in the absence of RAB18. However, it is incapable of enabling an increased autophagy under inductive conditions. Thus, we illustrate the role of RAB18 in connecting LDs and autophagy, further emphasize the importance of LD-derived lipids for the degradative pathway, and characterize an ATG9A phosphorylation-dependent autophagy rescue mechanism as an adaptive response that maintains autophagy under conditions of reduced LD-derived lipid availability.",

A consensus pause sequence that acts on RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from bacteria to mammals halts RNAP in an elemental paused state from which longer-lived pauses can arise. Although the structural foundations of pauses prolonged by backtracking or nascent RNA hairpins are recognized, the fundamental mechanism of the elemental pause is less well-defined. Here we report a mechanistic dissection that establishes the elemental pause signal (i) is multipartite; (ii) causes a modest conformational shift that puts RNAP in an off-pathway state in which template base loading but not RNA translocation is inhibited; and (iii) can easily enter pretranslocated and one-base-pair backtracked states despite principally occupying the half-translocated state observed in cryo-EM structures of paused RNAPs. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the elemental pause and a framework to understand how pausing is modulated by sequence, cellular conditions, and regulators.",

We investigate the behavior of -toc molecules in lipid bilayers containing oxidized lipids by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To verify the approach, the location and orientation of -toc are first shown to be in agreement with previous experimental results. The simulations further show that -toc molecules stay inside the lipid bilayer with their hydroxyl groups in contact with the bilayer surface. Interestingly, interbilayer -toc flip-flop was observed in both oxidized and non-oxidized bilayers with significantly higher frequency in aldehyde lipid bilayer. Free energy calculations were performed and estimates of the flip-flop rates across the bilayers were determined. As the main finding, our results show that the presence of oxidized lipids leads to a significant decrease of free energy barriers and that the flip-flop rates depend on the type of oxidized lipid present. Our results suggest that -toc molecules could potentially act as high efficacy scavengers of free radicals to protect membranes from oxidative attack and help stabilize them under oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "DYT1 dystonia is caused by an in-frame deletion of a glutamic acid codon in the gene encoding the AAA+ ATPase TorsinA. TorsinA localizes within the lumen of the nuclear envelope/ER and binds to a membrane-spanning co-factor, LAP1 or LULL1, to form an ATPase; the substrate(s) of TorsinA remain ill defined. Here we use budding yeast, which lack Torsins, to interrogate TorsinA function. We show that TorsinA accumulates at nuclear envelope embedded spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in a way that requires its oligomerization and the conserved SUN-domain protein, Mps3. TorsinA is released from SPBs upon expression of LAP1 and stabilized by LAP1 mutants incapable of stimulating TorsinA ATPase activity, suggesting the recapitulation of a TorsinA-substrate cycle. While the expression of TorsinA or TorsinA-{Delta}E impacts the fitness of strains expressing mps3 alleles, a genetic interaction with a conserved component of the nuclear pore complex, Pom152, is specific for TorsinA. This specificity is mirrored by a physical interaction between Pom152 and TorsinA, but not TorsinA-{Delta}E. These data suggest that TorsinA-nucleoporin interactions would be abrogated by TorsinA-{Delta}E, providing new experimental avenues to interrogate the molecular basis behind nuclear envelope herniations seen in cells lacking TorsinA function.",

    "abstract": "Gap junctions are proteins made of connexins which are involved in the regulation of vascular function. Deletion of connexins 43 (Cx43) modifies expression of genes known to be involved in the regulation of the vasculature, differentiation and function of vascular cells. Interestingly, mutant mice lacking endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene have been shown to be hypertensive, suggesting that nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the physiological control of blood pressure. It was therefore hypothesised that the endothelial deletion of Cx43 in the pulmonary vasculature induces endothelial dysfunction and causes eNOS impairment thereby reducing NO biosynthesis, thus leading to vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling which subsequently leads to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This project was aimed at evaluating eNOS gene expression in mice genetically heterozygous (HET) in Cx43 (Cx43 +/- mice). This was achieved by using lung tissues from four groups of wild type (W/T) and Cx43 +/- (male and female) mice. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from the lung tissues using RNA II isolation system and was reverse transcribed to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). End - point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real time PCR were used to measure the expression of eNOS gene. eNOS gene expression levels were found to be the same in all four groups of mice tested, with no significant difference. The result therefore suggests that eNOS gene is expressed in mice genetically heterozygous in Cx43 (Cx43 + / -).",

    "abstract": "During gastrulation, physical forces reshape the simple embryonic tissue to form a complex body plan of multicellular organisms1. These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the tissue undergoing gastrulation movements is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4,5. While it is well recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility6,7, it is not known if interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that impact gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope surrounding the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts the tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. Furthermore, this localized attachment is mediated by a specific integrin, and its knock-down leads to a gastrulation phenotype consistent with complete loss of attachment. Moreover, analysis of another integrin in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline. Together, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism whereby the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable counter-forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects.",

Here, we establish a set of common principles by categorising the response of individual cells against a time-varying signal. A positive intracellular signal relay of sufficient gain from participating cells is required to sustain the oscillations, together with phase matching. The two conditions yield quantitative predictions for the onset cell density and frequency in terms of measured single-cell and signal response functions. Through mathematical constructions, we show that cells that adapt to a constant stimulus fulfil the phase requirement by developing a leading phase in an active frequency window that enables cell-to-signal energy flow. Analysis of dynamical quorum sensing in several cellular systems with increasing biological complexity reaffirms the pivotal role of adaptation in powering oscillations in an otherwise dissipative cell-to-cell communication channel. The physical conditions identified also apply to synthetic oscillatory systems.",

    "abstract": "The local field potentials (LFPs) of the hippocampus are primarily generated by the spatiotemporal accretion of electrical currents via activated synapses. Oscillations in the hippocampal LFP at theta and gamma frequencies are prominent during awake-behavior and have demonstrated several behavioral correlates. In particular, both oscillations have been observed to increase in amplitude and frequency as a function of running velocity. Previous investigations, however, have examined the relationship between velocity and each of these oscillation bands separately. Based on energy cascade models where \\\"...perturbations of slow frequencies cause a cascade of energy dissipation at all frequency scales\\\" (Buzsaki 2006), we hypothesized that the cross-frequency interactions between theta and gamma should increase as a function of velocity. We examined these relationships across multiple layers of the CA1 subregion and found a reliable correlation between the power of theta and the power of gamma, indicative of an amplitude-amplitude relationship. Moreover, there was an increase in the coherence between the power of gamma and the phase of theta, demonstrating increased phase-amplitude coupling with velocity. Finally, at higher velocities, phase entrainment between theta and gamma becomes stronger. These results have important implications and provide new insights regarding how theta and gamma are integrated for neuronal circuit dynamics, with coupling strength determined by the excitatory drive within the hippocampus.",
