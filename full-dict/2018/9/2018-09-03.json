    "abstract": "Inferior frontal regions in the left and right hemisphere support different aspects of language processing. In the canonical model, left inferior frontal regions are mostly involved in processing based on phonological, syntactic and semantic features of language, whereas the right inferior frontal regions process paralinguistic aspects like affective prosody.\\n\\nUsing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based probabilistic fiber tracking in 20 healthy volunteers, we identify a callosal fiber system connecting left and right inferior frontal regions that are involved in linguistic processing of varying complexity. Anatomically, we show that the interhemispheric fibers are highly aligned and distributed along a rostral to caudal gradient in the body and genu of the corpus callosum to connect homotopic inferior frontal regions.\\n\\nIn light of converging data, taking previous DTI-based tracking studies and clinical case studies into account, our findings suggest that the right inferior frontal cortex not only processes paralinguistic aspects of language (such as affective prosody), as purported by the canonical model, but also supports the computation of linguistic aspects of varying complexity in the human brain. Our model may explain patterns of right hemispheric contribution to stroke recovery as well as disorders of prosodic processing. Beyond language-related brain function, we discuss how interspecies differences in interhemispheric connectivity and fiber density, including the system we described here, may also explain differences in transcallosal information transfer and cognitive abilities across different mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "Blue light has been shown to elicit a tumbling response in E. coli, a non-phototrophic bacterium. The exact mechanism of this phototactic response is still unknown, and its biological significance remains unclear. Here, we quantify phototaxis in E. coli by analyzing single-cell trajectories in populations of free-swimming bacteria before and after light exposure. Bacterial strains expressing only one type of chemoreceptor reveal that all five E. coli receptors - Aer, Tar, Tsr, Tap and Trg - are capable of mediating a response to light. In particular, light exposure elicits a running response in Tap-only strain, the opposite of the tumbling response observed for all other strains. Light therefore emerges as a universal stimulus for all E. coli chemoreceptors. We also show that blue light exposure causes a reversible decrease in swimming velocity, a proxy for proton motive force. We hypothesize that rather than sensing light directly, chemoreceptors sense light-induced perturbations in proton motive force.\\n\\nImportanceOur findings provide new insights on the mechanism of E. coli phototaxis, showing that all five chemoreceptor types respond to light and that their interactions play an important role in cell behavior. Our results also open up new avenues for examining and manipulating E. coli taxis. Since light is a universal stimulus, it may provide a way to quantify interactions between different types of receptors. Since light is easier to control spatially and temporally than chemicals, it may be used to study swimming behavior in complex environments. Since phototaxis can cause migration of E. coli bacteria in light gradients, light may be used to control bacterial density for studying density-dependent processes in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cell populations across nearly all forms of life generally maintain a characteristic cell type-dependent size, but how size control is achieved has been a long-standing question. Prior work has uncovered diverse size control strategies operating at distinct cell cycle stages, but it is unclear how these numerous pathways are integrated to provide robust, systems-level cell size control for any organism. Here, we probe cell growth and size control in budding yeast that can be reversibly blocked from bud initiation. While blocked, cells continue to grow isotropically, increasing their volume by more than an order of magnitude over unperturbed cells. Upon release, these  giant yeast resume budding and the population returns to its initial volume distribution within a few cell division cycles. Size control under these conditions does not require an explicit molecular size sensor. Instead, our observations are consistent with a size-invariant bud growth timer specifying the duration of S/G2/M to limit daughter cell size.",

    "abstract": "Jumping to conclusions during probabilistic reasoning is a cognitive bias reliably observed in psychosis, and linked to delusion formation. Although the reasons for this cognitive bias are unknown, one suggestion is that psychosis patients may view sampling information as more costly. However, previous computational modelling has provided evidence that patients with chronic schizophrenia jump to conclusion because of noisy decision making. We developed a novel version of the classical beads-task, systematically manipulating the cost of information gathering in four blocks. For 31 individuals with early symptoms of psychosis and 31 healthy volunteers, we examined the numbers of  draws to decision when information sampling had no, a fixed, or an escalating cost. Computational modelling involved estimating a cost of information sampling parameter and a cognitive noise parameter. Overall patients sampled less information than controls. However, group differences in numbers of draws became less prominent at higher cost trials, where less information was sampled. The attenuation of group difference was not due to floor effects, as in the most costly block participants sampled more information than an ideal Bayesian agent. Computational modelling showed that, in the condition with no objective cost to information sampling, patients attributed higher costs to information sampling than controls (Mann-Whiney U=289, p=0.007), with marginal evidence of differences in noise parameter estimates (t=1.86 df=60, p=0.07). In patients, individual differences in severity of psychotic symptoms were statistically significantly associated with higher cost of information sampling (rho=0.6, p=0.001) but not with more cognitive noise (rho=0.27, p=0.14); in controls cognitive noise predicted aspects of schizotypy (preoccupation and distress associated with delusion-like ideation on the Peters Delusion Inventory). Using a psychological manipulation and computational modelling, we provide evidence that early psychosis patients jump to conclusions because of attributing higher costs to sampling information, not because of being primarily noisy decision makers.",

    "abstract": "Here we present an open-source R package  meaRtools that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL>=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCultured neuronal networks are widely used to study and characterize neuronal network activity. Among the many uses of neuronal cultures are the capabilities to evaluate neurotoxicity and the effects of pharmacological compounds on cellular physiology. Multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can collect high-throughput data from multiple neuronal cultures simultaneously, and thereby make possible hypotheses-driven inquiries into neurobiology and neuropharmacology. The analysis of MEA-derived information presents many computational challenges. High frequency data recorded simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes can be difficult to handle. The need to compare network activity across various drug treatments or genotypes recorded on the same plate from experiments lasting several weeks presents another challenge. These challenges inspired us to develop meaRtools; an MEA data analysis package that contains new methods to characterize network activity patterns, which are illustrated here using examples from a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Among the highlights of meaRtools are novel algorithms designed to characterize neuronal activity dynamics and network properties such as bursting and synchronization, options to combine multiple recordings and use a robust statistical framework to draw appropriate statistical inferences, and finally data visualizations and plots. In summary, meaRtools provides a platform for the analyses of singular and longitudinal MEA experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal salience processing has been suggested to contribute to the formation of positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and related conditions. Previous research utilising reward learning or anticipation paradigms has demonstrated cortical and subcortical abnormalities in people with psychosis, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum. In these paradigms, reward prediction errors attribute motivational salience to stimuli. However, little is known about possible abnormalities across different forms of salience processing in psychosis patients, and whether any such abnormalities involve the dopaminergic midbrain. The aim of our study was, therefore, to investigate possible alterations in psychosis in neural activity in response to various forms of salience: novelty, negative emotion, targetness (task-driven salience) and rareness/deviance. We studied 14 antipsychotic naive participants with first episode psychosis, and 37 healthy volunteers. During fMRI scanning, participants performed a visual oddball task containing these four forms of salience. Psychosis patients showed abnormally reduced signalling in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) for novelty, negative emotional salience and targetness; reduced striatal and occipital (lingual gyrus) signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience, reduced signalling in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex and parahippocamal gyrus to negative emotional salience, and reduced cerebellar signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience. Our results indicate alterations of several forms of salience processing in patients with psychosis in the midbrain SN/VTA, with additional subcortical and cortical regions also showing alterations in salience signalling, the exact pattern of alterations depending on the form of salience in question.",

To illustrate applications of CATCH, we focused on capturing viral genomes. We designed, synthesized, and validated multiple probe sets, including one that targets whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriched unique viral content on average 18x and allowed us to assemble genomes that we could not otherwise recover, while accurately preserving within-sample diversity.

Partial reprogramming in prematurely aged mice has shown promising results in alleviating age-related symptoms without teratoma formation. Does partial reprogramming lead to rejuvenation (i.e. \\\"younger\\\" cells), rather than dedifferentiation, which bears the risk of cancer? Here we analyse the dynamics of cellular age during human iPSC reprogramming and find that partial reprogramming leads to a reduction in the epigenetic age of cells. We also find that the loss of somatic gene expression and epigenetic age follow different kinetics, suggesting that they can be uncoupled and there could be a safe window where rejuvenation can be achieved with a minimised risk of cancer.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict local structural features of a protein from the primary sequence is of paramount importance for unravelling its function in absence of experimental structural information. Two main factors affect the utility of potential prediction tools: their accuracy must enable extraction of reliable structural information on the proteins of interest, and their runtime must be low to keep pace with sequencing data being generated at a constantly increasing speed.\\n\\nHere, we present an updated and extended version of the NetSurfP tool (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP-2.0/), that can predict the most important local structural features with unprecedented accuracy and runtime. NetSurfP-2.0 is sequence-based and uses an architecture composed of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks trained on solved protein structures. Using a single integrated model, NetSurfP-2.0 predicts solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder, and backbone dihedral angles for each residue of the input sequences.\\n\\nWe assessed the accuracy of NetSurfP-2.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output features. We observe a correlation of 80% between predictions and experimental data for solvent accessibility, and a precision of 85% on secondary structure 3-class predictions. In addition to improved accuracy, the processing time has been optimized to allow predicting more than 1,000 proteins in less than 2 hours, and complete proteomes in less than 1 day.",

    "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiencies affect a large part of the world population. They are mostly due to the consumption of grains with insufficient content of Fe or Zn. Both de novo uptake by roots and recycling from leaves may provide seeds with nutrients. Autophagy, which is a conserved mechanism for nutrient recycling in eukaryotes, was shown to be involved in nitrogen remobilization to seeds. Here, we have investigated the role of this mechanism in micronutrient translocation to seeds. We found that several Arabidopsis thaliana plants impaired in autophagy display defects in nutrient remobilization to seeds. In atg5-1 mutant, which is completely defective in autophagy, the efficiency of Fe translocation from vegetative organs to seeds was severely decreased even when Fe was provided during seed formation. Combining atg5-1 with sid2 mutation that counteracts premature senescence associated to autophagy deficiency and using 57Fe pulse labeling, we could propose a two-step mechanism in which iron taken up de novo during seed formation is first accumulated in vegetative organs and subsequently remobilized to seeds. Finally, we showed that translocations of zinc and manganese to seeds are also dependent on autophagy. Fine tuning autophagy during seed formation opens therefore new possibilities to improve micronutrient remobilization to seeds.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA growing number of experimental and theoretical studies show the importance of partner choice as a mechanism to promote the evolution of cooperation, especially in humans. In this paper, we focus on the question of the precise quantitative level of cooperation that should evolve under this mechanism. When individuals compete to be chosen by others, their level of investment in cooperation evolves towards higher values, a process called competitive altruism, or runaway cooperation. Using a classic adaptive dynamics model, we first show that, when the cost of changing partner is low, this runaway process can lead to a profitless escalation of cooperation. In the extreme, when partner choice is entirely frictionless, cooperation even increases up to a level where its cost entirely cancels out its benefit. That is, at evolutionary equilibrium, individuals gain the same payoff than if they had not cooperated at all. Second, importing models from matching theory in economics we, however, show that, when individuals can plastically modulate their choosiness in function of their own cooperation level, partner choice stops being a runaway competition to outbid others, and becomes a competition to form the most optimal partnerships. In this case, when the cost of changing partner tends toward zero partner choice leads to the evolution of the socially optimum level of cooperation. This last result could explain the observation that human cooperation seems to be often constrained by considerations of social efficiency.",

Fast reaction to environmental change tends to favor plastic responsiveness at the expense of greater sensitivity to perturbations that degrade homeostatic control. Greater homeostatic stability against unpredictable disturbances tends to reduce performance in tracking environmental change. This article applies the classic principles of engineering control theory to the evolutionary design of regulatory systems. The engineering theory clarifies the conceptual aspects of evolutionary tradeoffs and provides analytic methods for developing specific predictions. On the conceptual side, this article clarifies the meanings of integral control, feedback, and design, concepts that have been discussed in a confusing way within the biological literature. On the analytic side, this article presents extensive methods and examples to study error-correcting feedback, which is perhaps the single greatest principle of design in both human-engineered and naturally designed systems. The broad framework and associated software code provide a comprehensive how-to guide for making models that focus on functional aspects of regulatory control and for making comparative predictions about regulatory design in response to various kinds of environmental challenge. The second article in this series analyzes how alternative regulatory designs influence the relative levels of genetic variability, stochasticity of trait expression, and heritability of disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMammalian cells are flexible and can rapidly change shape when they contract, adhere, or migrate. Their nucleus must be stiff enough to withstand cytoskeletal forces, but flexible enough to remodel as the cell changes shape. This is particularly important for cells migrating through constricted space, where the nuclear shape must change in order to fit through the constriction. This occurs many times in the life cycle of a neutrophil, which must protect its chromatin from damage and disruption associated with migration.\\n\\nResultsTotal RNA-sequencing identified that neutrophil migration through 5 or 14m pores was associated with changes in the transcript levels of inflammation and chemotaxis-related genes, when compared to unmigrated cells. Differentially expressed transcripts specific to migration with constriction were enriched for groups of genes associated with cytoskeletal remodeling.\\n\\nHi-C was used to capture the genome organization in control and migrated cells. Minimal switching was observed between the active (A) and inactive (B) compartments after migration. However, global depletion of short range contacts was observed following migration with constriction compared to migration without constriction. Regions with disrupted contacts, TADs, and compartments were enriched for inactive chromatin.\\n\\nConclusionShort range genome organization is preferentially altered in inactive chromatin, possibly protecting transcriptionally active contacts from the disruptive effects of migration with constriction.

Further investigation concerning the contribution of heterochromatin to stiffness, flexibility, and protection of nuclear function will be important for understanding cell migration in human health and disease.",

However, whether this is true for functional network activity remains unknown, primarily due to experimental inaccessibility of the initial stages of the living human brain. Here, we developed cortical organoids that spontaneously display periodic and regular oscillatory network events that are dependent on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. These nested oscillations exhibit cross-frequency coupling, proposed to coordinate neuronal computation and communication. As evidence of potential network maturation, oscillatory activity subsequently transitioned to more spatiotemporally irregular patterns, capturing features observed in preterm human electroencephalography (EEG).

    "abstract": "Sex differences in the study of the human physiological response to mental stress are often erroneously ignored. To this end, we set out to show that our understanding of the stress response is fundamentally altered once sex differences are taken into account. This is achieved by comparing the heart rate variability (HRV) signals acquired during mental maths tests from ten females and ten males of similar maths ability; all females were in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. For rigour, the HRV signals from this pilot study were analysed using temporal, spectral and nonlinear signal processing techniques, which all revealed significant statistical differences between the sexes, with the stress-induced increases in the heart rates from the males being significantly larger than those from the females (p-value=2.2x10-3). In addition, mental stress produced an overall increase in the power of the low frequency component of HRV in the males, but caused an overall decrease in the females. The stress-induced changes in the power of the high frequency component were even more profound; it greatly decreased in the males, but increased in the females. We also show that mental stress was followed by the expected decrease in sample entropy, a nonlinear measure of signal regularity, computed from the males HRV signals, while overall, stress manifested in an increase in the sample entropy computed from the females HRV signals. This finding is significant, since mental stress is commonly understood to be manifested in the decreased entropy of HRV signals, however, the significant difference (p-value=2x10-9) in the changes in the entropies from the males and females highlights the pitfalls in ignoring sex in the formation of a physiological hypothesis. Furthermore, it has been argued that oestrogen attenuates the effect of catecholamine stress hormones; the findings from this investigation suggest for the first time that the conventionally cited cardiac changes, attributed to the fight-or-flight stress response, are not universally applicable to females. Instead, this pilot study provides an alternative interpretation of cardiac responses to stress in females, which indicates a closer alignment to the evolutionary tend-and-befriend response.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic vertebrates have a remarkable ability to regenerate limbs and tails after amputation. Previous studies indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling initiates regeneration, but the mechanism by which this takes place is poorly understood. Developmental signalling pathways have been shown to have pro-regenerative roles in many systems. However, whether these are playing roles that are specific to regeneration, or are simply recapitulating their developmental functions is unclear. We have analysed zebrafish larval tail regeneration and find evidence that ROS released upon wounding cause repositioning of notochord cells to the damage site. These cells secrete Hedgehog ligands which are required for regeneration. Hedgehog signalling is not required for normal tail development suggesting that it has a regeneration specific role. Our results provide a model for how ROS initiate tail regeneration, and indicate that developmental signaling pathways can play regenerative functions that are not directly related to their developmental roles.",

    "abstract": "Cortical collapse factors affect microtubule (MT) dynamics at the plasma membrane. They play important roles in neurons, as suggested by inhibition of axon growth and regeneration through the Arf activator Efa6 in C. elegans, and by neurodevelopmental disorders linked to the mammalian kinesin Kif21A. How cortical collapse factors influence axon growth is little understood. Here we studied them, focussing on the function of Drosophila Efa6 in experimentally and genetically amenable fly neurons. First, we show that Drosophila Efa6 can inhibit MTs directly without interacting molecules via an N-terminal 18 amino acid motif (MT elimination domain/MTED) that binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule growth in vitro and cells. If N-terminal MTED-containing fragments are in the cytoplasm they abolish entire microtubule networks of mouse fibroblasts and whole axons of fly neurons. Full-length Efa6 is membrane-attached, hence primarily blocks MTs in the periphery of fibroblasts, and explorative MTs that have left axonal bundles in neurons. Accordingly, loss of Efa6 causes an increase of explorative MTs: in growth cones, they enhance axon growth, in axon shafts, explorative MTs cause excessive branching, as well as atrophy through perturbations of MT bundles. Efa6 over-expression causes the opposite phenotypes. Taken together, our work conceptually links molecular and sub-cellular functions of cortical collapse factors to axon growth regulation and reveals new roles in axon branching and in the prevention of axonal atrophy. Furthermore, the MTED delivers a promising tool that can be used to inhibit MTs in a compartmentalised fashion when fusing it to specifically localising protein domains.\\n\\nSummary statementThe cortical collapse factor Efa6 inhibits microtubule polymerising outside axonal bundles. Thereby it limits axon growth and branching, but preserves microtubule bundle organisation crucial for axon maintenance.",

    "abstract": "The cosynthesis of DNA and RNA potentially generates conflicts between replication and transcription, which can lead to genomic instability. In trypanosomatids, eukaryotic parasites that perform polycistronic transcription, this phenomenon and its consequences have not yet been investigated. Here, using equations and computational analysis we demonstrated that the number of constitutive origins mapped in the Trypanosoma brucei genome is close to the minimum required to complete replication within S phase duration. However, taking into account the location of these origins in the genome, the replication in due time becomes virtually impossible, making it necessary to activate non-constitutive origins. Moreover, computational and biological assays pointed to transcription being responsible for activating non-constitutive origins. Together, our results suggest that transcription action through conflicts with replication contributes to the firing of non-constitutive origins, maintaining the robustness of S phase duration. The usage of this entire pool of origins seems to be of paramount importance for the survival of this parasite that infects million people around the world since it contributes to the maintenance of the replication of its DNA.",

The CP is thought to coordinate the flagellar beat and defects in CP projections are associated with loss of motility and human disease. In most cilia, the CP nucleate near a  basal plate at the distal end of the transition zone (TZ). Here, we show that the trypanosome TZ protein  basalin is essential for building the basal plate, and its loss is associated with inefficient recruitment of CP assembly factors to the TZ, loss of the CP and flagellum paralysis. Guided by synteny, we identified highly divergent basalin orthologs in the genomes of related Leishmania species. Basalins are predicted to be highly unstructured, suggesting that they may act as  hubs facilitating many protein-protein interactions. This raises the general concept that proteins involved in cytoskeletal functions and apparently appearing organism-specific, may have highly divergent and cryptic orthologs in other species.",

    "abstract": "Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are an uncommon and heterogeneous group of malignancies that result in high mortality. Metastatic STS have very bad prognosis due to the lack of effective treatments. Dinaciclib is a model drug for the family of CDK inhibitors. Its main targets are cell cycle regulator CDK1 and protein synthesis controller CDK9. We present data supporting Dinaciclib ability to inactivate in vitro different STS models at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, the different rhythms of cell death induction allow us to further study into the mechanism of action of the drug. Cell death was found to respond to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was identified as the key regulator of this process. Bcl-xL showed a slower decay curve after protein synthesis disruption that in tolerant cell lines was enough to delay apoptosis, as its action cannot be countered by the relative low levels of pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins BIM and PUMA. Combination of Dinaciclib with BH3-mimetics led to quick and massive apoptosis induction in vitro, but in vivo assessment was prevented due to liver toxicity. Additionally, Bcl-xL inhibitor A-1331852 also synergized with conventional chemotherapy drugs as Gemcitabine. Thus, Bcl-xL targeted therapy arises as a major opportunity to the treatment of STS.",

    "abstract": "The ability to link soil microbial diversity to soil processes requires technologies that differentiate active subpopulations of microbes from so-called relic DNA and dormant cells. Measures of microbial activity based on various techniques including DNA labelling have suggested that most cells in soils are inactive, a fact that has been difficult to reconcile with observed high levels of bulk soil activities. We hypothesized that measures of in situ DNA synthesis may be missing the soil microbes that are metabolically active but not replicating, and we therefore applied BONCAT (Bioorthogonal Non Canonical Amino Acid Tagging) i.e. a proxy for activity that does not rely on cell division, to measure translationally active cells in soils. We compared the active population of two soil depths from Oak Ridge (TN) incubated under the same conditions for up to seven days. Depending on the soil, a maximum of 25 - 70% of the cells were active, accounting for 3-4 million cells per gram of soil type, which is an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates. The BONCAT positive cell fraction was recovered by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and identified by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The diversity of the active fraction was a selected subset of the bulk soil community. Excitingly, some of the same members of the community were recruited at both depths independently from their abundance rank. On average, 86% of sequence reads recovered from the active community shared >97% sequence similarity with cultured isolates from the field site. Our observations are in line with a recent report that, of the few taxa that are both abundant and ubiquitous in soil, 45% are also cultured - and indeed some of these ubiquitous microorganisms were found to be translationally active. The use of BONCAT on soil microbiomes provides evidence that a large portion of the soil microbes can be active simultaneously. We conclude that BONCAT coupled to FACS and sequencing is effective for interrogating the active fraction of soil microbiomes in situ and provides new perspectives to link metabolic capacity to overall soil ecological traits and processes.",

    "abstract": "In most mammalian species, females regularly interact with kin, and it may thus be difficult to understand the evolution of some aggressive and harmful competitive behaviour among females, such as infanticide. Here, we investigate the evolutionary determinants of infanticide by females by combining a quantitative analysis of the taxonomic distribution of infanticide with a qualitative synthesis of the circumstances of infanticidal attacks in published reports. Our results show that female infanticide is widespread across mammals and varies in relation to social organization and life-history, being more frequent where females breed in groups and have intense bouts of high reproductive output. Specifically, female infanticide occurs where the proximity of conspecific offspring directly threatens the killers reproductive success by limiting access to critical resources for her dependent progeny, including food, shelters, care or a social position. In contrast, infanticide is not immediately modulated by the degree of kinship among females, and females occasionally sacrifice closely related juveniles. Our findings suggest that the potential direct fitness rewards of gaining access to reproductive resources have a stronger influence on the expression of female aggression than the indirect fitness costs of competing against kin.",

    "abstract": "Constitutive heterochromatin is commonly associated with high levels of repressive epigenetic marks and is stably maintained transcriptionally silent by the concerted action of different, yet convergent, silencing pathways. Reactivation of heterochromatin transcription is generally associated with alterations in levels of these epigenetic marks. However, in mutants for particular epigenetic regulators, or upon particular environmental changes such as heat stress, heterochromatin-associated silencing is destabilized without noticeable changes in epigenetic marks. This suggests that transcription can occur in a non-permissive chromatin context, yet the factors involved remain poorly known. Here, we show that heat stress-induced transcription of heterochromatin depends on the TFIIH component UVH6 and the Mediator subunit MED14. Mutants for these two factors exhibit hypersensitivity to heat stress, and under these conditions, UVH6 and MED14 are required for transcription of a high number of loci. We further show that MED14, but not UVH6, is required for transcription when heterochromatin silencing is destabilized in the absence of stress. In this case, MED14 requires proper chromatin patterns of repressive epigenetic marks for its function. We also uncover that MED14 regulates non-CG DNA methylation at a subset of RNA-directed DNA methylation target loci. These findings provide insight into the control of heterochromatin transcription upon silencing destabilization and identify MED14 as a regulator of DNA methylation.",

A survey of hygienic behaviour and brood diseases was conducted on 649 colonies in eastern Australia to initiate a selective breeding program targeting disease resistance and provide a level of resistance to Varroa (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman and V. jacobsoni Oudemans) mites should they become established in Australia. The test population showed a remarkably high baseline level of hygienic behaviour with 17% of colonies meeting or exceeding breeding selection thresholds. Colonies belonging to a breeding program were 5.8 times more likely to be highly hygienic and colonies headed by queens raised from hygienic queen mothers were 2.2 times more likely. Nectar availability (nectar yielding flowering plants within honey bee forage range) influenced hygienic behaviour expression but was not a significant predictor of level of hygienic behaviour. Surprisingly, hygienic behaviour was not a significant predictor of the presence of infection of the honey bee brood disease chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) and was not influential in predicting severity of chalkbrood the infection in surveyed honey bee colonies. This study, along with reports from commercial beekeepers that chalkbrood infection is on the rise, warrants a deeper exploration of the host-pathogen relationship between Apis mellifera and Ascosphaera apis in Australia.",

    "abstract": "We present an in silico characterization of the von Hippel-Lindau like protein (VLP), the only known human paralogue of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). Phylogenetic investigation showed VLP to be mostly conserved in upper mammals and specifically expressed in brain and testis. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulation show VLP to be very similar to pVHL three-dimensional organization and binding dynamics. In particular, conservation of elements at the protein interfaces suggests VLP to be a functional pVHL homolog potentially possessing multiple functions beyond HIF-1-dependent binding activity. Our findings show that VLP may share at least seven interactors with pVHL, suggesting novel functional roles for this under-studied human protein. These may occur at precise hypoxia levels where functional overlap with pVHL may permit a finer modulation of pVHL functions.",

    "abstract": "Primnoa pacifica is the most ecologically important coral species in the North Pacific Ocean where it provides important habitat for commercially important fish and invertebrates. Ocean acidification (OA) is more rapidly increasing in high-latitude seas because anthropogenic CO2 uptake is greater in these regions. This is due to the solubility of CO2 in cold water and the reduced buffering capacity due to low alkalinity of colder waters. Primnoa pacifica colonies were cultured for six to nine months in either pH 7.55 (predicted 2100 pH levels) or pH 7.75 (control). Oocyte development and fecundity in females, and spermatocyst stages in males were measured to assess the effects of pH on gametogenesis. Oocyte diameters were 13.6% smaller and fecundities were 30.9% lower in the Year 2100 samples, indicating that OA may limit oocyte formation, potentially through lipid limitation. A higher proportion of vitellogenic oocytes (65%) were also reabsorbed (oosorption) in the Year 2100 treatment. Lowered pH appeared to advance the process of spermatogenesis with a higher percentage of later stage sperm compared to control controls. There was a laboratory effect observed in all measurement types, however these only significantly affected the analyses of spermatogenesis. These results indicate that reproduction may not be possible in an acidified ocean, or that if spawning could occur, spawned oocytes would not be sufficiently equipped to support the normal development of larvae.",

The trainee dentists conducted initial interviews with the SPs after completing the Japanese version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy. Their interviews were recorded and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. The SPs assessed the trainees communication immediately after each interview. The trainee dentists were classified into two groups (more positive and less positive groups) according to SP assessment scores.\\n\\nResultsCompared with the less positive trainees, the more positive trainees scored higher on the [Emotional expression] and lower on the [Medical data gathering] Roter Interaction Analysis System categories. There was no difference in [Dental data gathering] between the two groups. The SPs of more positive trainees had higher rates of [Positive talk] and [Emotional expression] and lower rates of [Medical information giving] and [Dental information giving]. The trainees with more positive ratings from SPs had significantly higher Jefferson Scale of Empathy total scores.\\n\\nConclusionThe results of this study suggest that responding to the SPs emotions is a relevant characteristic of dentist-SP communication to SPs positive assessment in medical interviews. Further, trainees self-reported empathy was related with the SPs assessment of trainees communication, which indicated that patient satisfaction can be improved by increasing the dentists empathy. Thus, an empathic attitude among dentists is a significant determinant of patient satisfaction.",

Especially in translational research, they play an essential role in understanding development and progression of diseases as well as in developing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Stored in biobanks, fast access to appropriate material becomes possible. However, biobanking in a clinical context faces several challenges. In practice, collecting samples during clinical routine does not allow to strictly adhere to protocols of sample collection in all aspects. This may influence sample quality to variable degrees. Time from sample draw to asservation is a variable factor, and influences of prolonged storage at ambient temperature of tissues are not well understood. We investigated whether delays between 5 minutes and 3 hours, and the use of RNAlater RNA-preserving reagent would lead to a relevant drop in sample quality, measured by quantitative mRNA expression analysis. Our findings suggest that even under ambient conditions, delays up to 3 hours do not have a major impact on sample quality as long as the tissue remains intact.",

    "abstract": "Despite the conserved function of aggression across taxa in obtaining critical resources such as food and mates, serotonins (5-HT) modulatory role on aggressive behavior appears to be largely inhibitory for vertebrates but stimulatory for invertebrates. However, critical gaps exist in our knowledge of invertebrates that need to be addressed before definitively stating opposing roles for 5-HT and aggression. Specifically, the role of 5-HT receptor subtypes are largely unknown, as is the potential interactive role of 5-HT with other neurochemical systems known to play a critical role in aggression. Similarly, the influence of these systems in driving sex differences in aggressive behavior of invertebrates is not well understood. Here, we investigated these questions by employing complementary approaches in a novel invertebrate model of aggression, the stalk-eyed fly. A combination of altered social conditions, pharmacological manipulation and 5-HT2 receptor knockdown by siRNA revealed an inhibitory role of this receptor subtype on aggression. Additionally, we provide evidence for 5-HT2s involvement in regulating neuropeptide F activity, a suspected inhibitor of aggression. However, this function appears to be stage-specific, altering only the initiation stage of aggressive conflicts. Alternatively, pharmacologically increasing systemic concentrations of 5-HT significantly elevated the expression of the neuropeptide tachykinin, which did not affect contest initiation but instead promoted escalation via production of high intensity aggressive behaviors. Notably, these effects were limited solely to males, with female aggression and neuropeptide expression remaining unaltered by any manipulation that affected 5-HT. Together, these results demonstrate a more nuanced role for 5-HT in modulating aggression in invertebrates, revealing an important interactive role with neuropeptides that is more reminiscent of vertebrates. The sex-differences described here also provide valuable insight into the evolutionary contexts of this complex behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSerotonins (5-HT) modulatory role in aggression is generally reported as inhibitory in vertebrates but stimulatory in invertebrates. Using a novel invertebrate model system, we provide evidence of common pathways of aggression at the 5-HT receptor subtype level as well as 5-HTs interactive role with other neurochemical systems namely neuropeptide F and tachykinin. Additionally, we found that these effects were sex-dependent as well as stage-dependent affecting either the initiation or escalation stage of an aggressive contest. Our results reveal the impressive level of conservation with respect to neurochemical mechanisms among species as diverse as vertebrates and invertebrates, and highlights the need to consider multiple factors when determining potential taxonomic differences in how 5-HT mediates aggression.",

Here, we found that Hsp90 inhibition induced IKK{beta} degradation, which is partially mediated by Keap1. Geldanamycin (GA), a Hsp90 inhibitor, enhances association of IKK{beta} with Keap1 through the binding site in KD, and translocates IKK{beta} to detergent-insoluble fractions leading its autophagic degradation. An electrophile tBHQ suppressed Keap1-mediated proteasomal Nrf2 degradation but not autophagic IKK{beta} degradation. Substitution mutation of Leu353 to Ala in the ULD destabilizes IKK{beta}, enhances its association with Keap1, translocates it to detergent-insoluble fractions, and causes its autophagic degradation. These results suggest that Keap1 is involved in the degradation of structural destabilized IKK{beta} and negative regulation of NF-[kcy]B under proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcross the world, ticks act as vectors of human and animal pathogens. Ticks rely on bacterial endosymbionts, which often share close and complex evolutionary links with tick-borne pathogens. As the prevalence, diversity and virulence potential of tick-borne agents remain poorly understood, there is a pressing need for microbial surveillance of ticks as potential disease vectors.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe developed a two-stage protocol that includes 16S-amplicon screening of pooled samples of hard ticks collected from dogs, sheep and camels in Palestine, followed by shotgun metagenomics on individual ticks to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. Two ticks isolated from sheep yielded an abundance of reads from the genus Rickettsia, which were assembled into draft genomes. One of the resulting genomes was highly similar to Rickettsia massiliae strain MTU5. Analysis of signature genes showed that the other represents the first genome sequence of the potential pathogen Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae. Ticks from a dog and a sheep yielded draft genome sequences of strains of the Coxiella-like endosymbiont Candidatus Coxeilla mudrowiae. A sheep tick yielded sequences from the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis, while Hyalomma ticks from camels yielded sequences belonging to Francisella-like endosymbionts. From the metagenome of a dog tick from Jericho, we generated a genome sequence of a canine parvovirus.\\n\\nSignificanceHere, we have shown how a cost-effective two-stage protocol can be used to detect and characterise tick-borne pathogens and endosymbionts. In recovering genome sequences from an unexpected pathogen (canine parvovirus) and a previously unsequenced pathogen (Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae), we demonstrate the open-ended nature of metagenomics. We also provide evidence that ticks can carry canine parvovirus, raising the possibility that ticks might contribute to the spread of this troublesome virus.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe have shown how DNA sequencing can be used to detect and characterise potentially pathogenic microorganisms carried by ticks. We surveyed hard ticks collected from domesticated animals across the West Bank territory of Palestine. All the ticks came from species that are also capable of feeding on humans. We detected several important pathogens, including two species of Rickettsia, the sheep pathogen Anaplasma ovis and canine parvovirus. These findings highlight the importance of hard ticks and the hazards they present for human and animal health in Palestine and the opportunities presented by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of DNA sequences in this setting.",

Markers of Aortic Oxidative stress were detected using assay kit. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine the expression level of eNOS and ET-1. Lipid metabolism parameters were detected with an automatic analyzer. Exercise at different intensities improved lipid metabolism, enhanced anti-oxidation function, reduced MDA, increased NO, and improved the expression of eNOS and ET-1 protein levels. Decreased blood lipids were exhibited in all exercise groups.

    "abstract": "Recently, we presented a new approach to create high-speed amplitude modulation of femtosecond laser pulses and tag multiple excitation beams with specific modulation frequencies. In this work, we discuss the utility of this method to record calcium signals in brain tissue with two-photon frequency-division multiplexing (2P-FDM) microscopy. While frequency-multiplexed imaging appears slightly inferior in terms of image quality as compared to conventional two-photon laser scanning microscopy due to shot noise-induced cross-talk between frequency channels, applying this technique to record average signals from regions of interest (ROI) such as neuronal cell bodies was found to be promising. We use phase information associated with each pixel or waveform within a selected ROI to phase-align and recombine the signals into one extended amplitude-modulated waveform. This procedure narrows the frequency detection window, effectively decreasing noise contributions from other frequency channels. Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and in vitro imaging we demonstrate a reduction of cross-talk by more than an order of magnitude and predict the usefulness of 2P-FDM for functional studies of brain activity.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex underlies our complex cognitive capabilities, yet we know little about the specific genetic loci influencing human cortical structure. To identify genetic variants, including structural variants, impacting cortical structure, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of brain MRI data from 51,662 individuals. We analysed the surface area and average thickness of the whole cortex and 34 regions with known functional specialisations. We identified 255 nominally significant loci (P [&le;] 5 x 10-8); 199 survived multiple testing correction (P [&le;] 8.3 x 10-10; 187 surface area; 12 thickness). We found significant enrichment for loci influencing total surface area within regulatory elements active during prenatal cortical development, supporting the radial unit hypothesis. Loci impacting regional surface area cluster near genes in Wnt signalling pathways, known to influence progenitor expansion and areal identity. Variation in cortical structure is genetically correlated with cognitive function, Parkinsons disease, insomnia, depression and ADHD.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCommon genetic variation is associated with inter-individual variation in the structure of the human cortex, both globally and within specific regions, and is shared with genetic risk factors for some neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is an important model system for cell and developmental biology. Applying microinjection to the C. elegans embryo had been difficult due to the rigid eggshell surrounding the embryo. In 2013, microinjection method using a carbon-coated quartz needle for the C. elegans embryo was reported. To prepare the needle, unfortunately, special equipment is required and thus a limited number of researchers can use this method. In this study, we established a method for the microinjection of drugs, dyes, and microbeads into the C. elegans embryo using an uncoated glass needle that can be produced in a general laboratory. This method enabled us to easily detect cell lineage up to adult stages by injecting a fluorescent dye into a blastomere. We also found a cell-non-autonomous control mechanism of cell adhesion; specifically, the injection of an actin inhibitor into one cell at the 2-cell stage enhanced adhesion between daughter cells of the other cell. Our microinjection method is expected to be used for broad studies and could facilitate various discoveries using C. elegans.",

Previous studies on ALPs have focused on the proteins positive effects on dough strength, whilst no correlation has been made between TaALPs and the plant immune system. Here, we performed genome-wide characterization of ALP encoding genes in bread wheat. In silico analyses indicated the presence of critical peptides in TaALPs that are active in the plant immune system. Pathogenesis-related nucleotide motifs were also identified in the putative promoter regions of TaALP encoding genes. RT-PCR was performed on TaALP and previously characterised pathogenesis resistance genes in developing wheat caryopses under control and Fusarium graminearum infection conditions. The results showed that TaALP and NMT genes were upregulated upon F. graminearum inoculation. mRNA insitu hybridization showed that TaALP genes were expressed in the embryo, aleurone and sub-aleurone layer cells. Seven TaALP genes were cloned for the expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, which displayed significant inhibitory function on F. graminearum under anti-fungal tests. In addition, FHB index association analyses showed that allelic variations of two ALP genes on chromosome 7A were significantly correlated with FHB symptoms. Over-expression of an ALP gene on chromosome 7A showed an enhanced resistance to FHB. Yeast two Hybridization results revealed that ALPs have potential proteases inhibiting effect on metacaspases and beta-glucosidases. A vital infection process related pathogen protein, F. graminearum Beta-glucosidase was found to interact with ALPs. Our study is the first to report a class of wheat storage protein or gluten protein with biochemical functions. Due to its abundance in the grain and the important multi-functions, the results obtained in the current study are expected to have a significant impact on wheat research and industry.",

    "abstract": "The human brain shows remarkable development of functional brain activity from childhood to adolescence. Here, we investigated whether electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are suitable for predicting the age of children and adolescents. Moreover, we investigated whether over-or underestimation of age was stable over longer time periods, as stable prediction error can be interpreted as reflecting individual brain maturational level. Finally, we established whether the age-prediction error was genetically determined. Three minutes eyes-closed resting state EEG data from the longitudinal EEG studies of Netherlands Twin Register (n=836) and Washington University in St. Louis (n = 702) were used at ages 5, 7, 12, 14, 16 and 18. Longitudinal data were available within childhood and adolescence. We calculated power in 1 Hz wide bins (1 to 24 Hz). Random Forest regression and Relevance Vector Machine with 6-fold cross-validation were applied. The best mean absolute prediction error was obtained with Random Forest (1.22 years). Classification of childhood vs. adolescence reached over 94% accuracy. Prediction errors were moderately to highly stable over periods of 1.5 to 2.1 years (0.53 < r < 0.74) and signifcantly affected by genetic factors (heritability between 42% and 79%). Our results show that age prediction from low-cost EEG recordings is comparable in accuracy to those obtained with MRI. Children and adolescents showed stable over- or underestimation of their age, which means that some participants have stable brain activity patterns that reflect those of an older or younger age, and could therefore reflect individual brain maturational level. This prediction error is heritable, suggesting that genes underlie maturational level of functional brain activity. We propose that age prediction based on EEG recordings can be used for tracking neurodevelopment in typically developing children, in preterm children, and in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Summary StatementsWe unveil a previously unrecognized role of peroxisomes in the regulation of mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics, mitochondrion-dependent caspase activation, and cellular apoptosis.\\n\\nAbstractPeroxisomes cooperate with mitochondria in the performance of cellular metabolic functions such as fatty acid oxidation and maintenance of redox homeostasis. Whether peroxisomes also regulate mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics or mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis has remained unclear, however. We now show that genetic ablation of the peroxins Pex3 or Pex5, which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis, resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in a manner dependent on dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Conversely, treatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid, an inducer of peroxisome proliferation, resulted in mitochondrial elongation in wild-type MEFs, but not in Pex3-deficient MEFs. We further found that peroxisome deficiency increased the levels of cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase activity under basal conditions without inducing apoptosis. It also greatly enhanced etoposide-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, indicative of an enhanced cellular sensitivity to death signals. Together, our data unveil a previously unrecognized role of peroxisomes in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. Given that mutations of peroxin genes are responsible for lethal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome, effects of such mutations on mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis may contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Orthopedic injuries often occur at the interface between soft tissues and bone. The tendon-bone junction (TBJ) is a classic example of such an interface. Current clinical strategies for TBJ injuries prioritize mechanical reattachment over regeneration of the native interface, resulting in poor outcomes. The need to promote regenerative healing of spatially-graded tissues inspires our effort to develop new tissue engineering technologies that replicate features of the spatially-graded extracellular matrix and strain profiles across the native TBJ. We recently described a biphasic collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffold containing distinct compartment with divergent mineral content and structural alignment (isotropic vs. anisotropic) linked by a continuous interface zone to mimic structural and compositional features of the native TBJ. Here, we report application of physiologically relevant levels of cyclic tensile strain (CTS) to the scaffold via a bioreactor leads to non-uniform strain profiles across the spatially-graded scaffold. Further, combinations of CTS and matrix structural features promote rapid, spatially-distinct differentiation profiles of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) down multiple osteotendinous lineages. CTS preferentially upregulates MSC activity and tenogenic differentiation in the anisotropic region of the scaffold. Further, there are no negative effects of CTS on MSC osteogenic potential in the mineralized region previously shown to promote robust bone regeneration. Together, this work demonstrates a tissue engineering approach that couples instructive biomaterials with physiological stimuli as a mean to promote regenerative healing of orthopedic interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The perivascular niche (PVN) plays an essential role in brain tumor stem-like cell (BTSC) fate control, tumor invasion, and therapeutic resistance. Herein we report on the use of a microvasculature-on-a-chip system as a PVN model to evaluate the dynamics of BTSCs ex vivo from 10 glioblastoma patients. We observed that BTSCs preferentially localize in the perivascular zone. Live cell tracking revealed that the cells residing in the vicinity of microvessels had the lowest motility, while a fraction of cells on the microvessels unexpectedly possessed the highest motility and migrated over the longest distance. These results indicate that the perivascular zone is a niche for BTSCs, while the microvascular tracks are also a path for long-distance tumor cell migration and invasion. Additionally, the degree of co-localization between tumor cells and microvessels varied significantly across patients. To validate the results from our microvasculature-on-a-chip system, we used single-cell transcriptome sequencing (10 patients and 21,750 single cells in total) to identify the subtype of each tumor cell. The co-localization coefficient was found to correlate positively with proneural (stem-like) or mesenchymal (invasive) but not classical (proliferative) tumor cells. Furthermore, we found that a gene signature profile including PDGFRA correlated strongly with the \\\"homing\\\" of brain tumor cells to the PVN. Our findings demonstrated that ex vivo dynamics of human brain tumor cells in a microvasculature-on-a-chip model can recapitulate in vivo tumor cell dynamics, heterogeneity, and subtypes, representing a new route to the study of human tumor cell biology and uncover patient-specific tumor cell functions.",

    "abstract": "The miRNA pathway consists of three segments - biogenesis, targeting and downstream regulatory effectors. How the cells control their activities remains incompletely understood. This study explored the intrinsically complex miRNA-mRNA targeting relationships, and suggested differential mechanistic control of the three segments. We first analyzed evolutionarily conserved sites for conserved miRNAs in the human transcriptome. Strikingly, AGO1, AGO2 and AGO3 are all among the top 14 mRNAs with highest numbers of unique conserved miRNA sites, and so is ANKRD52, the phosphatase regulatory subunit of the recently identified AGO phosphorylation cycle (AGOs, CSNK1A1, ANKRD52 and PPP6C). The mRNAs for TNRC6, which acts together with loaded AGO to channel miRNA-mediated regulation actions onto specific mRNAs, are also heavily miRNA-targeted. Moreover, mRNAs of the AGO phosphorylation cycle share much more than expected miRNA binding sites. In contrast, upstream miRNA biogenesis mRNAs do not display these characteristics, and neither do the downstream regulatory effector mRNAs. In a word, miRNAs heavily and directly feedback-regulate their targeting machinery mRNAs, but neither upstream biogenesis nor downstream regulatory effector mRNAs. The observation was then confirmed with experimentally determined miRNA-mRNA target relationships. In summary, our exploration of the miRNA-mRNA target relationship uncovers intensive, and specific, feedback auto-regulation of miRNA targeting activity directly by miRNAs themselves, i.e., segment-specific feedback auto-regulation of miRNA pathway. Our results also suggest that the complexity of miRNA-mRNA targeting relationship - a defining feature of miRNA biology - should be a rich source for further functional exploration.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue due to physical exertion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in everyday life and especially common in a range of neurological diseases. While the effect of fatigue on limiting skill execution are well known, its influence on learning new skills is unclear. This is of particular interest as it is common practice to train athletes, musicians or perform rehabilitation exercises up to and beyond a point of fatigue. In a series of experiments, we describe how fatigue impairs motor skill learning beyond its effects on task execution. The negative effects on learning are evidenced by impaired task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue. Further, we found that this effect is in part mediated centrally and can be alleviated by altering motor cortex function. Thus, the common practice of training while, or beyond, fatigue levels should be carefully reconsidered, since this affects overall long-term skill learning.",

    "abstract": "Biocompatibility assessment of nanomaterials has been of great interest due to their potential toxicity. However, conventional biocompatibility tests are short of providing a fast toxicity report. We developed a whole cell based biosensor to track biocompatibility of nanomaterials with the aim of providing fast feedback for engineering nanomaterials with lower toxicity levels. We have engineered promoters of four heat shock response proteins. As an initial design a reporter coding gene was cloned to downstream of the promoter regions selected. Initial results indicated that native HSP promoter regions were not very promising to generate signals with low background signals. Introducing riboregulators to native promoters eliminated unwanted background signal almost entirely. Unfortunately, this approach also leads a decrease in expected sensor signal. Thus, a repression based genetic circuit, inspired from HSP mechanism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was constructed. These genetic circuits can report the toxicity of Quantum Dot nanoparticles in one hour with high precision. Our designed nanoparticle toxicity sensors can provide quick reports which can lower the demand for additional experiments with more complex organisms.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction mechanisms and successive regulatory processes alter the lateral mobility of {beta}2-adrenergic receptors ({beta}2AR). In this work we combined modern single particle tracking methods in order to analyze the diffusion dynamics of SNAP-tagged {beta}2AR in HEK wild-type cells and HEK {beta}-arrestin knockout cells before and after agonist stimulation. For analysis of trajectories we first used mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis. Secondly, we applied an advanced variational Bayesian treatment of hidden Markov models (vbSPT) in combination with the recently introduced packing coefficient (Pc), which together provided a detailed model of three discrete diffusive states, state transitioning and spatial confinement. Interesting to note, state switching between S3 (fast-diffusing) and S1 (slow-diffusing) occurred sequentially over an intermediate state S2. After ligand stimulation more SNAP-tagged {beta}2AR in HEK wild-type cells switched occupancy into the slow-diffusing state, whereas less receptors were found in the fast diffusive state. Unexpectedly, all three states showed a fraction of confined receptor mobility that increased under stimulation, but confinement sizes were unaffected. Receptor diffusion characteristics were comparable in HEK {beta}-arrestin knockout cells under basal conditions and only minor but non-significant changes occurred upon stimulation, as expected from the depletion of {beta}-arrestin, an important regulatory protein. The data presented here on the occurrence of different diffusion states, their transitioning and variable spatial confinements clearly indicate that lateral mobility of {beta}2AR is much more complex than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "To segregate accurately during meiosis, homologous chromosomes in most species must recombine. Very small chromosomes would risk missegregation if recombination were randomly distributed, so the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination are not haphazard. How this nonrandomness is controlled is not under-stood. Here we demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates multiple, temporally distinct pathways to regulate chromosomal binding of pro-DSB factors Rec114 and Mer2, thereby controlling duration of a DSB-competent state. Homologous chromosome engagement regulates Rec114/Mer2 dissociation late in prophase, whereas replication timing and proximity to centromeres or telomeres influence timing and amount of Rec114/Mer2 accumulation early. A distinct early mechanism boosts Rec114/Mer2 binding quickly to high levels specifically on the shortest chromosomes, dependent on chromosome axis proteins and subject to selection pressure to maintain hyperrecombinogenic properties of these chromosomes. Thus, an organisms karyotype and its attendant risk of meiotic missegregation influence the shape and evolution of its recombination landscape.",

    "abstract": "Replication stress is a common feature of cancer cells, and thus a potentially important therapeutic target. Here we show that CDK-induced replication stress is synthetic lethal with mutations disrupting dNTP homeostasis in fission yeast. Wee1 inactivation leads to increased dNTP demand and replication stress through CDK-induced firing of dormant replication origins. Subsequent dNTP depletion leads to inefficient DNA replication, Mus81-dependent DNA damage, and to genome instability. Cells respond to this replication stress by increasing dNTP supply through Set2-dependent MBF-induced expression of Cdc22, the catalytic subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Disrupting dNTP synthesis following Wee1 inactivation, through abrogating Set2-dependent H3K36 tri-methylation or DNA integrity checkpoint inactivation results in critically low dNTP levels, replication collapse and cell death, which can be rescued by increasing dNTP levels. These findings support a  dNTP supply and demand model in which maintaining dNTP homeostasis is essential to prevent replication catastrophe in response to CDK-induced replication stress.",

    "abstract": "The physic-chemistry of biological membranes is at the origin of fundamental cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking, cell adhesion and migration1-3. Because most of intracellular shapes and local demixing of membranes take place in the nanometer scale, AFM becomes an extremely powerful technique to assess the properties of these biological membranes. Porous substrates provide an elegant strategy to avoid the conundrum of placing soft and thin biomembranes on hard substrates for AFM studies, although the surface chemistry make the actual substrates rather challenging setups. Here, we have engineered porous systems on the most widely used substrate in AFM, mica muscovite, with tunable pore sizes from some tens to few hundreds nanometers for biological applications. We show that free-standing bilayers on nano-porous can be obtained by using well-established vesicle spreading methods and that they display equivalent nano-mechanical stability and phsyco-chemical properties to that of membranes on conventional mica supports. By reducing the pore radius < 40 nm and limiting the contribution of membrane tension to the elastic response of free-standing membranes we estimate a bending modulus of 18 kbT and 73 kbT for DOPC and DPPC bilayers, respectively. The quantitative mapping of suspended membranes shows a different mechanical response at the pore rims, which is more pronounced for DPPC and suggest a different lipid ordering. We find that the combination of membrane bending and the different lipid packing at the edges of pores shapes the curvature of free-standing membranes on pores in the range of few tens of nm.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian chromosomes are folded into an intricate hierarchy of structural domains, within which topologically associating domains (TADs) and CTCF-associated loops partition the physical interactions between regulatory sequences. Current understanding of chromosome folding largely relies on chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based experiments, where chromosomal interactions are detected as ligation products after crosslinking of chromatin. To measure chromosome structure in vivo, quantitatively and without relying on crosslinking and ligation, we have implemented a new method named damC. DamC combines DNA-methylation based detection of chromosomal interactions with next-generation sequencing and a biophysical model of methylation kinetics. DamC performed in mouse embryonic stem cells provides the first in vivo validation of the existence of TADs and CTCF loops, confirms 3C-based measurements of the scaling of contact probabilities within TADs, and provides evidence that mammalian chromatin in vivo is essentially rigid below 5 kilobases. Combining damC with transposon-mediated genomic engineering shows that new loops can be formed between ectopically introduced and endogenous CTCF sites, which alters the partitioning of physical interactions within TADs. This establishes damC as a crosslinking-and ligation-free framework to measure and modify chromosome interactions combined with a solid theoretical background for rigorous data interpretation. This orthogonal approach to 3C validates the existence of key structural features of mammalian chromosomes and provides novel insights into how chromosome structure within TADs can be manipulated.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 protease is one of the prime targets of agents used in antiretroviral therapy against HIV. However, under selective pressure of protease inhibitors, primary mutations at the active site weaken inhibitor binding to confer resistance. Darunavir (DRV) is the most potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor in clinic; resistance is limited, as DRV fits well within the substrate envelope. Nevertheless, resistance is observed due to hydrophobic changes at residues including I50, V82 and I84 that line the S1/S1 pocket within the active site. Through enzyme inhibition assays and a series of 12 crystal structures, we interrogated susceptibility of DRV and two potent analogs to primary S1 mutations. The analogs had modifications at the hydrophobic P1 moiety to better occupy the unexploited space in the S1 pocket where the primary mutations were located. Considerable losses of potency were observed against protease variants with I84V and I50V mutations for all three inhibitors. The crystal structures revealed an unexpected conformational change in the flap region of I50V protease bound to the analog with the largest P1 moiety, indicating interdependency between the S1 subsite and the flap region. Collective analysis of protease-inhibitor van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the crystal structures using principle component analysis indicated I84V mutation underlying the largest variation in the vdW contacts. Interestingly, the principle components were able to distinguish inhibitor identity and relative potency solely based on vdW interactions of active site residues in the crystal structures. Our results reveal the interplay between inhibitor P1 moiety and primary S1 mutations, as well as suggesting a novel method for distinguishing the interdependence of resistance through principle component analyses.",

We verify binding of Sacetyl to N-linked glycans in vitro, using both isolated glycans and cell-derived proteoliposomes.

    "abstract": "The vast majority of malaria mortality is attributed to one parasite species: Plasmodium falciparum. Asexual replication of the parasite within the red blood cell is responsible for the pathology of the disease. In Plasmodium, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central hub for protein folding and trafficking as well as stress response pathways. In this study, we tested the role of an uncharacterized ER protein, PfGRP170, in regulating these key functions by generating conditional mutants. Our data show that PfGRP170 localizes to the ER and is essential for asexual growth, specifically required for proper development of schizonts. PfGRP170 is essential for surviving heat shock, suggesting a critical role in cellular stress response. The data demonstrate that PfGRP170 interacts with the Plasmodium orthologue of the ER chaperone, BiP. Finally, we found that loss of PfGRP170 function leads to the activation of the Plasmodium eIF2 kinase, PK4, suggesting a specific role for this protein in this parasite stress response pathway.",

    "abstract": "A close relationship between soil-borne diseases, soil microbial community structure, and functional diversity has been described in the mulberry plant. In the present study, microbial abundance, community structure, and functional diversity in the soil rhizosphere were compared in resistant (Kangqing10) and susceptible (Guisang12) mulberry genotypes using the dilution plate method, micro-ecology technology, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The goal of this study was to develop better management methods for mulberry cultivation and preventing and controlling bacterial wilt. Rhizosphere soil microorganisms were more abundant in the resistant normal mulberry genotype than in the susceptible normal mulberry genotype. Carbon source utilization was better in the susceptible normal mulberry genotype. These properties were lower in the resistant sickly mulberry genotype than in the susceptible sickly mulberry genotype. PCR-DGGE indicated that the bacterial and fungal community structures of the resistant genotypes were more stable than those of the susceptible genotypes. Correlation regression analysis implicated mulberry bacterial wilt in the loss of soil nutrients, particularly organic matter and nitrogen, which can disrupt the balance of the soil microbial community. Loss of soil organic matter and nitrogen had a lower impact on resistant genotype plants than on susceptible genotype plants. Therefore, resistant genotype plants displayed some resistance to bacterial wilt. Further insights into the soil rhizosphere microbial diversities of resistant and susceptible genotypes will help in the control and prevention of mulberry bacterial wilt.",

    "abstract": "As systems become more robust against perturbations, they can compensate for greater sloppiness in the performance of their components. That robust compensation reduces the force of natural selection on the systems components, leading to component decay. The paradoxical coupling of robustness and decay predicts that robust systems evolve cheaper, lower performing components, which accumulate greater mutational genetic variability and which have greater phenotypic stochasticity in trait expression. Previous work noted the paradox of robustness. However, no general theory for the evolutionary dynamics of system robustness and component decay has been developed. This article takes a first step by linking engineering control theory with the genetic theory of evolutionary dynamics. Control theory emphasizes error-correcting feedback as the single greatest principle in robust system design. Linking control theory to evolution leads to a theory for the evolutionary dynamics of error-correcting feedback, a unifying approach for the evolutionary analysis of robust systems. In this article, I study how, in theory, increasingly robust systems accumulate more genetic variability and greater stochasticity of expression in their components. The theory predicts different levels of variability between different regulatory control architectures and different levels of variability between different components within a particular regulatory control system. Those predictions provide a way to understand the accumulating data on genetic variability and single-cell stochasticity of gene expression. I also show that increasing robustness reduces the frequency of system failures associated with disease and, simultaneously, causes a strong increase in the heritability of disease. Thus, robust error correction in biological regulatory control may partly explain the puzzlingly high heritability of disease and, more generally, the surprisingly high heritability of fitness.",

A protein-sharing network analysis highlights the conserved core genes within this clade. Combining genome, RNAseq and mass spectrometry analyses of its virion proteins allowed us to accurately identify genes and elucidate regulatory elements for this phage (ncRNAs, tRNAs and promoter elements). In total PA5oct encodes 462 CDS (compared to 345 in silico predicted genes using automated annotation pipelines), of which 25.32%, have been identified as virion-associated based on ESI-MS/MS. The RNAseq-based temporal genome organization suggests a gradual take-over by viral transcripts from 21%, 69%, and 92% at 5, 15 and 25 min after infection, respectively. Like many large phages, PA5oct is not organized into contiguous regions of temporal transcription. However, although the temporal regulation of the PA5oct genome expression reveals specific genome clusters expressed in early and late infection, many genes encoding experimentally observed structural proteins surprisingly appear to remain almost untranscribed throughout the infection cycle. Within the host, operons associated with elements of a cryptic Pf1-like prophage are upregulated, as are operons responsible for Psl exopolysaccharide (pslE-J) and periplasmic nitrate reductase (napA-F) production. The characterization described here represents a crucial step towards understanding the genomic complexity as well as molecular diversity of jumbo viruses.",

The pioneering work of Kahneman and Tversky provides strong evidence that people are not rational. Recent work in psychophysics argues that incentivized sensorimotor decisions (such as deciding where to reach to get a reward) maximizes expected gain, suggesting that it may be impervious to cognitive biases and heuristics. We rigorously tested this hypothesis using multiple experiments and multiple computational models. We obtained strong evidence that people deviated from the objectively rational strategy when potential losses were large. They instead appeared to follow a strategy in which they simplify the decision problem and satisfice rather than optimize. This work is consistent with the framework known as bounded rationality, according to which people behave rationally given their computational limitations.",

    "abstract": "Human populations native to high altitude regions ([&ge;]2500 m) exhibit numerous adaptations to hypoxic stress. On the Tibetan Plateau, these include modifications of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway to essentially uncouple erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration--which normally increase in response to low oxygen--from hypoxia. Uncoupling of erythropoiesis and hypoxia is also observed among people with diabetes due to damage to kidney tissues. This is hypothesized to result in elevated risk for anemia among diabetics, which increases risk for cardiovascular disease and death. We tested the hypothesis that the independence of erythropoiesis from HIF among high-altitude adapted populations of the Tibetan Plateau may protect against diabetes-associated anemia. We investigated this hypothesis among the Mosuo, a population living in Yunnan Province, China (at ~2800 m altitude) that is undergoing rapid market integration and lifestyle change, with concomitant increase in risk for type 2 diabetes. We found that, although diabetes (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c [&ge;]6.5%) is associated with anemia (females: Hb<12g/dl; males: Hb<13g/dl) among the Chinese population as a whole (N: 5,606; OR: 1.48; p: 0.008), this is not the case among the Mosuo (N: 316; OR: 1.36; p: 0.532). Both pathways uncoupling hypoxia from erythropoiesis (diabetic disease and high altitude adaptation) are incompletely understood; their intersection in protecting Mosuo with diabetes from anemia may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying each. Further, these findings point to the importance of understanding how high-altitude adaptations interact with chronic disease processes, as populations like the Mosuo experience rapid market integration.",

    "abstract": "The networks proposed here show how neurons can be connected to form flip-flops, the basic building blocks in sequential logic systems. The novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are explicit, dynamic, and can generate known phenomena of short-term memory.\n\nFor each network design, all neurons, connections, and types of synapses are shown explicitly. The neurons operation depends only on explicitly stated, minimal properties of excitement and inhibition. This operation is dynamic in the sense that the level of neuron activity is the only cellular change, making the NFFs operation consistent with the speed of most brain functions. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena. NFFs, together with a decoder from a previous paper, suggest a resolution to the longstanding controversy of whether short-term memory depends on neurons firing persistently or in brief, coordinated bursts.\n\nTwo novel NFFs are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. This transformation is reversible and is apparently new to engineering as well as neuroscience.",

It also generates virtual human subject data from statistics of population variability. All parameters are extracted as statistical distributions from experimental data from the literature. The model exhibits previously described features, such as stimulusintensity-dependent MEP amplitude distributions, including bimodal ones. The model can generate long sequences of test data for individual subjects with specified parameters or for subjects from a virtual population.

    "abstract": "MotivationDirect-coupling analysis (DCA) for studying the coevolution of residues in proteins has been widely used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its sequence. Current algorithms for DCA, although efficient, have a high computational cost of determining Direct Information (DI) values for large proteins or domains. In this paper, we present RADI (Reduced Alphabet Direct Information), a variation of the original DCA algorithm that simplifies the computation of DI values by grouping physicochemically equivalent residues.\\n\\nResultsWe have compared the first top ranking 40 pairs of DI values and their closest paired contact in 3D. The ranking is also compared with results obtained using a similar but faster approach based on Mutual Information (MI). When we simplify the number of symbols used to describe a protein sequence to 9, RADI achieves similar results as the original DCA (i.e. with the classical alphabet of 21 symbols), while reducing the computation time around 30-fold on large proteins (with length around 1000 residues) and with higher accuracy than predictions based on MI. Interestingly, the simplification produced by grouping amino acids into only two groups (polar and non-polar) is still representative of the physicochemical nature that characterizes the protein structure, having a relevant and useful predictive value, while the computation time is reduced between 100 and 2500-fold.\\n\\nAvailabilityRADI is available at https://github.com/structuralbioinformatics/RADI\\n\\nContactbaldo.oliva@upf.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data is available in the git repository.",

    "abstract": "Concerns have been raised that microplastics (MP) can impact aquatic organisms by compromising their nutrition. However, little is understood about the mechanisms of the adverse effects of MP in suspension-feeders that routinely ingest particles of low nutritional value, such as mineral particles. We compared effects of non-edible particles (MP and kaolin) mixed with microalgae on the swimming and filtering behavior of a planktonic filtrator Daphnia magna; incubations with only algae served as controls. The following questions were addressed: (1) Are there differences in swimming movements between the daphnids exposed to MP and those exposed to kaolin? and (2) Whether occurrence of biofilm on the particle surface affects daphnid swimming and how these effects differ between the kaolin- and MP-exposed animals? We found that both kaolin and MP altered swimming, yet in opposite way, with a decrease of filtration-related movements in kaolin and their increase in MP. The difference was amplified in biofilm coated particles, indicating that daphnids spend more energy when swimming in suspension with MP, and even more when the MP have biofilm. The increased swimming activity of filtrators exposed to plastic litter decaying to microparticles may translate into changes in energy balance and growth.",

    "abstract": "In their competition for hosts, parasites with antigens that are novel to host immunity will be at a competitive advantage. The resulting frequency-dependent selection can structure parasite populations into strains of limited genetic overlap. For Plasmodium falciparum-the causative agent of malaria-in endemic regions, the high recombination rates and associated vast diversity of its highly antigenic and multicopy var genes preclude such clear clustering; this undermines the definition of strains as specific, temporally-persisting gene variant combinations. We use temporal multilayer networks to analyze the genetic similarity of parasites in both simulated data and in an extensively and longitudinally sampled population in Ghana. When viewed over time, populations are structured into modules (i.e., groups) of parasite genomes whose var gene combinations are more similar within, than between, the modules, and whose persistence is much longer than that of the individual genomes that compose them. Comparison to neutral models that retain parasite population dynamics but lack competition reveals that the selection imposed by host immunity promotes the persistence of these modules. The modular structure is in turn associated with a slower acquisition of immunity by individual hosts. Modules thus represent dynamically generated niches in host immune space, which can be interpreted as strains. Negative frequency-dependent selection therefore shapes the organization of the var diversity into parasite genomes, leaving a persistence signature over ecological time scales. Multilayer networks extend the scope of phylodynamics analyses by allowing quantification of temporal genetic structure in organisms that generate variation via recombination or other non-bifurcating processes. A strain structure similar to the one described here should apply to other pathogens with large antigenic spaces that evolve via recombination. For malaria, the temporal modular structure should enable the formulation of tractable epidemiological models that account for parasite antigenic diversity and its influence on intervention outcomes.\\n\\nSignificanceMany pathogens, including the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium falciparum, use antigenic variation, obtained via recombination, as a strategy to evade the human immune system. The vast diversity and multiplicity of genes encoding antigenic variation in high transmission regions challenge the notion of the existence of distinct strains: temporally-persistent and specific combinations of genes relevant to epidemiology. We examine the role of human immune selection in generating such genetic population structure in the major blood-stage antigen of Plasmodium falciparum. We show, using simulated and empirical data, that immune selection generates and maintains  modules of genomes with higher genetic similarity within, than between, these groups. Selection further promotes the persistence of these modules for much longer times than those of their constituent genomes. Simulations show that the temporal modular structure reduces the speed at which hosts acquire immunity to the parasite. We argue that in P. falciparum modules can be viewed as dynamic strains occupying different niches in human immune space; they are thus relevant to formulating transmission models that encompass the antigenic diversity of the parasite. Our analyses may prove useful to understand the interplay between temporal genetic structure and epidemiology in other pathogens of human and wildlife importance.",

    "abstract": "Due to the low density of envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of HIV-1, neutralizing IgG antibodies rarely bind bivalently using both antigen-binding arms (Fabs) to crosslink between spikes (inter-spike crosslinking), instead resorting to weaker monovalent binding that is more sensitive to Env mutations. Synthetic antibodies designed to bivalently bind a single Env trimer (intra-spike crosslinking) were previously shown to exhibit increased neutralization potencies. In initial work, diFabs joined by varying lengths of rigid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were considered. Anticipating future experiments to improve synthetic antibodies, we investigate whether linkers with different rigidities could enhance diFab potency by modeling DNA-Fabs containing different combinations of rigid dsDNA and flexible single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and characterizing their neutralization potential. Model predictions suggest that while a long flexible polymer may be capable of bivalent binding, it exhibits weak neutralization due to the large loss in entropic degrees of freedom when both Fabs are bound. In contrast, the strongest neutralization potencies are predicted to require a rigid linker that optimally spans the distance between two Fab binding sites on an Env trimer, and avidity can be further boosted by incorporating more Fabs into these constructs. These results inform the design of multivalent anti-HIV-1 therapeutics that utilize avidity effects to remain potent against HIV-1 in the face of the rapid mutation of Env spikes.\\n\\nSignificanceIgG antibodies utilize avidity to increase their apparent affinities through simultaneous binding of two antigen-binding Fabs - if one Fab dissociates from an antigen, the other Fab can remain attached, allowing rebinding. HIV-1 foils this strategy by having few, and highly-separated, Envelope spike targets for antibodies, forcing most IgGs to bind monovalently. Here we develop a statistical mechanics model of synthetic diFabs joined by DNA linkers of different lengths and flexibilities. This framework enables us to translate the energetic and entropic effects of the linker into the neutralization potency of a diFab. We demonstrate that the avidity of multivalent binding is enhanced by using rigid linkers or including additional Fabs capable of simultaneous binding, providing the means to quantitatively predict the potencies of other antibody designs.",

We provide evidence of a low affinity interaction with CAR, with modelling suggesting affinity is attenuated through extended, semi-flexible loop structures, providing steric hindrance. Conversely, in silico and in vitro experiments are unable to provide evidence of interaction between HAdV-D26/48 fiber-knob with CD46, or with Desmoglein 2.

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that perception and reasoning vary according to the phase of internal bodily signals such as heartbeat. This has been shown by locking the presentation of sensory events to distinct phases of the cardiac cycle. However, task-relevant information is not usually encountered in such a phase-locked manner nor passively accessed, but rather actively sampled at ones own pace. Moreover, if the phase of the cardiac cycle is an important modulator of perception and cognition, as previously proposed, then the way in which we actively sample the world should be similarly modulated by the phase of the cardiac cycle. Here we tested this by coregistration of eye movements and heartbeat signals while participants freely compared differences between two visual arrays. Across three different analyses, we found a significant coupling of saccades, subsequent fixations, and blinks with the cardiac cycle. More eye movements were generated during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, which has been reported as the period of maximal effect of the baroreceptors activity upon cognition. Conversely, more fixations were found during the diastole phase (quiescent baroreceptors). Lastly, more blinks were generated in the later period of the cardiac cycle. These results suggest that interoceptive and exteroceptive processing do adjust to each other; in our case, by sampling the outer environment during quiescent periods of the inner organism.",

This algorithm employs a combination of dimension reduction techniques and image registration to increase frame rate.\\n\\nIf the distance between two successive frames of a video be great, motion jerkiness will appear between them and visual quality of the video will decrease. Some parts of heart have a very high speed motion, and echocardiography videos, obtained by available systems cant take enough number of frames to show them well. So, to achieve an echocardiography image set with a better visual quality, more frames are necessary between two frames at a great distance. Here, we use dimension reduction techniques to find out the number of suitable frames between two consecutive frames to show the fast motions better, but dont take much time. We project images to a 3-dimentional space by this way. Greater difference between the frames, results greater distance between corresponding embedded points. Thus, the distance between the embedded points is a scale for the suitable number of frames, needed between two successive frames. These frames are produced with the registration techniques.\\n\\nOn the other hand, heart doesnt have a constant speed during a cycle, but echocardiography images are recorded with constant speed. So, frames at a greater distance show fast motions of the heart, and frames at a lower distance show slow motions of the heart. While, we put unequal number of frames between successive frames, and in this way remove temporal coordination of the image set. To solve this problem, we put efficient number of linear average of available frames, in places that the number of inserted frames in between available frames is less than maximum to obtain an equal number of frames between all successive frames.",

    "abstract": "Finding homologous proteins is the indispensable first step in many protein biology studies. Thus, building highly efficient \\\"search engines\\\" for protein databases is a highly desired function in protein bioinformatics. As of August 2018, there are more than 140,000 protein structures in PDB, and this number is still increasing rapidly. Such a big number introduces a big challenge for scanning the whole structure database with high speeds and high sensitivities at the same time. Unfortunately, classic sequence alignment tools and pairwise structure alignment tools are either not sensitive enough to remote homologous proteins (with low sequence identities) or not fast enough for the task. Therefore, specifically designed computational methods are required for quickly scanning structure databases for homologous proteins.\\n\\nHere, we propose a novel ContactLib-DNN method to quickly scan structure databases for homologous proteins. The core idea is to build structure fingerprints for proteins, and to perform alignment-free comparisons with the fingerprints. Specifically, the fingerprints are low-dimensional vectors representing the contact groups within the proteins. Notably, the Cartesian distance between two fingerprint vectors well matches the RMSD between the two corresponding contact groups. This is done by using RMSD as the domain knowledge to supervise the deep neural network learning. When comparing to existing methods, ContactLib-DNN achieves the highest average AUROC of 0.959. Moreover, the best candidate found by ContactLib-DNN has a probability of 70.0% to be a true positive. This is a significant improvement over 56.2%, the best result produced by existing methods.\\n\\nGitHub: https://github.com/Chenyao2333/contactlib/\\n\\nIndex Termshomologous proteins, protein structures, remote protein homolog detection, alignment-free comparisons",

Microsatellites are vulnerable to DNA mismatch errors, and have thus been used to detect cancers with mismatch repair deficiency. To reveal the mutational landscape of the microsatellite repeat regions at the genome level, we analyzed approximately 20.1 billion microsatellites in 2,717 whole genomes of pan-cancer samples across 21 tissue types. Firstly, we developed a new insertion and deletion caller (MIMcall) that takes into consideration the error patterns of different types of microsatellites. Among the 2,717 pan-cancer samples, our analysis identified 31 samples, including colorectal, uterus, and stomach cancers, with higher microsatellite mutation rate ([&ge;] 0.03), which we defined as microsatellite instability (MSI) cancers in genome-wide level. Next, we found 20 highly-mutated microsatellites that can be used to detect MSI cancers with high sensitivity. Third, we found that replication timing and DNA shape were significantly associated with mutation rates of the microsatellites. Analysis of germline variation of the microsatellites suggested that the amount of germline variations and somatic mutation rates were correlated. Lastly, analysis of mutations in mismatch repair genes showed that somatic SNVs and short indels had larger functional impact than germline mutations and structural variations. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of mutations in the microsatellite regions, and reveals possible causes of mutations, as well as provides a useful marker set for MSI detection.",

    "abstract": "Joint analysis of multiple traits can result in the identification of associations not found through the analysis of each trait in isolation. In addition, approaches that consider multiple traits can aid in the characterization of shared genetic etiology among those traits. In recent years, parent-offspring trio studies have reported an enrichment of de novo mutations (DNMs) in neuropsychiatric disorders. The analysis of DNM data in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders has implicated multiple putatively causal genes, and a number of reported genes are shared across disorders. However, a joint analysis method designed to integrate de novo mutation data from multiple studies has yet to be implemented. We here introduce multi pi e-trait TAD A (mTADA) which jointly analyzes two traits using DNMs from non-overlapping family samples. mTADA uses two single-trait analysis data sets to estimate the proportion of overlapping risk genes, and reports genes shared between and specific to the relevant disorders. We applied mTADA to >13,000 trios for six disorders: schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental disorders (DD), intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy (EPI), and congenital heart disease (CHD). We report the proportion of overlapping risk genes and the specific risk genes shared for each pair of disorders. A total of 153 genes were found to be shared in at least one pair of disorders. The largest percentages of shared risk genes were observed for pairs of DD, ID, ASD, and CHD (>20%) whereas SCZ, CHD, and EPI did not show strong overlaps In risk gene set between them. Furthermore, mTADA identified additional SCZ, EPI and CHD risk genes through integration with DD de novo mutation data. For CHD, using DD information, 31 risk genes with posterior probabilities > 0.8 were identified, and 20 of these 31 genes were not in the list of known CHD genes. We find evidence that most significant CHD risk genes are strongly expressed in prenatal stages of the human genes. Finally, we validated our findings for CHD and EPI in independent cohorts comprising 1241 CHD trios, 226 CHD singletons and 197 EPI trios. Multiple novel risk genes identified by mTADA also had de novo mutations in these independent data sets. The joint analysis method introduced here, mTADA, is able to identify risk genes shared by two traits as well as additional risk genes not found through single-trait analysis only. A number of risk genes reported by mTADA are identified only through joint analysis, specifically when ASD, DD, or ID are one of the two traits examined. This suggests that novel genes for the trait or a new trait might converge to a core gene list of the three traits.",

We applied natural language processing and machine learning on a large sample of 283,216 secure messages sent from 6,941 patients to their clinicians for this study to develop and validate literacy profiles as indicators of patients health literacy. All patients were participants in Kaiser Permanente Northern Californias DISTANCE Study. We created three literacy profiles, comparing performance of each literacy profile against a gold standard of patient self-report. We also analyzed associations between the literacy profiles and patient demographics, health outcomes and healthcare utilization. T-tests were used for numeric data such as A1C, Charlson comorbidity index and healthcare utilization rates, and chi-square tests for categorical data such as sex, race, continuous medication gaps and severe hypoglycemia. Literacy profiles varied in their test characteristics, with C-statistics ranging from 0.61-0.74. Relationships between literacy profiles and health outcomes revealed patterns consistent with previous health literacy research: patients identified via literacy profiles as having limited health literacy were older and more likely minority; had poorer medication adherence and glycemic control; and higher rates of hypoglycemia, comorbidities and healthcare utilization. This research represents the first successful attempt to use natural language processing and machine learning to measure health literacy.

We targeted putative microglia regulators, including signature genes and non-cell autonomous factors, by Cas9/gRNA-complex injections, followed by neutral red-based visualization of microglia. Microglia were quantified automatically in 3-day-old larvae using a software tool we called SpotNGlia. We identified that loss of function of the zebrafish homolog of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) ligand IL34, caused strongly reduced microglia numbers in early development. Previous studies on the role of the IL34 on microglia development in vivo were ambiguous. Our data, and a concurrent paper, show that in zebrafish, il34 is required during the earliest seeding of the brain by microglia progenitors. Our data also indicate that Il34 is required for distribution to other organs.\\n\\nPreviously, we showed that csf1ra and csf1rb double mutant zebrafish have no microglia. As there is a moderate effect of il34 on microglia development, relative to the effect csf1r, additional Csf1r-dependent signalling may be needed for establishment of the microglia network. In all, we identified il34 as a modifier of microglia colonization, by affecting distribution of yolk sac macrophages to target organs, validating our reverse genetic screening pipeline in zebrafish which can be used for the identification of additional regulators of microglia development.",

    "abstract": "Women exhibit higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension with presyncopal symptoms compared to men. These symptoms could be influenced by an attenuated ability of the cerebrovasculature to respond to rapid changes in blood pressure (BP) [dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA)]. However, the influence of sex on dCA remains equivocal. We compared dCA in 11 women (25 {+/-} 2 y) and 11 age-matched men (24 {+/-} 1 y) using a multimodal approach including a sit-to-stand maneuver and forced oscillations (5 min of squat-stand performed at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz). The prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension (IOH; decrease in systolic [&ge;] 40 mmHg and/or diastolic BP [&ge;] 20 mmHg) during the first 15 sec of sit-to-stand was determined as a functional outcome. In women, the decrease in mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAvmean) following the sit-to-stand was greater (-20 {+/-} 8 vs. -11 {+/-} 7 cm sec-1; p=0.018) and the onset of the regulatory change (time lapse between the beginning of the sit-to-stand and the increase in the conductance index (MCAvmean/mean arterial pressure(MAP)) was delayed (p=0.007). Transfer function analysis gain during 0.05 Hz squat-stand was [~]48% higher in women (6.4 {+/-} 1.3 vs. 3.8 {+/-} 2.3 sec; p=0.017). The prevalence of IOH was comparable between groups (4/9 vs. 5/9, p=0.637). These results indicate the cerebrovasculature of healthy women has an attenuated ability to react to large and rapid changes in BP in the face of preserved orthostasis, which could be related to a higher cerebrovascular reserve to face a rapid transient hypotension.\\n\\nNEWS & NOTEWORTHYThe novel findings of this study are that healthy women have impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation, although the prevalence of orthostatic intolerance was similar in women and men. These results indicate the cerebrovasculature of healthy women has an attenuated ability to react to large and rapid changes in blood pressure in the face of preserved orthostasis, which could be related to a higher cerebrovascular reserve to face a rapid transient hypotension.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has as standard pharmacological therapy with corticoisteroids (CS) that decrease inflammation and immune responses present in patients and animal models. CS have however limited efficacy and important and numerous side effects. Therefore, there is a need for new anti-inflammatory and pro-tolerogenic treatments that could replace or decrease doses of CS. We first assessed the status of immune system of dystrophin-deficient rats (Dmdmdx) that closely reproduce the phenotype of DMD patients. Dmdmdx rats showed increased leukocyte infiltration in skeletal and cardiac muscles, containing mostly macrophages but also T cells, and increased expression of several cytokines. Anti-CD45RC Monoclonal antibody (Mab) treatment induced immune tolerance in models of organ transplantation and GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease). We observed that muscles and blood of DMD patients contained T CD4+ and CD8+ expressing high levels of CD45RChigh cells. Treatment of young Dmdmdx rats with anti-CD45RC MAb corrected skeletal muscle strength associated to a depletion of effectors CD45RChigh T cells with no obvious side-effects. Prednisolone treatment of Dmdmdx rats similarly increased skeletal muscle strength and was also associated to a depletion of effectors CD45RChigh cells but resulted in severe weight loss.\\n\\nOverall, Dmdmdx rats display important immune inflammatory response and thus represent a useful model to analyze new anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic treatments for DMD. As an example, a new treatment with anti-CD45RC antibodies improved muscle strength in Dmdmdx rats as prednisolone did but without side effects. Anti-CD45RC therapy could complement other therapies in DMD patients.",

    "abstract": "The human hookworm Necator americanus infects more than 400 million people worldwide, contributing substantially to the poverty in these regions. Adult stage N. americanus live in the small intestine of the human host where they inject excretory/secretory (ES) products into the mucosa. ES products have been characterized at the proteome level for a number of animal hookworm species, but until now, the difficulty in obtaining sufficient live N. americanus has been an obstacle in characterizing the secretome of this important human pathogen. Herein we describe the ES proteome of N. americanus and utilize this information to conduct the first proteogenomic analysis of a parasitic helminth, significantly improving the available genome and thereby generating a robust description of the parasite secretome. The genome annotation resulted in a a revised prediction of 3,425 fewer genes than initially reported, accompanied by a significant increase in the number of exons and introns, total gene length and the percentage of the genome covered by genes. Almost 200 ES proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS with SCP/TAPS proteins,  hypothetical proteins and proteases among the most abundant families. These proteins were compared to commonly used model species of human parasitic infections, including Ancylostoma caninum, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Our findings provide valuable information on important families of proteins with both known and unknown functions that could be instrumental in host-parasite interactions, including protein families that might be key for parasite survival in the onslaught of robust immune responses, as well as vaccine and drug targets.",

Bacteriophages have in turn evolved inhibitory  anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins, including six inhibitors (AcrIIA1-6) that can block DNA cutting and genome editing by type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes. We show here that AcrIIA2 and its homologue, AcrIIA2b, prevent Cas9 binding to DNA by occluding protein residues required for DNA binding. Cryo-EM-determined structures of AcrIIA2 or AcrIIA2b bound to S. pyogenes Cas9 reveal a mode of competitive inhibition of DNA binding that is distinct from other known Acrs. Differences in the temperature dependence of Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA2b arise from differences in both inhibitor structure and the local inhibitor-binding environment on Cas9. These findings expand the natural toolbox for regulating CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing temporally, spatially and conditionally.",

    "abstract": "Premigratory neural crest cells arise within the dorsal neural tube and subsequently undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to leave the neuroepithelium and initiate migration. Draxin is a Wnt modulator that has been shown to control the timing of cranial neural crest EMT. Here we show that this process is accompanied by three stages of remodeling of the basement membrane protein laminin, from regression to expansion and channel formation. Loss of Draxin results in blocking laminin remodeling at the regression stage, whereas ectopic maintenance of Draxin blocks remodeling at the expansion stage. The latter effect is rescued by addition of Snail2, previously shown to be downstream of Draxin. Our results demonstrate an essential function for the Wnt modulator Draxin in regulating basement membrane remodeling during cranial neural crest EMT.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICranial neural crest migrate through a laminin-rich basement membrane channel\\nC_LIO_LIPerturbation of Draxin, a Wnt antagonist, alters laminin channel formation\\nC_LIO_LIDraxins effect on laminin channel formation is largely mediated by Snail2\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing induces a p53-dependent DNA damage response in primary cells, which may select for cells with oncogenic p53 mutations11,12. It is unclear whether these CRISPR-induced changes are applicable to different cell types, and whether CRISPR gene editing may select for other oncogenic mutations. Addressing these questions, we analyzed genome-wide CRISPR and RNAi screens to systematically chart the mutation selection potential of CRISPR knockouts across the whole exome. Our analysis suggests that CRISPR gene editing can select for mutants of KRAS and VHL, at a level comparable to that reported for p53. These predictions were further validated in a genome-wide manner by analyzing independent CRISPR screens and patients tumor data. Finally, we performed a new set of pooled and arrayed CRISPR screens to evaluate the competition between CRISPR-edited isogenic p53 WT and mutant cell lines, which further validated our predictions. In summary, our study systematically charts and points to the potential selection of specific cancer driver mutations during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.",

    "abstract": "The conserved Rho-family GTPase Cdc42 is a master regulator of polarity establishment in many cell types. Cdc42 becomes activated and concentrated in a region of the cell cortex, and recruits a variety of effector proteins to that site. In turn, many effectors participate in regulation of cytoskeletal elements in order to remodel the cytoskeleton in a polarized manner. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a tractable model system for studies of cell polarity. In yeast cells, Cdc42 polarization involves a positive feedback loop in which effectors called p21-activated kinases (PAKs) act to recruit a Cdc42-directed guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), generating more GTP-Cdc42 in areas that already have GTP-Cdc42. The GTPase-interacting components (GICs) Gic1 and Gic2 are also Cdc42 effectors, and have been implicated in regulation of the actin and septin cytoskeleton. However, we report that cells lacking GICs are primarily defective in polarizing Cdc42 itself, suggesting that they act upstream as well as downstream of Cdc42 in yeast. Our findings suggest that feedback pathways involving GTPase effectors may be more prevalent than had been appreciated.",

Here, we identify a chromatin-based system for inducible aneuploidy in a human pathogen. Candida albicans utilizes chromosome missegregation to acquire resistance to antifungal drugs4,5 and for ploidy reduction after mating6. We discovered that the ancestor of C. albicans and two related pathogens evolved a variant of histone H2A that lacks the conserved phosphorylation site for Bub1 kinase7, a key regulator of chromosome segregation1. Expression of this variant controls the rates of aneuploidy and antibiotic resistance in this species. Moreover, CENP-A/Cse4, the histone H3 that specifies centromeres, is depleted from tetraploid mating products and virtually eliminated from cells exposed to aneuploidy-promoting cues. Thus, changes in chromatin regulation can confer the capacity for rapid evolution in eukaryotes.",
