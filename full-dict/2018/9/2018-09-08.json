    "abstract": "The Arg/N-end rule pathway, a mechanism of protein degradation conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in cellular protein quality control, but its role has only been vaguely understood. Through systematic examination of single residue mutants of model misfolded substrates, and global analyses of yeast proteins, we discovered that Ubr1, an E3 ligase of the Arg/N-end rule, degrades organellar proteins that fail to reach their intended subcellular compartments. We determined that recognition by Ubr1 is dependent on location signals that are naturally embedded into the 2nd amino acid residue of the majority of proteins. The N-end rule pathway is thus likely to have been critical to the evolution of endosymbiotic relationships which paved the way for advanced eukaryotic cellular life.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work elucidates a novel role for the N-end Rule Pathway, a protein degradation pathway highly conserved from yeast to humans. We demonstrate that the N-end rule pathway enforces the cellular compartmentalization of ER and mitochondrial proteins by degrading them when they fail to successfully translocate into their intended destinations and thus become mislocalized to the cytosol. This mechanism prevents the accumulation of toxic foreign proteins within the cytosol. Recognition of the displaced proteins is dependent on cellular location signals programmed into the 2nd residue of the target proteins, as well as the tendency for the proteins to misfold in a foreign environment. These findings have significant relevance to research on the mechanisms causing human diseases involving protein misfolding.",

    "abstract": "Infection by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a major health risk owing to its chronic nature, ability to reactivate to cause blindness and encephalitis, and high prevalence in human populations. Like nearly all eukaryotes, Toxoplasma glycosylates many of its proteins and lipids and assembles polysaccharides. Unlike most eukaryotes, Toxoplasma divides and differentiates in vacuoles within host cells. While their glycans resemble canonical models, they exhibit species-specific variations that have inhibited deeper investigations into their roles in parasite biology and virulence. The genome of Toxoplasma encodes a suite of likely glycogenes expected to assemble a range of N-glycans, O-glycans, a C-glycan, GPI-anchors, and polysaccharides, along with their requisite precursors and membrane transporters. To facilitate genetic approaches to investigate the roles of specific glycans, we mapped probable connections between 59 glycogenes, their enzyme products, and the glycans to which they contribute. We adapted a double-CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and a mass spectrometry-based glycomics workflow to test these relationships, and conducted infection studies in fibroblast monolayers to probe cellular functions. Through the validated disruption of 17 glycogenes, we also discovered novel Glc0-2-Man6-GlcNAc2-type N-glycans, GalNAc2- and Glc-Fuc-type O-glycans, and a nuclear O-Fuc type glycan. We describe the guide sequences, disruption constructs, and mutant strains, which are freely available to practitioners for application in the context of the relational map to investigate the roles of glycans in their favorite biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of genes that do not code for proteins. Since lncRNAs (or a fraction thereof) are expected to be functional, many efforts have been dedicated to catalog lncRNAs in numerous organisms, but our knowledge of lncRNAs in non vertebrate species remains very limited. Here, we annotated lncRNAs using transcriptomic data from the same larval stage of four Caenorhabditis species. The number of annotated lncRNAs in self-fertile nematodes was lower than in out-crossing species. We used a combination of approaches to identify putatively homologous lncRNAs: synteny, sequence conservation, and structural conservation. We classified a total of 1,532 out of 7,635 genes from the four species into families of lncRNAs with conserved synteny and expression at the larval stage, suggesting that a large fraction of the predicted lncRNAs may be species specific. Despite both sequence and local secondary structure seem to be poorly conserved, sequences within families frequently shared BLASTn hits and short sequence motifs, which were more likely to be unpaired in the predicted structures. We provide the first multi-species catalog of lncRNAs in nematodes and identify groups of lncRNAs with conserved synteny and expression, that share exposed motifs.",

    "abstract": "There is a critical unmet need for new tools to analyze and understand \\\"big data\\\" in the biological sciences where breakthroughs come from connecting massive genomics data with complex phenomics data. By integrating instant data visualization and statistical hypothesis testing, we have developed a new tool called OLIVER for phenomics visual data analysis with a unique function that any user adjustment will trigger real-time display updates for any affected elements in the workspace. By visualizing and analyzing omics data with OLIVER, biomedical researchers can quickly generate hypotheses and then test their thoughts within the same tool, leading to efficient knowledge discovery from complex, multi-dimensional biological data. The practice of OLIVER on multiple plant phenotyping experiments has shown that OLIVER can facilitate scientific discoveries. In the use case of OLIVER for large-scale plant phenotyping, a quick visualization identified emergent phenotypes that are highly transient and heterogeneous. The unique circular heat map with false-color plant images also indicates that such emergent phenotypes appear in different leaves under different conditions, suggesting that such previously unseen processes are critical for plant responses to dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Consequences of environmental fluctuations, including those associated with climate changes, can have a knock-on effect from individual to community scale. In particular, changes in species seasonal phenology can modify the structure and composition of communities, with potential consequences on their functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. In mild climate areas, aphids can be present in cereal fields throughout the winter, which allows aphid parasitoids to remain active. Using a nine-year dataset of aphid-parasitoid winter trophic webs in cereal fields of Western France, we report that the community structure and composition that prevailed before 2011 have recently shifted toward a more diversified community, with the presence of two new braconid parasitoid species (Aphidius ervi and Aphidius avenae), a few hyperparasitoid species and one aphid species (Metopolophium dirhodum). Increases in minimal winter temperatures and the frequency of frost events across the years partially explain observed community changes. Strong bottom-up effects from the relative abundances of aphid species also determine the relative abundance of parasitoid species each winter. Strong compartmentalization in parasitoid preference for host is reported. We suggest the recent modifications in parasitoid community composition to be linked to shifts in diapause expression (reduction or arrest of the use of winter diapause) and to host availability throughout the year. We highlight the implications for natural biological control in cereal fields. Perspectives are proposed to predict the composition of future host-parasitoid communities in the climate change context.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cell-free gene expression (CFE) systems have enabled their use for a host of synthetic biology applications, particularly for rapid prototyping of genetic circuits designed as biosensors. Despite the proliferation of cell-free protein synthesis platforms, the large number of currently existing protocols for making CFE extracts muddles the collective understanding of how the method by which an extract is prepared affects its functionality. Specifically, a key goal toward developing cell-free biosensors based on native genetic regulators is activating the transcriptional machinery present in bacterial extracts for protein synthesis. However, protein yields from genes transcribed in vitro by the native Escherichia coli RNA polymerase are quite low in conventional crude extracts originally optimized for expression by the bacteriophage transcriptional machinery. Here, we show that cell-free expression of genes under bacterial {sigma}70 promoters is constrained by the rate of transcription in crude extracts and that processing the extract with a ribosomal run-off reaction and subsequent dialysis can alleviate this constraint. Surprisingly, these processing steps only enhance protein synthesis in genes under native regulation, indicating that the translation rate is unaffected. We further investigate the role of other common process variants on extract performance and demonstrate that bacterial transcription is inhibited by including glucose in the growth culture, but is unaffected by flash-freezing the cell pellet prior to lysis. Our final streamlined protocol for preparing extract by sonication generates extract that facilitates expression from a diverse set of sensing modalities including protein and RNA regulators. We anticipate that this work will clarify the methodology for generating CFE extracts that are active for biosensing and will encourage the further proliferation of cell-free gene expression technology for new applications.",

    "abstract": "Affordable, easy-to-use diagnostic tests that can be readily deployed for point-of-care (POC) testing are key in addressing challenges in the diagnosis of medical conditions and for improving global health in general. Ideally, POC diagnostic tests should be highly selective for the biomarker, user-friendly, have a flexible design architecture and a low cost of production. Here we developed a novel agglutination assay based on whole E. coli cells surface-displaying nanobodies which bind selectively to a target protein analyte. As a proof-of-concept, we show the feasibility of this design as a new diagnostic platform by the detection of a model analyte at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, we show that the design architecture is flexible by building assays optimized to detect a range of model analyte concentrations supported using straight-forward design rules and a mathematical model. Finally, we re-engineer E. coli cells for the detection of a medically relevant biomarker by the display of two different antibodies against the human fibrinogen and demonstrate a detection limit as low as 10 pM in diluted human plasma. Overall, we demonstrate that our agglutination technology fulfills the requirement of POC testing by combining low-cost nanobody production, customizable detection range and low detection limits. This technology has the potential to produce affordable diagnostics for both field-testing in the developing world, emergency or disaster relief sites as well as routine medical testing and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Axonal transport is a highly regulated cellular process responsible for site-specific neuronal cargo delivery. This process is mediated in part by KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family of molecular motors. It is imperative that KIF1As highly efficient, superprocessive motility along microtubules is tightly regulated as misregulation of KIF1A cargo delivery is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for KIF1As motility, and subsequent proper spatiotemporal cargo delivery, are largely unknown. One potential regulatory mechanism of KIF1A motility is through the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of axonal microtubules. These PTMs, often occurring on the C-terminal tails of the microtubule tracks, act as molecular \\\"traffic signals\\\" helping to direct kinesin motor cargo delivery. Occurring on neuronal microtubules, C-terminal tail polygutamylation is known to be important for KIF1A cargo transport. KIF1As initial interaction with microtubule C-terminal tails is facilitated by the K-loop, a positively charged surface loop of the KIF1A motor domain. However, the K-loops role in KIF1A motility and response to perturbations in C-terminal tail polyglutamylation is underexplored. Using single-molecule imaging, we present evidence of KIF1As previously unreported pausing behavior on multiple microtubule structures. Further analysis revealed that these pauses link multiple processive segments together, contributing to KIF1As characteristic superprocessive run length. We further demonstrate that KIF1A pausing is mediated by a K-loop/polyglutamylated C-terminal tail interaction and is a regulatory mechanism of KIF1A motility. In summary, we introduce a new mechanism of KIF1A motility regulation, providing further insight into KIF1As role in axonal transport.",

The technological progress in fluorescence microscopy now allows in principle to measure these patterns with sufficient spatial resolution. However, high resolution imaging comes along with long acquisition times and high phototoxicity. Physiological live cell imaging is therefore often unfeasible and chemical fixation is employed. However, fixation methods have not been rigorously reviewed to preserve patterns at the resolution at which they can be nowadays imaged. A key parameter for this is the time span until fixation is completed. During this time, cells are under unphysiological conditions and patterns decay. We demonstrate here that formaldehyde fixation takes more than one hour for cytosolic proteins in cultured cells. Associated with this, we found a distinct displacement of proteins and lipids, including their loss from the cells. Other small aldehydes like glyoxal or acrolein showed inferior results. Fixations using glutaraldehyde were faster than four minutes and retained most cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, autofluorescence produced by glutaraldehyde was almost completely antagonized by supplementary addition of formaldehyde without compromising fixation speed. These findings indicate, which cellular processes can actually be reliably imaged after a certain chemical fixation.",

Viable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were obtained from the wrappable microwires between 30 and 60 days (n = 8). Weekly impedance measurements showed no correlation between SNR or time. The wrappable microwires successfully interfaced with small diameter nerves and has been validated in a chronic, awake preclinical model, which can better facilitate clinical translation for bioelectronic medicine.",

    "abstract": "Humans and vocal animals use vocalizations (human speech or animal  calls) to communicate with members of their species. A necessary function of auditory perception is to generalize across the high variability inherent in the production of these sounds and classify them into perceptually distinct categories ( words or  call types). Here, we demonstrate using an information-theoretic approach that production-invariant classification of calls can be achieved by detecting mid-level acoustic features. Starting from randomly chosen marmoset call features, we used a greedy search algorithm to determine the most informative and least redundant set of features necessary for call classification. Call classification at >95% accuracy could be accomplished using only 10 - 20 features per call type. Most importantly, predictions of the tuning properties of putative neurons selective for such features accurately matched some previously observed responses of superficial layer neurons in primary auditory cortex. Such a feature-based approach succeeded in categorizing calls of other species such as guinea pigs and macaque monkeys, and could also solve other complex classification tasks such as caller identification. Our results suggest that high-level neural representations of sounds are based on task-dependent features optimized for specific computational goals.",

    "abstract": "Many indicators are used to monitor the progress of the target which aims to stop the biodiversity loss by 2020. However, the occupancy-detection model which is currently applied to calculate the indicator is biased. Hence, more robust models are required to track the trend of the species precisely. This research first reviews the previous works on improving this occupancy-detection model by changing the prior distributions of one of the quantities and of the models considered previously, a model based on a random walk is found to be the most appropriate although it has some potential deficiencies. Then this research provides some potential improvements of the random walk model by changing the way of modelling the prior distributions of each quantity and changing the model structure. Then the hoverflies datasets are used in this research to analyse the performance of the models. These models are compared by the running times of fitting the models and the plots of the trend of the species of all models. As a result, the categorical list length model is considered to be the most precise model among all models with a reasonable running time. Then, we fit this model with a large dataset, however, it takes a long running time to get the result. Finally, some potential improvements are suggested which may be useful for further research.",

    "abstract": "Little remains known about how the timing of mitigation of current greenhouse gas emissions will influence freshwater biodiversity patterns. Using three general circulation models, we evaluate the response of 260 broad-ranging European caddisfly species to climate conditions in 2080 under two scenarios: business as usual (A2A) and mitigation (A1B). If implemented effectively, recent government commitments established under COP21, to mitigate current greenhouse gas emissions, would result in future climatic conditions similar to the mitigation scenario we explored. Under the Cgcm circulation model, which we found to be the most conservative model, suitable environmental conditions were predicted to shift 3{degrees} more to the east under the mitigation scenario compared to business as usual. The majority of broad-ranging European caddisfly species will benefit from mitigation, but 5 to 15% of species that we evaluated will be bigger losers under the mitigation scenario compared to business as usual. Under the mitigation scenario, caddisfly species that will retain less of their current range and experience lower predicted range expansion are those that currently have relatively limited distributions. Continental-scale assessments such as the ones that we present are needed to identify species at greatest risk of range loss under changing climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "1. Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs) estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animal. Conceptually, random coefficients could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach, but straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking.\n\n2. We take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i. e., the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, but also with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including random intercept-only models, and to a two-step algorithm for fitting mixed-effects models.\n\n3. We also reinforce the need to weight available points when fitting RSFs, since models fit using \"infinitely weighted logistic regression\" have been shown to be equivalent to an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP). We generalize this result to \"infinitely weighted Poisson regression\", which converges to the same underlying IPP distribution.\n\n4. Using data from Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the importance of including random slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters.\n\n5. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.",

Overall, 80 (11.90%) individual mosquito samples revealed to show positive amplifications in both markers and 69.0% showed congruence in supergroup identification (supergroup B).

However, the principle of selecting representative network motifs for local motif based clustering remains largely unexplored. We present a scalable algorithm called FSM for network motif discovery. FSM accelerates the motif discovery process by effectively reducing the number of times to do subgraph isomorphism labeling. Multiple heuristic optimizations for subgraph enumeration and subgraph classification are also adopted in FSM to further improve its performance. Experimental results show that FSM is more efficient than the compared models on computational efficiency and memory usage. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that large and frequent network motifs may be more appropriate to be selected as the representative network motifs for discovering higher-order organizational structures in biological networks than small or low-frequency network motifs.",

    "abstract": "It has been a puzzle how decondensed interphase chromosomes remain essentially unknotted. The natural expectation is that in the presence of type II DNA topoisomerases that permit passages of double-stranded DNA regions through each other, all chromosomes should reach the state of topological equilibrium. The topological equilibrium in highly crowded interphase chromosomes forming chromosome territories would result in formation of highly knotted chromatin fibres. However, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methods revealed that the decay of contacts with the genomic distance in interphase chromosomes is practically the same as in the crumpled globule state that is formed when long polymers condense without formation of any knots. To remove knots from highly crowded chromatin, one would need an active process that should not only provide the energy to move the system from the state of topological equilibrium but also guide topoisomerase-mediated passages in such a way that knots would be efficiently unknotted instead of making the knots even more complex. We show here that the process of chromatin-loop extrusion is ideally suited to actively unknot chromatin fibres in interphase chromosomes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSimilar to earphone cables crammed into a pocket, long and crowded chromatin fibres that form chromosomes in living cells have the natural tendency to get knotted. This is exacerbated by the action of DNA topoisomerases that transiently cut some chromatin fibres and let other to pass through. Yet, the knotting frequency of chromatin fibres is very low and it has been a puzzle how this is achieved. Recently a novel active mechanism known as chromatin loop extrusion has been proposed to be involved in shaping chromosomes by forming sequential arrays of ca 1 Mb large chromatin loops. Using numerical simulations, we show here that chromatin loop extrusion is ideally suited to remove knots from chromatin fibres.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) possesses a two-component regulatory system, DosRST, that enables Mtb to sense host immune cues and establish a state of non-replicating persistence (NRP). NRP bacteria are tolerant to several anti-mycobacterial drugs and are thought to play a role in the long course of tuberculosis (TB) therapy. Therefore, small molecules that inhibit Mtb from establishing or maintaining NRP could reduce the reservoir of drug tolerant bacteria and function as an adjunct therapy to reduce treatment time. Previously, we reported the discovery of six novel chemical inhibitors of DosRST, named HC101A-106A, from a whole cell, reporter-based phenotypic high throughput screen. Here, we report functional and mechanism of action studies of HC104A and HC106A. RNAseq transcriptional profiling shows that the compounds downregulate genes of the DosRST regulon. Both compounds reduce hypoxia-induced triacylglycerol synthesis by ~50%. HC106A inhibits Mtb survival during hypoxia-induced NRP, however, HC104A did not inhibit survival during NRP. An electrophoretic mobility assay shows that HC104A inhibits DosR DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that HC104A may function by directly targeting DosR. In contrast, UV-visible spectroscopy studies suggest HC106A directly targets the histidine kinase heme, via a mechanism that is distinct from the oxidation and alkylation of heme previously observed with artemisinin (HC101A). Synergistic interactions were observed when DosRST inhibitors were examined in pair-wise combinations with the strongest potentiation observed between artemisinin paired with HC102A, HC103A, or HC106A. Our data collectively show that the DosRST pathway can be inhibited by multiple distinct mechanisms.",

Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide opportunities to identify new cell types and molecular features.

This unbiased approach recovered 90% of the known ISCs/EBs markers, highlighting the high quality of the dataset. Gene set enrichment analysis in conjunction with electron micrographs revealed that ISCs are enriched in free ribosomes and possess mitochondria with fewer cristae. We demonstrate that a subset of EEs in the middle region of the midgut expresses the progenitor marker esg and that individual EEs are capable of expressing up to 4 different gut hormone peptides. We also show that the transcription factor klumpfuss (klu) is expressed in EBs and functions to suppress EE formation. Lastly, we provide a web-based resource for visualization of gene expression in single cells.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain can be associated with functional and morphological changes in the brain. It has long been thought that some severe chronic pain conditions, such as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), are not only associated with, but even maintained by a reorganisation of the somatotopic representation of the affected limb in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). This notion has driven treatments that aim to restore S1 representations, such as sensory discrimination training and mirror therapy. However, this notion is based on both indirect and incomplete evidence obtained with imaging methods with low spatial resolution. Here, we used functional MRI to characterize the S1 representation of the affected and unaffected hand in patients with unilateral CRPS of one hand. Our study demonstrates that the cortical area, location, and geometry of the S1 representation of the CRPS hand are comparable to those of the healthy hand, as well as to those of controls. Given that S1 representations are largely preserved in CPRS patients, it is compelling to reconsider not only the cortical mechanisms that underlie the disorder, but also the rationale for interventions that aim to \\\"restore\\\" somatotopic representations.",

To date, few studies have examined the genetic architecture of lipids in Polynesians, and none have in Samoans, whose unique population history, including many population bottlenecks, may provide insight into the biological foundations of variation in lipid levels. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of four fasting serum lipid levels: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG) in a sample of 2,849 Samoans, with validation genotyping for associations in a replication cohort comprising 1,798 Samoans and American Samoans. We identified multiple genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10-8) previously seen in other populations - APOA1 with TG, CETP with HDL, and APOE with TC and LDL - and several suggestive associations (P < 1 x 10-5), including an association of variants downstream of MGAT1 and RAB21 with HDL. However, we observed different association signals for variants near APOE than what has been previously reported in non-Polynesian populations. The association with several known lipid loci combined with the newly-identified associations with variants near MGAT1 and RAB21 suggest that while some of the genetic architecture of lipids is shared between Samoans and other populations, part of the genetic architecture may be Polynesian-specific.",

    "abstract": "DiSulfide Bond (DSB) oxidative folding enzymes are master regulators of virulence localized to the periplasm of many Gram-negative bacteria. The archetypal DSB machinery from Escherichia coli K12 has a dithiol oxidizing redox relay pair (DsbA/B), a disulfide isomerizing redox relay pair (DsbC/D) and specialist reducing enzymes DsbE and DsbG that also interact with DsbD. By contrast the Gram-negative bacterium Wolbachia pipientis encodes just three DSB enzymes. Two of these -DsbA1 and -DsbB form a redox relay pair analogous to E. coli DsbA/B. The third enzyme -DsbA2 incorporates a DsbA-like sequence but does not interact with -DsbB. In comparison with other DsbA enzymes, -DsbA2 has [~]50 extra N-terminal residues. The crystal structure of -DsbA2{Delta}N, the N-terminally truncated form in which these residues are removed confirms the DsbA-like nature of this domain. However, -DsbA2 does not have DsbA-like activity: it is structurally and functionally different as a consequence of its N-terminal residues. First, -DsbA2 is a powerful disulfide isomerase and a poor dithiol oxidase - ie its role is to shuffle rather than introduce disulfide bonds. Moreover, small-angle X-ray scattering of -DsbA2 reveals a homotrimeric arrangement. Our results allow us to draw conclusions about the factors required for functionally equivalent enzymatic activity across structurally diverse protein architectures.",

    "abstract": "The first-layer filters employed in convolutional neural networks tend to learn, or extract, spatial features from the data. Within their application to genomic sequence data, these learned features are often visualized and interpreted by converting them to sequence logos; an information-based representation of the consensus nucleotide motif. The process to obtain such motifs, however, is done through post-training procedures which often discard the filter weights themselves and instead rely upon finding those sequences maximally correlated with the given filter. Moreover, the filters collectively learn motifs with high redundancy, often simply shifted representations of the same sequence. We propose a schema to learn sequence motifs directly through weight constraints and transformations such that the individual weights comprising the filter are directly interpretable as either position weight matrices (PWMs) or information gain matrices (IGMs). We additionally leverage regularization to encourage learning highly-representative motifs with low inter-filter redundancy. Through learning PWMs and IGMs directly we present preliminary results showcasing how our method is capable of incorporating previously-annotated database motifs along with learning motifs de novo and then outline a pipeline for how these tools may be used jointly in a data application.",

    "abstract": "Numerous biophysical hypotheses invoke tissue stiffness as a key parameter for shaping tissue during development and for influencing cell behaviours during disease progression. However, currently available methods are insufficient to test hypotheses that concern the physical properties of bulk tissues. Here we introduce, validate and apply a new 3D magnetic device that generates a uniform magnetic field gradient within a space that is sufficient to accommodate a vertebrate, organ-stage embryo under live conditions. The device allows for rapid, nontoxic measurement of the spatial variation of absolute elastic modulus and viscosity deep within mesenchymal tissues and within epithelia. By applying the device to map the spatiotemporal variation of viscoelastic properties within the early mouse limb bud, we identified an anteriorly biased mesodermal stiffness gradient along which cells move collectively to shape the early bud. Tissue stiffness corresponds to the nascent expression domain of fibronectin that is Wnt5a-dependent. The findings challenge the notion that Wnt5a regulates cell movements by chemotaxis, and raises the possibility that Wnt5a modifies the tissue microenvironment to promote durotaxis in vivo. Importantly, the ability to precisely measure tissue stiffness in 3D has the potential to instigate and refine mechanisms of development and disease progression.",

    "abstract": "To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define molecular alterations within (and between) disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell states. We note that disease-associated perturbations usually retain cellular-identity programs (core genes), providing an appropriate reference for secondary comparison analyses. Thus, we created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis and classification of cell types from diverse scRNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony is an automated and easy-to-use tool that efficiently matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community clustering and alignment strategy. Utilizing core genes and community clustering to reveal disease and cell-state systems-level insights overcomes bias toward donor and disease effects that can be imposed by joint-alignment approaches. Moreover, cellHarmony directly compares cell frequencies and gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner, then produces a holistic representation of these differences across potentially dozens of cell populations and impacted regulatory networks. Using this approach, we identify gene regulatory programs that are selectively impacted in distinct hematopoietic and heart cell populations that suggest novel disease mechanisms and drug targets. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex diseases.",

Some naive normal-based tests have low testing power with invalid normal distribution assumptions for RNA-seq read counts, whereas count-based methods lack a biologically meaningful interpretation and have limited capability for integration with other analysis packages for mRNA abundance. In this study, we propose an improved method, RoMA, to accurately detect differential expression and unlock the integration with upstream and downstream analyses on mRNA abundance in RNA-seq studies.\\n\\nResultsRoMA incorporates information from both mRNA abundance and raw counts. Studies on simulated data and two real datasets showed that RoMA provides an accurate quantification of mRNA abundance and a data adjustment-tolerant DE analysis with high AUC, low FDR, and an efficient control of type I error rate. This study provides a valid strategy for mRNA abundance modeling and data analysis integration for RNA-seq studies, which will greatly facilitate the identification and interpretation of DE genes.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationRoMA is available at https://github.com/GuoshuaiCai/RoMA.\\n\\nContactGCAI@mailbox.sc.edu or Michael.L.Whitfield@Dartmouth.edu",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) orchestrate the dynamic and diverse transcriptional programs that assemble the human central nervous system (CNS) during development and maintain its function throughout life. Genetic variation within CREs plays a central role in phenotypic variation in complex traits including the risk of developing disease. However, the cellular complexity of the human brain has largely precluded the identification of functional regulatory variation within the human CNS. We took advantage of the retina, a well-characterized region of the CNS with reduced cellular heterogeneity, to establish a roadmap for characterizing regulatory variation in the human CNS. This comprehensive resource of tissue-specific regulatory elements, transcription factor binding, and gene expression programs in three regions of the human visual system (retina, macula, retinal pigment epithelium/choroid) reveals features of regulatory element evolution that shape tissue-specific gene expression programs and defines the regulatory elements with the potential to contribute to mendelian and complex disorders of human vision.",
