    "abstract": "During the last decade genome-wide association studies have proven to be a powerful approach to identifying disease-causing variants. However, for admixed populations, most current methods for performing association testing are based on the assumption that the effect of a genetic variant is the same regardless of its ancestry. This is a reasonable assumption for a causal variant, but may not hold for the genetic variants that are tested in genome-wide association studies, which are usually not causal. The effects of non-causal genetic variants depend on how strongly their presence correlate with the presence of the causal variant, which may vary between ancestral populations because of different linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies.\\n\\nMotivated by this, we here introduce a new statistical method for association testing in recently admixed populations, where the effect size is allowed to depend on the ancestry of a given allele. Our method does not rely on accurate inference of local ancestry, yet using simulations we show that in some scenarios it gives a dramatic increase in statistical power to detect associations. In addition, the method allows for testing for difference in effect size between ancestral populations, which can be used to help determine if a SNP is causal. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method on data from the Greenlandic population.",

    "abstract": "The storage limitations of visual working memory have been the subject of intense research interest for several decades, but few studies have systematically investigated the dependence of these limitations on memory load that exceeds our retention abilities. Under this real-world scenario, performance typically declines beyond a critical load among low-performing subjects, a phenomenon known as working memory overload. We used a fronto-parietal cortical model to test the hypothesis that high-performing subjects select a manageable number of items for storage, thereby avoiding overload. The model accounts for behavioural and electrophysiological data from high-performing subjects in a parameter regime where competitive encoding in its prefrontal network selects items for storage, inter-areal projections sustain their representations after stimulus offset, and weak dynamics in its parietal network limit their mutual interference. Violation of these principles accounts for these data among low-performing subjects, implying that poor visual working memory performance reflects poor control over fronto-parietal circuitry, and making testable predictions for experiments.",

    "abstract": "Research in the area of transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) often relies on computational models of current flow in the brain. Models are built based on the magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human head to capture detailed individual anatomy. To simulate current flow on an individual, the subjects MRI is segmented, virtual electrodes are placed on this anatomical model, the volume is tessellated into a mesh, and a finite element model (FEM) is solved numerically to estimate the current flow. Various software tools are available for each step, as well as processing pipelines that connect these tools for automated or semi-automated processing. The goal of the present tool - ROAST - is to provide an end-to-end pipeline that can automatically process individual heads with realistic volumetric anatomy leveraging open-source software and custom scripts to improve segmentation and execute electrode placement. The electric field estimated with the open-source tools used by ROAST differ little from the results obtained with commercial meshing and FEM solving software. We also do not find large differences between the various automated segmentation methods used by ROAST and SimNIBS, a well-established open-source modeling pipeline. However, we do find large differences when volumetric segmentation are converted into surfaces that are used in SimNIBS to generate volumetric meshes. Evaluation on intracranial recordings from human subjects suggests that ROAST outperforms newer versions of SimNIBS in predicting field distribution and magnitudes, but that an older version of SimNIBS performs similarly. We hope that the detailed comparisons presented here of various choices in this modeling pipeline can provide guidance for future tool development. We release ROAST as an open-source, easy-to-install and fully-automated pipeline for individualized TES modeling at https://www.parralab.org/roast/.",

To improve community function, we can artificially select communities by growing \\\"Newborn\\\" communities over \\\"maturation time\\\" into \\\"Adult\\\" communities, and selecting highest-functioning Adults to \\\"reproduce\\\" by diluting each into multiple Newborns of the next cycle. Community selection has been attempted a few times on complex communities, often generating mixed results that are difficult to interpret. Here, we ask how costly community function may be improved via mutations and community selection. We simulate selection of two-species communities where Helpers digest Waste and generate Byproduct essential to Manufacturers; Manufacturers divert a fraction of their growth to make Product. Community function, the total Product in an \\\"Adult\\\", is sub-optimal even when both species have been pre-optimized as monocultures. If we dilute an Adult into Newborns by pipetting (a common experimental procedure), stochastic fluctuations in Newborn composition prevents community function from improving. Reducing fluctuations via cell sorting allows selection to work. Our conclusions hold regardless of whether H and M are commensal or mutualistic, or variations in model assumptions.",

    "abstract": "We report the analysis of activation of full-length mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish belonging to the oldest group of jawed vertebrates by corticosteroids and progesterone. Based on their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fishes. Although progesterone activates ray-finned fish MRs, progesterone does not activate human, amphibian or alligator MRs, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis and other non-epithelial tissues, indicating that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Our data suggest that progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in elephant shark ovary and testis.",

    "abstract": "Unspliced XBP1 mRNA encodes XBP1u, the transcriptionally inert variant of the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1u targets its mRNA-ribosome-nascent-chain-complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to facilitate UPR activation and prevents overactivation. Yet, its membrane association is controversial. Here, we use cell-free translocation and cellular assays to define a moderately hydrophobic stretch in XBP1u that is sufficient to mediate insertion into the ER membrane. Mutagenesis of this transmembrane (TM) region reveals residues that facilitate XBP1u turnover by an ER-associated degradation route that is dependent on signal peptide peptidase (SPP). Furthermore, the impact of these mutations on TM helix dynamics was assessed by residue-specific amide exchange kinetics, evaluated by a semi-automated algorithm. Based on our results, we suggest that SPP-catalyzed intramembrane proteolysis of TM helices is not only determined by their conformational flexibility, but also by side chain interactions near the scissile peptide bond with the enzymes active site.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of external feedback, a decision maker must rely on a subjective estimate of their decision accuracy in order to appropriately guide behavior. Normative models of perceptual decision making relate subjective estimates of internal signal quality (e.g. confidence) directly to the internal signal quality itself, thereby making it unknowable whether the subjective estimate or the underlying signal is what drives behavior. We constructed stimuli that dissociated human observers performance on a visual estimation task from their subjective estimates of confidence in their performance, thus violating normative principles. To understand whether confidence influences future decision making, we examined serial dependence in observers responses, a phenomenon whereby the estimate of a stimulus on the current trial can be biased towards the stimulus from the previous trial. We found that when decisions were made with high confidence, they conferred stronger biases upon the following trial, suggesting that confidence may enhance serial dependence. Critically, this finding was true also when confidence was experimentally dissociated from task performance, indicating that subjective confidence, independent of signal quality, can amplify serial dependence. These findings demonstrate an effect of confidence on future behavior, independent of task performance, and suggest that perceptual decisions incorporate recent history in an uncertainty-weighted manner, but where the uncertainty carried forward is a subjectively estimated and possibly suboptimal readout of objective sensory uncertainty.",

Surprisingly, direct evidence for their interrelatedness is lacking, as is an understanding of why they might be related. There is debate about whether they are linked by an underlying memory-related process or, as has more recently been suggested, because they each require the endogenous construction of scene imagery. Here, using a large sample of participants and multiple cognitive tests with a wide spread of individual differences in performance, we found that these functions are indeed related. Mediation analyses further showed that scene construction, and not memory, mediated (explained) the relationships between the functions. These findings offer a fresh perspective on autobiographical memory, future thinking, navigation, and also on the hippocampus, where scene imagery appears to play an influential role.",

Here we report a discovery of novel allosteric modulation of p53 by small molecules, which is an unexpected turn in the p53 story. We identified a structural element involved in p53 regulation, whose targeting by RITA, PpIX and licofelone block the binding of p53 inhibitors, MDM2 and MDMX. Deletion and mutation analysis followed by molecular modeling, identified the key p53 residues S33 and S37 targeted by RITA and PpIX. We propose that the binding of small molecules to the identified site induces a conformational trap preventing p53 from the interaction with MDM2 and MDMX. These results point to a high potential of allosteric activators. Our study provides the basis for the development of therapeutics with a novel mechanism of action, thus extending the p53 pharmacological potential.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnsupervised clustering is important in disease subtyping, among having other genomic applications. As genomic data has become more multifaceted, how to cluster across data sources for more precise subtyping is an ever more important area of research. Many of the methods proposed so far, including iCluster and Cluster of Cluster Assignments, make an unreasonble assumption of a common clustering across all data sources, and those that do not are fewer and tend to be computationally intensive.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a Bayesian parametric model for integrative, unsupervised clustering across data sources. In our two-way latent structure model, samples are clustered in relation to each specific data source, distinguishing it from methods like Cluster of Cluster Assignments and iCluster, but cluster labels have across-dataset meaning, allowing cluster information to be shared between data sources. A common scaling across data sources is not required, and inference is obtained by a Gibbs Sampler, which we improve with a warm start strategy and modified density functions to robustify and speed convergence. Posterior interpretation allows for inference on common clusterings occurring among subsets of data sources. An interesting statistical formulation of the model results in sampling from closed-form posteriors despite incorporation of a complex latent structure. We fit the model with Gaussian and more general densities, which influences the degree of across-dataset cluster label sharing. Uniquely among integrative clustering models, our formulation makes no nestedness assumptions of samples across data sources so that a sample missing data from one genomic source can be clustered according to its existing data sources.\\n\\nWe apply our model to a Norwegian breast cancer cohort of ductal carcinoma in-situ and invasive tumors, comprised of somatic copy-number alteration, methylation and expression datasets. We find enrichment in the Her2 subtype and ductal carcinoma among those observations exhibiting greater cluster correspondence across expression and CNA data. In general, there are few pan-genomic clusterings, suggesting that models assuming a common clustering across genomic data sources might yield misleading results.\\n\\nImplementation and AvailabilityThe model is implemented in an R package called twl (\\\"two-way latent\\\"), available on CRAN. Data for analysis is available within the R package.\\n\\nContactdavid.swanson@medisin.uio.no\\n\\nSupplementary MaterialAppendices are available online and include additional Breast Cancer subtyping analysis and model runs, comparison with leading integrative clustering methods, fully general statistical formulation and description of improvements of the Gibbs sampler.",

    "abstract": "Pacific salmon are a keystone resource in Alaska, generating annual revenues of well over [~]US$500 million/yr. Due to their anadromous life history, adult spawners distribute amongst thousands of streams, posing a huge management challenge. Currently, spawners are enumerated at just a few streams because of reliance on human counters and, rarely, sonar. The ability to detect organisms by shed tissue (environmental DNA, eDNA) promises a more efficient counting method. However, although eDNA correlates generally with local fish abundances, we do not know if eDNA can accurately enumerate salmon. Here we show that daily, and near-daily, flow-corrected eDNA rate closely tracks daily numbers of returning sockeye and coho spawners and outmigrating sockeye smolts. eDNA thus promises accurate and efficient enumeration, but to deliver the most robust numbers will need higher-resolution stream-flow data, at-least-daily sampling, and a focus on species with simple life histories, since shedding rate varies amongst jacks, juveniles, and adults.",

    "abstract": "Though bacteria in nature are often nutritionally limited and growing slowly, most of our understanding of core cellular processes such as transcription comes from studies in a handful of model organisms doubling rapidly under nutrient-replete conditions. We previously identified a small protein of unknown function, called SutA, in a global screen of proteins synthesized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under growth arrest (Babin BM, et al. (2016) SutA is a bacterial transcription factor expressed during slow growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PNAS 113(5):E597-605). SutA binds RNA polymerase (RNAP), causing widespread changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Here, using biochemical and structural methods, we examine how SutA interacts with RNAP and the functional consequences of these interactions. We show that SutA consists of a central -helix with unstructured N- and C-terminal tails, and binds to the {beta}1 domain of RNAP. It activates transcription from the P. aeruginosa rrn promoter by both the housekeeping sigma factor holoenzyme (E{sigma}70) and the general stress response sigma factor holoenzyme (E{sigma}S) in vitro, and its N-terminal tail is required for activation in both holoenzyme contexts. However, we find that the interaction between SutA and each holoenzyme is distinct, with the SutA C-terminal tail and an acidic loop unique to {sigma}70 playing the determining roles in these differences. Our results add SutA to a growing list of transcription regulators that use their intrinsically disordered regions to remodel transcription complexes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCELittle is known about how bacteria regulate their activities during periods of dormancy, yet growth arrest dominates bacterial existence in most environments and is directly relevant to the problem of physiological antibiotic tolerance. Though much is known about transcription in the model organism, Escherichia coli, even there, our understanding of gene expression during dormancy is incomplete. Here we explore how transcription under growth arrest is modulated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the small acidic protein, SutA. We show that SutA binds to RNA polymerase and controls transcription by a mechanism that is distinct from other known regulators. Our work underscores the potential for fundamental, mechanistic discovery in this important and understudied realm of bacterial physiology.",

Foamy viruses, including those that form endogenous copies, provide strong evidence for virus-host co-divergence across the vertebrate phylogeny.

Here we report a novel endogenous foamy virus, named SpuEFV, in genome of the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), an endangered reptile species endemic to New Zealand. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that SpuEFV has likely co-diverged with its host over a period of many millions of years. The discovery of SpuEFV fills a major gap in the fossil record of foamy viruses and provides important insights into the early evolution of retroviruses.",

    "abstract": "Humans possess the capacity to employ prior knowledge in the service of our ability to remember; thus, memory is oftentimes superior for information that is semantically congruent with our prior knowledge. This congruency benefit grows during development, but little is understood about neurodevelopmental differences that underlie this growth. Here, we sought to explore the brain mechanisms underlying these phenomena. To this end, we examined the neural substrates of semantically congruent vs. incongruent item-context associations in 116 children and 25 young adults who performed encoding and retrieval tasks during functional MRI data collection. Participants encoded item-context pairs by judging whether an item belonged in a scene. Episodic memory was then tested with a source memory task. Consistent with prior work, source memory accuracy improved with age, and was greater for congruent than incongruent pairs; further, this congruency benefit was greater in adults than children. Age-related differences were observed across univariate, functional connectivity, and multivariate analyses, particularly in lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In sum, our results revealed two general age differences. First, left ventrolateral/rostrolateral PFC exhibited age-related increases in univariate activity, as well as greater functional connectivity with temporal regions during the processing of congruency. Second, right rostrolateral PFC activation was associated with successfully encoded congruent associations in adults, but not children. Finally, multivariate analyses provided evidence for stronger veridical memory in adults than children in right ventrolateral PFC. These effects in right lateral PFC were significantly correlated with memory performance, implicating them in the process of remembering congruent associations. These results connect brain regions associated with top-down control in the congruency benefit and age-related improvements therein.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpithelial cytokines, including IL-33 and TSLP, have attracted interest because of their roles in chronic allergic inflammation-related conditions such as asthma. Mast cells are one of the major targets of IL-33, to which they respond by secreting cytokines. Most studies performed thus far have investigated the acute effects of IL-33 on mast cells.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this study is to investigate how acute versus prolonged exposure of human mast cells to IL-33 and TSLP affects mediator synthesis and IgE-mediated activation.\\n\\nMethodsHuman lung mast cells (HLMCs), cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs), and the ROSA mast cell line were used for this study. Surface receptor expression and the levels of mediators were measured after treatment with IL-33 and/or TSLP.\\n\\nResultsIL-33 induced the acute release of cytokines. Prolonged exposure to IL-33 increased while TSLP reduced intracellular levels of tryptase. Acute IL-33 treatment strongly potentiated IgE-mediated activation. In contrast, four days of exposure to IL-33 decreased IgE-mediated activation, an effect that was accompanied by a reduction in Fc{varepsilon}RI expression.\\n\\nConclusion & Clinical RelevanceWe show that IL-33 plays dual roles for mast cell functions. The acute effect includes cytokine release and the potentiation of IgE-mediated degranulation, whereas prolonged exposure to IL-33 reduces IgE-mediated activation. We conclude that mast cells act quickly in response to the alarmin IL-33 to initiate an acute inflammatory response, whereas extended exposure to IL-33 during prolonged inflammation reduces IgE-mediated responses. This negative feedback effect suggests the presence of a novel IL-33 mediated regulatory pathway that modulates IgE-induced human mast cell responses.",

    "abstract": "Aptamers have evolved as a viable alternative to antibodies in recent years. High throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized the aptamer research by increasing the number of reads from few using Sanger sequencing to millions of reads using HTS approach. Despite the availability and advantages of HTS compared to Sanger sequencing there are only 50 aptamer HTS sequencing samples available on public databases. HTS data for aptamer research are mostly used to compare sequence enrichment between subsequent selection cycles. This approach does not take full advantage of HTS because enrichment of sequences during selection can be due to inefficient negative selection when using live cells. Here we present differential binding cell-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) workflow that adapts FASTAptamer toolbox and bioinformatics tool edgeR that is mainly used for functional genomics to achieve more informative metrics about the selection process. We propose fast and practical high throughput aptamer identification method to be used with cell-SELEX technique to increase successful aptamer selection rate against live cells. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by performing aptamer selection against clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) RCC-MF cell line using RC-124 cell line from healthy kidney tissue for negative selection.",

Exogenous fatty acids were required likely due to suppression of intrinsic fatty acid synthesis by hypoxia and low cytokine conditions.

In particular, stress-alleviation strategies act on the tumor by reducing its stiffness, decreasing solid stresses and improving blood perfusion. However, these microenvironmental changes trigger chemo-mechanically induced cellular phenotypic transitions whose impact on therapy outcomes is not completely understood. In this work, we perform experiments to analyze the effects of mechanical compression on migration and proliferation of two glioma cell lines. From these experiments, we derive a mathematical model of glioma progression focusing on cellular phenotypic plasticity. The model reveals a trade-off between tumor infiltration and cellular content as a consequence of stress-alleviation approaches. We discuss how these findings can improve the current understanding of glioma/microenvironment interactions, and suggest strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

It has been demonstrated that it is possible to use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to infer to which speaker someone is attending by relating the neural activity to the speech signals. However, classifying auditory attention within a short time interval remains the main challenge. We present a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract the locus of auditory attention (left/right) without knowledge of the speech envelopes. Our results show that it is possible to decode the locus of attention within 1 to 2 s, with a median accuracy of around 81%.

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen with an intrinsically high resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. This high level of resistance requires several genes (oatA, pgdA, dltA and sigV) acting synergistically to inhibit both the enzymatic and cationic antimicrobial peptide activities of lysozyme. We sought to identify novel genes modulating E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme. Random transposon mutagenesis carried out in the quadruple oatA/pgdA/dltA/sigV mutant led to the identification of several independent insertions clustered on the chromosome. These mutations were located in a locus referred to as the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) variable region located downstream of the highly conserved epaA-epaR genes proposed to encode a core synthetic machinery. The epa variable region was previously proposed to be responsible for EPA decorations, but the role of this locus remains largely unknown. Here, we show that EPA decoration contributes to resistance towards charged antimicrobials and underpins virulence in the zebrafish model of infection by conferring resistance to phagocytosis. Collectively, our results indicate that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections and reveal an essential role of the modification of this surface polymer for enterococcal pathogenesis.",

The structure, polymorphism and functions of these lipocalins have been well described in the western European house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus), clarifying their role in semiochemical communication. The complexity of these roles in the mouse raises the question of similar functions in other rodents, including the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus. Norway rats express MUPs in urine but information about specific MUP isoform sequences and functions is limited. In this study, we present a detailed molecular characterization of the MUP proteoforms expressed in the urine of two laboratory strains, Wistar Han and Brown Norway, and wild caught animals, using a combination of manual gene annotation, intact protein mass spectrometry and bottom-up mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches. Detailed sequencing of the proteins reveals a less complex pattern of primary sequence polymorphism than the mouse. However, unlike the mouse, rat MUPs exhibit added complexity in the form of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and exoproteolytic trimming of specific isoforms. The possibility that urinary MUPs may have different roles in rat chemical communication than those they play in the house mouse is also discussed.",

Here we use the Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer database (CIViC) in conjunction with single-molecule molecular inversion probe (smMIP) capture to identify and design probes targeting clinically relevant variants in cancer. In total, 2,027 smMIPs were designed to target 111 eligible CIViC variants. The total genomic region covered by the CIViC smMIPs reagent was 61.5 kb. When compared to existing genome or exome sequencing results (n = 27 cancer samples from 5 tumor types), CIViC smMIP sequencing demonstrated a 95% sensitivity for variant detection (n = 61/64 variants). Variant allele frequency for variants identified on both sequencing platforms were highly concordant (Pearson correlation = 0.885; n = 61 variants). Moreover, for individuals with paired tumor/normal samples (n = 12), 182 clinically relevant variants missed by original sequencing were discovered by CIViC smMIPs sequencing. This design paradigm demonstrates the utility of an open-sourced database built on attendant community contributions for each variant with peer-reviewed interpretations. Use of a public repository for variant identification, probe development, and variant annotation could provide a transparent approach to build a dynamic next-generation sequencing-based oncology panel.",

We aim to assess the effects of a continuous care intervention (CCI) on retention, glycemic control, weight, body composition, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, thyroid, inflammatory markers, diabetes medication usage and disease outcomes at 2 years in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAn open label, non-randomized, controlled study with 262 and 87 participants with T2D were enrolled in the CCI and usual care (UC) groups, respectively.\n\nRESULTSSignificant changes from baseline to 2 years in the CCI group included: HbA1c (-12% from 7.7{+/-}0.1%); fasting glucose (-18% from 163.67{+/-}3.90 mg/dL); fasting insulin (-42% from 27.73{+/-}1.26 pmol L-1); weight (-10% from 114.56{+/-}0.60 kg); systolic blood pressure (-4% from 131.7{+/-}0.9 mmHg); diastolic blood pressure (-4% from 81.8{+/-}0.5 mmHg); triglycerides (-22% from 197.2{+/-}9.1 mg/dL); HDL-C (+19% from 41.8{+/-}0.9 mg/dL), and liver alanine transaminase (-21% from 29.16{+/-}0.97 U/L). Spine bone mineral density in the CCI group was unchanged. Glycemic control medication use (excluding metformin) among CCI participants declined (from 56.9% to 26.8%, P=1.3x10-11) including prescribed insulin (-62%) and sulfonylureas (-100%). The UC group had no significant changes in these parameters (except uric acid and anion gap) or diabetes medication use.

    "abstract": "The default mode network is a large-scale brain network that is active during rest and internally focused states and deactivates as well as desynchronizes during externally oriented (top-down) attention demanding cognitive tasks. However, it is not sufficiently understood if unpredicted salient stimuli, able to trigger bottom-up attentional processes, could also result in similar reduction of activity and functional connectivity in the DMN. In this study, we investigated whether bottom-up sensory processing could influence the default mode like network (DMLN) in rats. DMLN activity was examined using block-design visual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while its synchronization was investigated by comparing functional connectivity during a resting versus a continuously stimulated brain state by unpredicted light flashes. We demonstrated that activity in DMLN regions was decreased during visual stimulus blocks and increased during blanks. Furthermore, decreased inter-network functional connectivity between the DMLN and visual networks as well as decreased intra-network functional connectivity within the DMLN was observed during the continuous visual stimulation. These results suggest that triggering of bottom-up attention mechanisms in anesthetized rats can lead to a cascade similar to top-down orienting of attention in humans and is able to deactivate and desynchronize the DMLN.",

Measuring biomarkers with research-use ELISA kits is universal, yet lack of kit standardization and unexpected lot-to-lot variability presents analytic challenges for long-term projects. During an ongoing two-year project measuring plasma biomarkers in cancer patients, control concentrations for one biomarker (PF) decreased significantly after changes in ELISA kit lots. A comprehensive operations review pointed to standard curve shifts with the new kits, an analytic variable that jeopardized data already collected on hundreds of patient samples. After excluding other reasonable contributors to data variability, a computational solution was developed to provide a uniform platform for data analysis across multiple ELISA kit lots. The solution (ELISAtools) was developed within open-access R software in which variability between kits is treated as a batch effect. A defined best-fit Reference standard curve is modelled, a unique Shift factor \\\"S\\\" is calculated for every standard curve and data adjusted accordingly. The averaged S factors for PF ELISA kit lots #1-5 ranged from -0.086 to 0.735, and reduced control inter-assay variability from 62.4% to <9%, within quality control limits. S factors calculated for four other biomarkers provided a quantitative metric to monitor ELISAs over the 10 month study period for quality control purposes. Reproducible biomarker measurements are essential, particularly for long-term projects with valuable patient samples. Use of research-use ELISA kits is ubiquitous and judicious use of this computational solution maximizes biomarker reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "In spite of glyphosates wide use in agriculture, questions remain about effects of the herbicide on soil microbial communities. Conflicting scientific literature reports divergent results; from no observable effect of glyphosate to the enrichment of common agricultural pathogens such as Fusarium. We conducted a comprehensive field-based study to compare treatments that did and did not receive foliar application of glyphosate spray. The study included two field sites, Maryland and Mississippi; two crops, soybean and corn; four site years, 2013 and 2014; and a variety of organic and conventional farming systems. Using amplicon sequencing, the prokaryotic (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS) communities were described along with chemical and physical properties of the soil. Sections of corn and soy roots were plated to screen for the presence of plant pathogens. Geography, farming system, and seasonal progression were significant factors determining composition of fungal and bacterial communities. Plots treated with or without glyphosate did not differ in overall microbial community composition after controlling for these factors. No differential effect of glyphosate treatment was found in the relative abundance of organisms such as Fusarium spp. or putative growth-promoting bacteria Pseudomonas spp.",

    "abstract": "Global assessments have highlighted land-use change as a key driver of biodiversity change. However, we lack real-world global-scale estimates of how habitat transformations such as forest loss and gain are reshaping biodiversity over time. Here, we quantify the influence of 150 years of forest cover change on populations and ecological assemblages worldwide and across taxa by analyzing change in 6,667 time series. We found that forest loss simultaneously intensified ongoing increases and decreases in abundance, species richness and temporal species replacement (turnover) by up to 48%. Temporal lags in these responses extended up to 50 years and increased with species generation time. Our findings demonstrate that land-use change precipitates divergent population and biodiversity change, highlighting the complex biotic consequences of deforestation and afforestation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryDeclines in forest cover amplify both gains and losses in population abundance and biodiversity over time.",

    "abstract": "Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS; OMIM: #260400) is caused by variants in SBDS (Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome gene), which encodes a protein that plays an important role in ribosome assembly. Recent reports suggest that recessive variants in EFL1 are also responsible for SDS. However, the precise genetic mechanism that leads to EFL1-induced SDS remains incompletely understood. Here we present three unrelated Korean SDS patients that carry biallelic pathogenic variants in EFL1 with biased allele frequencies, resulting from a bone marrow-specific somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) in chromosome 15. The recombination events generated cells that were homozygous for the relatively milder variant, allowing for the evasion of catastrophic physiological consequences. Still, the milder EFL1 variant was solely able to impair 80S ribosome assembly and induce SDS features in cell line, zebrafish, and mouse models. The loss of EFL1 resulted in a pronounced inhibition of terminal oligo-pyrimidine element-containing ribosomal protein transcript 80S assembly. Therefore, we propose a more accurate pathogenesis mechanism of EFL1 dysfunction that eventually leads to aberrant translational control and ribosomopathy.",

    "abstract": "In less than a decade since its identification in 2009, the emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris has become a major public health threat due to its multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, high transmissibility, and high mortality. Unlike any other Candida species, C. auris has acquired high levels of resistance to an already limited arsenal of antifungals. As an emerging pathogen, there are currently a limited number of documented murine models of C. auris infection. These animal models use inoculums as high as 107-108 cells per mouse, and the environmental and occupational exposure of working with these models has not been clearly defined. Using real-time quantitative PCR and culture, we monitored the animal holding room as well as the procedure room for up to six months while working with an intravenous model of C. auris infection. This study determined that shedding of the organism is dose-dependent, as detectable levels of C. auris were detected in the cage bedding when mice were infected with 107 and 108 cells, but not with doses of 105 and 106 cells. Autoclaving bedding in closed micro-isolator cages was found to be an effective way to minimize exposure to animal caretakers. We found that tissue necropsies of infected mice were also an important source of potential source exposure to C. auris. To mitigate these potential exposures, we implemented a rigorous \\\"buddy system\\\" workflow and a disinfection protocol that uses 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol and can be used in any animal facility when using small animal models of C. auris infection.",

    "abstract": "Podospora anserina is a model ascomycetous fungus which shows pronounced phenotypic senescence when grown on solid medium but possesses unlimited lifespan under submerged cultivation. In order to study the genetic aspects of adaptation of P. anserina to submerged cultivation, we initiated a long-term evolution experiment. In the course of the first four years of the experiment, 125 single-nucleotide substitutions and 23 short indels were fixed in eight independently evolving populations. Six proteins that affect fungal growth and development evolved in more than one population; in particular, the G-protein alpha subunit FadA evolved in seven out of eight experimental populations. Parallel evolution at the level of genes and pathways, an excess of nonsense and missense substitutions, and an elevated conservation of proteins and their sites where the changes occurred suggest that many of the observed allele replacements were adaptive and driven by positive selection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLiving beings adapt to novel conditions that are far from their original environments in different ways. Studying mechanisms of adaptation is crucial for our understanding of evolution. The object of our interest is a multicellular fungus Podospora anserina. This fungus is known for its pronounced senescence and a definite lifespan, but it demonstrates an unlimited lifespan and no signs of senescence when grown under submerged conditions. Soon after transition to submerged cultivation, the rate of growth of P. anserina increases and its pigmentation changes. We wanted to find out whether there are any genetic changes that contribute to adaptation of P. anserina to these novel conditions and initiated a long-term evolutionary experiment on eight independent populations. Over the first four years of the experiment, 148 mutations were fixed in these populations. Many of these mutations lead to inactivation of the part of the developmental pathway in P. anserina, probably reallocating resources to vegetative proliferation in liquid medium. Our observations imply that strong positive selection drives changes in at least some of the affected protein-coding genes.\\n\\nData AvailabilityGenome sequence data have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accessions QHKV00000000 (founder genotype A; version QHKV01000000) and QHKU00000000 (founder genotype B; version QHKU01000000), with the respective BioSample accessions SAMN09270751 and SAMN09270757, under BioProject PRJNA473312.

    "abstract": "Production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, in the gut microbiome is required for optimal health but is frequently limited by the lack of fermentable fiber in the diet. We attempted to increase butyrate production by supplementing the diets of 174 healthy young adults for two weeks with resistant starch from potatoes (RPS), resistant starch from maize (RMS), inulin from chicory root, or an accessible corn starch control. RPS resulted in the greatest increase in total SCFAs, including butyrate. Although the majority of microbiomes responded to RPS with increases in the relative abundance of bifidobacteria, those that responded with an increase in Ruminococcus bromii or Clostridium chartatabidum were more likely to yield higher butyrate concentrations, especially when their microbiota were replete with populations of the butyrate-producing species Eubacterium rectale. RMS and inulin induced different changes in fecal communities, but they did not generate significant increases in fecal butyrate levels.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThese results reveal that not all fermentable fibers are equally capable of stimulating SCFA production, and they highlight the importance of the composition of an individuals microbiota in determining whether or not they respond to a specific dietary supplement. In particular, R. bromii or C. chartatabidum may be required for enhanced butyrate production in response to RS. Bifidobacteria, though proficient at degrading RS and inulin, may not contribute to the butyrogenic effect of those fermentable fibers in the short term.",

    "abstract": "The normal embryogenesis of marine animals is typically confined to a species-specific range of temperatures. Within that temperature range development results in a consistent, or canalized, phenotype, whereas above and below the range abnormal phenotypes are produced. This study reveals an abrupt high temperature limit, occurring over a 1-2{degrees}C range, for normal embryonic development in C. intestinalis. Above that threshold morphological abnormalities in the notochord and other organs are observed, beginning with cleavage and gastrula stages, and becoming more pronounced as embryogenesis proceeds. However, even in highly morphologically abnormal temperature disrupted (TD) embryos, cell type specification, including muscle, endoderm, notochord, and sensory pigment cells is accomplished. An explanation for this finding is that in C. intestinalis cell type specification occurs relatively early in embryogenesis, due to cleavage stage segregation of maternal cytoplasmic determinants and short-range cell interactions, which are largely intact in TD embryos. On the other hand, morphogenesis of the notochord and other structures is dependent on precise cell movement and shape changes after the gastrula stage, which appear to be disrupted above the high temperature threshold. These findings have implications for the relationship between ecology and reproduction in C. intestinalis. More broadly they point to mechanisms behind canalization in animals, such as ascidians, characterized by early, largely autonomous, cell type specification.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis is a shape-building process during development of multicellular organisms. During this process the establishment and modulation of cell-cell contacts play an important role. Cadherins, the major cell adhesion molecules, form adherens junctions connecting ephithelial cells. Numerous studies in Bilateria have shown that cadherins are associated with the regulation of cell differentiation, cell shape changes, cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. To date, the role of Cadherins in non-bilaterians is unknown. Here, we study the expression and the function of two paralogous classical cadherins, cadherin1 and cadherin3, in the diploblastic animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We show that a cadherin switch is accompanying the formation of germ layers. Using specific antibodies, we show that both cadherins are localized to adherens junctions at apical and basal positions in ectoderm and endoderm. During gastrulation, partial EMT of endodermal cells is marked by a step-wise downregulation of cadherin3 and upregulation of cadherin1. Knockdown experiments show that both cadherins are required for maintenance of tissue integrity and tissue morphogenesis. This demonstrates that cnidarians convergently use cadherins to differentially control morphogenetic events during development.",

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major energy regulator that suppresses tumor growth, and 1-(3-chloro-4-((trifluoromethyl)thio)phenyl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)urea (FND-4b) is a novel AMPK activator that inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in colon cancer. The purpose of this project was to test the effects of FND-4b on AMPK activation, proliferation, and apoptosis in breast cancer with a particular emphasis on TNBC.\\n\\nMaterials and methods(i) Estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer (ER+BC; MCF-7, and T-47D), TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and HCC-1806), and breast cancer stem cells were treated with FND-4b for 24h. Immunoblot analysis assessed AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), ribosomal protein S6, cyclin D1, and cleaved PARP. (ii) Sulforhodamine B growth assays were performed after treating ER+BC and TNBC cells with FND-4b for 72h. Proliferation was also assessed by counting cells after 72h of FND-4b treatment. (iii) Cell death ELISA assays were performed after treating ER+BC and TNBC cells with FND-4b for 72h.\\n\\nResults(i) FND-4b increased AMPK activation with concomitant decreases in ACC activity, phosphorylated S6, and cyclin D1 in all subtypes. (ii) FND-4b decreased proliferation in all cells, while dose-dependent growth decreases were found in ER+BC and TNBC. (iii) Increases in apoptosis were observed in ER+BC and the MDA-MB-231 cell line with FND-4b treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that FND-4b decreases proliferation for a variety of breast cancers by activating AMPK and has notable effects on TNBC. The growth reductions were mediated through decreases in fatty acid synthesis (ACC), mTOR signaling (S6), and cell cycle flux (cyclin D1). ER+BC cells were more susceptible to FND-4b-induced apoptosis, but MDA-MB-231 cells still underwent apoptosis with higher dose treatment. Further development of FND compounds could result in a novel therapeutic for TNBC.",

Clock genes harmonize circadian rhythms by their periodic expression and regulate several physiological functions. However, the association between clock genes and GERD is still unknown. We investigated whether reflux esophagitis affects circadian variability of clock genes in the esophagus and other organs using a rat reflux esophagitis model.\\n\\nMethodsReflux esophagitis was induced in 7-week-old male Wistar rats. Sham-operated rats were used as controls. Rats were sacrificed at 09:00 (light period) and 21:00 (dark period) 3 days (acute phase) and 21 days (chronic phase) after induction of esophagitis. The expression levels of clock gene mRNAs such as Per1, Per2, Per3, Cryl, Cry2, Arntl, and Clock in the esophagus were investigated by qPCR. Arntl expression was examined in stomach, small intestine, colon, and liver tissues. Serum melatonin and IL-6 levels were measured by ELISA.\\n\\nResultsHistological examination of reflux esophagitis mainly revealed epithelial defects with marked inflammatory cell infiltration in the acute phase, and mucosal thickening with basal cell hyperplasia in the chronic phase. Circadian variability of clock genes, except Cry1, was present in the normal esophagus, and was completely disrupted in reflux esophagitis during the acute phase. The circadian variability of Per2, Per3, and Arntl returned to normal, but disruption of Per1, Cry2, and Clock was present in the chronic phase. Disruption of circadian variability of Arntl was observed in the esophagus, as well as in the stomach, small intestine, and liver tissues in reflux esophagitis during the acute phase. There were no significant differences in serum melatonin and IL-6 levels between control and reflux esophagitis animals in both acute and chronic phases.\\n\\nConclusionDisruption to circadian variability of clock genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of GERD.",

    "abstract": "Elite soccer teams that participate in European competitions often have a difficult schedule, involving weeks in which they play up to three matches, which leads to acute and transient subjective, biochemical, metabolic and physical disturbances in players over the subsequent hours and days. Inadequate time recovery between matches can expose players to the risk of training and competing whilst not fully recovered. Controlling the level of effort and fatigue of players to reach higher performances during the matches is therefore critical. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to provide the first report of seasonal internal and external training load (TL) that included Hooper Index (HI) scores in elite soccer players during an in-season period. Sixteen elite soccer players were sampled, using global position system, session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and HI scores during the daily training sessions throughout the 2015-2016 in-season period. Data were analysed across ten mesocycles (M: 1 to 10) and collected according to the number of days prior to a match. Total daily distance covered was higher at the start (M1 and M3) compared to the final mesocycle (M10) of the season. M1 (5589m) reached a greater distance than M5 (4473m) (ES = 9.33 [12.70, 5.95]) and M10 (4545m) (ES = 9.84 [13.39, 6.29]). M3 (5691m) reached a greater distance than M5 (ES = 9.07 [12.36, 5.78]), M7 (ES = 6.13 [8.48, 3.79]) and M10 (ES = 9.37 [12.76, 5.98]). High-speed running distance was greater in M1 (227m), than M5 (92m) (ES = 27.95 [37.68, 18.22]) and M10 (138m) (ES = 8.46 [11.55, 5.37]). Interestingly, the s-RPE response was higher in M1 (331au) in comparison to the last mesocycle (M10, 239au). HI showed minor variations across mesocycles and in days prior to the match. Every day prior to a match, all internal and external TL variables expressed significant lower values to other days prior to a match (p<0.01). In general, there were no differences between player positions.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results reveal that despite the existence of some significant differences between mesocycles, there were minor changes across the in-season period for the internal and external TL variables used. Furthermore, it was observed that MD-1 presented a reduction of external TL (regardless of mesocycle) while internal TL variables did not have the same record during in-season match-day-minus.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem simulation models are valuable tools for strengthening and promoting ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). However, utility of these models in practical fisheries management is often undermined by lack of simple means to test the effect of uncertainty on model outputs. Recently, the use of multiple ecosystem models has been recommended as an  insurance against effects of uncertainty that comes with modelling complex systems. The assumption is that if models with different structure and formulation give consistent results, then, policy prescriptions are robust (i.e. less sensitive to model choice). However, information on the behaviour of trends from structurally-distinct ecosystem models with respect to changes in fishing conditions is limited, especially for freshwater systems. In this study, we compared outputs of two ecosystem models, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) and Atlantis, for Lake Victoria under different fishing pressure scenarios. We compared model behaviour at the ecosystem level, and also at a level of functional groups. At functional group level, we determined two questions: what is the change in the targeted group, and what are the consequent effects in other parts of the system? Overall results suggest that different model formulations can provide similar qualitative predictions (direction of change), especially for targeted groups with similar trophic interactions and adequate data for parameterization and calibration. However, considerable variations in predictions (where models predict opposite trends) may also occur due to inconsistencies in the strength of the aggregate multispecies interactions between species and models, and not necessarily due to model detail and complexity. Therefore, with more information and data, especially on diet, and comparable representation of feeding interactions across models, ecosystem models with distinct structure and formulation can give consistent policy evaluations for most biological groups.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater habitats of the Neotropics exhibit a gradient from relatively neutral, ion-rich whitewater to acidic, ion-poor blackwater. Closely related species often show complementary distributions among ionic habitats, suggesting that adaptation to divergent osmoregulatory environments may be an important driver of Neotropical fish diversity. However, little is known about the evolutionary tradeoffs involved in ionoregulation across distinct freshwater environments. Here, we surveyed gill mRNA expression of Cichla ocellaris var. monoculus, a Neotropical cichlid, to examine cellular and physiological responses to experimental conditions mimicking whitewater and blackwater.\\n\\nGene ontology enrichment of expressed genes indicated that the gills were remodeled during both forms of environmental challenge, with changes biased towards the cellular membrane. We observed expression of signaling pathways from both the acute and extended response phases, including evidence that growth hormone (GH) may mediate osmoregulation in whitewater through paracrine expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), but not through the GH receptor, which instead showed correlated up-regulation with the prolactin receptor and insulin-like growth factor II in blackwater.\\n\\nDifferential expression of genes related to paracellular tight junctions and transcellular ion transport showed responses similar to euryhaline fishes in fresh versus seawater, with some exceptions, suggesting that relaxed ion retention via the gills, possibly mediated by the GH/IGF-I axis, is a strong candidate for evolutionary modification in whitewater and blackwater endemic populations. In each osmoregulatory domain, we saw examples of contrasting differential expression of paralogs of genes that are single copy in most terrestrial vertebrates, indicating that adaption by fishes to diverse physicochemcial environments has capitalized on diversification of osmoregulatory gene families.",

    "abstract": "Intensive use of pesticides applied simultaneously in field to improve the effectiveness of pest control increase the environmental contamination, affecting the soil and water quality. Some of the commonly used pesticides are the insecticide chlorpyrifos and the fungicide iprodione; being thus critically essential to develop bioremediation methods to remove these contaminants by tolerant-bacteria. In this study we selected and characterized different pesticides-tolerant bacteria isolated from a biomixture of a biopurification system that had received continuous applications of a mixture of the pesticides chlorpyrifos and iprodione. Out of the 10 isolated bacterial colonies, only six strains presented adequate growth in presence of the both pesticides at 100 mg L-1. Biochemical and enzymatic characterization using API ZYM showed that all isolates (100%) were positive for esterase, leucine aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase, and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase. According to the molecular level study of the 16S ribosomal gene and MALDI TOF/TOF MS, it was possible to determine that the isolated bacteria belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Achromobacter. Bacterial growth decreased proportionally (R2 > 0.96) as been as both pesticide concentrations increased from 10 to 100 mg L-1. Achromobacter sp. strain C1 showed the best chlorpyrifos removal (between 56-29%) after 120 h of incubation. On the other hand, the highest iprodione removal (between 91.2-98.9%) was observed for the Pseudomonas sp. strain C9, which was not detected after 48 h of incubation. According with their identification and ability to remove the contaminants, Achromobacter sp. strain C1 and Pseudomonas sp. strain C9 appear as promising microorganisms for their use in the treatment of matrices contaminated with chlorpyrifos, iprodione or their mixture. The results of this study will help to improve current technologies for the biodegradation of this commonly used insecticide and fungicide, in order to give a response to the problem of contamination by pesticides.",

The association of some M. bovis strains with hyper-virulence, MDR-TB and disseminated disease makes it imperative to understand the biology of the pathogen.\\n\\nMethodsMycobacterium bovis (15) among 1755 M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolated between 2012 and 2014 were characterized and analyzed for associated patient demography and other risk factors. Five of the M. bovis were whole-genome sequenced and comparatively analyzed against a global collection of published M. bovis genomes.\\n\\nResultsMycobacterium bovis was isolated from 3/560(0.5%) females and 12/1195(1.0%) males with pulmonary TB. The average age of M. bovis infected cases was 46.8 years (7-72years). TB patients from the Northern region of Ghana (1.9%;4/212) had a higher rate of infection with M. bovis (OR=2.7,p=0.0968) compared to those from the Greater Accra region (0.7%;11/1543). Among TB patients with available HIV status, the odds of isolating M. bovis from HIV patients (2/119) was 3.3 higher relative to non-HIV patients (4/774). Direct contact with livestock or their unpasteurized products was significantly associated with bTB (p<0.0001,OR=124.4,95% CI=30.1-508.3). Two (13.3%) of the M. bovis isolates were INH resistant due to the S315T mutation in katG whereas one (6.7%) was RIF resistant with Q432P and I1491S mutations in rpoB. M. bovis from Ghana resolved as mono-phyletic branch among mostly M. bovis from Africa irrespective of the host and were closest to the root of the global M. bovis phylogeny. M. bovis-specific amino acid mutations were detected among MTBC core genes such as mce1A, mmpL1, pks6, phoT, pstB, glgP and Rv2955c. Additional mutations P6T in chaA, G187E in mgtC, T35A in Rv1979c, S387A in narK1, L400F in fas and A563T in eccA1 were restricted to the 5 clinical M. bovis from Ghana.\\n\\nConclusionOur data indicate potential zoonotic transmission of bTB in Ghana and hence calls for intensified public education on bTB, especially among risk groups.",

Genomic selection is a method to predict phenotypes (i.e., traits) such as yield and drought resistance in crops from high-density markers positioned throughout the genome of the varieties. In this paper, we employ employ sparse Bayesian learning as a technique for genomic selection and ranking markers based on their relevance to a trait, which can aid in genome-wide association studies. We define and explore two different forms of the sparse Bayesian learning for predicting phenotypes and identifying the most influential markers of a trait, respectively. In particular, we introduce a new framework based on sparse Bayesian and ensemble learning for ranking influential markers of a trait. Then, we apply our methods on a real-world Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset, and analyse our results with respect to existing related works, trait heritability, as well as the accuracies obtained from the use of different kernel functions including linear, Gaussian, and string kernels. We find that sparse Bayesian methods are not only as good as other machine learning methods in predicting yeast growth in different environments, but are also capable of identifying the most important markers, including both positive and negative effects on the growth, from which biologists can get insight. This attribute can make our proposed ensemble of sparse Bayesian learners favourable in ranking markers based on their relevance to a trait.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated by the evolutionarily conserved SPO11 complex in the context of chromatin loops that are organized along axial elements (AEs) of chromosomes. However, how DSBs are formed with respect to chromosome axes and the SPO11 complex remains unclear in plants. Here, we confirm that DSB and bivalent formation are defective in maize spo11-1 mutants. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrates dynamic localization of SPO11-1 during recombination initiation, with variable numbers of SPO11-1 foci being distributed in nuclei but similar numbers of SPO11-1 foci being found on AEs. Notably, cytological analysis of spo11-1 meiocytes revealed an aberrant AE structure. At leptotene, AEs of wild-type and spo11-1 meiocytes were similarly curly and discontinuous. However, during early zygotene, wild-type AEs become uniform and exhibit shortened axes, whereas the elongated and curly AEs persisted in spo11-1 mutants, suggesting that loss of SPO11-1 compromised AE structural maturation. Our results reveal an interesting relationship between SPO11-1 loading onto AEs and the conformational remodeling of AEs during recombination initiation.\n\nAuthor SummaryMeiosis is essential during sexual reproduction to produce haploid gametes. Recombination is the most crucial step during meiotic prophase I. It enables pairing of homologous chromosomes prior to their reductional division and generates new combinations of genetic alleles for transmission to the next generation. Meiotic recombination is initiated by generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via SPO11, a topoisomerase-related enzyme. The activity, timing and location of this DSB machinery must be controlled precisely, but how this is achieved remains obscure. Here, we show dynamic localization of SPO11-1 on chromatin during meiotic initiation in maize, yet a similar number of SPO11-1 is able to load onto axial elements (AEs), which accompanies a structural change of the AEs of wild-type meiotic chromosomes. Interestingly, loss of SPO11-1 not only affects DSB formation but also impairs structural alterations of AEs, resulting in abnormally long and curly AEs during early meiosis. Our study provides new insights into SPO11-1 localization during recombination initiation and suggests an intimate relationship between DSB formation and AE structural changes.",

    "abstract": "HighlightsO_LIMitochondrial monophyly is commonly employed to define evolutionary significant units.\\nC_LIO_LIMonophyly may be caused by insufficient sampling or a recent common ancestor.\\nC_LIO_LIMitogenomic studies are generally based on few samples and prone to sampling issues.\\nC_LIO_LIExpanded mitogenome sampling negates previous monophyly in fin whales.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbstractThe advent of massive parallel sequencing technologies has resulted in an increase of studies based upon complete mitochondrial genome DNA sequences that revisit the taxonomic status within and among species. Spatially distinct monophyly in mitogenomic genealogies, i.e., the sharing of a recent common ancestor among con-specific samples collected in the same region has been viewed as evidence for subspecies. Several recent studies in cetaceans have employed this criterion to suggest subsequent intraspecific taxonomic revisions. We reason that employing intra-specific, spatially distinct monophyly at non-recombining, clonally inherited genomes is an unsatisfactory criterion for defining subspecies based upon theoretical (genetic drift) and practical (sampling effort) arguments. This point is illustrated by a re-analysis of a global mitogenomic assessment of fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus spp., published by Archer et al. (2013) which proposed to further subdivide the Northern Hemisphere fin whale subspecies, B. p. physalus. The proposed revision was based upon the detection of spatially distinct monophyly among North Atlantic and North Pacific fin whales in a genealogy based upon complete mitochondrial genome DNA sequences. The extended analysis conducted in this study (1,676 mitochondrial control region, 162 complete mitochondrial genome DNA sequences and 20 microsatellite loci genotyped in 358 samples) revealed that the apparent monophyly among North Atlantic fin whales reported by Archer et al. (2013) to be due to low sample sizes. In conclusion, defining sub-species from monophyly (i.e., the absence of para-or polyphyly) can lead to erroneous conclusions due to relatively \\\"trivial\\\" aspects, such as sampling. Basic population genetic processes (i.e., genetic drift and migration) also affect the time to most recent common ancestor and hence the probability that individuals in a sample are monophyletic.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=195 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/488130v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e38e54org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9533eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@183b5b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eae09_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Since the dawn of agriculture, crop yield has always been impaired through abiotic stresses. In a field trial across five locations worldwide, we tested three abiotic stresses, nitrogen deficiency, drought and salinity, using HEB-YIELD, a selected subset of the wild barley nested association mapping population HEB-25. We show that barley flowering time genes Ppd-H1, Sdw1, Vrn-H1 and Vrn-H3 exert pleiotropic effects on plant development and grain yield. Under field conditions, these effects are strongly influenced by environmental cues like day length and temperature. For example, in Al-Karak, Jordan, the day length-sensitive wild barley allele of Ppd-H1 was associated with an increase of grain yield by up to 30% compared to the insensitive elite barley allele. The observed yield increase is accompanied by pleiotropic effects of Ppd-H1 resulting in shorter life cycle, extended grain filling period and increased grain size. Our study indicates that the adequate timing of plant development is crucial to maximize yield formation under harsh environmental conditions. We provide evidence that wild barley germplasm, introgressed into elite barley cultivars, can be utilized to improve grain yield. The presented knowledge may be transferred to related crop species like wheat and rice securing the rising global food demand for cereals.",

Certain isolated rhizobacteria displayed antifungal activity against the tested pathogens and affected growth of Arabidopsis, and Bacilli members possessed several enzymatic activities. Subsequently, we designed two SynComs with different composition and tested their effect on Arabidopsis and tomato growth and health. SynCom1, consisting of different bacterial genera, displayed negative effect on Arabidopsis in vitro, but promoted tomato growth in pots. SynCom2, consisting of Bacilli, didnt affect Arabidopsis growth, enhanced tomato growth and suppressed Fusarium wilt symptoms. Overall, we found selection of compost-derived microbes with beneficial properties in the rhizosphere of tomato plants, and observed that application of SynComs on poor substrates can yield reproducible plant phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived secondary metabolites play a vital role in the food, pharmaceutical, agrochemical and cosmetic industry. Metabolite concentrations are measured after extraction, biochemistry and analyses, requiring time, access to expensive equipment, reagents and specialized skills. Additionally, metabolite concentration often varies widely among plants, even within a small area. A quick method to estimate the metabolite concentration class (high or low) will significantly help in selecting trees yielding high metabolites for the metabolite production process. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning approach to estimate the concentration class of an intracellular metabolite, azadirachtin, using models built with images of leaves and fruits collected from randomly selected Azadirachta indica (neem) trees in an area spanning >500,000 sqkms and their corresponding biochemically measured metabolite concentrations. We divided the input data randomly into training- and test-sets ten times to avoid sampling bias and to optimize the model parameters during cross-validation. The training-set contained >83,000 fruit and >86,000 leaf images. The best models yielded prediction errors of 19.13% and 15.11% (for fruit), and 8% and 26.67% (for leaf), each, for low and high metabolite classes, respectively. We further validated the fruit model using independently collected fruit images from different locations spanning nearly 130,000 sqkms, with 70% accuracy. We developed a desktop application to scan offline image(s) and a mobile application for real-time utility to predict the metabolite content class. Our work demonstrates the use of a deep learning method to estimate the concentration class of an intracellular metabolite using images, and has broad applications and utility.",

    "abstract": "Plants retain the ability to produce organs throughout their life by maintaining active stem cell niches called meristems. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is responsible for the growth of aerial plant structures. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the SAM initially produces leaves during the vegetative phase and later flowers during reproductive development. In the early stages of floral initiation, a group of cells first emerges from the SAM to form a stereotypically organized meristematic structure on its flank. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of this specific meristematic organization remain elusive. We show here that the transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and REVOLUTA (REV) control two partially redundant pathways controlling meristematic organization in early flower primordia. We found that LFY acts through the transcription factor REGULATOR OF AXILLARY MERISTEM1 (RAX1) and we provide mechanistic insights in how RAX1 allows meristem identity establishment in young flowers. Our work provides a molecular link between the processes of meristem formation and floral identity acquisition in the nascent flower.",

    "abstract": "The broad host range necrotrophic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating pathogen of many oil and vegetable crops. Plant genes conferring complete resistance against S. sclerotiorum have not been reported. Instead, plant populations challenged by S. sclerotiorum exhibit a continuum of partial resistance designated as quantitative disease resistance (QDR). Because of their complex interplay and their small phenotypic effect, the functional characterization of QDR genes remains limited. How broad host range necrotrophic fungi manipulate plant programmed cell death is for instance largely unknown. Here, we designed a time-resolved automated disease phenotyping pipeline and assessed the kinetics of disease symptoms caused by seven S. sclerotiorum isolates on six A. thaliana natural accessions with unprecedented resolution. We hypothesized that large effect polymorphisms common to the most resistant A. thaliana accessions, but absent from the most susceptible ones, would point towards disease susceptibility genes. This identified highly divergent alleles of the nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat gene LAZ5 in the resistant accessions Rubenzhnoe and Lip-0. Two LAZ5-deficient mutant lines in the Col-0 genetic background showed enhanced QDR to S. sclerotiorum, whereas plants mutated in the closely related CSA1 gene responded like the wild type. These findings illustrate the value of time-resolved image-based phenotyping for unravelling the genetic bases of complex traits such as QDR. Our results suggest that S. sclerotiorum manipulates plant sphingolipid pathways guarded by LAZ5 to trigger programmed cell death and cause disease.",

    "abstract": "Drugs of abuse are known to alter activity in areas of brain associated with reward, cognition and decision making. Changes in neural activity in these regions that follow repeated exposures to abused substances may underlie the development of addictive behaviors and contribute to the high rates of relapse associated with drug use. Measuring real-time changes in neural activity during drug seeking and taking is important for correlating changes in behavior with alterations in neuronal signaling typically measured using ex vivo electrophysiological recordings. In this study, C57BL/6J mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in different brain areas with adeno-associated viruses (AAV) encoding the calcium sensor GCaMP6f along with an optical fiber. Calcium-dependent fluorescence was monitored in the nucleus accumbens core or mPFC during and following exposure to toluene vapor and in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during ethanol drinking. Toluene vapor, at concentrations previously shown to induce conditioned place preference, produced a rapid decrease in the frequency of calcium transients in the NAc core of rats that recovered following washout of the toluene vapor. In a probabilistic risk task, GCaMP6 signals in rat mPFC increased just prior to lever pressing and showed decreases during the reward phase that were proportional to reward size. Toluene pretreatment elevated the signal during the decision-making period while post-lever responses were independent of reward size. Using the drinking in the dark (DID) protocol in mice, we observed a consistent increase in GCaMP6 fluorescence during the period leading up to an ethanol drinking bout, a decrease during consumption and a rebound increase following the bout. The initial increase in signal prior to consumption was greater for ethanol and sucrose than water. GCaMP6 signals in the lateral OFC also decreased during ethanol consumption and increased following bout completion while no increase in activity was noted prior to bout initiation. Following repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure that enhanced ethanol consumption, OFC calcium signals during and after ethanol drinking were similar to those in air-treated animals. Addition of quinine to the ethanol solution augmented the decrease in signal during consumption in both air and CIE mice while having no effect on the magnitude of the rebound in activity. Conversely, when sucrose was added to the ethanol solution, air exposed mice showed blunted changes in GCaMP6 signals while those in CIE mice were enhanced. Overall, the results from these experiments complement and extend data from prior behavioral and electrophysiological studies and support the use of in vivo fiber photometry in the study of effects of abused substances on brain function.",

However, culture representatives of AAPs from phyllosphere and their genome information are lacking, limiting our capability to assess their potential ecological roles in this unique niche. In this study, we investigated the presence of AAPs in the phyllosphere of a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Denmark by employing bacterial colony based infrared imaging and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. A total of ~4480 colonies were screened for the presence of cellular BChl a, resulting in 129 AAP isolates that were further clustered into 25 groups based on MALDI-TOF MS profiling, representatives of which were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms. Twenty draft and five complete genomes of AAPs were assembled belonging in Methylobacterium, Rhizobium, Roseomonas and a novel strain in Methylocystaceae.

The FERM domain of PTPN21 stimulates dense core vesicle transport in primary hippocampal neurons and rescues integrin trafficking in KIF1C-depleted cells. In vitro, human full-length KIF1C is a processive, plus-end directed motor. Its landing rate onto microtubules increases in the presence of either PTPN21 FERM domain or the cargo adapter Hook3 that binds the same region of KIF1C tail. This autoinhibition release mechanism allows cargo-activated transport and might enable motors to participate in bidirectional cargo transport without undertaking a tug-of-war.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment (GSE) testing enhances the biological interpretation of ChIP-seq data and other large sets of genomic regions. Our group has previously introduced two GSE methods for genomic regions: ChIP-Enrich for narrow regions and Broad-Enrich for broad genomic regions, such as histone modifications. Here, we introduce new methods and extensions that more appropriately analyze sets of genomic regions with vastly different properties. First, we introduce Poly-Enrich, which models the number of peaks assigned to a gene using a generalized additive model with a negative binomial family to determine gene set enrichment, while adjusting for gene locus length (#bps associated with each gene). This is the first method that controls for locus length while accounting for the number of peaks per gene and variability among genes. We also introduce a flexible weighting approach to incorporate region scores, a hybrid enrichment approach, and support for new gene set databases and reference genomes/species.\n\nAs opposed to ChIP-Enrich, Poly-Enrich works well even when nearly all genes have a peak. To illustrate this, we used Poly-Enrich to characterize the pathways and types of genic regions (introns, promoters, etc) enriched with different families of repetitive elements. By comparing ChIP-Enrich and Poly-Enrich results from ENCODE ChIP-seq data, we found that the optimal test depends more on the pathway being regulated than on the transcription factor or other properties of the dataset. Using known transcription factor functions, we discovered clusters of related biological processes consistently better modeled with either the binary score method (ChIP-Enrich) or count based method (Poly-Enrich). This suggests that the regulation of certain processes is more often modified by multiple binding events (count-based), while others tend to require only one (binary). Our new hybrid method handles this by automatically choosing the optimal method, with correct FDR-adjustment.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough every cell in our body contains the same DNA, our cells perform vastly different functions due to differences in how our genes are regulated. Certain regions of the genome are bound by DNA binding proteins (transcription factors), which regulate the expression of nearby genes. After an experiment to identify a large set of these regions, we can then model the association of these regions with various cellular pathways and biological processes. This analysis helps understand the overall biological effect that the binding events have on the cells. For example, if genes relating to apoptosis tend to have the transcription factor, Bcl-2, bind more often nearby, then Bcl-2 is likely to have a vital role in regulating apoptosis. The specifics of how to best perform this analysis is still being researched and depends on properties of the set of genomic regions. Here, we introduce a new, more flexible method that counts the number of occurrences per gene and models that in a sophisticated statistical test, and compare it to a previous method. We show that the optimal method depends on multiple factors, and the new method, Poly-Enrich, allows interesting findings in scenarios where the previous method failed.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose iProFun, an integrative analysis tool to screen for Proteogenomic Functional traits perturbed by DNA copy number alterations (CNA) and DNA methylations. The goal is to characterize functional consequences of DNA copy number and methylation alterations in tumors and to facilitate screening for cancer drivers contributing to tumor initiation and progression. Specifically, we consider three functional molecular quantitative traits: mRNA expression levels, global protein abundances, and phosphoprotein abundances. We aim to identify those genes whose CNAs and/or DNA methylations have cis-associations with either some or all three types of molecular traits. In comparison with analyzing each molecular trait separately, the joint modeling of multi-omics data enjoys several benefits: iProFun experienced enhanced power for detecting significant cis-associations shared across different omics data types; and it also achieved better accuracy in inferring cis-associations unique to certain type(s) of molecular trait(s). For example, unique associations of CNA/methylations to global/phospho protein abundances may imply post-translational regulations.\\n\\nWe applied iProFun to ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, and identified CNAs and methylations of 500 and 122 genes, respectively, affecting the cis-functional molecular quantitative traits of the corresponding genes. We observed substantial power gain via the joint analysis of iProFun. For example, iProFun identified 130 genes whose CNAs were associated with phosphoprotein abundances by leveraging mRNA expression levels and global protein abundances. By comparison, analyses based on phosphoprotein data alone identified none. A group of these 130 genes clustered in a small region on Chromosome 14q, harboring the known oncogene, AKT1. In addition, iProFun identified one gene, CANX, whose DNA methylation has a cis-association with its global protein abundances but not its mRNA expression levels These and other genes identified by iProFun could serve as potential drug targets for ovarian cancer.",

To perceive mechanical perturbations of different types and magnitudes, tissues need a range of appropriate detectors 6-8, with a compliance that has to match the perturbation amplitude. As a proxy of biological tissues, we use multicellular aggregates, a composite material made of cells, extracellular matrix and permeating fluid. We compare the effect of a selective compression of cells within the aggregate, leaving the extracellular matrix unstrained, to a global compression of the whole aggregate. We show that the global compression strongly reduces the aggregate volume 9-13, while the same amount of selective compression on cells has almost no effect 14,15. We support this finding with a theoretical model of an actively pre-stressed composite material, made of incompressible and impermeable cells and a poroelastic interstitial space. This description correctly predicts the emergent bulk modulus of the aggregate as well as the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficient of the percolating interstitial fluid under compression. We further show that, on a longer timescale, the extracellular matrix serves as a sensor that regulates cell proliferation and migration in a 3D environment through its permanent deformation and dehydration following the global compression.",

    "abstract": "Severity of motion sickness varies across individuals. While some experience immediate symptoms, others seem relatively immune. We explored a potential explanation for such individual variability based on cue conflict theory. According to cue conflict theory, sensory signals that lead to mutually incompatible perceptual interpretations will produce physical discomfort. A direct consequence of such theory is that individuals with greater sensitivity to visual (or vestibular) sensory cues should show greater susceptibility, because they would be more likely to detect a conflict. Using virtual reality (VR), we first assessed individual sensitivity to a number of visual cues and subsequently induced moderate levels of motion sickness using stereoscopic movies presented in the VR headset. We found that an observers sensitivity to motion parallax cues predicted severity of motion sickness symptoms. We also evaluated evidence for another reported source of variability in motion sickness severity in VR, namely sex, but found little support. We speculate that previously-reported sex differences might have been due to poor personalization of VR displays, which default to male settings and introduce cue conflicts for the majority of females. Our results identify a sensory sensitivity-based predictor of motion sickness, which can be used to personalize VR experiences and mitigate discomfort.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis produces gametes through two successive nuclear divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II. In contrast to mitosis and meiosis II, where sister chromatids are segregated, during meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are segregated. This requires the monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores and the loss of cohesion from chromosome arms, but not centromeres, during meiosis I. The establishment of both sister kinetochore mono-orientation and cohesion protection rely on the budding yeast meiosis I-specific Spo13 protein, the functional homolog of fission yeast Moa1 and mouse MEIKIN. Here we investigate the effects of loss of SPO13 on cohesion during meiosis I. Unlike wild type, cells lacking SPO13 fail to maintain the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, Rec8, at centromeres and segregate sister chromatids to opposite poles during anaphase I. We show that the cohesin-destabilizing factor, Wpl1, is not primarily responsible for the loss of cohesion during meiosis I. Instead, premature loss of centromeric cohesin during anaphase I in spo13{Delta} cells relies on separase-dependent cohesin cleavage. Further, cohesin loss in spo13{Delta} anaphase I cells is blocked by forcibly tethering the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, Rts1, to Rec8. Our findings indicate that separase-dependent cleavage of phosphorylated Rec8 causes premature cohesin loss in spo13{Delta} cells.",

    "abstract": "Growth delay and retardation are complex phenotypes which can results by a range of factors including genetics variants. We identified a novel homozygous frameshift mutation, c.892dupA, in SPART gene, in two brothers with short stature and psychomotor retardation, born from healthy consanguineous parents. Mutations in SPART are the cause of Troyer syndrome, an autosomal recessive form of spastic paraplegia resulting in muscle weakness, short stature and cognitive defects. SPART encodes for Spartin, a protein with different cellular functions, such as endosomal trafficking and mitochondrial stability.\\n\\nWe evaluated the effects of Spartin loss by transiently silencing SPART in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and by generating an SH-SY5Y cell line model carrying the c.892dupA mutation via CRISPR/Cas9. In both models, we observed an altered neuronal growth and an increase in neurite outgrowth. In the SH-SY5Y cell line carrying the c.892dupA mutation, Spartin absence led to an altered distribution of mitochondria, and to a severe decrease in the NADH-dehydrogenase activity of mitochondrial Complex I. These impairments determined an energetic failure with a decrease in ATP synthesis due to a halt in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, increased reactive oxygen species production, and alteration in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Transient re-expression of Spartin in mutant cells restored an intracellular Ca2+ level. Mutant cells presented a significant increase in extracellular pyruvate, which may result from increased glycolysis due to impaired Complex I activity. Consistently, Spartin loss led to an over-activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) factor, a key regulator of glycolysis.\\n\\nThese data demonstrate that Spartin loss leads to a profound bioenergetics imbalance with defective OXPHOS activity, and this altered metabolism might underlie Troyer syndrome and neurodevelopmental delays.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture is a major driver of global biodiversity loss 1,2, accounts for one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions 3, and is responsible for 70% of freshwater use 4,5. How can land be used for agriculture in a way that minimises the impact on the worlds natural resources while maintaining current production levels? Here, we solved this more than 10 million dimensional optimisation problem and find that moving current croplands and pastures to optimal locations, while allowing then-abandoned areas to regenerate, could simultaneously decrease the current carbon, biodiversity and water footprint of global agriculture by up to 71%, 91% and 100%, respectively. This would offset current net CO2 emissions for half a century, massively alleviate pressure on global biodiversity and greatly reduce freshwater shortages. Whilst these achievements would require global coordination of agricultural policies, reductions of up to 59%, 78% and close to 100% are achievable by relocating production within national borders, with the greatest potential for carbon footprint reduction held by the worlds top three CO2 emitting countries.",

An understanding of the movement networks can help the policymakers in planning effective disease control measures. The objectives of this work are: 1) estimate swine movement probabilities at the county level from comprehensive anonymous inventory and sales data published by the United States Department of Agriculture - National Agriculture Statistics Service database, 2) develop a network based on those estimated probabilities, and 3) analyze that network using network science metrics. First, we use a probabilistic approach based on the maximum entropy method to estimate the movement probabilities among different swine populations. Then, we create a swine movement network using the estimated probabilities for the counties of the central agricultural district of Iowa. The analysis of this network has found evidence of small-world phenomenon. Our study suggests that the US swine industry may be vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks because of the small-world structure of its movement network. Our system is easily adaptable to estimate movement networks for other sets of data, farm animal production systems, and geographic regions.",

High-resolution structural information can only be reached if crystals are perfectly flat and highly ordered. In practice, such crystals are difficult to obtain. Available image unbending algorithms correct for disorder, but only perform well on images of non-tilted, flat crystals, while out-of-plane distortions are not addressed. Here, we present an approach that employs single-particle refinement procedures to locally unbend crystals in 3D. With this method, density maps of the MloK1 potassium channel with a resolution of 4 [A] were obtained from images of 2D crystals that do not diffract beyond 10 [A]. Furthermore, 3D classification allowed multiple structures to be resolved, revealing a series of MloK1 conformations within a single 2D crystal. This conformational heterogeneity explains the poor diffraction observed and is related to channel function. The approach is implemented in the FOCUS package.",

    "abstract": "One of the earliest and most significant events in embryonic development is zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In several species, bulk transcription begins at the mid-blastula transition (MBT) when, after a certain number of cleavages, the embryo attains a particular nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, maternal repressors become sufficiently diluted, and the cell cycle slows down. Here we resolve the frog ZGA in time and space by profiling RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) engagement and its transcriptional readout. We detect a gradual increase in both the quantity and the length of RNAPII elongation before the MBT, revealing that >1,000 zygotic genes disregard the N/C timer for their activation, and that the sizes of newly transcribed genes are not necessarily constrained by cell cycle duration. We also find that Wnt, Nodal and BMP signaling together generate most of the spatio-temporal dynamics of regional ZGA, directing the formation of orthogonal body axes and proportionate germ layers.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral environmental conditions can impact descendant phenotypes through a variety of epigenetic mechanisms. Previous studies on transgenerational effects in Drosophila melanogaster suggest that parental nutrition may affect the body size, developmental duration, and egg size of the next generation. However, it is unknown whether these effects on phenotype remain stable across generations, or if specific generations have general responses to ancestral diet. In the current study, we examined the effect on multiple life history phenotypes of changing diet quality across three generations. Our analysis revealed unforeseen patterns in how phenotypes respond to dietary restriction. Our generalized linear model showed that when considering only two generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily affected by their own diet, and to a lesser extent by the diet of their parents or the interaction between the two generations. Surprisingly, however, when considering three generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily impacted by their grandparents diet and their own diet. Interactions amongst different generations diets affected development time, egg volume, and pupal mass more than ovariole number or wing length. Further, pairwise comparisons of diet groups from the same generation revealed commonalities in strong responses to rich vs. poor diet: ovariole number, pupal mass, and wing length responded more strongly to poor diet than to rich diet, while development time responded strongly to both rich and poor diets. To improve investigations into the mechanisms and consequences of transgenerational, epigenetic inheritance, future studies should closely examine how phenotypes change across a higher number of generations, and consider responses to broader variability in diet treatments.",

DHHC5 is a plasma membrane-localised PAT with roles in synaptic plasticity, massive endocytosis and cancer cell growth/invasion. Here we demonstrate that stabilisation of DHHC5 at the plasma membrane requires binding to and palmitoylation of an accessory protein Golga7b. This interaction requires the palmitoylation of the C-terminus of DHHC5 which regulates the internalisation of DHHC5 from the plasma membrane. Proteomic analysis of DHHC5/Golga7b-associated protein complexes reveals an enrichment in adhesion proteins, particularly components of desmosomes. We show that Desmoglein-2 and Plakophilin-3 are substrates of DHHC5 and that DHHC5/Golga7b are required for localisation of Desmoglein-2 to the plasma membrane and desmosomal patterning. Loss of DHHC5/Golga7b causes functional impairments in cell adhesion suggesting these proteins have a wider role in cell adhesion beyond desmosome assembly. This work uncovers a novel mechanism of DHHC5 regulation by Golga7b and demonstrates a role for the DHHC5/Golga7b complex in the regulation of cell adhesion.",

Using a murine melanoma cell line that endogenously expresses podoplanin, we demonstrate interactions with proteins necessary for cytoskeleton reorganization, adhesion and matrix degradation, and endocytosis/receptor recycling but also identify a novel interaction with caveolin-1. We generated a panel of podoplanin and caveolin-1 variants to determine the molecular interactions and functional consequences of these interactions. Complementary in vitro and in vivo systems confirmed the existence of a functional cooperation in which surface expression of both full length, signalling competent podoplanin and caveolin-1 are necessary to induce directional migration and invasion, which is executed via PAK1 and ERK1 pathways. Our findings establish that podoplanin signalling mediates the invasive properties of melanoma cells in a caveolin-1 dependent manner.\\n\\nSummary StatementThis manuscript describes a new interaction and functional cooperation between podoplanin and caveolin1 that drives tumour cell invasion into surrounding tissues.",

    "abstract": "Proteasomes are molecular machineries responsible for regulated protein degradation and general homeostasis. The distribution of this degradation capacity is reflected by the cellular localisation of proteasomal particles. Here we combine super-resolution imaging, single-particle tracking (SPT) and single-cell patch clamp techniques to investigate the localisation and translocation of endogenous mammalian proteasomes tagged with fluorescent proteins. While proteasomes are found dispersed in the cell without distinct localisation, we detect a higher density of proteasomes in the nucleus compared to the ER and the cytosol. SPT of proteasomes revealed two populations with diffusion coefficients averaging ~4 and ~0.8 m2/s. The ratio between these two populations could be altered upon changed cellular conditions. We further report that proteasomal particles translocate to the cell periphery during hyperpolarisation, while depolarisation re-localises proteasomes to the cell interior. Depolymerising microtubules or actin filaments inhibited this potential-dependent translocation. Our results suggest that at resting membrane potential proteasomes undergo diffusion-based motions, while membrane polarisation may induce cytoskeleton-dependent translocation. Fine-tuning these translocation modes can potentially dedicate proteasomes to degradation activities at distinct subcellular sites.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic obligate-intracellular apicomplexan parasites possess an essential chloroplast-like organelle called the apicoplast that undergoes division and segregation during replication. Parasite actin is essential during intracellular development, implicated in vesicular transport, parasite replication and apicoplast inheritance. However, the inability to visualise live actin dynamics in apicomplexan parasites limited functional characterisation of both filamentous-actin (F-actin) and actin regulatory factors. Apicomplexans possess at least two distinct formins, Formin-1 and Formin-2, predicted to serve as actin-nucleating factors, and previously implicated in regulating gliding motility and host cell invasion. Here, we expressed chromobodies and validated them as F-actin-binding sensors in Plasmodium falciparum and characterised the in vivo dynamics of the F-actin network. The F-actin network could be modulated chemically and disrupted by conditionally deleting the actin-1 gene. In a comparative approach, we demonstrate that Formin-2 is closely associated with apicoplasts and with the F-actin network in P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Consequently, disruption of Formin-2 resulted not only in an apicoplast segregation defect, but also in complete abrogation of F-actin dynamics in intracellular parasites. Together, our results strongly indicate that Formin-2-mediated filament formation is the common primary mechanism for F-actin nucleation during apicomplexan intracellular growth effecting apicoplast segregation.",

    "abstract": "During terminal differentiation most cells will exit the cell cycle and enter into a prolonged or permanent G0. Cell cycle exit is usually initiated through the repression of cell cycle gene expression by formation of a transcriptional repressor complex called DREAM. However when DREAM repressive function is compromised during terminal differentiation, additional unknown mechanisms act to stably repress cycling and ensure robust cell cycle exit. Here we provide evidence that developmentally programmed, temporal changes in chromatin accessibility at a subset of critical cell cycle genes acts to enforce cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation in the Drosophila melanogaster wing. We show that during terminal differentiation, chromatin closes at a set of pupal wing enhancers for the key rate-limiting cell cycle regulators cycE, e2f1 and stg. This closing coincides with wing cells entering a robust postmitotic state that is strongly refractory to cell cycle re-activation. When cell cycle exit is genetically disrupted, chromatin accessibility at cell cycle genes remains largely unaffected and the closing of enhancers at cycE, e2f1 and stg proceeds independent of the cell cycling status. Instead, disruption of cell cycle exit leads to changes in accessibility and expression of a subset of hormone-induced transcription factors involved in the progression of terminal differentiation. Our results uncover a mechanism that acts as a cell cycle-independent timer to limit aberrant cycling in terminally differentiating tissues. In addition, we provide a new molecular description of the cross-talk between cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation during metamorphosis.",

We apply our method to nine empirically-parameterized eco-evolutionary models of exploiter-victim systems from the literature and identify which particular feedbacks cause some systems to converge to a steady state or to exhibit sustained oscillations. We find that ecological feedbacks involving the interactions between all species and evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving only the interactions between exploiter species (predators or pathogens) are typically stabilizing. In contrast, evolutionary and eco-evolutionary feedbacks involving the interactions between victim species (prey or hosts) are destabilizing more often than not. We also find that while eco-evolutionary feedbacks rarely altered system stability from what would be predicted from just ecological and evolutionary feedbacks, eco-evolutionary feedbacks have the potential to alter system stability at faster or slower speeds of evolution. As the number of empirical studies demonstrating eco-evolutionary feedbacks increases, we can continue to apply these methods to determine whether the patterns we observe are common in other empirical communities.",

Smoking strongly influences DNA methylation, with current, former and never smokers exhibiting different methylation profiles. Recently, two approaches were proposed to calculate scores based on smoking-responsive DNA methylation loci, to serve as reliable indicators of long-term exposure and potential biomarkers to estimate smoking behavior. However, these two methodologies need significant improvements to make them globally applicable to all populations and to achieve an optimal classification of individuals with unknown smoking habits. To advance the practical applicability of the smoking-associated methylation signals, we used machine learning methodology to train a classifier for smoking status prediction. We show the prediction performance of our classifier on three independent whole-blood test datasets demonstrating its robustness and global applicability. Furthermore, we show the cross-tissue functionality of our classifier in tissues other than blood. Additionally, we provide the community with an R package, EpiSmokEr, facilitating implementation of our classifier to predict smoking status in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common syndrome with perioperative cerebral damage in elderly patients, displaying cognitive impairment and memory loss. Current studies revealed that anesthesia is one of the important causes for POCD occurrence. Recently, Ubiquitin-like with PHD and Ring Finger Domains 2 (Uhrf2) has been reported to play a crucial role in regulating DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, which are closely connected with memory building and erasure. However, whether narcotic drugs can affect Uhrf2 to impact on DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in POCD is poorly understood. In this study, we established the elderly POCD mouse model through sevoflurane treatment, and observed the compromised levels of global DNA hydroxymethylated cytosine (5hmC) and Uhrf2 in hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus compared to non-POCD and control. Furthermore, 5hmC modification on the promoters of the genes associated with neural protection and development, such as GDNF, BDNF, GCR, ACSS2 were reduced in the hippocampus of POCD compared to non-POCD and control groups by MedIP qPCR. Taken together, our findings determined that the loss of 5hmC in hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus modulated by Uhrf2 suppression might result in the learning and memory ability impairment in POCD.",

    "abstract": "In fMRI research, univariate analysis (UNIVAR), representational similarity analysis (RSA, following multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)), and functional connectivity analysis (FCA) are the most commonly used methods by cognitive neuroscientists investigating the functional organization of the human brain. Despite their popularity, few studies have examined the relationship between the network structures as identified through these different methods. Thus, the current study aims to evaluate the similarities between neural networks derived from UNIVAR, RSA, and FCA, and to clarify how these methods relate to each other. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the data of a previously published study with the three methods and compared the results by performing (partial) correlation and multiple regression analysis. Our findings reveal that neural networks resulting from UNIVAR, RSA, and FCA methods are highly similar to each other even after ruling out the effect of anatomical proximity between the network nodes. Nevertheless, the neural network from each method shows idiosyncratic structure that cannot be explained by any of the other methods. Thus, we conclude that the UNIVAR, RSA, and FCA methods provide similar but not identical information on how brain regions are organized in functional networks.",

    "abstract": "In shotgun proteomics, the information extractable from label-free quantification experiments is typically limited by the identification rate and the noise level in the quantitative data. This generally causes a low sensitivity in differential expression analysis on protein level. Here, we propose a quantification-first approach for peptides that reverses the classical identification-first workflow. This prevents valuable information from being discarded prematurely in the identification stage and allows us to spend more effort on the identification process. Specifically, we introduce a method, Quandenser, that applies unsupervised clustering on both MS1 and MS2 level to summarize all analytes of interest without assigning identities. Not only does this eliminate the need for redoing the quantification for each new set of search parameters and engines, but it also reduces search time due to the data reduction by MS2 clustering. For a dataset of partially known composition, we could now employ open modification and de novo searches to identify analytes of interest that would have gone unnoticed in traditional pipelines. Moreover, Quandenser reports error rates for feature matching, which we integrated into our probabilistic protein quantification method, Triqler. This propagates error probabilities from feature to protein level and appropriately deals with the noise in quantitative signals caused by false positives and missing values. Quandenser+Triqler outperformed the state-of-the-art method MaxQuant+Perseus, consistently reporting more differentially abundant proteins at 5% FDR: 123 vs. 117 true positives with 2 vs. 25 false positives in a dataset of partially known composition; 62 vs. 3 proteins in a bladder cancer set; 8 vs. 0 proteins in a hepatic fibrosis set; and 872 vs. 661 proteins in a nanoscale type 1 diabetes set. Compellingly, in all three clinical datasets investigated, the differentially abundant proteins showed enrichment for functional annotation terms.\n\nThe source code and binary packages for all major operating systems are available from https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/quandenser, under Apache 2.0 license.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYAnoxygenic phototrophic sulfide oxidation by green and purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) plays a key role in sulfide removal from anoxic shallow sediments and stratified waters. Although some PSB can also oxidize sulfide with nitrate and oxygen, little is known about the prevalence of this chemolithotrophic lifestyle in the environment. In this study, we investigated the role of these phototrophs in light-independent sulfide removal in the chemocline of Lake Cadagno. Our temporally resolved, high-resolution chemical profiles indicated that dark sulfide oxidation was coupled to high oxygen consumption rates of ~9 M O2{middle dot}h-1. Single-cell analyses of lake water incubated with 13CO2 in the dark revealed that Chr. okenii was to a large extent responsible for aerobic sulfide oxidation and it accounted for up to 40 % of total dark carbon fixation. The genome of Chr. okenii reconstructed from the Lake Cadagno metagenome confirms its capacity for microaerophilic growth and provides further insights into its metabolic capabilities. Moreover, our genomic and single-cell data indicated that other PSB grow microaerobically in these apparently anoxic waters. Altogether, our observations suggest that aerobic respiration may not only play an underappreciated role in anoxic environments, but also that organisms typically considered strict anaerobes may be involved.\\n\\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study reveals that dark aerobic sulfide oxidation within an anoxic layer dominated by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in the stratified water column of Lake Cadagno is to a large extent carried out by the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Chromatium okenii. Our findings imply that aerobic metabolisms may be more prevalent in anoxic zones than previously thought. We also present an environmental metagenome-assembled genome of Chr. okenii which is the first genome sequence for the genus Chromatium and reveals new interesting physiological features of this environmentally relevant organism, including its capacity for aerobic respiration.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the role of sympathetic nervous fibers in chronic inflammation has become increasingly evident. At the onset of inflammation, sympathetic activity is increased in the affected tissue. However, sympathetic fibers are largely absent from chronically inflamed tissue. Apparently, there is a very dynamic relationship between sympathetic innervation and the immune system in areas of inflammation, and hence a rapid and easy method for quantification of nerve fiber density of target organs is of great value to answer potential research questions. Currently, nervous fiber densities are either determined by tedious manual counting, which is not suitable for high throughput approaches, or by expensive automated processes relying on specialized software and high-end microscopy equipment. Usually, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is used as the marker for sympathetic fibers. In order to overcome the current quantification bottleneck with a cost-efficient alternative, an automated process was established and compared to the classic manual approach of counting TH-positive sympathetic fibers. Since TH is not exclusively expressed on sympathetic fibers, but also in a number of catecholamine-producing cells, a prerequisite for automated determination of fiber densities is to reliably distinct between cells and fibers. Therefore, an additional staining using peripherin exclusively expressed in nervous fibers as a secondary marker was established. Using this novel approach, we studied the spleens from a syndecan-3 knockout (SDC3KO) mouse line, and demonstrated equal results on SNS fiber density for both manual and automated counts (Manual counts: wt: 22.57 +/- 11.72 fibers per mm2; ko: 31.95 +/- 18.85 fibers per mm2; p = 0.0498; Automated counts: wt: 31.6 +/- 18.98 fibers per mm2; ko: 45.49 +/- 19.65 fibers per mm2; p = 0.01868). In conclusion, this new and simple method can be used as a high-throughput approach to reliably and quickly quantify SNS nerve fiber density in target tissues.",

Altough steatosis is a benign condition it can develop into non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to irreversible damage, such as fibrosis and hepatocarcinoma. While NASH appears as a major public health concern worldwide, it remains an unmet medical need. Several drugs are being tested in clinical trials, including pharmacological agonists for the different PPAR isotypes. In current study, we investigated the role of hepatocyte PPAR in a preclinical model of steatosis.\\n\\nMethods/ResultsWe have investigated the role of hepatocyte PPAR in a preclinical model of steatosis using High Fat Diet (HFD) feeding as a model of obesity in C57BL/6J male Wild-Type mice (WT), in whole-body (Ppar-/-) mice and in mice lacking Ppar in hepatocyte (Pparhep-/-).

    "abstract": "High quality reference genomes are an important resource in genomic research projects. A consequence is that DNA fragments carrying the reference allele will be more likely to map suc-cessfully, or receive higher quality scores. This reference bias can have effects on downstream population genomic analysis when heterozygous sites are falsely considered homozygous for the reference allele.\\n\\nIn palaeogenomic studies of human populations, mapping against the human reference genome is used to identify endogenous human sequences. Ancient DNA studies usually operate with low sequencing coverages and fragmentation of DNA molecules causes a large proportion of the sequenced fragments to be shorter than 50 bp - reducing the amount of accepted mismatches, and increasing the probability of multiple matching sites in the genome. These ancient DNA specific properties are potentially exacerbating the impact of reference bias on downstream analyses, especially since most studies of ancient human populations use pseudohaploid data, i.e. they randomly sample only one sequencing read per site.\\n\\nWe show that reference bias is pervasive in published ancient DNA sequence data of pre-historic humans with some differences between individual genomic regions. We illustrate that the strength of reference bias is negatively correlated with fragment length. Reference bias can cause differences in the results of downstream analyses such as population affinities, heterozygosity estimates and estimates of archaic ancestry. These spurious results highlight how important it is to be aware of these technical artifacts and that we need strategies to mitigate the effect. Therefore, we suggest some post-mapping filtering strategies to resolve reference bias which help to reduce its impact substantially.",

One such secreted matricellular protein, cellular communication network factor 4 (CCN4), stimulates metastasis in other malignancies. Here, we report that CCN4 expression is associated progressively with reduced overall survival in patients with primary melanomas. To reveal the roles of CCN4 in melanoma progression, we used mouse melanoma models and knocked out Ccn4 using a homology-directed repair CRISPR/CAS9 system to generate pools of Ccn4-knockout cells. In vitro assays supported previous findings using clones generated using a double nickase-based CRISPR/CAS9 system that CCN4 promoted an epithelial - mesenchymal-like transition in melanoma cells and stimulated invasion and metastasis. We also found that, while Ccn4 knockout enhanced cell growth in optimal 2D culture conditions, the knockout suppressed certain cell survival signaling pathways and rendered cells less resistant to stress conditions. Tumor cell growth assays at sub-optimal conditions in vitro, quantitative analysis of tumor growth assays in vivo, and transcriptomics analysis of human melanoma cell lines suggested that CCN4 repressed cell growth and simultaneously enhanced cell survival. The collective role of CCN4 suggests a potential therapeutic target for limiting metastatic invasion in melanoma and a biomarker for metastatic potential.",

    "abstract": "How the rate of cell growth is influenced by cell size is a fundamental question of cell biology. The simple model that cell growth is proportional to cell size, based on the proposition that larger cells have proportionally greater synthetic capacity than smaller cells, leads to the predication that the rate of cell growth increases exponentially with cell size. However, other modes of cell growth, including bilinear growth, have been reported. The distinction between exponential and bilinear growth has been explored in particular detail in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have revisited the mode of fission yeast cell growth using high-resolution time-lapse microscopy and find, as previously reported, that these two growth models are difficult to distinguish both because of the similarity in shapes between exponential and bilinear curves over the two-fold change in length of a normal cell cycle and because of the substantial biological and experimental noise inherent to these experiments. Therefore, we contrived to have cells grow more than two fold, by holding them in G2 for up to eight hours. Over this extended growth period, in which cells grow up to 5.5-fold, the two growth models diverge to the point that we can confidently exclude bilinear growth as a general model for fission yeast growth. Although the growth we observe is clearly more complicated than predicted by simple exponential growth, we find that exponential growth is a robust approximation of fission yeast growth, both during an unperturbed cell cycle and during extended periods of growth.",
