    "abstract": "Here human trichromats were presented with two types of scenes - geometric and real-world scenes -tinted with a shade of colour in order to destabilize the perceived illumination, and chromaticity of the retinal image of each scene. Each trichromat was instructed to adjust the chromaticity of the object embedded within each scene until its surface appeared devoid of any hue in the DKL colour space which spans two chromatic opponent axes - the S-(L+M) and L- M axis - and a luminance axis - the L+M axis. The following observations were made : (i) across scenes, adjustments were dispersed along the S-(L+M) axis, along which daylight is known to vary; (ii) across trichromats, for the geometric scenes, adjustments were biased towards the S pole of the S-(L+M) axis for one group (group 1), and towards the (L+M) pole for the other group (group 2); (iii) for the real-world scenes, adjustments for both groups systematically converged towards the (L+M) pole. These results suggest that when the core set of priors upon which the human visual system typically relies become ill-equipped, the human visual system is able to recruit one of the two illumination priors - PriorS or PriorL+M - in combination with the representation it has formed over time about the spectral composition of the illuminant associated with scenes the trichromatic observer is currently being exposed to within its ecological niche, as it attempts to stabilize the chromaticity of the retinal image of real-world scenes.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome quality control is an important step in RNA-seq experiments. However, the quality of de novo assembled transcriptomes is difficult to assess, due to the lack of reference genome to compare the assembly to. We developed a method to assess and improve the quality of de novo assembled transcriptomes by focusing on the removal of chimeric sequences. These chimeric sequences can be the result of faulty assembled contigs, merging two transcripts into one. The developed method is incorporated into a pipeline, that we named Bellerophon, which is broadly applicable and easy to use. Bellerophon first uses the quality-assessment tool TransRate to indicate the quality, after which it uses a Transcripts Per Million (TPM) filter to remove lowly expressed contigs and CD-HIT-EST to remove highly identical contigs. To validate the quality of this method, we performed three benchmark experiments: 1) a computational creation of chimeras, 2) identification of chimeric contigs in a transcriptome assembly, 3) a simulated RNAseq experiment using a known reference transcriptome. Overall, the Bellerophon pipeline was able to remove between 40 to 91.9% of the chimeras in transcriptome assemblies and removed more chimeric than non-chimeric contigs. Thus, the Bellerophon sequence of filtration steps is a broadly applicable solution to improve transcriptome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) of human fecal samples to germ-free (GF) mice is useful for establishing causal relationships between altered gut microbiota and human phenotypes. However, due to intrinsic differences between human and mouse intestines, and distinct diets of choice between the two organisms, replicating human phenotypes in mouse through FMT is not guaranteed; similarly, treatments that are effective in mouse models do not guarantee their success in human either. In this study, we aimed to identify human gut microbes that have undergone significant and consistent changes after transplanted to GF mice across multiple experimental settings. By comparing gut microbiota profiles in 1,713 human-mouse pairs, we found strikingly on average <50% of the human gut microbes can be re-established in mice at the species level; among which, more than 1/3 have undergone significant changes (referred as to \\\"variable microbes\\\"), most of which were consistent across multiple human-mouse pairs and experimental settings. Consistently, one-third of human samples had changed their enterotypes, i.e. significant changes in their leading species after FMT. Mice fed with controlled diet showed significant decrease in the enterotype change rate (~25%) as compared those with non-controlled diet (~50%), suggesting a possible solution for rescue. Strikingly, most of the variable microbes have been implicated in human diseases, with some being recognized as causing species. Our results highlighted the challenges of using mouse model in replicating human gut microbiota-associated phenotypes, provided useful information for researchers using mice in their gut microbiota studies and call for additional validations after FMT.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication alters the dosage balance among genes; at the mid-S phase, early-replicating genes have doubled their copies while late-replicating genes have not. Dosage imbalance among proteins, especially within members of a protein complex, is toxic to cells. Here, we propose the synchronized replication hypothesis: genes sensitive to stoichiometric relationships will be replicated simultaneously to maintain stoichiometry. In support of this hypothesis, we observe that genes encoding the same protein complex have similar replication timing, but surprisingly, only in fast-proliferating cells such as embryonic stem cells and cancer cells. The synchronized replication observed in cancer cells, but not in slow-proliferating differentiated cells, is due to convergent evolution during tumorigenesis that restores synchronized replication timing within protein complexes. Collectively, our study reveals that the selection for dosage balance during S phase plays an important role in the optimization of the replication-timing program; that this selection is relaxed during differentiation as the cell cycle is elongated, and restored as the cell cycle shortens during tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary dynamics is fundamentally shaped by stochastic processes: spon-taneous mutations enter populations randomly, and the fate of a mutant lineage is determined by the competition between (random) genetic drift and (determin-istic) selection. In populations undergoing range expansions, fluctuations in the reproductive process and the local motion of individuals are enhanced within a small subpopulation at the edge of the population. Range expansions are typically studied in homogeneous environments, but we argue here that the fluctuations at the range edge are susceptible to small-scale environmental heterogeneities that may have a strong effect on the evolutionary dynamics of the expanding population.\\n\\nTo show this, we tracked the dynamics of the clones of spontaneous mutations with a tunable fitness effect in bacterial colonies grown on randomly disordered surfaces. We find that environmental heterogeneity on scales much larger than an individual, but much smaller than the total population, can dramatically reduce the efficacy of selection. Time lapse microscopy and computer simulations suggest that this effect is a general consequence of a local \\\"pinning\\\" of the expansion front, whereby stretches of the front are slowed down on a length scale that depends on the structure of the environmental heterogeneity. This pinning focuses the range expansion into a small number of individuals with access to expansion paths, increasing the importance of chance and thus limiting the efficacy of selection.",

    "abstract": "Multi-targeting antibiotics, i.e. single compounds capable to inhibit two or more bacterial targets offer a promising therapeutic strategy, but information on resistance evolution against such drugs is scarce. Gepotidacin is an antibiotic candidate that selectively inhibits both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. In a susceptible organism, Klebsiella pneumoniae, a combination of two specific mutations in these target proteins provide an over 2000-fold increment in resistance, while individually none of these mutations affect resistance significantly. Alarmingly, gepotidacin-resistant strains are found to be as virulent as the wild-type K. pneumoniae strain in a murine model, and extensive cross-resistance was demonstrated between gepotidacin and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic widely employed in clinical practice. This suggests that numerous fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogenic isolates carry mutations which would promote the evolution of clinically significant resistance against gepotidacin in the future. We conclude that prolonged antibiotic usage could select for mutations that serve as stepping-stones towards resistance against antimicrobial compounds still under development. More generally, our research indicates that even balanced multi-targeting antibiotics are prone to resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "Metschnikowia pulcherrima synthesizes the red pigment pulcherrimin, from cyclodileucine (cyclo(Leu-Leu)) as a precursor, and exhibits strong antifungal activity against notorious plant pathogenic fungi such as Botrytis and Gibberella (i.e., Fusarium). This yeast therefore has great potential for biocontrol applications against fungal diseases; particularly in the phyllosphere where this species is frequently found. To elucidate the molecular basis of the antifungal activity of M. pulcherrima, we compared a wildtype strain with a spontaneously occurring, pigmentless, weakly antagonistic mutant derivative. Whole genome sequencing of the wildtype and mutant strains identified a point mutation that creates a premature stop codon in the transcriptional regulator SNF2 in the mutant strain. Complementation of the snf2 mutant strain with the wildtype SNF2 gene restored pigmentation and recovered the strong antifungal activity of M. pulcherrima against plant pathogens in vitro and on cherries. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution heated electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC HR HESI-MS) proved the presence and structure of the pulcherrimin precursors cyclo(Leu-Leu) and pulcherriminic acid and also identified new compounds that likely represented an additional precursor and degradation products of pulcherriminic acid and/or pulcherrimin. All of these compounds were identified in the wildtype and complemented strain, but were undetectable in the pigmentless snf2 mutant strain. These results thus identify SNF2 as a regulator of antifungal activity and pulcherriminic acid biosynthesis in M. pulcherrima and provide a starting point for deciphering the molecular functions underlying the antagonistic activity of this yeast.\\n\\nSignificance statementMetschnikowia pulcherrima is a strongly antifungal yeast and a most promising species for the control of notorious plant diseases. This multidisciplinary study on the M. pulcherrima mode of action compared a wildtype isolate with a pigmentless mutant exhibiting reduced antifungal activity. The transcriptional regulator Snf2 was identified as a \\\"biocontrol regulator\\\" controlling antifungal activity of M. pulcherrima via PUL gene transcription, cyclodipeptide synthesis and additional, yet uncharacterized mechanisms. The identification of cyclo(Leu-Leu), pulcherriminic acid, as well as novel precursor and degradation products of pulcherrimin, opens up new avenues for research on the metabolism and functions of pulcherrimin. Overall, this works establishes M. pulcherrima as a genetically tractable model and will benefit the development of biocontrol solutions for important plant diseases.",

    "abstract": "Compound heterozygotes occur when different mutations at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of mutations at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 genomes participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 genomes data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 genomes participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5% and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous mutations in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development - PRTG (p=0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p=0.0221% MAF, combined ancestries), and MACF1 (p=0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes. However, PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous mutations should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Attention operates through top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) mechanisms. Recently, it has been shown that slow (alpha) frequencies index facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms of TD attention and faster (gamma) frequencies signal BU attentional capture. Ageing is characterized by increased behavioral distractibility, resulting from either a reduced efficiency of TD attention or an enhanced triggering of BU attention. However, only few studies have investigated the impact of ageing upon the oscillatory activities involved in TD and BU attention. MEG data were collected from 14 elderly and 14 matched young healthy human participants while performing the Competitive Attention Task. Elderly participants displayed (1) exacerbated behavioral distractibility, (2) altered TD suppressive mechanisms, indexed by a reduced alpha synchronization in task-irrelevant regions, (3) less prominent alpha peak-frequency differences between cortical regions, (4) a similar BU system activation indexed by gamma activity, and (5) a reduced activation of lateral prefrontal inhibitory control regions. These results show that the ageing-related increased distractibility is of TD origin.",

    "abstract": "Fear behavior depends on interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the expression of fear involves synchronized activity in theta and gamma oscillatory activities. In addition, freezing, the most classical measure of fear response in rodents, temporally coincides with the development of sustained 4-Hz oscillations in prefrontal- amygdala circuits. Interestingly, these oscillations were recently shown to depend on the animals respiratory rhythm, supporting the growing body of evidence pinpointing the influence of nasal breathing on brain rhythms. During fearful states, rats also emit 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) which drastically affect respiratory rhythm. However, the relationship between 22-kHz USV, respiration and brain oscillatory activities is still unknown. Yet such information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how the different components of fear response collectively modulate rats brain neural dynamics. Here we trained male rats in an odor fear conditioning task, while recording simultaneously local field potentials in BLA, mPFC and olfactory piriform cortex, together with USV calls and respiration. We show that USV calls coincide with an increase in delta and gamma power and a decrease in theta power. In addition, during USV emission in contrast to silent freezing, there is no coupling between respiratory rate and delta frequency, and the modulation of fast oscillations amplitude relative to the phase of respiration is modified. We propose that sequences of USV calls could result in a differential gating of information within the network of structures sustaining fear behavior, thus potentially modulating fear expression/memory.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhile freezing is the most frequently used measure of fear, it is only one amongst the different components of rodents response to threatening events. USV is another index that gives additional insight into the socioemotional status of an individual. Our study is the first to describe the effects of USV production on rats brain oscillatory activities in the fear neural network, and to relate some of them to changes in nasal breathing. A better knowledge of the impact of USV calls on brain neural dynamics is not only important for understanding the respective weight of the different components of fear response, but is also particularly relevant for rodent models of human neuropsychiatric disorders, for which socio-affective communication is severely impaired.",

Extensive evidence demonstrates that the entorhinal cortex is critically implicated in navigation underpinned by the firing of spatially modulated neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that entorhinal-dependent navigation is impaired in pre-dementia Alzheimers disease.\\n\\nForty-five patients with mild cognitive impairment (26 with CSF Alzheimers disease biomarker data: 12 biomarker-positive and 14 biomarker-negative) and 41 healthy control participants undertook an immersive virtual reality path integration test, as a measure of entorhinal-dependent navigation. Behavioural performance was correlated with MRI measures of entorhinal cortex volume, and the classification accuracy of the path integration task was compared with a battery of cognitive tests considered sensitive and specific for early Alzheimers Disease.\\n\\nBiomarker-positive patients exhibited larger errors in the navigation task than biomarker-negative patients, whose performance did not significantly differ from controls participants. Path-integration errors were negatively correlated with the volumes of the total entorhinal cortex and of its posteromedial subdivision. The path integration task demonstrated higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for differentiating biomarker positive versus negative patients (area under the curve = 0.90) than was achieved by the best of the cognitive tests (area under the curve = 0.57).\\n\\nThis study demonstrates that an entorhinal cortex-based virtual reality navigation task can differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment at low and high risk of developing dementia, with classification accuracy superior to reference cognitive tests considered to be highly sensitive to early Alzheimers disease. This study provides evidence that navigation tasks may aid early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease, and the basis of this in animal cellular and behavioural studies provides the opportunity to answer the unmet need for translatable outcome measures for comparing treatment effect across preclinical and clinical trial phases of future anti-Alzheimers drugs.",

We show that DNA binding at the Smc hinge is dispensable and identify an essential DNA binding site at engaged heads which faces the S compartment. Mutations interfering with DNA binding do not prevent ATP hydrolysis but block DNA translocation by Smc/ScpAB. Our findings are consistent with the notion that Smc/DNA contacts stabilize looped DNA segments in the S compartment, while the base of a chromosomal DNA loop is enclosed in the K compartment. Transfer of DNA double helices between S and K compartments may support DNA translocation.",

An independent BLASTp search showed that the protein had significant homology with phos-phoglycolate phosphatase from mouse, human and yeast, and prompted us to re-investigate the biochemical properties of the recombinant Plasmodium enzyme. Owing to the insoluble nature of the Pf enzyme, an extended substrate screen and biochemical characterization was performed on its P. berghei (Pb) homolog that led to the identification of 2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phospho L-lactate as the relevant physiological substrates. 2-phosphoglycolate is known to be generated during repair of damaged DNA ends whereas, 2-phospho L-lactate is a product of pyruvate kinase side reaction.

    "abstract": "Explaining variation in life history strategies is a long-standing goal of evolutionary biology. For plants, annual and perennial life histories are thought to reflect adaptation to environments that differ in the frequency of stress events such as drought. Here we test this hypothesis in Heliophila (Brassicaceae), a diverse genus of flowering plants native to Africa, by integrating 34 years of satellite-based drought measurements with 2192 herbaria occurrence records. Consistent with predictions from classic life history theory, we find that perennial Heliophila species occur in environments where droughts are significantly less frequent compared to annuals. These associations are predictive while controlling for phylogeny, lending support to the hypothesis that drought related natural selection has influenced the distributions of these strategies. Additionally, the collection dates of annual and perennial species indicate that annuals escape drought prone seasons during the seed phase of their life cycle. Together, these findings provide empirical support for classic hypotheses about the drivers of life history strategy in plants - that perennials out compete annuals in environments with less frequent drought and that annuals are adapted to environments with more frequent drought by escaping drought prone seasons as seeds.",

    "abstract": "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are instrumental in genome-wide identification of regulatory elements, yet were overlooked in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). By analyzing 5079 RNA-seq samples from 23 tissues we identified association of ancient mtDNA SNPs (haplogroups T2, L2, J2 and V) and recurrent SNPs (mtDNA positions 263, 750, 1438 and 10398) with tissue-dependent mtDNA gene-expression. Since the recurrent SNPs independently occurred in different mtDNA genetic backgrounds, they constitute the best candidates to be causal eQTLs. Secondly, the discovery of mtDNA eQTLs in both coding and non-coding mtDNA regions, propose the identification of novel mtDNA regulatory elements. Third, we identified association between low m1A 947 MT-RNR2 (16S) rRNA modification levels and altered mtDNA gene-expression in twelve tissues. Such association disappeared in skin which was exposed to sun, as compared to sun-unexposed skin from the same individuals, thus supporting the impact of UV on mtDNA gene expression. Taken together, our findings reveal that both mtDNA SNPs and mt-rRNA modification affect mtDNA gene expression in a tissue-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the evolutionary potential of quantitative traits and reliably predicting responses to selection in wild populations are important challenges in evolutionary biology. The genomic revolution has opened up opportunities for measuring relatedness among individuals with precision, enabling pedigree-free estimation of trait heritabilities in wild populations. However, until now, most quantitative genetic studies based on a genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) have focused on long-term monitored populations for which traditional pedigrees were also available, and have often had access to knowledge of genome sequence and variability. Here, we investigated the potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating heritability in a free-ranging roe deer population for which no prior genomic resources were available. We propose a step-by-step analytical framework to optimize the quality and quantity of the genomic data and explore the impact of the SNP calling and filtering processes on the GRM structure and GRM-based heritability estimates. As expected, our results show that sequence coverage strongly affects the number of recovered loci, the genotyping error rate and the amount of missing data. Ultimately, this had little effect on heritability estimates and their standard errors, provided that the GRM was built from a minimum number of loci (above 7000). GRM-based heritability estimates thus appear robust to a moderate level of genotyping errors in the SNP dataset. We also showed that quality filters, such as the removal of low-frequency variants, affect the relatedness structure of the GRM, generating lower h2 estimates. Our work illustrates the huge potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating GRM-based heritability in virtually any natural population.",

    "abstract": "HIV can evolve remarkably quickly in response to anti-retroviral therapies and the immune system. This evolution stymies treatment effectiveness and prevents the development of an HIV vaccine. Consequently, there has been great interest in using population genetics to disentangle the forces that govern the HIV adaptive landscape (selection, drift, mutation, recombination). Traditional population genetics approaches look at the current state of genetic variation and infer the processes that can generate them [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, because HIV evolves rapidly, we can also sample populations repeatedly over time and watch evolution in action [5, 6, 7]. In this paper, we demonstrate how time series data can bound evolutionary parameters in a way that complements and informs traditional population genetic approaches.\\n\\nSpecifically, we focus on our recent paper [2], in which we show that, as improved HIV drugs have led to fewer patients failing therapy due to resistance evolution, less genetic diversity has been maintained following the fixation of drug resistance mutations. We interpret this as evidence that resistance to early HIV drugs that failed quickly and predictably was driven by soft sweeps while evolution of resistance to better drugs is both less frequent and when it takes place it is associated with harder sweeps due to an effectively lower HIV population mutation rate ({theta}). Recently, Harris et al. have proposed an alternative interpretation [8]: the signal could be due to an increase in the selective benefit of mutations conferring resistance to better drugs. Therefore, better drugs lead to faster sweeps with less opportunity for recombination to rescue diversity. In this paper, we use time series data to show that drug resistance evolution during ineffective treatment is very fast, providing new evidence that soft sweeps drove early HIV treatment failure.",

This study provides novel insights into how linguistic associative knowledge is acquired by systematically tracking schematic knowledge formation while participants were learning an abstract artificial language organized by higher-order associative regularity. During learning, we found activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in response to knowledge updating during feedback presentation, as well as in response to available accumulated knowledge during retrieval. A complementary signal was found in the caudate nucleus, where activity correlated with the availability of recently acquired knowledge during retrieval, suggesting it initially supports the retrieval of knowledge. Furthermore, we find that activity in a set of regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, scaled with accumulated knowledge during feedback presentation, which might be indicative of increased generalization of features of the hierarchical knowledge structure. Together, these results provide a mechanistic insight into how linguistic associative knowledge is acquired by generalization across repeated learning experiences.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImputation has become a standard approach in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to infer in silico untyped markers. Although feasibility for common variants imputation is well established, we aimed to assess rare and ultra-rare variants imputation in an admixed Caribbean Hispanic population (CH).\n\nMethodsWe evaluated imputation accuracy in CH (N = 1,000), focusing on rare (0.1% [&le;]minor allele frequency (MAF) [&le;] 1%) and ultra-rare (MAF < 0.1%) variants. We used two reference panels, the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC; N = 27,165) and 1000 Genome Project (1000G phase 3; N = 2,504) and multiple phasing (SHAPEIT, Eagle2) and imputation algorithms (IMPUTE2, MACH-Admix). To assess imputation quality, we reported: a) high-quality variant counts according to imputation tools internal indexes (e.g. IMPUTE2 \"Info\"[&ge;]80%). b) Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test comparing imputation quality for genotyped variants that were masked and imputed; c) Cohens kappa coefficient to test agreement between imputed and whole-exome sequencing (WES) variants; d) imputation of G206A mutation in the PSEN1 (ultra-rare in the general population an more frequent in CH) followed by confirmation genotyping. We also tested ancestry proportion (European, African and Native American) against WES-imputation mismatches in a Poisson regression fashion.\n\nResultsSHAPEIT2 retrieved higher percentage of imputed high-quality variants than Eagle2 (rare: 51.02% vs. 48.60%; ultra-rare 0.66% vs 0.65%, Wilcoxon p-value < 0.001). SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 employing HRC outperformed 1000G (64.50% vs. 59.17%; 1.69% vs 0.75% for high-quality rare and ultra-rare variants, respectively; Wilcoxon p-value < 0.001). SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 outperformed MaCH-Admix. Compared to 1000G, HRC-imputation retrieved a higher number of high-quality rare and ultra-rare variants, despite showing lower agreement between imputed and WES variants (e.g. rare: 98.86% for HRC vs. 99.02% for 1000G). High Kappa (K = 0.99) was observed for both reference panels. Twelve G206A mutation carriers were imputed and all validated by confirmation genotyping. African ancestry was associated with higher imputation errors for uncommon and rare variants (p-value < 1e-05).\n\nConclusionReference panels with larger numbers of haplotypes can improve imputation quality for rare and ultra-rare variants in admixed populations such as CH. Ethnic composition is an important predictor of imputation accuracy, with higher African ancestry associated with poorer imputation accuracy.",

Animal models of incubation may help develop treatments to prevent relapse, but these models have ubiquitously focused on the role of conditioned stimuli (CSs) signaling drug delivery. From a translational perspective this is problematic because people encounter these stimuli only during or after relapse. For this reason, incubation in response to discriminative stimuli (DSs) that signal drug availability before relapse, not yet examined in preclinical studies, could be more relevant to relapse prevention. We trained rats to self-administer cocaine (or palatable food) under DS control, then investigated DS-controlled incubation of craving, in the absence of drug-paired CSs. DS-controlled cocaine (but not palatable food) seeking incubated over 60 days of abstinence and persisted up to 300 days. Understanding the neural mechanisms of this DS-controlled incubation holds significant promise for drug relapse treatments.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBetter understanding of the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be critical to developing novel, effective therapeutics. Here, we conducted a data-driven investigation using a well-established, graph-based topological measure of nodal strength to determine the extent of functional dysconnectivity in a cohort of active duty US Army soldiers with PTSD compared to controls.\\n\\nMETHODS102 participants with (n=50) or without PTSD (n=52) completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest and during symptom provocation using subject-specific script imagery. Vertex/voxel global brain connectivity with global signal regression (GBCr), a measure of nodal strength, was calculated as the average of its functional connectivity with all other vertices/voxels in the brain gray matter.\\n\\nRESULTSIn contrast to during resting-state, where there were no group differences, we found a significantly higher GBCr, in PTSD participants compared to controls, in areas within the right hemisphere, including anterior insula, caudal-ventrolateral prefrontal, and rostral-ventrolateral parietal cortices. Overall, these clusters overlapped with the ventral and dorsal salience networks. Post hoc analysis showed increased GBCr in these salience clusters during symptom provocation compared to resting-state. In addition, resting-state GBCr in the salience clusters predicted GBCr during symptom provocation in PTSD participants but not in controls.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONIn PTSD, increased connectivity within the salience network has been previously hypothesized, based primarily on seed-based connectivity findings. The current results strongly support this hypothesis using whole-brain network measure in a fully data-driven approach. It remains to be seen in future studies whether these identified salience disturbances would normalize following treatment.",
