    "abstract": "Anoxic subsurface sediments contain communities of heterotrophic microorganisms that metabolize organic carbon at extraordinarily slow rates. In order to assess the mechanisms by which subsurface microorganisms access detrital sedimentary organic matter, we measured kinetics of a range of extracellular peptidases in anoxic sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC. Nine distinct peptidase substrates were enzymatically hydrolyzed at all depths. Potential peptidase activities (Vmax) decreased with increasing sediment depth, although Vmax expressed on a per cell basis was approximately the same at all depths. Half-saturation constants (Km) decreased with depth, indicating peptidases that functioned more efficiently at low substrate concentrations. Potential activities of extracellular peptidases acting on molecules that are enriched in degraded organic matter (D-phenylalanine and L-ornithine) increased relative to enzymes that act on L-phenylalanine, further suggesting microbial community adaptation to access degraded organic matter. Nineteen classes of predicted, exported peptidases were identified in genomic data from the same site, of which genes for class C25 (gingipain-like) peptidases represented more than 40% at each depth. Methionine aminopeptidases, zinc carboxypeptidases, and class S24-like peptidases, which are involved in single-stranded DNA repair, were also abundant. These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic microbial community that primarily accesses low-quality detrital organic matter via a diverse suite of well-adapted extracellular enzymes.\\n\\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWBurial of organic carbon in marine and estuarine sediments represents a long-term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Globally, [~]40% of organic carbon burial occurs in anoxic estuaries and deltaic systems. However, the ultimate controls on the amount of organic matter that is buried in sediments, versus oxidized into CO2, are poorly constrained. Here we used a combination of enzyme assays and metagenomic analysis to identify how subsurface microbial communities catalyze the first step of proteinaceous organic carbon degradation. Our results show that microbial communities in deeper sediments are adapted to access molecules characteristic of degraded organic matter, suggesting that those heterotrophs are adapted to life in the subsurface.",

    "abstract": "The notion that sensitivity to the statistical structure of the environment is pivotal to perception has recently garnered considerable attention. Here we investigated this issue in the context of hearing. Building on previous work (Sohoglu & Chait, 2016b), stimuli were artificial  sound-scapes populated by multiple (up to 14) simultaneous sources ( auditory objects) comprised of tone-pip sequences, each with a distinct frequency and pattern of amplitude modulation. Sequences were either temporally regular or random.\\n\\nWe show that listeners ability to detect abrupt appearance or disappearance of a source is facilitated when scene sources were characterized by a temporally regular fluctuation pattern. The patterning of the changing source as well as that of the background (non-changing) sources contribute independently to this effect. Remarkably, listeners benefit from regularity even when they are not consciously aware of it. These findings establish that perception of complex acoustic scenes relies on the availability of detailed representations of the regularities automatically extracted from each scene source.",

    "abstract": "Active sensing by means of light is rare. In vertebrates, it is known only from chemiluminescent fish with light organs below their pupils, an anatomical arrangement that is ideal to generate eyeshine in the pupils of nearby organisms. Here, we test whether diurnal fish can achieve the same by redirecting sunlight through reflection instead. We recently showed that small (< 5 cm), benthic, marine triplefin fish actively redirect downwelling light using their iris. We hypothesized that this mechanism allows triplefins to improve detection of a cryptic organism by generating eyeshine in its pupil. Here, we tested this by attaching small dark hats to triplefins to shade their iris from downwelling light. Two controls consisted of triplefins with a clear or no hat. These treatments test the prediction that light redirection increases the visual detection ability of triplefins. To this end, we placed treated fish in a tank with a display compartment containing either a stone as the control stimulus, or a scorpionfish, i.e. a cryptic, motionless triplefin predator with retroreflective eyes. After overnight acclimatization, we determined the average distance triplefins kept from the display compartment over two days. Both in the laboratory (n = 15 replicates per treatment) and in a similar field experiment at 15 m depth (n = 43 replicates per treatment) fish kept longer distances from the scorpionfish than from the stone. This response varied between hat treatments: shaded triplefins stayed significantly closer to the scorpionfish in the laboratory and in one of two orientations tested in the field. A follow-up field experiment at 10 m depth revealed the immediate response of triplefins to a scorpionfish. At first, many individuals (n = 80) moved towards it, with shaded triplefins getting significantly closer. All individuals then gradually moved to a safer distance at the opposite half of the tank. Visual modelling supported the experimental results by showing that triplefins can redirect enough light with their iris to increase a scorpionfishs pupil brightness above detection threshold at a distance of 7 cm under average field conditions and at more than 12 cm under favorable conditions. We conclude that triplefins are generally good in the visual detection of a cryptic predator, but can significantly improve this ability when able to redirect downwelling light with their iris and induce eyeshine in the predators pupil. We discuss the consequences of \\\"diurnal active photolocation\\\" for visual detection and camouflage among fish species.",

We describe here a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework which makes two major advances: an efficient parallel implementation, allowing parameter estimation for more complex forward models, and a system for practical model selection, allowing evidence-based comparison between distinct physical models. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by generating simulated noisy flow velocity data from a branching arterial tree model in which a structural defect is introduced at an unknown location; our approach is shown to accurately locate the abnormality and estimate its physical properties even in the presence of significant observational and systemic error. As the method readily admits real data, it shows great potential in patient-specific parameter fitting for hemodynamical flow models.",

    "abstract": "The ability to speak coherently is essential for effective communication but declines with age: older people more frequently produce tangential, off-topic speech. Little is known, however, about the neural systems that support coherence in speech production. Here, fMRI was used to investigate extended speech production in healthy older adults. Computational linguistic analyses were used to quantify the coherence of utterances produced in the scanner, allowing identification of the neural correlates of coherence for the first time. Highly coherent speech production was associated with increased activity in bilateral inferior prefrontal cortex (BA45), an area implicated in selection of task-relevant knowledge from semantic memory, and in bilateral rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA10), implicated more generally in planning of complex goal-directed behaviours. These findings demonstrate that neural activity during spontaneous speech production can be predicted from formal analysis of speech content, and that multiple prefrontal systems contribute to coherence in speech.",

    "abstract": "How do humans search for rewards? This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an options spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Many models of classical conditioning fail to describe important phenomena, notably the rapid return of fear after extinction. To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the models ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational researchers are increasingly interested in a structured form of learning known as latent-state inferences. Latent-state inferences is a type of learning that involves categorizing, generalizing, and recalling disparate associations between observations in ones environment and is used in situations when the correct association is latent or unknown. This type of learning has been used to explain overgeneralization of a fear memory and the cognitive role of certain brain regions important to cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. Accordingly, latent-state inferences are an important area of inquiry. Through simulation and theory, we establish a new model of latent-state inferences. Moving forward, we aim to use this framework to measure latent-state inferences in healthy and psychiatric populations.",

    "abstract": "In human sperm, a fraction of its chromatin retains nucleosomes that are positioned on specific sequences containing genes and regulatory units essential for embryonic development. This nucleosome positioning (NP) feature provides an inherited epigenetic mark for sperm. However, it is not known whether there is a structural constraint for these nucleosomes and, if so, how they are localized in a three-dimensional (3D) context of the sperm nucleus. In this study, we examine the 3D organization of sperm chromatin and specifically determine its 3D localization of nucleosomes using structured illumination microscopy. A fraction of the sperm chromatin form nucleosome domains (NDs), visible as microscopic puncta ranging from 40 m to 700 m in diameter, and these NDs are precisely localized in the postacrosome region (PAR), outside the sperms core chromatin. Importantly, these types of NDs exist only in sperm from fertile men but not in sperm from sterile men. This study uncovers a new spatially restricted sub-nuclear structure containing NDs that are consistent with NPs of the sperm. This represents a novel form of epigenetic mark for healthy sperms and can provide a potential new therapeutic and diagnostic target for treating male infertility.",

    "abstract": "HIV can evolve remarkably quickly in response to anti-retroviral therapies and the immune system. This evolution stymies treatment effectiveness and prevents the development of an HIV vaccine. Consequently, there has been great interest in using population genetics to disentangle the forces that govern the HIV adaptive landscape (selection, drift, mutation, recombination). Traditional population genetics approaches look at the current state of genetic variation and infer the processes that can generate them [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, because HIV evolves rapidly, we can also sample populations repeatedly over time and watch evolution in action [5, 6, 7]. In this paper, we demonstrate how time series data can bound evolutionary parameters in a way that complements and informs traditional population genetic approaches.\\n\\nSpecifically, we focus on our recent paper [2], in which we show that, as improved HIV drugs have led to fewer patients failing therapy due to resistance evolution, less genetic diversity has been maintained following the fixation of drug resistance mutations. We interpret this as evidence that resistance to early HIV drugs that failed quickly and predictably was driven by soft sweeps while evolution of resistance to better drugs is both less frequent and when it takes place it is associated with harder sweeps due to an effectively lower HIV population mutation rate ({theta}). Recently, Harris et al. have proposed an alternative interpretation [8]: the signal could be due to an increase in the selective benefit of mutations conferring resistance to better drugs. Therefore, better drugs lead to faster sweeps with less opportunity for recombination to rescue diversity. In this paper, we use time series data to show that drug resistance evolution during ineffective treatment is very fast, providing new evidence that soft sweeps drove early HIV treatment failure.",

    "abstract": "Although neural responses with a millisecond precision were reported in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex of multiple species, the presence and role of such a fine temporal structure is still debated at the cortical level and the general belief remains that early visual system encodes information at slower timescales. In this study, we used a new stimulation platform to generate visual stimuli that were very precisely encoded in time and we characterized in human subjects the EEG responses to moving patterns that shared the same global motion but differed in their fine scale spatio-temporal properties. In two experiments, we manipulated the information within temporal windows that corresponded to the frame duration in conventional (1/60 = 16.7ms, experience 1) and more recent (1/120 = 8.3ms, experience 2) visual displays. Our results demonstrate that EEG responses to temporally dense and coherent trajectories are significantly stronger than those to control conditions without these properties. They extend previous results from our group that showed that accurate temporal information (<10ms) significantly improve perceptual judgments on spatial discrimination, digit recognition and sensitivity for speed [Kime et al., 2016]. Altogether, our results suggest that instead of low-pass filtering the temporal information it receives from its thalamic afferents, the visual cortex may actually exploit its richness to improve visual perception.\\n\\nSignificance statementMost visual experiments use frame-based stimulation screens which are synchronous and slow. This might not engage the full encoding capacity of the visual system, as in natural condition, visual information is asynchronously acquired by the retina with a very high temporal resolution. In the present study, we used an unconventional and highly configurable stimulation platform to determine the EEG responses to moving patterns that shared the same global motion but differed in their fine scale (<10ms) spatio-temporal properties. Our results demonstrate that brain responses in human are significantly stronger for motion patterns that are refreshed at very high frame rate (360Hz) and thereby provide a strong support for the use of very precise temporal stimulations in vision studies.",

Yet, the possibility that plants emit airborne sounds when stressed - similarly to many animals - has not been investigated.

We recorded [~]65 dBSPL ultrasonic sounds 10 cm from tomato and tobacco plants, implying that these sounds could be detected by some organisms from up to several meters away. We developed machine learning models that were capable of distinguishing between plant sounds and general noises, and identifying the condition of the plants - dry, cut, or intact - based solely on the emitted sounds. Our results suggest that animals, humans, and possibly even other plants, could use sounds emitted by a plant to gain information about the plants condition. More investigation on plant bioacoustics in general and on sound emission in plants in particular may open new avenues for understanding plants and their interactions with the environment, and it may also have a significant impact on agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Glioma tumor dispersion involves invading cells escaping the tumor bulk and migrating into the healthy brain parenchyma. Here, they encounter linearly aligned track-like tissue structures such as axon bundles and the perivascular space. These environments also contain micrometer-scale pores that impose mechanical confinement on invading cells. To study glioma cell migration in an in vitro system that reproduces some of these features, we used microfluidic devices with 60 m2 cross-sectional area channels that confine cells into one-dimensional (1D) tracks. Individual cell tracking revealed strongly persistent migration at a mean rate of 8.5 {+/-} 0.33 nm s-1. Notably, a 1D computational cell migration simulator predicts migration behaviors of glioma cells without significant adjustment of parameters estimated from previous experiments on two-dimensional (2D) substrates. Pharmacological inhibitors of integrin-mediated adhesions, myosin II activation, or drugs targeting F-actin assembly or microtubule dynamics influence migration consistent with simulations where relevant parameters are changed. These results suggest that cell parameters calibrated to a motor-clutch model on 2D substrates effectively predict 1D confined migration behaviors a priori. Our results outline a method for testing biophysical mechanisms of tumor cell migration in confined spaces and predicting the effects of anti-motility therapy.",

    "abstract": "Humans often fail to identify a target because of nearby flankers. The nature and stage(s) at which this \\\"crowding\\\" occurs are unclear, and whether crowding operates via a common mechanism across visual dimensions is unknown. Using a dual estimation report, we quantitatively assessed the processing of each feature alone and in conjunction with another feature both within and between dimensions. Crowding emerged due to confusion between orientations or colors of target and flankers, but averaging of their spatial frequencies (SFs). Furthermore, crowding of orientation and color were independent, but crowding of orientation and SF were interdependent. This qualitative difference of crowding errors across dimensions revealed a tight link between crowding and  illusory conjunctions (mis-binding of feature dimensions). These results and a computational model suggest that crowding and illusory conjunction in the visual periphery are due to pooling across a joint coding of orientation and spatial frequencies but not of color.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecently, there has been increasing concern about the replicability, or lack thereof, of published research. An especially high rate of false discoveries has been reported in some areas motivating the creation of resource-intensive collaborations to estimate the replication rate of published research by repeating a large number of studies. The substantial amount of resources required by these replication projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings.\\n\\nMethods and findingsIn 2013, Jager and Leek developed a method to estimate the empirical false discovery rate from journal abstracts and applied their method to five high profile journals. Here, we use the relative efficiency of Jager and Leeks method to gather p-values from over 30,000 abstracts and to subsequently estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a five-year time span. We model the empirical false discovery rate by journal subject area (cancer or general medicine), impact factor, and Open Access status. We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer vs. general medicine journals (p = 5.14E-6). Within cancer journals, we find that this relationship is further modified by journal impact factor where a lower journal impact factor is associated with a higher empirical false discovery rates (p = 0.012, 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). We find no significant differences, on average, in the false discovery rate for Open Access vs closed access journals (p = 0.256, 95% CI: -0.014, 0.051).\\n\\nConclusionsWe find evidence of a higher false discovery rate in cancer journals compared to general medicine journals, especially those with a lower journal impact factor. For cancer journals, a lower journal impact factor of one point is associated with a 0.006 increase in the empirical false discovery rate, on average. For a false discovery rate of 0.05, this would result in over a 10% increase to 0.056. Conversely, we find no significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access vs. closed access journals from InCites. Our results provide identify areas of research that may need of additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research.",

Despite the explosive growth in the number of cells that can be assayed by a single experiment, scRNA-seq still has several limitations, including high rates of dropouts, which result in a large number of genes having zero read count in the scRNA-seq data, and complicate downstream analyses.\\n\\nMethodsTo overcome this problem, we treat zeros as missing values and develop nonparametric deep learning methods for imputation. Specifically, our LATE (Learning with AuToEncoder) method trains an autoencoder with random initial values of the parameters, whereas our TRANSLATE (TRANSfer learning with LATE) method further allows for the use of a reference gene expression data set to provide LATE with an initial set of parameter estimates.\\n\\nResultsOn both simulated and real data, LATE and TRANSLATE outperform existing scRNA-seq imputation methods, achieving lower mean squared error in most cases, recovering nonlinear gene-gene relationships, and better separating cell types. They are also highly scalable and can efficiently process over 1 million cells in just a few hours on a GPU.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that our nonparametric approach to imputation based on autoencoders is powerful and highly efficient.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are common intracellular bacteria that are generally found in arthropods including a high proportion of insects and also some nematodes. This intracellular symbiont can affect sex ratio with a variety of reproductive anomalies in the host, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in haplodiploides. In this study, we questioned if the parasitoid wasp, Habrobracon hebetor (Hym.: Braconidae), which is one of the most important biological control agents of many lepidopteran larvae, is infected with Wolbachia. To test this, DNA was extracted from adult insects and subjected to PCR using specific primers to Wolbachia target genes. The results showed high rate of Wolbachia infection in this parasitoid wasp. To find out the biological function of Wolbachia in H. hebetor, we removed this bacterium from the wasps using antibiotic treatment (cured wasps). Results of the crossing experiments revealed that Wolbachiainduced CI in H. hebetor in which cured females crossed with infected males produced only males, while in the progeny of other crosses, both males and females were observed. Also, our result showed that the presence of Wolbachia in the females increased fecundity and female offspring of this parasitoid wasp. However, the presence of Wolbachia in the males had no significant effect on the fecundity and female production, but might have incurred costs. We also investigated the effect of Wolbachia on mate choice and found that Wolbachia affects mating behavior of H. hebetor. Together, we show that Wolbachia induce CI in H. hebetor and affect host mating behavior in favor of its transmission. Wolbachia utilize these strategies to increase the frequency of infected females in the host population.",

    "abstract": "Our recent study established the role of integrins in KGF-induced oral epithelial adhesion and rete peg elongation. However, how extracellular matrix remodeling cooperates with the increased epithelial adhesion during rete peg elongation has yet to be determined. Podosomes are cell-matrix contact structures that combine several abilities, including adhesion and matrix degradation. In the present study, we identified podosome formation at the ventral side of human immortalized oral epithelial cells (HIOECs) upon KGF treatment. Moreover, podosomal components colocalized with the F-actin-cortactin complex and matrix degradation assays demonstrated the ability of the F-actin-cortactin complex to degrade matrix. Inhibition both of integrin subunits {beta}4 and {beta}l with specific blocking antibodies and inhibition of Erk1/2 abrogated the KGF-induced podosome formation. Notably, knockdown of integrin subunits {beta}4 and {beta}l with specific siRNA downregulated the phosphorylation levels of Erk1/2. In contrast, inhibition of both Erk1/2 could upregulate the expression of integrin subunits {beta}4 and {beta}1. These results demonstrate that KGF induces podosome formation via integrin-Erk1/2 signaling in HIOECs, suggesting a novel mechanism by which integrins enhance oral epithelial adhesion and rete peg elongation.\\n\\nSummary StatementHuman immortalized oral epithelial cells can form podosomes after stimulation with KGF during which integrin-Erk1/2 signaling play essential roles.",

    "abstract": "Our decisions often depend on multiple sensory experiences separated by time delays. The brain can remember these experiences and, simultaneously, estimate the timing between events. To understand the mechanisms underlying working memory and time encoding we analyze neural activity recorded during delays in four experiments on non-human primates. To disambiguate potential mechanisms, we propose two analyses, namely, decoding the passage of time from neural data, and computing the cumulative dimensionality of the neural trajectory over time. Time can be decoded with high precision in tasks where timing information is relevant and with lower precision when irrelevant for performing the task. Neural trajectories are always observed to be low dimensional. These constraints rule out working memory models that rely on constant, sustained activity, and neural networks with high dimensional trajectories, like reservoir networks. Instead, recurrent networks trained with backpropagation capture the time encoding properties and the dimensionality observed in the data.",

    "abstract": "Attention selectively routes the most behaviorally relevant information among the vast pool of sensory inputs through cortical regions. Previous studies have shown that visual attention samples the surrounding stimuli periodically. However, the neural mechanism underlying this sampling in the sensory cortex, and whether the brain actively uses these rhythms, has remained elusive. Here, we hypothesize that selective attention controls the phase of oscillatory synaptic activities to efficiently process the relevant information in the brain. We document an attentional modulation of pre-stimulus inter-trial phase coherence (a measure of deviation between instantaneous phases of trials) at low frequencies in macaque visual area MT. Our data reveal that phase coherence increases when attention is deployed towards the receptive field of the recorded neural population. We further show that the attentional enhancement of phase coherence is positively correlated with the attentional modulation of stimulus induced firing rate, and importantly, a higher phase coherence leads to a faster behavioral response. Our results suggest a functional utilization of intrinsic neural oscillatory activities for better processing upcoming environmental stimuli, generating the optimal behavior.",

    "abstract": "Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an allotetraploid Cyprinid species derived from recent whole genome duplication and provides an excellent model system for studying polyploid genome evolution in vertebrates. To explore the origins and consequences of tetraploidy in C. carpio, we generated three chromosome-level new reference genomes of C. carpio and compared them to the related diploid Cyprinid genome sequences. We identified a progenitor-like diploid Barbinae lineage by analysing the phylogenetic relationship of the homoeologous genes of C. carpio and their orthologues in closely related diploid Cyprinids. We then characterized the allotetraploid origin of C. carpio and divided its genome into two homoeologous subgenomes that are marked by a distinct genome similarity to their diploid progenitor. On the basis of the divergence rates of homoeologous genes and transposable elements in two subgenomes, we estimated that the two diploid progenitor species diverged approximately 23 million years ago (Mya) and merged to form the allotetraploid C. carpio approximately 12.4 Mya, which likely correlated with environmental upheavals caused by the extensive uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. No large-scale gene losses or rediploidization were observed in the two subgenomes. Instead, we found extensive homoeologous gene expression bias across twelve surveyed tissues, which indicates that subgenome B is dominant in homoeologous expression. DNA methylation analysis suggested that CG methylation in promoter regions plays an important role in altering the expression of these homoeologous genes in allotetraploid C. carpio. This study provides an essential genome resource and insights for extending further investigation on the evolutionary consequences of vertebrate polyploidy.",

    "abstract": "Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the leading cause of cervical cancer. Although the fundamental link between HPV infection and oncogenesis is established, the specific mechanisms of virus-mediated transformation remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that the HPV encoded E6 protein increases the activity of the proto-oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 in primary human keratinocytes; however, the molecular basis for STAT3 activation in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we show that STAT3 phosphorylation in HPV positive cervical cancer cells is mediated primarily via autocrine activation by the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6 (IL-6). Antibody-mediated blockade of IL-6 signalling in HPV positive cells inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas both recombinant IL-6 and conditioned media from HPV positive cells leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation within HPV negative cervical cancer cells. Interestingly, we demonstrate that non-conventional activation of the transcription factor NF{kappa}B, involving the protein kinase Akt, is required for IL-6 production and subsequent STAT3 activation. Our data provides new insights into the molecular re-wiring of cancer cells by HPV E6. We reveal that activation of an IL-6 signalling axis drives the autocrine and paracrine phosphorylation of STAT3 within HPV positive cervical cancers cells. Greater understanding of this pathway provides a potential opportunity for the use of existing clinically approved drugs for the treatment of HPV-mediated cervical cancer.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPersistent infection with HPV is the predominant cause of anogenital and oral cancers. Transformation requires the re-wiring of signalling pathways in infected cells by virus encoded oncoproteins. At this point a comprehensive understanding of the full range of host pathways necessary for HPV-mediated carcinogenesis is still lacking. In this study we describe a signalling circuit resulting in the aberrant production of the IL-6 cytokine. Mediated by the HPV E6 oncoprotein, it requires activation of the NF{kappa}B transcription factor. The autocrine and paracrine actions of IL-6 are essential for STAT3 activation in HPV-positive cervical cancers. This study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms by which a virus encoded oncoprotein activates an oncogenic pathway, and illuminates potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",
