    "abstract": "The role of norepinephrine (NE) in visuo-spatial attention remains poorly understood. Our goal was to identify the attentional processes under the influence of NE and to characterize these influences. We tested the effects of atomoxetine injections (ATX), a NE-reuptake inhibitor that boosts the level of NE in the brain, on seven monkeys performing a saccadic cued task in which cues and distractors were used to manipulate spatial attention. We found that when the cue accurately predicted the location of the upcoming cue in 80% of the trials, ATX consistently improved attentional orienting, as measured from reaction times (RTs). These effects were best accounted for by a faster accumulation rate in the valid trials, rather than by a change in the decision threshold. By contrast, the effect of ATX on alerting and distractor interference was more mitigated. Finally, we also found that, under ATX, RTs to non-cued targets were longer when these were presented separately from cued targets. This suggests that the impact of NE on visuo-spatial attention depends on the context, such that the adaptive changes elicited by the highly informative value of the cues in the most frequent trials were accompanied by a cost in the less frequent trials.",

    "abstract": "When dealing with multiple tasks, we often find ourselves in the problem of establishing the order in which to tackle them. Here we asked whether confidence, the subjective feeling in the accuracy of our decisions, plays an active role in this ordering problem. In a series of experiments, we show that confidence acts as a priority signal when ordering responses about tasks already completed, or ordering tasks that are to be made. In experiments 1-3, participants were engaged in a dual task and categorized perceptual stimuli along two dimensions. We found that they tended to give first the decision in which they were more confident. We also prove that confidence drives prioritization above and beyond task difficulty or response accuracy, and we discard alternative interpretations in terms of response availability or task demands. In experiments 4-6, we show that when participants have to select which of two sets of trials they want to perform first, they engage first in the set associated with higher confidence, and we extend this finding to situations involving non-perceptual (mental calculation) decisions. Our results thus support the role of confidence as a priority signal, thereby demonstrating a new way in which it regulates human behavior.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe show that when having to decide the order in which to approach two tasks, humans prefer to start with the one they feel more confident in.\\nC_LIO_LIThis holds both when deciding in which order to report two already completed tasks, and when deciding the order in which to tackle two tasks yet to complete.

    "abstract": "Itch is a distinct aversive sensation that elicits a strong urge to scratch. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the peripheral basis of itch, we know very little regarding how central neural circuits modulate acute and chronic itch processing. Here we establish the causal contributions of defined periaqueductal gray (PAG) neuronal populations in itch modulation. Chemogenetic manipulations demonstrate bidirectional modulation of scratching by neurons in the PAG. Fiber photometry studies show that activity of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the PAG is modulated in an opposing manner during chloroquine-evoked scratching. Furthermore, activation of PAG GABAergic neurons or inhibition of glutamatergic neurons resulted in attenuation of scratching in both acute and chronic pruritis. Surprisingly, PAG GABAergic neurons, but not glutamatergic neurons, seem to encode the aversive component of itch. Thus, the PAG represents a neuromodulatory hub that regulates both the sensory and affective aspects of acute and chronic itch.",

    "abstract": "Coupling of neuronal oscillations may reflect and facilitate the communication between neuronal populations. Two primary neuronal coupling modes have been described: phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling. Theoretically, both coupling modes are independent, but so far, their neuronal relationship remains unclear. Here, we combined MEG, source-reconstruction and simulations to systematically compare cortical phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling patterns in the human brain. Importantly, we took into account a critical bias of amplitude-coupling measures due to phase-coupling. We found differences between both coupling modes across a broad frequency range and most of the cortex. Furthermore, by combining empirical measurements and simulations we ruled out that these results were caused by methodological biases, but instead reflected genuine neuronal amplitude coupling. Overall, our results suggest that cortical phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns are non-redundant, which may reflect at least partly distinct neuronal mechanisms. Furthermore, our findings highlight and clarify the compound nature of amplitude coupling measures.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISystematic comparison of cortical phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns\\nC_LIO_LIDemonstration of genuine amplitude coupling independent of phase coupling bias\\nC_LIO_LIAmplitude- and phase coupling patterns differ across many cortical regions and frequencies\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The purpose of perception is driving action. During tasting, for instance, every stimulus must be either swallowed or rejected (the latter via a behavior known as \"gaping\"). Taste responses in the rodent primary gustatory cortex (GC) span this sensorimotor divide, progressing through a series of firing epochs that culminate in the emergence of action-related firing. Population analyses reveal this emergence to be a sudden, coherent ensemble transition that, despite varying in latency between trials, precedes gaping onset by 0.2-0.3s. Here, we tested whether this transition drives gaping, delivering 0.5s GC perturbations at various time-points in tasting trials. Perturbations significantly delayed gaping, but only when they preceded the action-related transition - thus, the same perturbation might have an impact or not, depending on the transition latency in that particular trial. Our results suggest a distributed attractor network model of taste processing, and a dynamical role for cortex in driving motor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose origin and underlying cellular defects are still not fully understood. While motor neuron degeneration is the signature feature of ALS, it is not yet clear if motor neurons, or other cells of the motor circuit, are the site of disease initiation. To better understand the contribution of multiple cell types in ALS, we made use of a Drosophila Sod1G85R knock-in model, in which all cells harbor the disease allele. End-stage dSod1G85R animals exhibit severe motor deficits with clear degeneration of motor neurons. Interestingly, earlier in dSod1G85R larvae motor function is also compromised, but their motor neurons exhibit only subtle morphological and electrophysiological changes, that are unlikely to cause the observed decrease in locomotion. We analyzed the intact motor circuit and identified a defect in sensory feedback that likely accounts for the altered motor activity of dSod1G85R. Furthermore, we found that the cell-autonomous activation of BMP signaling in proprioceptor sensory neurons that relay the contractile status of muscles back to the central nerve cord, is able to completely rescue early stage motor defects and partially rescue late stage motor function to extend lifespan. Identifying a defect in sensory feedback as a potential initiating event in ALS motor dysfunction, coupled with the ability of modified proprioceptors to alleviate such motor deficits, underscores the critical role that non-motor neurons play in disease progression and highlights their potential as a site to identify early-stage ALS biomarkers and for therapeutic intervention.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAt diagnosis, many cellular processes are already disrupted in the ALS patient. Identifying the initiating cellular events is critical for achieving an earlier diagnosis in order to slow or prevent disease progression. Our findings indicate that neurons relaying sensory information underlie early stage motor deficits in a Drosophila knock-in model of ALS that best replicates gene dosage in familial ALS (fALS). Importantly, studies on intact motor circuits revealed defects in sensory feedback before evidence of motor neuron degeneration. These findings strengthen our understanding of how neural circuit dysfunctions lead to neurodegeneration and coupled with our demonstration that activation of BMP signaling in proprioceptors alleviates both early and late motor dysfunction, underscores the importance of considering non-motor neurons as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "We present the first evidence for vascular regulation driving fMRI signals in specific functional brain networks. Using concurrent neuronal and vascular stimuli, we collected 30 BOLD fMRI datasets in 10 healthy individuals: a working memory task, flashing checkerboard stimulus, and CO2 inhalation challenge were delivered in concurrent but orthogonal paradigms. The resulting imaging data were averaged together and decomposed using independent component analysis, and three \\\"neuronal networks\\\" were identified as demonstrating maximum temporal correlation with the neuronal stimulus paradigms: Default Mode Network, Task Positive Network, and Visual Network. For each of these, we observed a second network component with high spatial overlap. Using dual regression in the original 30 datasets, we extracted the time-series associated with these network pairs and calculated the percent of variance explained by the neuronal or vascular stimuli using a normalized R2 parameter. In each pairing, one network was dominated by the appropriate neuronal stimulus, and the other was dominated by the vascular stimulus as represented by the end-tidal CO2 time-series recorded in each scan. We acquired a second dataset in 8 of the original participants, where no CO2 challenge was delivered and CO2 levels fluctuated naturally with breathing variations. Although splitting of functional networks was not robust in these data, performing dual regression with the network maps from the original analysis in this new dataset successfully replicated our observations. Thus, in addition to responding to localized metabolic changes, the brains vasculature may be regulated in a coordinated manner that mimics (and potentially supports) specific functional brain networks. Multi-modal imaging and advances in fMRI acquisition and analysis could facilitate further study of the dual nature of functional brain networks. It will be critical to understand network-specific vascular function, and the behavior of a coupled vascular-neural network, in future studies of brain pathology.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial focused ultrasound has the promise to evolve into a transformative noninvasive way to modulate activity of neuronal circuits deep in the brain. The approach may enable systematic and causal mapping of how individual brain circuits are involved in specific behaviors and behavioral disorders. Previous studies demonstrated neuromodulatory potential, but the effect polarity, size, and spatial specificity have been difficult to assess. Here, we engaged non-human primates (macaca mulatta) in an established task that provides a well defined framework to characterize the neuromodulatory effects. In this task, subjects decide whether to look at a right or a left target, guided by one the targets appearing first. Previous studies showed that excitation/inhibition of oculomotor circuits leads to contralateral/ipsilateral biases in this choice behavior. We found that brief, low-intensity ultrasound stimuli (300 ms, 0.6 MPa, 270 kHz) delivered to the animals left/right frontal eye fields bias the animals decisions to the right/left visual hemifield. The effect was modest, about on the order of that produced when injecting moderate amounts of potent neuromodulatory drugs into the same regions in this task. The polarity of the effects suggested a neuronal excitation within the stimulated regions. No effects were observed when we applied the same stimuli to control brain regions not involved in oculomotor target selection. Together, using an established paradigm, we found that transcranial ultrasound is capable of modulating neurons to the extent of biasing choice behavior of non-human primates. A demonstration of tangible, double-dissociated effects on behavior of primates constitutes a critical step toward applying this noninvasive neuromodulation method in investigations of how specific neural circuits are involved in specific behaviors or disease signs.",

    "abstract": "Multiciliated cells (MCC) are specialized epithelia that contain hundreds of motile cilia used to propel fluid over the surface of the cell. To template these cilia, each MCC produces hundreds of centrioles by a process termed centriole amplification. Airway progenitor cells initially contain two parental centrioles that nucleate multiple centrioles at once, and structures called deuterosomes that assemble the vast majority of centrioles during amplification. Remarkably, how each cell regulates the precise number of its centrioles and cilia remains unknown. Here, we investigate mechanisms that establish centriole number in MCC using an ex vivo airway culture model. We show that ablation of parental centrioles, via inhibition of Plk4 kinase, does not perturb deuterosome formation and centriole amplification, nor alter the total complement of centrioles per cell. Airway MCC vary in size and surface area, and exhibit a broad range in centriole number. Quantification of centriole abundance in vitro and in vivo identified a direct relationship between cell-surface area and centriole number. By manipulating cell size and shape, we discovered that centriole number scales with increasing surface area. Collectively, our results demonstrate that parental centrioles and Plk4 are dispensable for deuterosome formation, centriole amplification, and establishment of centriole number. Instead, a cell-intrinsic surface area-dependent mechanism controls centriole and cilia abundance in multiciliated cells.",

    "abstract": "Protein trafficking in the secretory pathway, for example the secretion of Wnt proteins, requires tight regulation. These ligands activate Wnt signaling pathways and are crucially involved in development and disease. Wnt is transported to the plasma membrane by its cargo receptor Evi, where Wnt/Evi complexes are endocytosed and sorted onto exosomes for long-range secretion. However, the trafficking steps within the endosomal compartment are not fully understood. The promiscuous SNARE Ykt6 folds into an auto-inhibiting conformation in the cytosol, but a portion associates with membranes by its farnesylated and palmitoylated C-terminus. Here, we demonstrate that membrane detachment of Ykt6 is essential for exosomal Wnt secretion. We identified conserved phosphorylation sites within the SNARE domain of Ykt6, which block Ykt6 cycling from the membrane to the cytosol. In Drosophila, Ykt6 RNAi-mediated block of Wg secretion is rescued by wildtype but not phosphomimicking Ykt6. We show that phosphomimicking Ykt6 accumulates at membranes, while wildtype Ykt6 regulates Wnt trafficking between the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we show that exosomal sorting of Wnts is fine-tuned by a regulatory switch in Ykt6 shifting it from a membrane-bound to cytosolic state at the level of endosomal maturation.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear envelope (NE) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subdomain that contains characteristic components dedicated to nuclear functions. These include nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) - the channels for nucleocytoplasmic transport, and the nuclear lamina (NL) - a scaffold for NE and chromatin organization at the nuclear periphery. Since numerous human diseases associated with NE/NL proteins occur in mesenchyme-derived cells, a more comprehensive characterization of proteins concentrated at the NE in these cell types is warranted. Accordingly, we used proteomics to analyze NE and other subcellular fractions isolated from mesenchymal stem cells and from differentiated adipocytes and myocytes. We evaluated the proteomics datasets to calculate relative protein enrichment in the NE fraction, using a spectral abundance-based scoring system that accurately described most benchmark proteins. We then examined five high-scoring transmembrane proteins expressed in all three cell types that were not previously known to be enriched at the NE. Using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy to track ectopically expressed proteins, we validated that all five of these components are substantially concentrated at the NE of multiple cell types. One (Itprip) is exposed to the outer nuclear membrane, a second (Smpd4) is enriched at the NPC, and the three others (Mfsd10, Tmx4, and Arl6ip6) are suggested to reside in the inner nuclear membrane. Considering their sequences and other features, these proteins provide new focal points for studying the functions and membrane dynamics of the NE. Our datasets should be useful for identifying additional NE-concentrated proteins, and for evaluating candidates that are identified in screening.",

Here we show that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) activities, are enriched at chromatin loop anchors with high transcriptional activity. Recurrent DSBs occur at CTCF/cohesin bound sites at the bases of chromatin loops and their frequency positively correlates with transcriptional output and directionality. The physiological relevance of this preferential positioning is indicated by the finding that genes recurrently translocating to drive leukemias, are highly transcribed and are enriched at loop anchors. These genes accumulate DSBs at recurrent hot spots that give rise to chromosomal fusions relying on the activity of both TOP2 isoforms and on transcriptional elongation. We propose that transcription and 3D chromosome folding jointly pose a threat to genomic stability, and are key contributors to the occurrence of genome rearrangements that drive cancer.",

As a prominent property, cell size is modulated by the coordination between these processes in bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.

Based on these findings, we establish and test a molecular competition model that recapitulates cell-cycle-entry dependence on growth rate. As key predictions at a single-cell level, we show that availability of the Ydj1 chaperone and nuclear accumulation of the G1 cyclin Cln3 are inversely dependent on growth rate and readily respond to changes in protein synthesis and stress conditions that alter protein folding requirements. Thus, chaperone workload would subordinate Start to the biosynthetic machinery and dynamically adjust proliferation to the growth potential of the cell.",

    "abstract": "The necessity to obtain relevant structural information from tomographic images is an all-pervasive step in a host of clinical and research-areas. Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is the imaging modality often used among the many available.\\n\\nCurrently approaches to extract structural properties from raw CBCT-images, involve some manual intervention by experts to measure their properties, such as size and displacements of their geometrical structures. Regarding the factors limiting the precision of these measurements, such as voxel-size and image contrast, we find conflicting statements in the literature. It is therefore useful to provide accurate data under well-defined experimental conditions.\\n\\nHere we present a method and associated software to measure displacements of geometrical structures. We also determined the minimum measureable displacement and minimum detectable defect in terms of voxel size. We select as our geometrical structure a sample of bovine bone and to provide a set of defects, we drilled a pattern of holes into it. We determined the holes three-dimensional structures using confocal spectroscopy.\\n\\nIn order to obtain the minimum measurable displacement, we acquired CBCT-tomographies containing a stationary reference and micro-metrically cnc controlled displacements of the sample. We then process these images with our software to extract the distances and compare them with the cnc displacements. All our processing includes a computational interpolation from the voxel-size of 0.35 mm corresponding to our CBCT-tomographies, down to 0.05 mm. We find that sample-displacements can be measured with a precision of ~ 20, 17 times smaller than the voxel-size of 0.35 mm.\\n\\nTo measure the size of the holes using our CBCT-tomographies, we first register the holes onto a hole-free region of the sample with our software, then overlay the result with the three-dimensional structure obtained from confocal spectroscopy. We find the minimum detectable hole-size to be 0. 7 mm, twice the voxel-size.",

    "abstract": "The Canary Islands indigenous people have been the subject of substantial archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and genetic research pointing to a most probable North African Berber source. However, neither agreement about the exact point of origin nor a model for the indigenous colonization of the islands has been established. To shed light on these questions, we analyzed 48 ancient mitogenomes from 25 archaeological sites from the seven main islands. Most lineages observed in the ancient samples have a Mediterranean distribution, and belong to lineages associated with the Neolithic expansion in the Near East and Europe (T2c, J2a, X3a...). This phylogeographic analysis of Canarian indigenous mitogenomes, the first of its kind, shows that some lineages are restricted to Central North Africa (H1cf, J2a2d and T2c1d3), while others have a wider distribution, including both West and Central North Africa, and, in some cases, Europe and the Near East (U6a1a1, U6a7a1, U6b, X3a, U6c1). In addition, we identify four new Canarian-specific lineages (H1e1a9, H4a1e, J2a2d1a and L3b1a12) whose coalescence dates correlate with the estimated time for the colonization of the islands (1st millennia CE). Additionally, we observe an asymmetrical distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the ancient population, with certain haplogroups appearing more frequently in the islands closer to the continent. This reinforces results based on modern mtDNA and Y-chromosome data, and archaeological evidence suggesting the existence of two distinct migrations. Comparisons between insular populations show that some populations had high genetic diversity, while others were probably affected by genetic drift and/or bottlenecks. In spite of observing interinsular differences in the survival of indigenous lineages, modern populations, with the sole exception of La Gomera, are homogenous across the islands, supporting the theory of extensive human mobility after the European conquest.",
