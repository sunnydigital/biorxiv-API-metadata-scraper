    "abstract": "To establish and exploit novel biomarkers of demyelinating diseases requires a mechanistic understanding of axonal propagation. Here, we present a novel computational framework called the stochastic spike-diffuse-spike (SSDS) model for assessing the effects of demyelination on axonal transmission. It models transmission through nodal and internodal compartments with two types of operations: a stochastic integrate-and-fire operation captures nodal excitability and a linear filtering operation describes internodal propagation. The effects of demyelinated segments on the probability of transmission, transmission delay and spike time jitter are explored. We argue that demyelination induced impedance mismatch prevents propagation in most part when the action potential leaves a demyelinated region, not when it enters a demyelinated region. In addition, we model sodium channel remodeling as a homeostatic control of nodal excitability. We find that the effects of mild demyelination on transmission probability and delay can be largely counterbalanced by an increase in excitability at the nodes surrounding the demyelination. The spike timing jitter, however, reflects the level of demyelination whether excitability is fixed or is allowed to change in compensation. This jitter can accumulate over long axons and leads to a broadening of the compound action potential, linking microscopic defects to a mesoscopic observable. Our findings articulate why action potential jitter and compound action potential dispersion can serve as potential markers of weak and sporadic demyelination.",

    "abstract": "The spatial signals in neuroimaging mass univariate analyses can be characterized in a number of ways, but one widely used approach is peak inference: the identification of peaks in the image. Peak locations and magnitudes provide a useful summary of activation and are routinely reported, however, the magnitudes reflect selection bias as these points have both survived a threshold and are local maxima. In this paper we propose the use of resampling methods to estimate and correct this bias in order to estimate both the raw units change as well as standardized effect size measured with Cohens d and partial R2. We evaluate our method with a massive open dataset, and discuss how the corrected estimates can be used to perform power analyses.",

    "abstract": "In standard models of perceptual decision-making, noisy sensory evidence is considered to be the primary source of choice errors and the accumulation of evidence needed to overcome this noise gives rise to speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Here, we investigated how the history of recent choices and their outcomes interacts with these processes using a combination of theory and experiment. We found that the speed and accuracy of performance of rats on olfactory decision tasks could be best explained by a Bayesian model that combines reinforcement-based learning with accumulation of uncertain sensory evidence. This model predicted the specific pattern of trial history effects that were found in the data. The results suggest that learning is a critical factor contributing to speed-accuracy tradeoffs in decision-making and that task history effects are not simply biases but rather the signatures of an optimal learning strategy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDIn soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), symptom provocation was found to induce increased connectivity within the salience network, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and global brain connectivity with global signal regression (GBCr). However, it is unknown whether these GBCr disturbances would normalize following effective PTSD treatment.\\n\\nMETHODS69 US Army soldiers with (n = 42) and without PTSD (n = 27) completed fMRI at rest and during symptom provocation using subject-specific script imagery. Then, participants with PTSD received 6 weeks (12 sessions) of group cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or present-centered therapy (PCT). At week 8, all participants repeated the fMRI scans. The primary analysis used a region-of-interest approach to determine the effect of treatment on salience GBCr. A secondary analysis was conducted to explore the pattern of GBCr alterations posttreatment in PTSD participants compared to controls.\\n\\nRESULTSOver the treatment period, PCT significantly reduced salience GBCr (p = .02). Compared to controls, salience GBCr was high pretreatment (PCT, p = .01; CPT, p = .03) and normalized post-PCT (p = .53), but not post-CPT (p = .006). Whole-brain secondary analysis found high GBCr within the central executive network in PTSD participants compared to controls. Post hoc exploratory analyses showed significant increases in executive GBCr following CPT treatment (p = .01).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONThe results support previous models relating CPT to central executive network and enhanced cognitive control while unraveling a previously unknown neurobiological mechanism of PCT treatment, demonstrating treatment-specific reduction in salience connectivity during trauma recollection.",

    "abstract": "Parental experience can generate adaptive changes in the behavioral and physiological traits of the offspring1-3. However, the biological properties of this intergenerational regulation and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism are not well understood. Here, we show that the experience of learning to avoid pathogenic bacteria in C. elegans alters the behavioral response to the pathogen in the progeny through the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. We previously show that the adult C. elegans learns to avoid the smell of pathogenic bacteria, such as the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14, after feeding on the pathogen for a few hours4,5. Here, we report that this learning experience can bidirectionally regulate the olfactory response to PA14 in the progeny that are never directly exposed to the pathogen. The olfactory preference for PA14 in these progeny is linearly correlated with the learned avoidance of PA14 in their mothers. If the mothers show strong learning of PA14, their progeny avoid PA14; intriguingly, if the mothers show weak learning of PA14, the progeny prefer PA14, suggesting that the PA14-trained mothers transmit both the negative and positive information of PA14 to their progeny. The intergenerational behavioral effect results from an altered behavioral decision regulated by an olfactory sensorimotor neural circuit. Learning to avoid the pathogen also influences the development of the progeny, which is regulated independently from the behavioral change. Animals mutated for the RRF-3/RNA-directed RNA polymerase, a master regulator for the synthesis of the small interfering RNAs that are maternally inherited or in the soma6,7, display the normal naive and learned response to PA14 but are defective in regulating the olfactory response to PA14 in their progeny. Our results characterize an intergenerational effect that allows the progeny to rapidly adapt to an environmental condition that is critical for survival.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic targeting of blood coagulation is a challenging task as it interferes with the delicate balance of pro- and anticoagulant activities. Anticoagulants are employed in millions of thrombophilic patients worldwide each year. The treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism has changed drastically with the replacement of traditional anticoagulant vitamin K antagonists by direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which selectively target coagulation factors Xa or IIa. However for a growing population with comorbidities satisfying therapeutic options are still lacking and the quest for novel therapeutics continues. Recently targeting factors XI or XII have emerged as new therapeutic strategies. As these factors play important roles in thrombosis, nevertheless are practically functionally dispensable for hemostasis, they may potentially overcome the functional obstacle of treating or preventing thrombosis without affecting hemostasis. Based on the recent elucidation of the hemostatic miRNA targetome, we introduce and discuss a hitherto unrecognized rationale for the therapeutic targeting of factor XI. This is based on mimicking endogenous factor XI expression control by therapeutic delivery of miRNA mimics. We discuss the functional difference between various gene targeting approaches, and propose the hemostatic system to represent an ideal model for assessment of the efficacy and safety of such therapeutic components, ushering in a novel therapeutic era with broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "The field of epitranscriptomics is growing in importance, with chemical modification of RNA being associated with a wide variety of biological phenomena. A pivotal challenge in this area is the identification of modified RNA residues within their sequence contexts. Next-generation sequencing approaches are generally unable to capture modifications, although workarounds for some epigenetic marks exist. Mass spectrometry (MS) offers a comprehensive solution by using analogous approaches to shotgun proteomics. However, software support for the analysis of RNA MS data is inadequate at present and does not allow high-throughput processing. In particular, existing software solutions lack the raw performance and statistical grounding to efficiently handle the large variety of modifications present on RNA. We present a free and open-source database search engine for RNA MS data, called NucleicAcidSearchEngine (NASE), that addresses these shortcomings. We demonstrate the capability of NASE to reliably identify a wide range of modified RNA sequences in three original datasets of varying complexity. In a human tRNA sample, we characterize over 20 different modification types simultaneously and find many cases of incomplete modification.",

    "abstract": "The performance of first-generation hybrids determines to a large extent the long-term outcome of hybridization in natural populations. F1 hybrids can facilitate further gene flow between the two parental species, especially in animal-pollinated flowering plants. We studied the performance of reciprocal F1 hybrids between Rhinanthus minor and R. major, two hemiparasitic, annual, self-compatible plant species, from seed germination to seed production under controlled conditions and in the field. We sowed seeds with known ancestry outdoors before winter and followed the complete life cycle until plant death in July the following season. While germination under laboratory conditions was much lower for the F1 hybrid formed on R. major compared to the reciprocal hybrid formed on R. minor, this difference disappeared under field conditions, pointing at an artefact caused by the experimental conditions during germination in the lab rather than at an intrinsic genetic incompatibility. Both F1 hybrids performed as well as or sometimes better than R. minor, which had a higher fitness than R. major in one of the two years in the greenhouse and in the field transplant experiment. The results confirm findings from naturally mixed populations, where F1 hybrids appear as soon as the two species meet and which leads to extensive advanced-hybrid formation and introgression in subsequent generations.",

    "abstract": "The availability of genome-wide sequence data from a large number of species as well as data from multiple individuals within a species has ushered in the era of phylogenomics. In this era, species phylogeny inference is based on models of sequence evolution on gene trees as well as models of gene tree evolution within the branches of species phylogenies. Parsimony, likelihood, Bayesian, and distance methods have been introduced for species phylogeny inference based on such models. All methods, except for the parsimony ones, assume a common mechanism across all loci as captured by a single value of each branch length of the species phylogeny. In this paper, we propose a \\\"no common mechanism\\\" (NCM) model, where every gene tree evolves according to its own parameters of the species phylogeny. An analogous model was proposed and explored, both mathematically and experimentally, for sites, or characters, in a sequence alignment in the context of the classical phylogeny problem. For example, a famous equivalence between the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogeny estimates was established under certain NCM models by Tuffley and Steel. Here we derive an analytically integrated likelihood of both species trees and networks given the gene trees of multiple loci under an NCM model. We demonstrate the performance of inference under this integrated likelihood on both simulated and biological data. The model presented here will afford opportunities for exploring connections among various methods for estimating species phylogenies from multiple, independent loci.",

The precise role of microglia during demyelination, and the relative contributions of microglia vs. peripheral macrophages, are incompletely understood. Here, using a genetic fate mapping strategy, we identify microglia as predominant responders and key effectors of demyelination in the cuprizone (CUP) model. Pharmacological depletion of microglia demonstrates these cells are necessary for the demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes, and reactive astrocytosis normally evident in this model. Electron microscopy (EM) and serial block face imaging show myelin sheaths remain intact in CUP treated mice depleted of microglia. However, these damaged myelin sheaths are lost upon-repopulation of microglia. Injection of colony-stimulating factor-1 to drive focal microgliosis in white matter is sufficient to induce focal demyelination in vivo. These studies indicate activated microglia are required for demyelination that results from primary myelin pathology and are sufficient to induce demyelination directly.",

    "abstract": "Scribble is a crucial adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role during establishment and control of cell polarity, impacting many physiological processes ranging from cell migration to immunity and organization of tissue architecture. Scribble harbors a leucine-rich repeat domain and four PDZ domains, which mediate most of Scribbles interactions with other proteins. It has become increasingly clear that posttranslational modifications substantially impact Scribble-ligand interactions, with phosphorylation being a major modulator of binding to Scribble. To better understand how Scribble PDZ domains direct cell polarity signalling and how phosphorylation impacts this process, we investigated human Scribble interactions with MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer). We systematically evaluated the ability of all four individual Scribble PDZ domains to bind the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of MCC as well as MCC phosphorylated at the -1 Ser position. We show that Scribble PDZ1 and PDZ3 are the major interactors with MCC, and that modifications to Ser at the -1 position in the MCC PBM only has a modest effect on binding to Scribble PDZ domains. We then examined the structural basis for these observations by determining the crystal structures of Scribble PDZ1 domain bound to both the unphosphorylated MCC PBM as well as phosphorylated MCC. Our structures indicated that phospho-Ser at the -1 position in MCC is not involved in major contacts with Scribble PDZ1, and in conjunction with our affinity measurements suggest that the impact of phosphorylation at the -1 position of MCC extends beyond a simple modulation of the affinity for Scribble PDZ domains.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke gait is often accompanied by muscle impairments that result in adaptations such as hip circumduction to compensate for lack of knee flexion. Our previous work robotically enhanced knee flexion in individuals post-stroke with Stiff-Knee Gait (SKG), however, this resulted in greater circumduction, suggesting the existence of abnormal coordination in SKG. The purpose of this work is to investigate two possible mechanisms of the abnormal coordination: 1) an involuntary coupling between stretched quadriceps and abductors, and 2) a coupling between volitionally activated knee flexors and abductors. We used previously collected kinematic, kinetic and EMG measures from nine participants with chronic stroke and five healthy controls during walking with and without the applied knee flexion torque perturbations in the pre-swing phase of gait in the neuromusculoskeletal simulation. The measured muscle activity was supplemented by simulated muscle activations to estimate the muscle states of the quadriceps, hamstrings and hip abductors. We used linear mixed models to investigate two hypotheses: H1) association between quadriceps and abductor activation during an involuntary period (reflex latency) following the perturbation and H2) association between hamstrings and abductor activation after the perturbation was removed. We observed significantly higher rectus femoris (RF) activation in stroke participants compared to healthy controls within the reflex latency period following the perturbation based on both measured (H1, p < 0.001) and simulated (H1, p = 0.022) activity. Simulated RF and gluteus medius (GMed) activations were correlated only in those with SKG, which was significantly higher compared to healthy controls (H1, p = 0.030). There was no evidence of voluntary synergistic coupling between any combination of hamstrings and hip abductors (H2, p > 0.05) when the perturbation was removed. The RF-GMed coupling suggests an underlying abnormal reflex coordination pattern in post-stroke SKG. These results challenge earlier assumptions that hip circumduction in stroke is simply a kinematic adaptation due to reduced toe clearance. Instead, abnormal coordination may underlie circumduction, illustrating the deleterious role of abnormal coordination in post-stroke gait.",

This antiviral mechanism is conserved in virtually all cell types, except for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and oocytes which are intrinsically incapable of producing IFNs. Despite the importance of the IFN response to fight viral infections, the mechanisms regulating this pathway during pluripotency are still unknown. Here we show that, in the absence of miRNAs, ESCs acquire an active IFN response. Proteomic analysis identified MAVS, a central component of the IFN pathway, to be actively silenced by miRNAs and responsible for suppressing IFN expression in ESCs. Furthermore, we show that knocking out a single miRNA, miR-673, restores the antiviral response in ESCs through MAVS regulation. Our findings suggest that the interaction between miR-673 and MAVS acts as a switch to suppress the antiviral IFN during pluripotency and present genetic approaches to enhance their antiviral immunity.",

In several cases directional intercalation and cell shape changes have been shown to be associated with a planar cell polarity in the organisation of the actinmyosin cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. This polarised cytoskeletal organisation has been postulated to reflect the directional tension necessary to drive and orient directional cell intercalations. We have now further characterised and applied a recently introduced non-destructive optical manipulation technique to measure the tension in individual cell junctions in the epiblast of chick embryos in the early stages of primitive streak formation. We have measured junctional tension as a function of position and orientation. Junctional tension of mesendoderm cells, the tissue that drives the formation of the streak, is higher than tension of junctions of cells in other parts of the epiblast. Furthermore, in the mesendoderm junctional tension is higher in the direction of intercalation. The data are fitted best with a Maxwell model and we find that both junctional tension and relaxation time are dependent on myosin activity.",

    "abstract": "Sperm morphology is critical for sperm competition and thus for reproductive fitness. In the male-hermaphrodite nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sperm size is a key feature of sperm competitive ability. Yet despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms regulating C. elegans sperm size and the genetic basis underlying its natural variation remain unknown. Examining 97 genetically distinct C. elegans strains, we observe significant heritable variation in male sperm size but genome-wide association mapping did not yield any QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). While we confirm larger male sperm to consistently outcompete smaller hermaphrodite sperm, we find natural variation in male sperm size to poorly predict male fertility and competitive ability. In addition, although hermaphrodite sperm size also shows significant natural variation, male and hermaphrodite sperm size do not correlate, implying a sex-specific genetic regulation of sperm size. To elucidate the molecular basis of intraspecific sperm size variation, we focused on recently diverged laboratory strains, which evolved extreme sperm size differences. Using mutants and quantitative complementation tests, we demonstrate that variation in the gene nurf-1 - previously shown to underlie the evolution of improved hermaphrodite reproduction - also explains the evolution of reduced male sperm size. This result illustrates how adaptive changes in C. elegans hermaphrodite function can cause the deterioration of a male-specific fitness trait due to a sexually antagonistic variant, representing an example of intralocus sexual conflict with resolution at the molecular level. Our results further provide first insights into the genetic determinants of C. elegans sperm size, pointing at an involvement of the NURF chromatin remodelling complex.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/501486v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (166K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff917org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a5e4corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@250996org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1989580_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is connected into tens of thousands of long-range looping interactions critically linked to spatiotemporal gene expression regulation. An important unanswered question is to what extent looping interactions change across developmental models, genetic perturbations, drug treatments, and disease states. Although methods exist for calling loops in single biological conditions, there is a severe shortage of computational tools for rigorous assessment of cell type-specific looping interactions across multiple biological conditions. Here we present 3DeFDR, a simple and effective statistical tool for classifying dynamic looping interactions across biological conditions from Chromosome-Conformation-Capture-Carbon-Copy (5C) data. 3DeFDR parses chromatin contacts into invariant and cell type-specific classes by thresholding on differences in modeled interaction strength signal across two or three cellular states. Thresholds are iteratively adjusted based on a target empirical false discovery rate computed between real and simulated 5C maps. 3DeFDR enables the sensitive detection of high-confidence looping interactions and markedly reduces false positives when benchmarked against a classic analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, our newly formulated parametric likelihood ratio test (3DLRT), and the leading Hi-C differential interaction caller diffHic. 3DeFDR also sensitively and specifically calls loops in Mb-scale genomic regions parsed from Hi-C data. Our work provides a statistical framework and an open-source coding library for identifying dynamic long-range looping interactions in high-resolution 5C data from multiple cellular conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany studies have shown that space environment can affect bacteria to cause a range of mutations. However, so far, there are less studies on the effects of long-term space flight (>1 month) on bacteria. In this study, a Staphylococcus warneri strain, which was isolated from the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft that had experienced a space flight (15-day), was carried into space again. After 64-day flight, the combined phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were performed to compare the influence of the two space flights on this bacteria.\\n\\nResultsCompared with short-term space flight, long-term space flight increased the biofilm formation ability of S. warneri and the cell wall resistance to external environment stress, but reduced the sensitivity to chemical stimulation. Further analysis showed that these changes might be related to the significantly up-regulated gene expression of phosphotransferase system, which regulated glucose metabolism pathway, including glucose, mannose, fructose and cellobiose. The mutation of S. warneri caused by 15-day space flight was limited at phenotype and gene level after ground culture.\\n\\nConclusionAfter a 79-day space flight, the changes of S. warneri are meaningful. Phosphotransferase system of S. warneri was up-regulated by long-term space stimulation, which resulted in a series of changes in cell wall, biofilm and chemical sensitivity, thus enhancing the resistance and adaptability of bacteria to the external environment.\\n\\nImportanceTaking S. warneri as an example, we found that the mutation of bacteria in long-term space flight mainly focused on the adaptation and tolerance like environmental adaptation, physical resistance and cell repair to various pressures and these changes should be more obvious or even become stable mutations. But the clinical changes, for example drug resistance and virulence should not be significant because there is no threat of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "When combining information across different senses humans need to flexibly select cues of a common origin whilst avoiding distraction from irrelevant inputs. The brain could solve this challenge using a hierarchical principle, by deriving rapidly a fused sensory estimate for computational expediency and, later and if required, filtering out irrelevant signals based on the inferred sensory cause(s). Analysing time- and source-resolved human magnetoencephalographic data we unveil a systematic spatio-temporal cascade of the relevant computations, starting with early segregated unisensory representations, continuing with sensory fusion in parietal-temporal regions and culminating as causal inference in the frontal lobe. Our results reconcile previous computational accounts of multisensory perception by showing that prefrontal cortex guides flexible integrative behaviour based on candidate representations established in sensory and association cortices, thereby framing multisensory integration in the generalised context of adaptive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Decisions about actions typically involve a period of deliberation that ends with the commitment to a choice and the motor processes overtly expressing that choice. Previous studies have shown that neural activity in sensorimotor areas, including the primary motor cortex (M1), correlates with deliberation features during action selection. Yet, the causal contribution of these areas to the decision process remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether M1 determines choice commitment, or whether it simply reflects decision signals coming from upstream structures and instead mainly contributes to the motor processes that follow commitment. To do so, we tested the impact of a disruption of M1 activity, induced by continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), on the behavior of human subjects in (1) a simple reaction time (SRT) task allowing us to estimate the duration of the motor processes and (2) a modified version of the tokens task (Cisek et al., 2009), which allowed us to estimate subjects time of commitment as well as accuracy criterion. The efficiency of cTBS was attested by a reduction in motor evoked potential amplitudes following M1 disruption, as compared to those following a sham stimulation. Furthermore, M1 cTBS lengthened SRTs, indicating that motor processes were perturbed by the intervention. Importantly, all of the behavioral results in the tokens task were similar following M1 disruption and sham stimulation, suggesting that the contribution of M1 to the deliberation process is potentially negligible. Taken together, these findings favor the view that M1 contribution is downstream of the decision process.\\n\\nNew and noteworthyDecisions between actions are ubiquitous in the animal realm. Deliberation during action choices entails changes in the activity of the sensorimotor areas controlling those actions, but the causal role of these areas is still often debated. Using continuous theta burst stimulation, we show that disrupting the primary motor cortex (M1) delays the motor processes that follow instructed commitment but does not alter volitional deliberation, suggesting that M1 contribution may be downstream of the decision process.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding accounts of brain functions profoundly influence current approaches to perceptual synthesis. However, a fundamental paradox has emerged, that may be very relevant for understanding hallucinations, psychosis or cognitive inflexibility. This paradox is that in some situations surprise or prediction error related responses can decrease when predicted and yet, they can increase when we know they are predictable. This paradox is resolved by recognizing that brain responses reflect precision weighted prediction error. This then presses us to disambiguate the contributions of precision and prediction error in electrophysiology. We report, for the first time, an experimental paradigm that may be able to meet this challenge. We examined brain responses to unexpected and expected surprising sounds, assuming that the latter yield a smaller prediction error but much more amplified by a larger precision weight. Importantly, addressing this modulation requires the modelling of trial-by-trial variations of brain responses, that we reconstructed within a fronto-temporal network by combining EEG and MEG. Our results reveal an adaptive learning of surprise with larger integration of past (relevant) information in the context of expected surprises. Within the auditory hierarchy, this adaptation was found tied down to specific connections and reveals in particular and crucially precision encoding through neuronal excitability. Strikingly, these fine processes are automated as sound sequences were unattended. These findings directly speak to applications in psychiatry, where it has been suggested that a specifically impaired precision weighting is at the heart of several conditions such as schizophrenia and autism.",

    "abstract": "Cross-kingdom small RNA (sRNA) silencing has recently emerged as a mechanism facilitating fungal colonization and disease development. Here we characterized RNAi pathways in Zymoseptoria tritici, a major fungal pathogen of wheat, and assessed their contribution to pathogenesis. Computational analysis of fungal sRNA and host mRNA sequencing datasets was used to define the global sRNA populations in Z. tritici and predict their mRNA targets in wheat. 389 in planta-induced sRNA loci were identified. sRNAs generated from some of these loci were predicted to target wheat mRNAs including those potentially involved in pathogen defense. However, molecular approaches failed to validate targeting of selected wheat mRNAs by fungal sRNAs. Mutant strains of Z. tritici carrying deletions of genes encoding key components of RNAi such as Dicer-like (DCL) and Argounate (AGO) proteins were generated, and virulence bioassays suggested that these are dispensable for full infection of wheat. Nonetheless, our results did suggest the existence of non-canonical DCL-independent pathway(s) for sRNA biogenesis in Z. tritici. dsRNA targeting essential fungal genes applied in vitro or generated from an RNA virus vector in planta in a procedure known as HIGS (Host-Induced Gene Silencing) was ineffective in preventing Z. tritici growth or disease. We also demonstrated that Z. tritici is incapable of dsRNA uptake. Collectively, our data suggest that RNAi approaches for gene function analyses in this fungal species and potentially also as a control measure may not be as effective as has been demonstrated for some other plant pathogenic fungi.",

The theoretical resolution enhancement of SOFI scales linearly with the cumulants order, while imaging conditions are less phototoxic to living samples as compared to other SR methods. High order SOFI could, therefore, be a method of choice for dynamic live cell imaging. However, due to cusp-artifacts and to dynamic range expansion of pixel intensities, this promise has not been materialized as of yet. Here we investigated and compared high order moments vs. high order cumulants SOFI reconstructions. We demonstrate that even-order moments reconstructions are intrinsically free of cusp artifacts, allowing for a subsequent deconvolution operation to be performed, hence enhancing the resolution even further. High order moments reconstructions performance was examined for various (simulated) conditions and applied to (experimental) imaging of QD labeled microtubules in fixed cells, and actin stress fiber dynamics in live cells.",

Cells lacking Cyclin B can enter mitosis and phosphorylate most mitotic proteins, because of parallel PP2A:B55 phos-phatase inactivation by Greatwall kinase. The final barrier to mitotic establishment corresponds to nuclear envelope breakdown that requires a decisive shift in the balance of Cdk1 and PP2A:B55 activity. Beyond this point Cyclin B/Cdk1 is essential to phosphorylate a distinct subset mitotic Cdk1 substrates that are essential to complete cell division.

    "abstract": "BackgroundUp to 10% of women use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants during and after pregnancy to manage mood disorders, with possible implications for the developing offspring. The microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the regulation of serotonin synthesis. However, the interaction between maternal depression, SSRI use, bacterial community composition, and availability of microbiota-derived metabolites during pregnancy and lactation is not clear and may be consequential to the long-term health of mother and offspring. To determine the impact of SSRI treatment on maternal microbial community dynamics, we conducted these studies in a rat model of maternal vulnerability (MV). All MV females are on a background of genetic vulnerability, where rats exposed to early life stress (sMV) develop a depressive-like phenotype. In adulthood, sMV- and control (cMV) females were treated with either the SSRI fluoxetine (FLX) or the vehicle (Veh) throughout pregnancy and lactation. High-resolution 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and targeted metabolomic analysis were used to assess the fecal microbiome and metabolite availability, respectively.\\n\\nResultsThe diversity, structure, and composition of the fecal bacterial community differed between pregnancy and lactation. Shifts in microbiota composition were accompanied by changes in fecal metabolite availability. FLX altered some key features of the transition from pregnancy to lactation, but only in females exposed to early life stress (sMV-Veh vs sMV-FLX). For instance, sMV-FLX females had lower fecal availability of the amino acids serine, proline, and aspartic acid than sMV-Veh females. These metabolite concentrations correlated negatively with the relative abundance of bacterial taxa Prevotella, Ruminococcus, and Oscillospira.\\n\\nConclusionsOur studies demonstrate an important relationship between antidepressant use during the perinatal period and maternal fecal metabolite availability in sMV rats, possibly through parallel changes in the maternal gut microbiome. Since maternal microbial metabolites contribute to health outcomes in offspring, insults to the maternal microbiome by SSRIs might have inter-generational consequences.",

    "abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, which is the most common vector borne disease in the United States and Europe. Although 2-4 week antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease is effective in the majority of cases, about 10-20% patients suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the mechanisms of PTLDS are unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics has been suggested as a possible explanation. B. burgdorferi can spontaneously develop different morphological variant forms under stress or in stationary phase with increased persistence to antibiotics. To shed light on the possible mechanisms by which these variant forms develop persistence, here, we isolated three B. burgdorferi forms, log phase spirochetal form, stationary phase planktonic form, and stationary phase aggregated biofilm-like microcolony form. We showed that the two separated stationary phase forms especially microcolony form have more persistence to antibiotics than the log phase spirochetal form. Then, we performed mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis to determine the proteomic profiles of the three different forms to reveal the mechanisms of persistence in B. burgdorferi. We identified 1023 proteins in the three B. burgdorferi forms, with 642 proteins (63%) differentially expressed. Compared with the log phase spirochetal form of B. burgdorferi, a total of 143 proteins were upregulated in both stationary phase planktonic form and microcolony form. Among these common upregulated proteins, 90 proteins had predicted functions and were mapped to different pathways involved in infection and virulence, DNA repair, heat shock, transport, sporulation, cell envelope and metabolism, many of which are consistent with persister mechanisms in other bacteria. A particularly interesting observation is that infection and virulence related proteins are highly up-regulated in stationary phase planktonic form and microcolony form compared with log phase spirochetal form. These findings shed new light on the mechanisms of B. burgdorferi persistence and offer novel targets for developing more effective diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.",

Understanding the relative importance of these drivers would enable scientists to design strategies initiating a desired reassembly for e.g., remediating low diversity ecosystems. Here, we aimed to examine if a human fecal-derived defined microbial community cultured in bioreactors assembled deterministically or stochastically, by completing replicate experiments under two growth medium conditions characteristic of either high fiber or high protein diets. Then, we recreated this defined microbial community by matching different strains of the same species sourced from distinct human donors, in order to elucidate whether coadaptation of strains within a host influenced community dynamics. Each defined microbial ecosystem was evaluated for composition using marker gene sequencing, and for behaviour using 1H-NMR based metabonomics. We found that stochasticity had the largest influence on the species structure when substrate concentrations varied, whereas habitat filtering greatly impacted the metabonomic output. Evidence of coadaptation was elucidated from comparisons of the two communities; we found that the artificial community tended to exclude saccharolytic Firmicutes species and was enriched for metabolic intermediates, such as Stickland fermentation products, suggesting overall that polysaccharide utilization by Firmicutes is dependent on cooperation.",

    "abstract": "In everyday tasks such as walking and running, we exploit the work performed by external sources such as gravity to reduce the work performed by muscles. There has been considerable recent effort to design devices capable of performing mechanical work to improve walking function or reduce effort. The success of these devices relies on the user adapting their natural control strategies to take advantage of assistance provided by the device. Although locomotor adaptation is central to this process, the study of adaptation is often done using approaches that on the surface, seem to have little in common with the use of external assistance. Here, we show that one of the most common approaches for studying this process, which is adaptation to walking on a split-belt treadmill, can be understood from a perspective in which people learn to take advantage of mechanical work performed by the treadmill. During adaptation, people systematically adjust their step lengths, defined as the distance between the feet at heel strike, from one step to the next. Initially, the step length on the slow belt is longer than the step length on the fast belt, measured as a negative step length asymmetry, but people naturally reduce this asymmetry with practice. Here, we demonstrate that these modifications of step length asymmetry allow people to extract positive work from the treadmill belts to reduce the positive work performed by the legs and simultaneously reduce metabolic cost. Moreover, we show that walking with a positive step length asymmetry minimizes metabolic cost, and people prefer to walk in this manner when allowed to select their walking pattern. Together, our results suggest that split-belt adaptation can be interpreted as a process by which people learn to take advantage of mechanical work performed by an external device to improve walking economy.",

    "abstract": "While the neuropeptide oxytocin can facilitate empathy and altruistic behavior it may also promote self-serving tendencies in some contexts, and it remains unclear if it would increase altruistic or self-interest behaviors when they compete within a social situation. The current between-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled fMRI study investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on empathy for social exclusion using a modified online ball-tossing game which incorporated monetary rewards and both the potential to display altruistic and self-interest behaviors. Results showed that when subjects in both oxytocin and placebo groups were observing a player being excluded (victim) by other players in the game there was activation in the mentalizing network. When subjects then played both with the victim and the players who had excluded them they threw more balls to the victim player, indicative of an altruistic response. However, subjects in the oxytocin group threw more balls to the excluder players indicative of greater self-interest, since the latter would be perceived as more likely to reciprocate to maximize financial gain. This behavioral effect of oxytocin was associated with greater medial orbitofrontal cortex activation when playing with the excluders and negatively correlated with trait-altruism scores. Overall, our findings suggest that in the context of competing motivations for exhibiting altruistic or self-interest behavior oxytocin enhanced self-interest and this was associated with greater activation in frontal reward areas.",

    "abstract": "Among optical imaging techniques light sheet fluorescence microscopy stands out as one of the most attractive for capturing high-speed biological dynamics unfolding in three dimensions. The technique is potentially millions of times faster than point-scanning techniques such as two-photon microscopy. However current-generation light sheet microscopes are limited by volume scanning rate and/or camera frame rate. We present speed-optimized Objective Coupled Planar Illumination (OCPI) microscopy, a fast light sheet technique that avoids compromising image quality or photon efficiency. We increase volume scanning rate to 40 Hz for volumes up to 700 {micro}m thick and introduce Multi-Camera Image Sharing (MCIS), a technique to scale imaging rate by parallelizing acquisition across cameras. Finally, we demonstrate fast calcium imaging of the larval zebrafish brain and find a heartbeat-induced artifact that can be removed by filtering when the imaging rate exceeds 15 Hz. These advances extend the reach of fluorescence microscopy for monitoring fast processes in large volumes.",

    "abstract": "Although the increasing use of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have improved the yield of genetic testing for Mendelian disorders, an estimated 50% of patients still leave the clinic without a genetic diagnosis. This can be attributed in part to our lack of ability to accurately interpret the genetic variation detected through next-generation sequencing. Variant interpretation is fundamentally reliant on accurate and complete gene annotation, however numerous reports and discrepancies between gene annotation databases reveals that the knowledge of gene annotation remains far from comprehensive. Here, we detect and validate transcription in an annotation-agnostic manner across all 41 different GTEx tissues, then connect novel transcription to known genes, ultimately improving the annotation of 63% of the known OMIM-morbid genes. We find the majority of novel transcription to be tissue-specific in origin, with brain tissues being most susceptible to misannotation. Furthermore, we find that novel transcribed regions tend to be poorly conserved, but are significantly depleted for genetic variation within humans, suggesting they are functionally significant and potentially have human-specific functions. We present our findings through an online platform vizER, which enables individual genes to be visualised and queried for evidence of misannotation. We also release all tissue-specific transcriptomes in a BED format for ease of integration with whole-genome sequencing data. We anticipate that these resources will improve the diagnostic yield for a wide range of Mendelian disorders.",

    "abstract": "Soil respiration, a major source of atmospheric carbon (C), can feed into climate warming, which in turn can amplify soil CO2 efflux by affecting root, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) and other heterotrophic respiration. Although tropical ecosystems contribute >60% of the global soil CO2 efflux, there is currently a dearth of data on tropical soil respiration responses to temperature rise. We set up a simulated warming and soil respiration partitioning experiment in tropical montane grasslands in the Western Ghats in southern India, to (a) evaluate soil respiration responses to warming, (b) assess the relative contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic components to soil respiration, and (c) assess the roles of soil temperature and soil moisture in influencing soil respiration in this system. Our results show that soil respiration was tightly coupled with soil moisture availability, with CO2 efflux levels peaking during the wet season. Soil warming by ~1.4 {degrees}C nearly doubled soil respiration from ~0.64 g CO2 m-2 hr-1 on average under ambient conditions to ~1.17 g CO2 m-2 hr-1 under warmed conditions. However, warming effects on soil CO2 efflux were contingent on water availability, with greater relative increases in soil respiration observed under conditions of low, compared to high, soil moisture. Heterotrophs contributed to the majority of soil CO2 efflux, with respiration remaining unchanged when roots and/or AMF hyphae were excluded. Overall, our results indicate that future warming is likely to substantially increase the largely heterotroph-driven soil C fluxes in this tropical montane grassland ecosystem.",

Moreover, chemogenetic activation of a specific retina-to-OPN pathway reveals a novel circuit element controlling pupil size.

The mechanisms controlling the specification and establishment of parallel sensory pathways remain unclear. Here we report the non-uniform distribution of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) expressing the transcription factor Tbx20 in mice. Owing to their layout within the retina, Tbx20-RGCs are positioned to preferentially encode light information from dorsal visual space. We discovered that Tbx20 expression is mostly restricted to three RGC-types: M1 intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs), M2 ipRGCs and  diving RGCs. The axonal projections of Tbx20-RGCs innervate non-image-forming brain centers including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the medial division of the posterior pretectal nucleus, and the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), a principal station in the neural pathway for generating the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Conditional deletion of Tbx20 resulted in reduced Tbx20-RGC axonal innervation of these targets and revealed a key role of these neurons in driving specific phases of the PLR. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation uncovered a novel role for a specific subset of Tbx20-RGCs in controlling pupil dilation. These data offer a new understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that establish specific, behaviorally-relevant visual circuits.",

These neuromodulators have been hypothesized to influence cortical function during behavioral periods such as arousal, locomotion, exploration, and attention. To determine when these neuromodulatory projections were active, we expressed the genetically-encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6 in neuromodulatory axons which project to the mouse primary visual cortex and performed two-photon microscopy to monitor their activity in vivo. We observed that the fluorescence of both cholinergic and noradrenergic axons increased during periods of pupil dilation, with the fluorescence of the axons rising less than one second before eye pupil dilation. We also observed increases in cholinergic and noradrenergic axon fluorescence periods of locomotion, which was accompanied by pupil dilation and nasal (forward) movement of both pupils. Locomotion was preceded by a rise in axonal fluorescence with a timing and amplitude that matched the subsequent pupil dilation, but axon fluorescence was more sustained than expected from the pupil dilation, suggesting that there is an additional physiological factor that affects cholinergic and noradrenergic axon activity in primary visual cortex during locomotion.",

We used morphometric similarity analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as a marker of inter-areal cortical connectivity in three prior case-control studies of psychosis: in total, N=185 cases and N=227 controls. Psychosis was associated with globally reduced morphometric similarity (MS) in all 3 studies. There was also a replicable pattern of case-control differences in regional MS which was significantly reduced in patients in frontal and temporal cortical areas, but increased in parietal cortex. Using prior brain-wide gene expression data, we found that the cortical map of case-control differences in MS was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted combination of genes enriched for neu-robiologically relevant ontology terms and pathways. In addition, genes that were normally over-expressed in cortical areas with reduced MS were significantly up-regulated in a prior post mortem study of schizophrenia. We propose that this combination of neuroimaging and transcriptional data provides new insight into how previously implicated genes and proteins, as well as a number of unreported proteins in their vicinity on the protein interaction network, may interact to drive structural brain network changes in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most dangerous superbugs and is responsible for both acute and chronic infection. Current therapies are not effective because of biofilms that increase antibiotic resistance. Bacterial virulence and biofilm formation are regulated through a system called quorum sensing, which includes transcriptional regulators LasR and RhIR. These regulators are activated by their own natural autoinducers. Targeting this system is a promising strategy to combat bacterial pathogenicity. Flavonoids are very well known for their antimicrobial activity and taxifolin is one of them. It is also known that flavonoids inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation, but the mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we tried to analyse the mode of interactions of LasR with taxifolin. We used a combination of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning techniques, which includes principal component and cluster analysis to study the interaction of the LasR protein with taxifolin. We show that taxifolin has two binding modes. One binding mode is the interaction with ligand binding domain. The second mode is the interaction with the \\\"bridge\\\", which is a cryptic binding site. It involves conserved amino acid interactions from multiple domains. Biochemical studies show hydroxyl group of ring A in flavonoids is necessary for inhibition. In our model the hydroxyl group ensures the formation of many hydrogen bonds during the second binding mode. Microsecond simulations also show the stability of the formed complex. This study may offer insights on how taxifolin inhibits LasR and the quorum sensing circuitry.",

Managing and analyzing data from large-scale projects such as TCGA is a demanding task. Indeed, it is difficult to dissect the high complexity hidden in genomic data and to adequately account for tumor heterogeneity.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we used a robust statistical framework along with the integration of diverse bioinformatic tools to analyze next-generation sequencing data from more than 1000 patient samples from two different lung cancer subtypes, i.e., the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and the squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In particular, we used RNA-Seq gene expression data to identify both co-expression modules and differentially expressed genes to accurately discriminate between LUAD and LUSC. Moreover, we identified a group of genes which could act as specific oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in one of the two lung cancer types, as well as two dual role genes. Our results have also been cross-validated against other transcriptomics data of lung cancer patients.\\n\\nConclusionsOur integrative approach allowed to identify two key features: a substantial up-regulation of genes involved in O-glycosylation of mucins in LUAD, and a compromised immune response in LUSC. The immune-profile associated with LUSC is linked to the activation of three specific oncogenic pathways which promote the evasion of antitumor immune response, providing new future directions for the design of target therapies.",

    "abstract": "Mygalomorph spiders of the family Theraphosidae, known to the broader public as tarantulas, are among the most recognizable arachnids on earth due to their large size and widespread distribution. Their use of urticating setae is a notable adaptation that has evolved exclusively in certain New World theraphosids. Thus far, the evolutionary history of Theraphosidae remains poorly understood; theraphosid systematics still largely relies on morphological datasets, which suffer from high degrees of homoplasy, and traditional targeted sequencing of preselected genes failed to provide strong support for supra-generic clades (i.e. particularly those broader than subfamilies). In this study, we provide the first robust phylogenetic hypothesis of theraphosid evolution inferred from transcriptome data. A core ortholog approach was used to generate a phylogeny from 2460 orthologous genes across 25 theraphosid genera, representing all of the major theraphosid subfamilies, except Selenogyrinae. For the first time our phylogeny recovers a monophyletic group that comprises the vast majority of New World theraphosid subfamilies including Aviculariinae and Theraphosinae. Concurrently, we provide additional evidence for the integrity of questionable subfamilies, such as Poecilotheriinae and Psalmopoeinae, and support the non-monophyly of Ischnocolinae. The deeper relationships between almost all subfamilies are confidently inferred for the first time. We also used our phylogeny in tandem with published morphological data to perform ancestral state analyses on urticating setae. This revealed that the evolution of this important defensive trait might be explained by three equally parsimonious scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The development of vaccines that provide sterile protection against human malaria is a major global public health priority requiring a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in natural and vaccine-induced sterile immunity. RNAseq was used to profile gene expression of peripheral blood samples from 12 Duffy positive (Fy+) (Plasmodium vivax susceptible) volunteers enrolled in a phase 2 trial who were vaccinated with radiation attenuated P. vivax sporozoites (RAS; 5 were protected, 7 not) and from 5 Fy- (P. vivax resistant) volunteers exposed to mosquitoes harboring live non-attenuated sporozoites. Blood samples were obtained before and after immunization as well as after controlled infection with live P vivax sporozoites. The most profound changes in gene expression were observed between baseline and post-challenge, with 97 distinct signatures differentiating protected and not protected Fy+ individuals. Differentiation was also observed between Fy- and Fy+ protected individuals, notably with downregulation of multiple inflammatory responses as well as extracellular matrix-related gene activity. Analysis of transcriptional modules shows that both B-cell and T-cell signaling are reduced while cell cycle regulation, interferon response, and other informative signatures are elevated in individuals who are not protected against malaria. An asymptomatic individual had an intermediate profile indicative of differential transcription associated with pathology and symptomology. Systems biology thus provides insight into how whole malaria-attenuated sporozoites prime the immune system to protect against malaria, as well as the transcription responses that are associated with sterile protection.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTranscriptomic analysis has shed considerable light on the molecular mechanisms of vaccine efficacy against a variety of viral pathogens, but has not yet been used in relation to parasite vaccinology. Here we describe whole peripheral blood gene expression profiling to contrast the contributions of myeloid and lymphoid immune responses to vaccine-induced and natural protection against Plasmodium vivax- mediated malaria. Two modes of modular bioinformatic analyses are applied to RNAseq data from pre- and post-vaccination samples from 19 volunteer participants in a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of an irradiated sporozoite vaccine. During active infection, both B- and T-cell activity are reduced in individuals who are not protected by vaccination relative to those who are protected. Lack of the Fy antigen prevents entry of parasite into red blood cells, thereby providing natural clinical immunity, but we also document differences in T-cell and neutrophil activity in these individuals relative to those protected by irradiation of the parasite. One individual who was asymptomatic for malaria but had blood parasite despite vaccination showed an intermediate response indicating how systems biology approaches can distinguish gene expression associated with pathology and infection.",

However, there is still very little information about inversions in the human genome due to the difficulty of their detection. Here, thanks to the development of a new high-throughput genotyping method, we have performed a complete study of a representative set of 45 common human polymorphic inversions. Most inversions promoted by homologous recombination occur recurrently both in humans and great apes and, since they are not tagged by SNPs, they are missed by genome-wide association studies. Furthermore, there is an enrichment of inversions showing signatures of positive or balancing selection, diverse functional effects, such as gene disruption and gene-expression changes, or association with phenotypic traits. Therefore, our results indicate that the genome is more dynamic than previously thought and that human inversions have important functional and evolutionary consequences, making possible to determine for the first time their contribution to complex traits.",

Elite neutralizers are generated by natural germinal centre (GC) reactions in a very small subset of patients. The best strategy of how to promote the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies is not known. Here, computer simulations of GC reactions are used to predict a feedback loop based on memory B cells from previous GC reactions that promotes GCs to focus on new epitopes. The simulations suggest that the injection of antibodies against immunodominant epitopes fosters affinity maturation of antibodies specific for rare or hidden epitopes.

    "abstract": "Early-life adversity (ELA) is a major predictor of psychopathology, and is thought to increase lifetime risk by epigenetically regulating the genome. Here, focusing on the lateral amygdala, a major brain site for emotional homeostasis, we described molecular cross-talk among multiple epigenetic mechanisms, including 6 histone marks, DNA methylation and the transcriptome, in subjects with a history of ELA and controls. We first uncovered, in the healthy brain, previously unknown interactions among epigenetic layers, in particular related to non-CG methylation in the CAC context. We then showed that ELA associates with methylomic changes that are as frequent in the CAC as in the canonical CG context, while these two forms of plasticity occur in sharply distinct genomic regions, features, and chromatin states. Combining these multiple data indicated that immune-related and small GTPase signaling pathways are most consistently impaired in the amygdala of ELA individuals. Overall, this work provides new insights into epigenetic brain regulation as a function of early-life experience.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing the acquisition of proteomics data collected from a mass spectrometer (MS) requires careful selection of processed material quantities, liquid-chromatography (LC) setup, and data acquisition parameters. The small internal diameter (ID) columns standardly used in nano-chromatography coupled MS result in long per injection overhead times that require sacrifices in design of offline-fractionation and data acquisition schemes. As cohort sizes and the numbers of samples to be analyzed continue to increase, there is a need to investigate methods for improving the efficiency and time of an acquisition (LC + MS). In this work, the ability to improve throughput in single runs or as part of an in-depth proteome analysis of a fractionated sample using standard LC hardware is investigated. Capitalizing on the increased loading capacity of nanochromatography columns with larger IDs, substantially improved throughput with no reduction in detection sensitivity is achieved in single-injection proteome analyses. An optimized 150 m ID column setup is paired with an offline fractionation-concatenation scheme to demonstrate the ability to perform in-depth proteome analysis on-par with current state-of-the-art studies, while minimizing sample loading overhead. Together, these data demonstrate an easy and effective means to improve sample analysis throughput with no reduction in data quality using an approach that is applicable to any standard nano-LC hardware.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing has enabled high-throughput and fine-grained quantitative analyses of the transcriptome. While differential gene expression is the most widely used application of this technology, RNA-seq data also has the resolution to infer differential transcript usage (DTU), which can elucidate the role of different transcript isoforms between experimental conditions, cell types or tissues. DTU has typically been inferred from exon-count data, which has issues with assigning reads unambiguously to counting bins, and requires alignment of reads to the genome. Recently, approaches have emerged that use transcript quantifications estimates directly for DTU. Transcript counts can be inferred from  pseudo or lightweight aligners, which are significantly faster than traditional genome alignment. However, recent evaluations show lower sensitivity in DTU analysis. Transcript abundances are estimated from equivalence classes (ECs), which determine the transcripts that any given read is compatible with. Here we propose performing DTU testing directly on equivalence class read counts. We evaluate this approach on simulated human and drosophila data, as well as on a real dataset through subset testing. We find that ECs counts have similar sensitivity and false discovery rates as exon-level counts but can be generated in a fraction of the time through the use of pseudo-aligners. We posit that equivalent class counts is a natural unit on which to perform many types of analysis.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new model -- the \"Sum of Single Effects\" (SuSiE) model -- which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of \"single-effect\" vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure -- Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) -- which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under the SuSiE model. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a Credible Set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outper-form existing methods for this task, and illustrate their application to fine-mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable selection problems.",

The current availability of hundreds of GWAS results provide the unique opportunity to gain insight into these questions. In this study, we harmonized and systematically analysed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWAS on 558 unique traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of those loci are associated with multiple trait domains. We further show that potential causal genetic variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and how trait-polygenicity is related to an estimate of the required sample size to detect 90% of causal genetic variants. Our results provide novel insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource (http://atlas.ctglab.nl).",

To elucidate the cellular requirements for PrimPol in human cells, we generated PrimPol-deleted cell lines and show that it plays key roles in maintaining active replication in both the nucleus and mitochondrion, even in the absence of exogenous damage. Human cells lacking PrimPol exhibit delayed recovery after UV-C damage and increased mutation rates, micronuclei and sister chromatin exchanges but are not sensitive to genotoxins. PrimPol is also required during mitochondrial replication, with PrimPol-deficient cells having increased mtDNA copy number but displaying a significant decrease in replication rates. Deletion of PrimPol in XPV cells, lacking functional Pol Eta, causes an increase in DNA damage sensitivity and pronounced fork stalling after UV-C treatment. We show that, unlike canonical TLS polymerases, PrimPol is important for allowing active replication to proceed, even in the absence of exogenous damage, thus preventing the accumulation of excessive fork stalling and genetic mutations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of PrimPol for maintaining efficient DNA replication in unperturbed cells and its complementary roles, with Pol Eta, in damage tolerance in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction represents a fundamental computational biology problem. To address this problem, extensive research efforts have been made to extract predefined features from the sequences. Based on these features, statistical algorithms are learned to classify the PPIs. However, such explicit features are usually costly to extract, and typically have limited coverage on the PPI information. Hence, we present an end-to-end framework, Lasagna, for PPI predictions using only the primary sequences of a protein pair. Lasagna incorporates a deep residual recurrent convolutional neural network in the Siamese learning architecture, which leverages both robust local features and contextualized information that are significant for capturing the mutual influence of protein sequences. Our framework relieves the data pre-processing efforts that are required by other systems, and generalizes well to different application scenarios. Experimental evaluations show that Lasagna outperforms various state-of-the-art systems on the binary PPI prediction problem. Moreover, it shows a promising performance on more challenging problems of interaction type prediction and binding affinity estimation, where existing approaches fall short.

We explored alterations in gene expression in the Pre-Frontal Cortex (PFC) of 65 alcoholics and 73 controls of European descent, and identified 129 genes that showed altered expression (FDR < 0.05) in subjects with alcohol dependence. Differentially expressed genes were enriched for pathways related to interferon signaling and Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) signaling. A coexpression module (thistle2) identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was significantly correlated with alcohol dependence, alcohol consumption, and AUDIT scores. Genes in the thistle2 module were enriched with genes related to calcium signaling pathways and showed significant downregulation of these pathways, as well as enrichment for biological processes related to nicotine response and opioid signaling. A second module (brown4) showed significant upregulation of pathways related to immune signaling. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for genes in the brown4 module were also enriched for genetic associations with alcohol dependence and alcohol consumption in large genome-wide studies included in the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium and the UK Biobanks alcohol consumption dataset.

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of -synuclein aggregates known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, whose formation is linked to disease development. The causal relation between -synuclein aggregates and PD is not well understood. We generated a new transgenic mouse line (MI2) expressing human, aggregation-prone truncated 1-120 -synuclein under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. MI2 mice exhibit progressive aggregation of -synuclein in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and their striatal terminals. This is associated with a progressive reduction of striatal dopamine release, reduced striatal innervation and significant nigral dopaminergic nerve cell death starting from 6 and 12 months of age, respectively. Overt impairment in motor behavior was found in MI2 mice at 20 months of age, when 50% of dopaminergic neurons are lost. These changes were associated with an increase in the number and density of 20-500nm -synuclein species as shown by dSTORM. Treatment with the oligomer modulator anle138b, from 9-12 months of age, restored striatal dopamine release and prevented dopaminergic cell death. These effects were associated with a reduction of the inner density of -synuclein aggregates and an increase in dispersed small -synuclein species as revealed by dSTORM. The MI2 mouse model recapitulates the progressive dopaminergic deficit observed in PD, showing that early synaptic dysfunction precedes dopaminergic axonal loss and neuronal death that become associated with a motor deficit upon reaching a certain threshold. Our data also provide new mechanistic insight for the effect of anle138bs function in vivo supporting that targeting -synuclein aggregation is a promising therapeutic approach for PD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDKetamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant effects thought to be mediated by activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). To test this hypothesis, depressed patients were pretreated with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, prior to receiving ketamine.\\n\\nMETHODSTwenty-three patients suffering a major depressive episode were randomized to oral rapamycin (6 mg) or placebo, each was followed 2 hours later by ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in a double-blind cross-over design with treatment days separated by at least 2 weeks. Depression severity was assessed using Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Antidepressant response was defined as a MADRS improvement of 50% or more.\\n\\nRESULTSOver the two-week follow-up, we found a significant treatment by time interaction (F(8,245) = 2.02, p = 0.04), reflecting prolonged antidepressant effects post rapamycin+ketamine treatment. At 2 weeks, we found a significantly higher response rate following rapamycin+ketamine (41%) compared to placebo+ketamine (13%, p = 0.04). However, rapamycin pretreatment did not alter the acute effects of ketamine.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONUnexpectedly, pretreatment with rapamycin prolonged rather than blocked the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine. This observation raises questions about the role of mTORC1 in the antidepressant effects of keta-mine, raises the possibility that rapamycin may extend the benefits of ketamine, and thereby potentially sheds light on mechanisms that limit the duration of ketamine effects. The supplementing of ketamine with rapamycin may be a treat-ment strategy for reducing the frequency of ketamine infusions during maintenance treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cross-kingdom RNAi has been shown to play important roles during plant pathogen interactions. But this cross-kingdom RNAi was still unexplored in the wheat-Zymoseptoria tritici pathosystem. Here we performed a detailed analysis of the sRNA bidirectional crosstalk between wheat and Z. tritici. Using a combination of sRNA-seq and mRNA-seq we were able to identify known and novel sRNAs and study their expression and their action on putative targets in both wheat and Z. tritici. We predicted the target genes of all the sRNAs in either wheat or Z. tritici transcriptome and used degradome analysis to validate the cleavage of these gene transcripts. We could not find any clear evidence of a cross-kingdom RNAi in this pathosystem. We also found that the fungal sRNA enrichment was lower in planta than during in vitro growth, probably due to the lower expression of the only Dicer gene of the fungus during plant infection. However, we found a downregulation of specific wheat sRNAs during the fungal infection, leading to a boost expression of wheat defense related genes, which may be enhancing the plant defense ability against the pathogen. Additionally, the fungal infection also induced sRNAs regulating the expression of specific wheat genes, including auxin related genes, as an immune response. These results confirm the role of sRNAs in the regulation of wheat defenses during Z. tritici infection. Our findings contribute to improve our understanding of the interactions between wheat and Z. tritici.",

    "abstract": "Remembering sequences of events defines episodic memory, but retrieval can be driven by both ordinality and temporal contexts. Whether these modes of retrieval operate at the same time or not remains unclear. Theoretically, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) confers ordinality, while the hippocampus (HC) associates events in gradually changing temporal contexts. Here, we looked for evidence of each with BOLD fMRI in a sequence task that taxes both retrieval modes. To test ordinal modes, items were transferred between sequences but retained their position (e.g., AB3). Ordinal modes activated mPFC, but not HC. To test temporal contexts, we examined items that skipped ahead across lag distances (e.g., ABD). HC, but not mPFC, tracked temporal contexts. There was a mPFC and HC by retrieval mode interaction. These current results suggest that the mPFC and HC are concurrently engaged in different retrieval modes in support of remembering when an event occurred.\n\nSignificance StatementMemory for sequences of events is a defining aspect of everyday episodic memory allowing our brain to separate unique experiences that otherwise have overlapping sensory and spatial content. Sequence memory is impaired in typical aging and in disorders such as Alzheimers disease. The results of the current study provide new evidence that two retrieval modes concurrently arise during sequence memory, and they have distinct neural correlates. The medial prefrontal cortex contributes to an ordinal retrieval mode, while at the same time, the hippocampus contributes a gradually-changing temporal context mode of retrieval. These data shed new light on why typical episodic memory requires both the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, and suggests a functional dissociation between the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus across these modes of retrieval.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSecond-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) are essential in the treatment of psychotic disorders, but are well-known for inducing substantial weight gain and obesity. Critically, weight gain may reduce life expectancy for up to 20-30 years in patients with psychotic disorders, and prognostic bio-markers are generally lacking. The dorsal striatum, rich in dopamine D2 receptors which are antagonized by antipsychotic medications, plays a key role in the human reward system and in appetite regulation, suggesting that altered dopamine activity in the striatal reward circuitry may be responsible for increased food craving and resultant weight gain.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we measured striatal volume and striatal resting state functional connectivity at baseline, and weight gain over the course of 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in 81 patients with early-phase psychosis. We also included a sample of 58 healthy controls. Weight measurements were completed at baseline, and then weekly for 4 weeks, and every 2 weeks until week 12. We used linear mixed models to compute individual weight gain trajectories. Striatal volume and whole-brain striatal connectivity were then calculated for each subject, and used to assess the relationship between striatal structure and function and individual weight gain in multiple regression models.\\n\\nOutcomesPatients had similar baseline weights and body mass indices (BMI) compared to healthy controls. There was no evidence that prior drug exposure or duration of untreated psychosis correlated with baseline BMI. Higher left putamen volume and lower frontopolar connectivity predicted magnitude of weight gain in patients, and these effects multiplied when the structure-function interaction was considered.\\n\\nInterpretationThese results provide evidence for a synergistic effect of striatal structure and function on antipsychotics-induced weight gain. Lower fronto-striatal connectivity, implicated in less optimal long-term decision making, was associated with more weight gain, and this relationship was stronger for higher compared to lower left putamen volumes.\\n\\nFundingSupported by NIMH grant P50MH080173 to Dr. Malhotra, grant R01MH060004 to Dr. Robinson, grant R01MH076995 to Dr. Szeszko and R21MH101746 to Drs.
