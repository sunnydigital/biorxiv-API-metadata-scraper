    "abstract": "Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common form of congenital myopathy that results in hypotonia and muscle weakness. This disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, but three recently discovered genes in NM encode for members of the Kelch family of proteins. Kelch proteins act as substrate-specific-adapters for CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate protein turn-over through the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. Defects in thin filament formation and/or stability are key molecular processes that underlie the disease pathology in NM, however, the role of Kelch proteins in these processes in normal and diseases conditions remains elusive in vivo. Here, we describe a role of NM causing Kelch protein, KLHL41, in premyofibil-myofibil transition during skeletal muscle development through a regulation of the thin filament chaperone, NRAP. KLHL41 binds to the thin filament chaperone NRAP and promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NRAP, a process that is critical for the formation of mature myofibrils. KLHL41 deficiency results in abnormal accumulation of NRAP in muscle cells. NRAP overexpression in transgenic zebrafish resulted in a severe myopathic phenotype and absence of mature myofibrils demonstrating a role in disease pathology. Reducing Nrap levels in KLHL41 deficient zebrafish rescues the structural and function defects associated with disease pathology. We conclude that defects in KLHL41-mediated ubiquitination of sarcomeric protein contribute to structural and functional deficits in skeletal muscle. These findings further our understanding of how the sarcomere assembly is regulated by disease causing factors in vivo, which will be imperative for developing mechanism-based specific therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the aetiology of monogenic Parkinsons disease (PD). Yet the role that mitochondrial processes play in the most common form of the disease; sporadic PD, is yet to be fully established. Here we comprehensively assessed the role of mitochondrial function associated genes in sporadic PD by leveraging improvements in the scale and analysis of PD GWAS data with recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of mitochondrial disease. First, we identified that a proportion of the \\\"missing heritability\\\" of the PD can be explained by common variation within genes implicated in mitochondrial disease (primary gene list) and mitochondrial function (secondary gene list). Next we calculated a mitochondrial-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) and showed that cumulative small effect variants within both our primary and secondary gene lists are significantly associated with increased PD risk. Most significantly we further report that the PRS of the secondary mitochondrial gene list was significantly associated with later age at onset. Finally, to identify possible functional genomic associations we implemented Mendelian randomisation, which showed that 14 of these mitochondrial function associated genes showed functional consequence associated with PD risk. Further analysis suggested that the 14 identified genes are not only involved in mitophagy but implicate new mitochondrial processes. Our data suggests that therapeutics targeting mitochondrial bioenergetics and proteostasis pathways distinct from mitophagy could be beneficial to treating the early stage of PD.",

    "abstract": "Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is required for sexual differentiation in the fetus, and in adult females AMH is produced by growing ovarian follicles. Consequently, AMH levels are correlated with ovarian reserve, declining towards menopause when the oocyte pool is exhausted. A previous genome-wide association study identified three genetic variants in and around the AMH gene that explained 25% of variation in AMH levels in adolescent males but did not identify any genetic associations reaching genome-wide significance in adolescent females. To explore the role of genetic variation in determining AMH levels in women of late reproductive age, we carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis in 3,344 pre-menopausal women from five cohorts (median age 44-48 years at blood draw). A single genetic variant, rs16991615, previously associated with age at menopause, reached genome-wide significance at P=3.48x10-10, with a per allele difference in age-adjusted inverse normal AMH of 0.26 SD (95% CI [0.18,0.34]). We investigated whether genetic determinants of female reproductive lifespan were more generally associated with pre-menopausal AMH levels. Genetically-predicted age at menarche had no robust association but genetically-predicted age at menopause was associated with lower AMH levels by 0.18 SD (95% CI [0.14,0.21]) in age-adjusted inverse normal AMH per one-year earlier age at menopause. Our findings support the hypothesis that AMH is a valid measure of ovarian reserve in pre-menopausal women and suggest that the underlying biology of ovarian reserve results in a causal link between pre-menopausal AMH levels and menopause timing.",

    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine shows variable efficacy in protection against adult tuberculosis (TB). Earlier, we have described a BCG mutant vaccine with a transposon insertion in the gene coding for the secreted acid phosphatase SapM, which led to enhanced long-term survival of vaccinated mice challenged with TB infection. To facilitate development of this mutation as part of a future improved live attenuated TB vaccine, we have now characterized the genome and transcriptome of this sapM::Tn mutant versus parental BCG Pasteur. Furthermore, we show that the sapM::Tn mutant had an equal low pathogenicity as WT BCG upon intravenous administration to immunocompromised SCID mice, passing this important safety test. Subsequently, we investigated the clearance of this improved vaccine strain following vaccination and found a more effective innate immune control over the sapM::Tn vaccine bacteria as compared to WT BCG. This leads to a fast contraction of IFN{gamma} producing Th1 and Tc1 cells after sapM::Tn BCG vaccination. These findings corroborate that a live attenuated vaccine that affords improved long-term survival upon TB infection can be obtained by a mutation that further attenuates BCG. These findings suggest that an analysis of the effectiveness of innate immune control of the vaccine bacteria could be instructive also for other live attenuated TB vaccines that are currently under development, and encourage further studies of SapM mutation as a strategy in developing a more protective live attenuated TB vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Persistence, the dormant, stress-tolerant state formed primarily through the cessation of protein synthesis after antibiotic and nutrient stress, is arguably one of most vital phenotypes for bacteria since nearly all cells experience nutrient stress. Persisters are also responsible for many recurring infections. However, how persister cells wake to reconstitute infections is not understood well, beyond that the level of ribosomes governs their waking speed in rich medium. Here, using single cell observations, we determined that alanine as the sole carbon source wakes Escherichia coli persister cells and that persister cells do not wake stochastically but wake primarily when presented with a carbon source. By screening all E. coli proteins, we found that the mechanism of persister cell waking is through sensing nutrients by the chemotaxis and flagellum systems and by reducing levels of the secondary messenger cAMP, which leads to ribosome resuscitation and rescue. Hence, persister cells wake using pathways evolved for nutrient sensing.",

Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of hAPP/A{beta} accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP aggravates EC tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/A{beta}, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chemogenetic attenuation of A{beta}-associated hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/A{beta} accumulation and reduction of pathological tau in downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimers disease (AD), A{beta}-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, recognition of the AvrPphB effector protease from Pseudomonas syringae is mediated by the disease resistance (R) protein RPS5, which is activated by AvrPphB-induced cleavage of the Arabidopsis protein kinase PBS1. The recognition specificity of RPS5 can be altered by substituting the AvrPphB cleavage site within PBS1 with cleavage sequences for other proteases, including proteases from viruses. AvrPphB also activates defense responses in soybean (Glycine max), suggesting that soybean may contain an R protein analogous to RPS5. It was unknown, however, whether this response is mediated by cleavage of a soybean PBS1-like protein. Here we show that soybean contains three PBS1 orthologs and that their products are cleaved by AvrPphB. Further, transient expression of soybean PBS1 derivatives containing a five-alanine insertion at their AvrPphB cleavage sites activated cell death in soybean protoplasts, demonstrating that soybean likely contains an AvrPphB-specific resistance protein that is activated by a conformational change in soybean PBS1 proteins. Significantly, we show that a soybean PBS1 decoy protein modified to contain a cleavage site for the Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) NIa protease triggers cell death in soybean protoplasts when cleaved by this protease, indicating that the PBS1 decoy approach will work in soybean using endogenous PBS1 genes. Lastly, we show that activation of the AvrPphB-dependent cell death response effectively inhibits systemic spread of SMV in soybean. These data also indicate that decoy engineering may be feasible in other crop plant species that recognize AvrPphB protease activity.",

Here, we propose a biologically realistic and unifying approach to emergent pattern formation. Our biphasic model of multicellular tissues incorporates turnover and transport of morphogens controlling cell differentiation and tissue mechanics in a single framework, where one tissue phase consists of a poroelastic network made of cells and the other is the extracellular fluid permeating between cells. While this model encompasses previous theories approximating tissues to inert monophasic media, such as Turings reaction-diffusion model, it overcomes some of their key limitations permitting pattern formation via any two-species biochemical kinetics thanks to mechanically induced cross-diffusion flows. Moreover, we unravel a qualitatively different advection-driven instability which allows for the formation of patterns with a single morphogen and which single mode pattern scales with tissue size. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for tissue morphogenesis.",

Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture may have impacted the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial and viral stimuli between Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in the transcriptional response to viruses compared to that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control, and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Across the set of genetic variants underlying inter-population immune response differences, however, the signatures of positive selection were disproportionately observed in the rainforest hunter-gatherers. This result is counter to expectations based on the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can readily generate mutations that prevent bacteriophage (phage) adsorption and thus make bacteria resistant to infections with these viruses. Nevertheless, the majority of bacteria carry complex innate and/or adaptive immune systems: restriction-modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, respectively. Both RM and CRISPR-Cas are commonly assumed to have evolved and be maintained to protect bacteria from succumbing to infections with lytic phage. Using mathematical models and computer simulations, we explore the conditions, under which selection mediated by lytic phage will favor such complex innate and adaptive immune systems, as opposed to simple envelope resistance. The results of our analysis suggest that when populations of bacteria are confronted with lytic phage: (i) In the absence of immunity, resistance to even multiple bacteriophage species with independent receptors can evolve readily. (ii) RM immunity can benefit bacteria by preventing phage from invading established bacterial populations and particularly so when there are multiple bacteriophage species adsorbing to different receptors. (iii) Whether CRISPR-Cas immunity will prevail over envelope resistance depends critically on the length of the co-evolutionary arms race between the bacteria acquiring spacers and the phage generating CRISPR-escape mutants. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of the evolution and maintenance of RM and CRISPR-Cas and highlight fundamental questions that remain unanswered.\\n\\nSummaryThe two most widely used tools for manipulating and editing DNA restriction and Cas9 endonucleases both originate from studies of mechanisms that provide bacteria with immunity to infections with lytic bacteriophage (phage): restriction modification and CRISPR-Cas. Using mathematical and computer simulations, we explore the a priori conditions under which selection mediated by lytic phage will favor the evolution and maintenance of restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas immunity in bacteria that, by mutation, can generate envelope resistance to these phage. The results of our analysis make predictions and raise testable-hypotheses about the genetic and ecological conditions under which these immune systems, rather than envelope resistance, will evolve and be maintained as the dominant mechanism of protecting bacteria from succumbing to infections with these viruses.",

This alters stress granule assembly and reprograms translation by only allowing for the translation of mRNAs resistant to RNase L degradation, including numerous antiviral mRNAs such as IFN-{beta}.

    "abstract": "Farmed ruminants are the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions globally. The methanogenic archaea responsible for these emissions use molecular hydrogen (H2), produced during bacterial and eukaryotic carbohydrate fermentation, as their primary energy source. In this work, we used comparative genomic, metatranscriptomic, and co-culture-based approaches to gain a system-wide understanding of the organisms and pathways responsible for ruminal H2 metabolism. Two thirds of sequenced rumen bacterial and archaeal genomes encode enzymes that catalyze H2 production or consumption, including 26 distinct hydrogenase subgroups. Metatranscriptomic analysis confirmed that these hydrogenases are differentially expressed in sheep rumen. Electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases from carbohydrate-fermenting Clostridia (e.g. Ruminococcus) accounted for half of all hydrogenase transcripts. Various H2 uptake pathways were also expressed, including methanogenesis (Methanobrevibacter), fumarate reduction and nitrate ammonification (Selenomonas), and acetogenesis (Blautia). Whereas methanogenesis predominated in high methane yield sheep, alternative uptake pathways were significantly upregulated in low methane yield sheep. Complementing these findings, we observed significant differential expression and activity of the hydrogenases of the hydrogenogenic cellulose fermenter Ruminococcus albus and the hydrogenotrophic fumarate reducer Wolinella succinogenes in co-culture compared to pure culture. We conclude that H2 metabolism is a more complex and widespread trait among rumen microorganisms than previously recognized. There is evidence that alternative hydrogenotrophs, including acetogens and selenomonads, can prosper in the rumen and effectively compete with methanogens for H2 in low methane yield ruminants. Strategies to increase flux through alternative H2 uptake pathways, including animal selection, dietary supplementation, and methanogenesis inhibitors, may lead to sustained methane mitigation.",

    "abstract": "In less than a decade since its identification in 2009, the emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris has become a major public health threat due to its multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, high transmissibility, and high mortality. Unlike any other Candida species, C. auris has acquired high levels of resistance to an already limited arsenal of antifungals. As an emerging pathogen, there are currently a limited number of documented murine models of C. auris infection. These animal models use inoculums as high as 107-108 cells per mouse, and the environmental and occupational exposure of working with these models has not been clearly defined. Using real-time quantitative PCR and culture, we monitored the animal holding room as well as the procedure room for up to six months while working with an intravenous model of C. auris infection. This study determined that shedding of the organism is dose-dependent, as detectable levels of C. auris were detected in the cage bedding when mice were infected with 107 and 108 cells, but not with doses of 105 and 106 cells. Autoclaving bedding in closed micro-isolator cages was found to be an effective way to minimize exposure to animal caretakers. We found that tissue necropsies of infected mice were also an important source of potential source exposure to C. auris. To mitigate these potential exposures, we implemented a rigorous \\\"buddy system\\\" workflow and a disinfection protocol that uses 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol and can be used in any animal facility when using small animal models of C. auris infection.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic biological decomposition of organic matter is ubiquitous in Nature wherever anaerobic environments prevail, and is catalysed by hydrolytic, fermentative, acetogenic, methanogenic, and various other groups, including syntrophic bacteria. It is also harnessed in innovative ways in engineered systems that may rely on small (0.1-4.0 mm), spherical, anaerobic granules, which we have found to be highly-replicated, whole-ecosystems harbouring the entire community necessary to mineralise complex organics. We hypothesised distinct granule sizes correspond to stages in a biofilm life-cycle, in which small granules are  young and larger ones are  old. Here, granules were separated into 10 size fractions used for physico-chemical and ecological characterisation. Gradients of volatile solids, density, settleability, biofilm morphology, methanogenic activity, and EPS profiles were observed across size fractions. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes indicated linear convergence of diversity during community assembly as granules increased in size. A total of 155 discriminant OTUs were identified, and correlated strongly with physico-chemical parameters. Community assembly across sizes was influenced by a niche effect, whereby Euryarchaeota dominated a core microbiome presumably as granules became more anaerobic. The findings indicate opportunities for precision management of environmental biotechnologies, and the potential of aggregates as playgrounds to study assembly and succession in whole microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Survival and growth of the anaerobic gut fungi (AGF, Neocallimastigomycota) in the herbivorous gut necessitate the possession of multiple abilities absent in other fungal lineages. We hypothesized that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was instrumental in forging the evolution of AGF into a phylogenetically distinct gut-dwelling fungal lineage. Patterns of HGT were evaluated in the transcriptomes of 27 AGF strains, 22 of which were isolated and sequenced in this study, and 4 AGF genomes broadly covering the breadth of AGF diversity. We identified 283 distinct incidents of HGT in AGF transcriptomes, with subsequent gene duplication resulting in an HGT frequency of 2.1-3.6% in AGF genomes. The majority of HGT events were AGF specific (91.5%) and wide (70.7%), indicating their occurrence at early stages of AGF evolution. The acquired genes allowed AGF to expand their substrate utilization range, provided new venues for electron disposal, augmented their biosynthetic capabilities, and facilitated their adaptation to anaerobiosis. The majority of donors were anaerobic fermentative bacteria prevalent in the herbivorous gut. This work strongly indicates that HGT indispensably forged the evolution of AGF as a distinct fungal phylum and provides a unique example of the role of HGT in shaping the evolution of a high rank taxonomic eukaryotic lineage.\n\nImportanceThe anaerobic gut fungi (AGF) represent a distinct basal phylum lineage (Neocallimastigomycota) commonly encountered in the rumen and alimentary tracts of herbivores. Survival and growth of anaerobic gut fungi in these anaerobic, eutrophic, and prokaryotes dominated habitats necessitates the acquisition of several traits absent in other fungal lineages. This manuscript assesses the role of horizontal gene transfer as a relatively fast mechanism for trait acquisition by the Neocallimastigomycota post sequestration in the herbivorous gut. Analysis of twenty-seven transcriptomes that represent the broad Neocallimastigomycota diversity identified 283 distinct HGT events, with subsequent gene duplication resulting in an HGT frequency of 2.1-3.6% in AGF genomes. These HGT events have allowed AGF to survive in the herbivorous gut by expanding their substrate utilization range, augmenting their biosynthetic pathway, providing new routes for electron disposal by expanding fermentative capacities, and facilitating their adaptation to anaerobiosis. HGT in the AGF is also shown to be mainly a cross-kingdom affair, with the majority of donors belonging to the bacteria. This work represents a unique example of the role of HGT in shaping the evolution of a high rank taxonomic eukaryotic lineage.",

Mechanistically, we find this transition to be epigenetically governed by H3K27 trimethylation of cell identity-related promoters whose susceptibility to repression is predicted by H3K27 acetylation patterns in ICC. The phenotypic switch was reversible by inhibition, knockdown or in-vivo genomic inactivation of the polycomb H3K27 methyl-transferase Ezh2.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) placed over the motor hotspot (thought to represent the primary motor cortex (M1)) to modulate motor network excitability is highly variable. The premotor cortex--particularly the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)--may be a promising alternative target to more effectively modulate motor excitability, as it influences motor control across multiple pathways, one independent of M1 and one with direct, modulating connections to M1. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to differentially excite motor and premotor regions using high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). HD-tDCS applied over either the motor hotspot or the premotor cortex demonstrated high inter-individual variability in changes on cortical motor excitability. However, HD-tDCS over the premotor cortex led to a higher number of responders and greater changes in local fMRI-based complexity than HD-tDCS over the motor hotspot. Furthermore, an analysis of individual motor hotspot anatomical locations revealed that, in more than half of the participants, the motor hotspot is not located over anatomical M1 boundaries, despite using a canonical definition of the motor hotspot. This heterogeneity in stimulation site may contribute to the variability of tDCS results. Altogether, these findings provide new considerations to enhance tDCS reliability.",

The search approach used to identify synthetic biology publications identifies a core set of synthetic biology papers, extracts and refines keywords from these core records, searches for additional papers using those keywords, and supplements with articles published in dedicated synthetic biology journals and curated synthetic biology special collections. For the period from 2000 through to mid-July 2018, 11,369 synthetic biology publication records are identified worldwide. For patents, the search approach uses the same keywords as for publications then identifies further patents using a citation-tree search algorithm. The search covered patents by priority year from 2003 to early August 2018. Following geographical matching, 8,460 synthetic biology basic patent records were identified worldwide. Using this data, analyses of publications are presented which look at the growth of synthetic biology outputs, top countries and leading organizations, international co-authoring, leading subject categories, citations, synthetic biology on the map of science, and funding sponsorship. For patents, the analysis examines growth in patenting, national variations in publications compared with patenting, leading patent assignees, and the positioning of synthetic biology on a visualized map of patents.",

    "abstract": "Experiments on steady state bacterial cultures have uncovered several quantitative regularities at the system level. These include, first, the exponential growth of cell size with time and the balanced growth of intracellular chemicals between cell birth and division, which are puzzling given the nonlinear and decentralized chemical dynamics in the cell. We model a cell as a set of chemical populations undergoing nonlinear mass action kinetics in a container whose volume is a linear function of the chemical populations. This turns out to be a special class of dynamical system that generically has attractors in which all populations grow exponentially with time at the same rate. This explains exponential balanced growth of bacterial cells without invoking any regulatory mechanisms and suggests that this could be a robust property of protocells as well. Second, we consider the hypothesis that cells commit themselves to division when a certain internal chemical population reaches a threshold of N molecules. We show that this hypothesis leads to a simple explanation of some of the variability observed across cells in a bacterial culture. In particular it reproduces the adder property of cell size fluctuations observed recently in E. coli, the observed correlations between interdivision time, birth volume and added volume in a generation, and the observed scale of the fluctuations (CV ~ 10-30%) when N lies between 10 and 100. Third, upon including a suitable regulatory mechanism that optimizes the growth rate of the cell, the model reproduces the observed bacterial growth laws including the dependence of the growth rate and ribosomal protein fraction on the medium. Thus, the models provide a framework for unifying diverse aspects of bacterial growth physiology under one roof. They also suggest new questions for experimental and theoretical enquiry.",

Here I show that this number strongly correlates with the proportion of cancer cases due to anthropogenic and lifestyle risk factors, such as air pollution, occupational hazards, ionizing radiation, smoking, alcohol, poor diet, insufficient exercise and obesity, but does not seem to correlate with the proportion of cases due to infection or ultraviolet radiation. The correlation was confirmed for three different countries, three corresponding incidence databases, and three risk estimation studies, as well as for both sexes: USA, CDC WONDER database, Islami et al. study, males [r=0.82, P=0.0006, 13 cancer types], females [r=0.83, P<0.0001, 16 cancer types]; England, ECIS database, Brown et al. study, males [r=0.90, P<0.0001, 16 cancer types], females [r=0.67, P=0.002, 19 cancer types]; Australia, CI5 database, Whiteman et al. study, males [r=0.90, P=0.0004, 10 cancer types], females [r=0.68, P=0.01, 13 cancer types]. It is thus confirmed that predictions based on interpreting the age distribution of cancer incidence as the Erlang probability distribution have biological meaning, validating the underlying Poisson process as the law governing the development of the majority of cancer types, with the possible exception of infection- and UV-induced cancers. It also suggests that the majority of driver events (70-80% in males, 50-70% in females) are induced by anthropogenic carcinogens and the lifestyle, and not by cell divisions or other internal processes.",

In plants, it is reflected by a trade-off at the leaf level between the rate of carbon assimilation and lifespan, the so-called Leaf Economics Spectrum (LES). However, it is still unclear how the LES is connected to the slow-fast syndrome, and reflects adaptation to climate. Here, we measured growth, morpho-physiological and life-history traits at both leaf and whole-plant levels in 384 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. We examined the extent to which the LES continuum parallels the slow-fast continuum, and compared trait variation to neutral genetic differentiation between lineages. We found that the LES is tightly linked to variation in whole-plant functioning, relative growth rate and life history. A genetic analysis further suggested that phenotypic differentiation is linked to the evolution of different slow-fast strategies in contrasted climates. Together, our findings shed light on the physiological bases of the slow-fast continuum, and its role for plant adaptation to climate.",

KCNJ13 gene encodes the Kir7.1 subunit protein which acts as a tetrameric inwardly rectifying potassium ion channel in the retinal pigment epithelium to maintain ionic homeostasis thereby allowing photoreceptors to encode visual information. We sought to determine if genetic approaches might be effective in treating blindness due to mutations in KCNJ13.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed patient-derived hiPSC-RPE carrying an autosomal recessive nonsense mutation in the KCNJ13 gene (c.158G>A, p.Trp53*). We performed biochemical and electrophysiology assays of Kir7.1 function. Both small molecule read-through drug and gene-therapy approaches were tested using this disease-in-a-dish approach.\\n\\nResultsWe found that the LCA16 hiPSC-RPE had normal morphology but did not express a functional Kir7.1 channel and was unable to demonstrate normal physiology. Following read-through drug treatment, the LCA16 hiPSC cells were hyperpolarized by 30 mV and Kir7.1 current was restored. Similarly, loss-of-function of Kir7.1 channel was circumvented by lentiviral gene delivery to the hiPSC-RPE cells. In either approach, Kir7.1 protein was expressing normally with restoration of membrane potential and Kir7.1 current.\\n\\nConclusionLoss-of-function mutation in Kir7.1 is a cause of LCA. Using either read-through therapy or gene augmentation, we rescued Kir7.1 channel function in patient-derived iPSC-RPE cells via a precision medicine approach.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is ubiquitous worldwide and associated with multiple cancers including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The role of EBV viral genomic variation in NPC development and its striking endemicity in southern China has been poorly explored. Through large-scale genome sequencing and association study of EBV isolates from China, we identified two non-synonymous EBV variants within BALF2 strongly associated with NPC risk (conditional P value 1.75x10-6 for SNP162476_C and 3.23x10-13 for SNP163364_T), whose cumulative effects contributed to 83% of the overall risk in southern China. Phylogenetic analysis of the risk variants revealed a unique origin in southern China followed by clonal expansion. EBV BALF2 haplotype carrying the risk variants were shown to reduce viral lytic DNA replication, as a result potentially promoting viral latency. Our discovery has not only provided insight to the unique endemic pattern of NPC occurrence in southern China, but also paved the way for the identification of individuals at high risk of NPC and effective intervention program to reduce the disease burden in southern China.",

    "abstract": "AQP5 has been shown to be upregulated in kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic nephropathy. Here we investigate whether urinary baseline AQP5 is independently associated with eGFR decline in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Baseline urine samples (n=997) from patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy recruited in the Sun-MACRO randomized placebo controlled double blind clinical trial were used for AQP5 measurement, using human AQP5-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent kits. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression between AQP5 with eGFR slope (calculated by [&ge;]3 serum creatinine during followup) was performed, and association with fast renal function decline, defined as eGFR slope less than 3.0 mL/min/1.73m2/year, was determined by logistic regression. Followup eGFR data over 1.4 years from n=700 were available for analysis. AQP5 was undetectable in 138 patients. Tertiles of AQP5 were 0.4 [0 - 2.2], 7.3 [5.9 - 9.1], and 16.0 [13.0 - 21.6] (ng/mL), respectively (p<0.01). Patients in the highest tertile of AQP5 had significantly higher total cholesterol, lower baseline eGFR, and higher levels of albuminuria compared to the lowest tertile. AQP5 was inversely correlated with eGFR slope (Pearson r = -0.12, p<0.001), and independent of clinical risk factors age, sex, race, and baseline SBP, DBP, HbA1c, Tot. Cholesterol, eGFR, and UACR ({beta} = -0.05, p<0.004). Furthermore, AQP5 was significantly associated with fast eGFR decline (OR = 1.03 (95%CI 1.003 - 1.06), p<0.03). Our data suggest that baseline AQP5 is independently associated with the progression of eGFR decline in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceThe root microbiome composition is largely determined by the soil inoculum, with a distinct contribution from the host. Yet, the molecular mechanisms with which the host influences its rhizobiome are only beginning to be discovered. Using a hydroponics-based synthetic community approach, we probe the impact of root-exuded specialized metabolites in shaping the root microbiome. We uncover a role for coumarins in structuring the rhizobiome, particularly by limiting the growth of a Pseudomonas strain, for which we propose a mechanism of action. Our findings support the exciting possibility that root-exuded coumarins form a part of the plants adaptive response to iron deficiency that goes beyond iron mobilization to modulate the rhizobiome, and highlights avenues towards engineering the rhizosphere for plant health.\\n\\nAbstractThe factors that dictate the composition of the root microbiome and its role in plant fitness has been a long-standing question. Recent work has highlighted a major contribution of the soil inoculum in determining the composition of the root microbiome. However, plants are known to conditionally exude a diverse array of unique secondary metabolites, largely varying between species and environmental conditions. Here, we explore the role of specialized metabolites in dictating which bacteria reside in the rhizosphere. We employed a reduced synthetic community (SynCom) of Arabidopsis thaliana root-isolated bacteria to detect community shifts that occur in the absence of the secreted small molecule phytoalexins, flavonoids, and coumarins. We find that lack of coumarin biosynthesis in f6h1 mutant plant lines causes a shift in the root microbial community specifically under iron deficiency. We demonstrate a potential role for iron-mobilizing coumarins in sculpting the A. thaliana root bacterial community by inhibiting the proliferation of a relatively abundant Pseudomonas species via a redox-mediated mechanism. This work establishes a systematic approach enabling elucidation of specific mechanisms by which plant-derived molecules mediate microbial community composition. Our findings expand on the function of conditionally-exuded specialized metabolites and lead to new avenues to effectively engineer the rhizosphere for improving crop growth in alkaline soils, which make up a third of total arable soils.",

    "abstract": "Chlorophyll degradation is one of the most visible landmarks of leaf senescence. During senescence, chlorophyll is degraded in the multi-step pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO)/phyllobilin pathway, which is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. This regulation allows a coordinated and efficient remobilisation of nitrogen towards sink organs. Taking advantage of combined transcriptome and metabolite analyses during dark-induced senescence of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in key steps of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway, we show an unanticipated role for one of the pathway intermediates, i.e. pheophorbide a. Both jasmonic acid-related gene expression and jasmonic acid precursors specifically accumulated in pao1, deficient in PAO. We propose that pheophorbide a, the last intact porphyrin intermediate of chlorophyll degradation and unique pathway  bottleneck, has been recruited as a signalling molecule of the chloroplast metabolic status. Our work challenges the assumption that chlorophyll breakdown is merely a senescence output, but propose that the flux of pheophorbide a through the pathway acts in a feed-forward loop that remodels the nuclear transcriptome and controls the pace of chlorophyll degradation in senescing leaves.\\n\\nSummaryTranscriptome and metabolite profiles of key chlorophyll breakdown mutants reveal complex interplay between speed of chlorophyll degradation and jasmonic acid signalling\\n\\nFinancial sourcesThis work was supported by the European Union (Plant Fellow program), the Swiss National Foundation/ERA-NET (grant N{degrees} 163504) and the German Research Foundation (DFG, grant N{degrees} INST 186/822-1).",

We also surveyed life science PhD and postdoctoral trainees to assess their engagement in career preparation activities. PhD professionals employed in non-academic sectors had engaged in various career preparation activities during their training. Some activities had a higher perceived impact on the path to employment than others. Trainees had also engaged in such activities, but those rated by professionals as having a highly positive impact on their path to employment were engaged in by only a minority of trainees. The proportion of trainees who wished to work in a non-academic sector was higher among those who were closer to program completion. Like professionals, many trainees reported facing barriers to pursuing career development activities. Our findings suggest that PhD trainees seeking to work in non-academic sectors should engage in career preparation activities, particularly those that involve experiential learning. By supporting co-curricular programming and reducing barriers to participation in career development activities, academic administrators and faculty have the opportunity to support trainees professional development beyond the laboratory.",

    "abstract": "As more and more large psychiatric genetic cohorts are becoming available, more and more independent investigations into the underlying genetic architecture are performed, and an expanding set of replicates for estimates of key genetic parameters, namely, liability scale SNP heritability and genetic correlations - is amassing in the literature. In recent work, we published a set of SNP-heritability and genetic correlation estimates for major psychiatric disorders using data from the iPSYCH case-cohort study, and presented them alongside estimates gleaned from large, independently collected, analyzed and published meta-studies of the same disorders. Although in the broadest sense the estimates from iPSYCH and external meta-studies were concordant, and requiring strict statistical significance could reject the null hypothesis for few pairs, there were enough subtle trends in the differences to warrant further investigation. In this work, we consider a set of factors related to sample ascertainment, including the lifetime risks for disorders for the sampled populations, the use of age censored or partially screened controls, the sampling of extreme cases and controls, and diagnostic error rates, and attempt to assess their potential contributions to estimates of genetic parameters in the context of the difference trends observed in our previous work.",

    "abstract": "The diversity and complexity of transcription start site (TSS) selection reflects variation of preinitiation complexes, divergent function of promoter-binding proteins and underlies not only transcriptional dynamics but may also impact on post-transcriptional fates of RNAs. The majority of metazoan genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from a canonical initiation motif having an YR dinucleotide at their TSSs. In contrast, translation machinery-associated genes carry promoters with polypyrimidine initiator (known as 5-TOP or TCT) with cytosine replacing the R nucleotide. The functional significance of start site choice in promoter architectures is little understood. To get insight into the developmental regulation of start site selection we profiled 5 ends of transcripts during zebrafish embryogenesis. We uncovered a novel class of dual-initiation (DI) promoters utilized by thousands of genes. In DI promoters non-canonical YC-initiation representing 5-TOP/TCT initiators is intertwined with canonical YR-initiation. During maternal to zygotic transition, the two initiation types are divergently used in hundreds of DI promoters, demonstrating that the two initiation systems are distinctly regulated. We show via the example of snoRNA host genes and translation interference experiments that dual-initiation from shared promoters can lead to divergent spatio-temporal expression dynamics generating distinct sets of RNAs with different post-transcriptional fates. Thus utilization of DI promoters in large number of genes suggests two transcription initiation mechanisms targeting these promoters. DI promoters are conserved within human and fruit fly and reflect an evolutionary conserved mechanism for switching transcription initiation to adapt to the changing developmental context. Thus, our findings highlight a novel level of complexity of core promoter regulation in metazoans and broaden the scope for identification and characterization of alternative RNA products generated at shared core promoters.",

Overproduction of non-ecotropic ERV (NEERV) envelope glycoprotein, gp70, and resultant nephritis occur in lupus-prone mice. However, a NEERV repressor has not been identified to test if this association is causal. Here we identified suppressor of NEERV (Snerv) 1 & 2, Kruppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFP) that repressed NEERV by binding the NEERV long terminal repeat to recruit the transcriptional regulator KAP1. Germline Snerv1/2 deletion increased activating chromatin modifications, transcription, and gp70 expression from NEERV loci. F1 crosses of lupus-prone NZB and 129 mice to Snerv1/2-/- mice failed to restore NEERV repression, demonstrating that loss of SNERV underlies the lupus autoantigen gp70 overproduction that promotes nephritis in susceptible mice. Increased ERV expression in lupus patients was inversely correlated with expression of three putative ERV-suppressing KRAB-ZFP, suggesting that KRAB-ZFP-mediated ERV misexpression may contribute to human lupus pathogenesis.",

Klebsiella quasipneumoniae was recently defined as a new species, yet its prevalence, niche, and propensity to acquire antimicrobial resistance genes are not fully described. We have been tracking inter- and intra-species transmission of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) gene, blaKPC, between bacteria isolated from a single institution. We applied a combination of Illumina and PacBio whole-genome sequencing to identify and compare K. quasipneumoniae from patients and the hospital environment over 10 and five-year periods respectively. There were 32 blaKPC-positive K. quasipneumoniae isolates, all of which were identified as K. pneumoniae in the clinical microbiology laboratory, from eight patients and 11 sink drains, with evidence for seven separate blaKPC plasmid acquisitions. Analysis of a single subclade of K. quasipneumoniae subspecies quasipneumoniae (n=23 isolates) from three patients and six rooms demonstrated seeding of a sink by a patient, subsequent persistence of the strain in the hospital environment, and then probable transmission to another patient. Longitudinal analysis of this strain demonstrated the acquisition of two unique blaKPC plasmids and then subsequent within-strain genetic rearrangement through transposition and homologous recombination. Our analysis highlights the apparent molecular propensity of K. quasipneumoniae to persist in the environment as well as acquire carbapenemase plasmids from other species and enabled an assessment of the genetic rearrangements which may facilitate horizontal transmission of carbapenemases.",

    "abstract": "Heightened neuronal plasticity expressed during early postnatal life has been thought to permanently decline once critical periods have ended. For example, monocular deprivation is able to shift ocular dominance in the mouse visual cortex during the first months of life, but this effect is lost later in life. However, various treatments such as the antidepressant fluoxetine can reactivate a critical period-like plasticity in the adult brain. When monocular deprivation is supplemented with chronic fluoxetine administration, a major shift in ocular dominance is produced after the critical period has ended. In the current study, we characterized the temporal patterns of fluoxetine-induced plasticity in the adult mouse visual cortex, using in vivo optical imaging. We found that artificially-induced plasticity in ocular dominance extended beyond the duration of the naturally occurring critical period, and continued as long as fluoxetine was administered. However, this fluoxetine-induced plasticity period ended as soon as the drug was not given. Taken together, our data highlights how a combination of pharmacological treatment and environmental change could be used to improve strategies in antidepressant therapy in humans.",

    "abstract": "Spiders rely on mechanical vibration sensing for sexual signalling, prey capture and predator evasion. The sensory organs underlying vibration detection, called slit sensilla, resemble cracks in the spiders exoskeleton, and are distributed all over the spider body. Those crucial to sensing web- and other substrate-borne vibrations are called lyriform organs and are densely distributed around leg joints. It has been shown that forces that cause bending at leg joints also activate these lyriform organs. Little is known of how the biomechanics of the body of a freely-suspended spider in its natural posture interact with vibrations introduced into the body and how this affects vibration perception. Female black widow spiders, in particular, have a striking body-form; their long thin legs support a large pendulous abdomen. Here, we show that in their natural posture, the large abdominal mass of black widow females, interacts with the spring-like behaviour of their leg joints and determines the mechanical behaviour of different leg joints. Furthermore, we find that adopting different body postures enables females to alter both the level and tuning of the mechanical input to lyriform organs. Therefore, we suggest that posture may be used to flexibly and reversibly focus attention to different classes or components of web vibration. Postural effects thus emphasize the dynamic loop of interactions between behaviour and perception, i.e. between  brain and body.",

    "abstract": "The most common explanations for the evolution and persistence of herd behavior in large herbivores relate to decreased risk of predation. However, poisonous plants such as larkspur (Delphinium spp.) can present a threat comparable to predation. In the western United States, larkspur diminishes the economic and ecological sustainability of cattle production by killing valuable animals and restricting management options. Recommendations for mitigating losses have long focused on seasonal avoidance of pastures with larkspur, despite little evidence that this is practical or effective. Our ongoing research points to the cattle herd itself as the potential solution to this seemingly intractable challenge and suggests that larkspur and forage patchiness may drive deaths. In this paper, we present an agent-based model that incorporates neutral landscape models to assess the interaction between plant patchiness and herd behavior within the context of poisonous plants as predator and cattle as prey. The simulation results indicate that larkspur patchiness is indeed a driver of toxicosis and that highly cohesive herds can greatly reduce the risk of death in even the most dangerous circumstances. By placing the results in context with existing theories about the utility of herds, we demonstrate that grouping in large herbivores can be an adaptive response to patchily distributed poisonous plants. Lastly, our results hold significant management-relevant insight, both for cattle producers managing grazing in larkspur habitat and in general as a call to reconsider the manifold benefits of herd behavior among domestic herbivores.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects more than 1% of children in the United States. ASD risk is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with the perinatal period as a critical window. Understanding early transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers and treatments. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing (Non-TD) or neurotypical children.\\n\\nMethodsGenome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array in RNA from umbilical cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies--Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD. An algorithm-based diagnosis from 36 month assessments categorized the younger sibling as either ASD, typically developing (TD), or not ASD but non-typically developing (Non-TD). 59 ASD, 92 Non-TD, and 120 TD subjects were included and differences were identified in ASD versus TD subjects, with Non-TD versus TD as a specificity control. Meta-analysis was used to combine the results from both studies. Functional enrichments of differentially-expressed genes were examined across diagnostic groups.\\n\\nResultsWhile cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD did not reach genome-wide significance when adjusting for multiple comparisons, 172 genes were nominally differentially-expressed between ASD and TD cord blood (log2(fold change) > 0.1, p < 0.01). These genes were significantly enriched for toxic substance response and xenobiotic metabolism functions, and gene sets involved in chromatin regulation and systemic lupus erythematosus were significantly upregulated (FDR q < 0.05). In contrast, 66 genes were differentially-expressed between Non-TD and TD cord blood, including only 8 genes that were also differentially-expressed in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to identify perinatal gene expression differences in umbilical cord blood specific to ASD. The results of this meta-analysis across two prospective ASD cohorts support involvement of environmental, immune, and epigenetic mechanisms in ASD etiology.",

Skin contains several UV-sensitive chromophores and exposure to sunlight can produce molecules, such as vitamin D3, that act in an endocrine manner. We investigated whether the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), an environmental sensor and ligand-regulated transcription factor activated by numerous planar compounds of dietary or environmental origin, could be the target of endocrine photoproducts produced by cutaneous UV exposure. 15-to 30-minute exposure of cells to a minimal erythemal dose of UVB irradiation in vitro induced translocation of the AHR to the nucleus, rapidly inducing site-specific DNA binding and target gene regulation. Importantly, ex vivo studies with Ahr wild-type or null fibroblasts showed that serum from mice whose skin was exposed to a 15 min UVB dose, but not control serum, contained agonist activity within 30 min of UV irradiation, inducing AHR-dependent gene expression. Moreover, a 15-min cutaneous UVB exposure induced AHR site-specific DNA binding and target gene regulation in vivo within 3-6 hr post-irradiation in blood and in peripheral tissues, including intestine. These results show that cutaneous exposure of mice to a single minimal erythemic dose of UVB induces rapid AHR signaling in multiple peripheral organs, providing compelling evidence that moderate sun exposure can exert endocrine control of immunity through the AHR.",

To assess its role in automatic auditory deviance detection we analyzed the high frequency EEG activity (75-145 Hz) from 90 intracranial insular electrodes across 16 patients who were candidates for resective epilepsy surgery while they passively listened to a stream of standard and deviant tones. Deviant and standard tones differed in four physical dimensions: intensity, frequency, location and time. Auditory responses were found in the short and long gyri, and the anterior, superior, and inferior segments of the circular sulcus of the insular cortex, but only a subset of electrodes in the inferior segment showed deviance detection responses, i.e. a greater and later response to deviants relative to standards.

    "abstract": "The Tremadocian (Early Ordovician) is currently considered a time span of greenhouse conditions with tropical water surface temperature estimates, interpolated from oxygen isotopes, approaching 40{degrees}C. In the high-latitude Baltoscandian Basin, these data are in contrast with the discovery of glendonite, a pseudomorph of ikaite (CaCO3{middle dot}6H2O) and valuable indicator of near-freezing bottom-water conditions. The massive precipitation of this climatically sensitive mineral is associated with transgressive conditions and high organic productivity. Surprisingly, the precipitation of glendonite is contemporaneous with the record of conodonts displaying low {delta}18O values, which would suggest high temperatures (>40{degrees}C) in the water column. Therefore, the early Tremadocian sediments of Baltoscandia contain both \"greenhouse\" pelagic signals and near-freezing substrate indicators. This apparent paradox suggests both the influence of isotopically depleted freshwater yielded by fluvial systems, and the onset of sharp thermal stratification patterns in a semi-closed basin, which should have played an important role in moderating subpolar climates and reducing latitudinal gradients.",

The question of the amount of hyper-volume overlap and differentiation between species is of great interest to understand the processes that drive niche dynamics, competitive interactions and, ultimately, community assembly.\\n\\n2. A novel framework is proposed to decompose overall differentiation among hypervolumes into two distinct components: niche shifts and niche contraction / expansion processes. Niche shift corresponds to the replacement of space between the hypervolumes occupied by two species, whereas niche contraction / expansion processes correspond to net differences between the amount of space enclosed by each hypervolume.\\n\\n3. Hypervolumes were constructed for two Darwin finches, Geospiza conirostris and Geospiza magnirostris, using intraspecific trait data from Genovesa Island, where they live in sympatry.

This means that Geospiza conirostris occupied a different niche space and not a reduced space on Genovesa.\\n\\n4. The proposed framework allows disentangling different processes and understand the drivers of niche partitioning between coexisting species. Niche displacement due to competition can this way be separated from niche contraction due to specialization or expansion due to lower pressure on newly occupied ecological settings.",

Here we tested the validity of this assumption with a recombination-aware analysis of whole genome sequences from 27 species of the cat family. We found that the prevailing phylogenetic signal within the autosomes is not always representative of speciation history, due to ancient hybridization throughout felid evolution. Instead, phylogenetic signal was concentrated within large, conserved X-chromosome recombination deserts that exhibited recurrent patterns of strong genetic differentiation and selective sweeps across mammalian orders. By contrast, regions of high recombination were enriched for signatures of ancient gene flow, and these sequences inflated crown-lineage divergence times by ~40%. We conclude that standard phylogenomic approaches to infer the Tree of Life may be highly misleading without considering the genomic partitioning of phylogenetic signal relative to recombination rate, and its interplay with historical hybridization.",

    "abstract": "1.Pasteuria penetrans is a gram-positive endospore forming bacterial parasite of Meloidogyne spp. the most economically damaging genus of plant parasitic nematodes globally. The obligate antagonistic nature of P. penetrans makes it an attractive candidate biological control agent. However, deployment of P. penetrans for this purpose is inhibited by a lack of understanding of its metabolism and the molecular mechanics underpinning parasitism of the host, in particular the initial attachment of the endospore to the nematode cuticle. Several attempts to assemble the genomes of species within this genus have been unsuccessful. Primarily this is due to the obligate parasitic nature of the bacterium which makes obtaining genomic DNA of sufficient quantity and quality which is free from contamination challenging. Taking advantage of recent developments in whole genome amplification, long read sequencing platforms, and assembly algorithms, we have developed a protocol to generate large quantities of high molecular weight genomic DNA from a small number of purified endospores. We demonstrate this method via genomic assembly of P. penetrans. This assembly reveals a reduced genome of 2.64Mbp estimated to represent 86% of the complete sequence; its reduced metabolism reflects widespread reliance on the host and possibly associated organisms. Additionally, apparent expansion of transposases and prediction of partial competence pathways suggest a high degree of genomic plasticity. Phylogenetic analysis places our sequence within the Bacilli, and most closely related to Thermoactinomyces species. Seventeen predicted BclA-like proteins are identified which may be involved in the determination of attachment specificity. This resource may be used to develop in vitro culture methods and to investigate the genetic and molecular basis of attachment specificity.",

Epidemiological evidence indicate that glucose intolerance, deficits in insulin secretion or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participate in increasing the risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. A pivotal role in the process is played by insulin as the hormone critically regulates brain functioning. GLP-1, the glucagon-like peptide 1, facilitates insulin signaling, regulates glucose homeostasis, and modulates synaptic plasticity. Exenatide is a GLP-1R agonist, characterized by an extended half-life, employed in T2DM. However, exenatide has also been shown to affect the signaling of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performances in animal models of brain aging and neurodegeneration.\\n\\nMethodsin this study, we tested whether exenatide exerts neuroprotection in a preclinical AD model set to mimic the clinical complexity of the human disease. To that aim, we investigated the effects of 3-month exenatide treatment in 3xTg-AD mice challenged for six months with a high-fat diet (HFD). Endpoints of the study were variations in systemic metabolism, insulin and neurotrophic signaling, neuroinflammation, levels of A{beta} and tau pathology as well as changes in cognitive performances.\\n\\nFindings and interpretationresults of the study indicate that exenatide reverts the adverse changes of BDNF signaling and the neuroinflammation status of 3xTg-AD mice undergoing HFD.",

    "abstract": "An improved ability to direct and control biomolecular interactions in living cells would impact on synthetic biology. A key issue is the need to introduce interacting components that act orthogonally to endogenous proteomes and interactomes. Here we show that low-complexity, de novo designed protein-protein-interaction (PPI) domains can substitute for natural PPIs and guide engineered protein-DNA interactions in Escherichia coli. Specifically, we use de novo homo- and hetero-dimeric coiled coils to reconstitute a cytoplasmic split adenylate cyclase; to recruit RNA polymerase to a promoter and activate gene expression; and to oligomerize both natural and designed DNA-binding domains to repress transcription. Moreover, the stabilities of the heterodimeric coiled coils can be modulated by rational design and, thus, adjust the levels of gene activation and repression in vivo. These experiments demonstrate the possibilities for using designed proteins and interactions to control biomolecular systems such as enzyme cascades and circuits in cells.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that a deep memory of early life is hidden in the architecture of metabolic networks, whose reactions could have been catalyzed by small molecules or minerals prior to genetically encoded enzymes (1-6). A major challenge in unraveling these early steps is assessing the plausibility of a connected, thermodynamically consistent proto-metabolism under different geochemical conditions, which are still surrounded by high uncertainty. Here we combine network-based algorithms (9, 10) with physicochemical constraints on chemical reaction networks to systematically show how different combinations of parameters (temperature, pH, redox potential and availability of molecular precursors) could have affected the evolution of a proto-metabolism. Our analysis of possible trajectories indicates that a subset of boundary conditions converges to an organo-sulfur-based proto-metabolic network fueled by a thioester- and redox-driven variant of the reductive TCA cycle, capable of producing lipids and keto acids. Surprisingly, environmental sources of fixed nitrogen and low-potential electron donors seem not to be necessary for the earliest phases of biochemical evolution. We use one of these networks to build a steady-state dynamical metabolic model of a proto-cell, and find that different combinations of carbon sources and electron acceptors can support the continuous production of a minimal ancient \\\"biomass\\\" composed of putative early biopolymers and fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Conservation in multi-use landscapes requires identifying and conserving critical resources for imperiled species because those resources may otherwise be destroyed or degraded by human activity. Summer day-roost sites are critical resources for bats, so conserving roost sites is thus an important component of many bat conservation plans. We used VHF telemetry to identify and characterize summer day-roost selection by male northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) at the western edge of their range in South Dakota, USA. We tracked 18 bats to 43 tree roosts and used an information theoretic approach to determine the relative importance of tree- and plot-level characteristics on roost site selection. Bats selected roost trees that were larger in diameter, more decayed, closer to more snags, and under denser canopy than other trees available on the landscape. Protecting large-diameter snags within intact forest is important for the conservation of this federally threatened species, particularly along the western edge of its range where it may be subject to range contraction and local extinction. Protecting short ([&le;] 3 m) snags in particular may be a low-risk, high-reward strategy for conservation of resources important to male northern long-eared bats.",

    "abstract": "Application of assembly methods for personal genome analysis from next generation sequencing data has been limited by the requirement for an expensive supercomputer hardware or long computation times when using ordinary resources. We describe CompStor Novos, achieving supercomputer-class performance in de novo assembly computation time on standard server hardware, based on a tiered-memory implementation. Run on commercial off-the-shelf servers, Novos assembly is more precise and 10-20 times faster than that of existing assembly algorithms. Furthermore, we integrated Novos into a variant calling pipeline and demonstrate that both compute times and precision of calling point variants and indels compare well with standard alignment-based pipelines. Additionally, assembly eliminates bias in the estimation of allele frequency for indels and naturally enables discovery of breakpoints for structural variants with base pair resolution. Thus, Novos bridges the gap between alignment-based and assembly-based genome analyses. Extension and adaption of its underlying algorithm will help quickly and fully harvest information in sequencing reads for personal genome reconstruction.",

We used normative adult brain gene expression data, and partial least squares (PLS) analysis, to find the weighted gene expression pattern that was most co-located with the cortical map of schizotypy-related magnetization (SRM).\n\nResultsMagnetization was significantly correlated with schizotypy in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (and for disorganized schizotypy also in medial prefrontal cortex; all FDR-corrected P < 0.05), which are regions of the default mode network specialized for social and memory functions. The genes most positively weighted on the whole genome expression map co-located with SRM were enriched for genes that were significantly down-regulated in two prior case-control histological studies of brain gene expression in schizophrenia. Conversely, the most negatively weighted genes were enriched for genes that were transcriptionally up-regulated in schizophrenia. Positively weighted (down-regulated) genes were enriched for neuronal, specifically inter-neuronal, affiliations and coded a network of proteins comprising a few highly interactive \"hubs\" such as parvalbumin and calmodulin.\n\nConclusionsMicrostructural MRI maps of intracortical magnetization can be linked to both the behavioural traits of schizotypy and to prior histological data on dysregulated gene expression in schizophrenia.",

Despite their great potential, BCIs perform inconsistently across individuals. Moreover, the neural processes activated by training that enable humans to achieve good control remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that BCI skill acquisition is paralleled by a progressive reinforcement of task-related activity and by the reduction of connectivity between regions beyond those primarily targeted during the experiments. Notably, these patterns of activity and connectivity reflect growing automaticity and predict future BCI performance. Altogether, our findings provide new insights in the neural mechanisms underlying BCI learning, which have implications for the use of this technology in a broad range of real-life applications.",

Two identical NFT systems in a greenhouse were used to grow tomato plants. One was connected to a slow sand filter (SSF), and one was used as control. DNA was isolated from irrigation freshwater, and molecular methods were carried out to characterise the BCC. These included terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), cloning and 454 pyrosequencing. A total number of 291 442 trimmed sequences, of 211 bp average length. A strong differentiation of the bacterial community composition in recycled irrigation water was triggered by the activity of the SSF. Phylogenetic affiliation revealed that Bacilli, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, and Nitrospira were differentially abundant during filtration with the SSF. This study showed that SSF modified the relative amount of a set of bacterial genera. These included Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Burkholderia and Azospirillum. These bacteria have been previously described as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The presence, increased or exclusive, in Water ssf of bacteria such as Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospira, Firmicutes, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, was associated with an increased biomass in plants. Such findings are promising for future applications of a combined system NFT-SSF: NFT guarantees a controlled closed environment for the growth of plants, while the SSF secures the microbiological balance of recycled irrigation water.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of mitochondrial genomes is essential for the adaptation of yeasts to the variation of environmental levels of oxygen. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA lacks all complex I genes, respiration is possible because alternative NADH dehydrogenases are encoded by NDE1 and NDI1 nuclear genes. The proposed whole genome duplication (WGD) in the yeast ancestor at 150-100 million years ago caused nuclear gene duplications and secondary losses, although its relation to the loss of complex I mitocondrial is unknown. Here we present phylogenomic supertrees and supermatrix tree of 46 mitochondrial genomes showing that the loss of complex I predates WGD and occurred independently in the S. cerevisiae group and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We also show that the branching patterns do not differ dramatically in supertrees and supermatrix phylogenies. Our inferences indicated consistent relations between conserved mitochondrial chromosomal gene order (synteny) in closely related yeasts. Correlation of mitochondrial molecular clock estimates and atmospheric oxygen variation in the Phanerozoic suggests that the Saccharomyces lineage might have lost the complex I during hypoxic periods near Perminian-Triassic or Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction events, while the Schizosaccharomyces lineage possibly lost the complex I during hypoxic environment periods during Middle Cambrian until Lower Devonian. The loss of mitochondrial complex I during low oxygen might not affect yeast metabolism due to fermentative switch. The return to increased oxygen periods might have favored adaptations to aerobic metabolism. Additionally, we also showed that NDE1 and NDI1 phylogenies indicate evolutionary convergence in yeasts where mitochondrial complex I is absent.",

In this study, we analyzed the distribution of GRN structural properties across a large set of distinct prokaryotic organisms and found a set of constrained characteristics such as network density and number of regulators. Our results allowed us to estimate the number of interactions that complete networks would have, a valuable insight that could aid in the daunting task of network curation, prediction, and validation. Using state-of-the-art statistical approaches, we also provided new evidence to settle a previously stated controversy that raised the possibility of complete biological networks being random. Therefore, attributing the observed scale-free properties to an artifact emerging from the sampling process during network discovery. Furthermore, we identified a set of properties that enabled us to assess the consistency of the connectivity distribution for various GRNs against different alternative statistical distributions. Our results favor the hypothesis that highly connected nodes (hubs) are not a consequence of network incompleteness. Finally, an interaction coverage computed for the GRNs as a proxy for completeness revealed that high-throughput based reconstructions of GRNs could yield biased networks with a low average clustering coefficient, showing that classical targeted discovery of interactions is still needed.",

The anti-quorum sensing activity was investigated by biosensor bioassay using Chromobacterium violaceum CVO26 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Quorum sensing is a key regulator of virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa such as bio-film formation, motility, productions of proteases, hemolysin, and Pyocyanin production. Additionally, the GC/MS technique was employed to detect the essential components of avocado oil. Avocado oil inhibits quorum system-mediated virulence factor production such as violacein in C.

Additionally, the use of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of avocado oil significantly inhibits the quorum system-mediated biofilm formation, exopolysaccride production (EPS) and swarming motility. Furthermore, this study concerned the potent activity of avocado oil antibacterial and antioxidant agent. Moreover, a total of 23 components was identified in avocado oil by GC/MS.Avocado oil could be exploited as a natural source of anti-pathogenic, where the pathogenicity is mediated through quorum sensing, antibacterial as well as antioxidant agents.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/486928_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (30K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f44fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9f371org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ddc15aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c136a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Stress profoundly impacts the brain and increases the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The brains response to stress is mediated by a number of pathways that affect gene expression and protein function throughout the cell. Understanding how stress achieves such dramatic effects on the brain requires an understanding of the brains stress response pathways. The majority of studies focused on molecular changes have employed repeated or chronic stress paradigms to assess the long-term consequences of stress and have not taken an integrative genomic and/or proteomic approach. Here, we determined the lasting impact of a single stressful event (restraint) on the broad molecular profile of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), a key brain region mediating emotion, memory and stress. Molecular profiling performed thirty days post-restraint consisted of small RNA sequencing, RNA sequencing and quantitative mass spectrometry and identified long-lasting changes in microRNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins. Alignment of the three datasets further delineated the regulation of stress-specific pathways which were validated by qPCR and Western Blot analysis. From this analysis, mir-29a-5p was identified as a putative regulator of stress-induced adaptations in the BLC. Further, a number of predicted mir-29a-5p targets are regulated at the mRNA and protein level. The concerted and long-lasting disruption of multiple molecular pathways in the amygdala by a single stress event is expected to be sufficient to alter behavioral responses to a wide array of future experiences, including exposure to additional stressors.",

    "abstract": "Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is rare, autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by hypervascularised tumour formation in multiple organ systems. Vision loss associated with retinal capillary hemangioblastomas remains one of the earliest complications of VHL disease. The mortality of Vhl-/- mice in utero restricted modelling of VHL disease in this mammalian model. Zebrafish harbouring a recessive germline mutation in the vhl gene represent a viable, alterative vertebrate model to investigate associated ocular loss-of-function phenotypes. Previous studies reported neovascularization of the brain, eye and trunk together with odema in the vhl-/- zebrafish eye. In this study, we demonstrate vhl-/- zebrafish almost entirely lack visual function. Furthermore, hyaloid vasculature networks in the vhl-/- eye are improperly formed and this phenotype is concomitant with development of an ectopic intraretinal vasculature. Sunitinib, a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, market authorised for cancer, reversed the ocular behavioural and morphological phenotypes observed in vhl-/- zebrafish. We conclude that the zebrafish vhl gene contributes to the endogenous molecular barrier that prevents development of intraretinal vasculature and that sunitinib can improve visual function and hyaloid vessel patterning while reducing abnormally formed ectopic intraretinal and choroidal vessels in vhl-/- zebrafish.",
