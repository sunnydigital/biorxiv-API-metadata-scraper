    "abstract": "Pathogen strains can stably coexist if they specialize on different hosts. Multiple strains can also coexist on a single host through negative frequency-dependent interactions mediated by partial cross-immunity. Understanding pathogen diversity remains a challenge however when both host specificity and cross-immunity are acting and may be functionally linked, as has been proposed for rotavirus, where a single protein is both antigenically important and determines host specificity by binding to the genetically encoded human blood group antigens. This situation is akin to the more general question in ecology of species coexistence when stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms interact. We examine this interaction with a theoretical model motivated by rotavirus and apply an adaptive dynamics framework to show how these two kinds of competition, typically considered separately, affect diversity. When cross-immunity depends on host-pathogen affinity, diversity is magnified as long-term evolution allows for the coexistence of multiple semi-specialized strains, similar to observations in rotavirus. In contrast, the simultaneous co-occurrence of several semi-specialized individuals is not observed when the degree of cross-immunity is independent from affinity distance among strains. The interplay of equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms fundamentally modifies diversity patterns and should be considered when addressing strain coexistence.",

    "abstract": "In human post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a major psychiatry challenge is how diverse stress reactions emerge after a protracted symptom-free period. Here, we study the behavioral development in mice isolated after observing an aggressive encounter inflicted upon their pair-housed partners and compared the results with those in multiple control paradigms. Compared with mice plainly isolated, mice isolated following the acute witnessing social stress gradually developed a wide range of long-term differences of their physiological conditions, spontaneous behaviors, and social interactions, including paradoxical results if interpreted in traditional ways. To address this developmental diversity, we applied fine-scale behavioral analysis to standard behavioral tests and showed that the seemingly sudden emergent behavioral differences developed gradually. Mice showed different developmental patterns in different zones of a behavior testing apparatus. However, the results of the fine-scale analysis together with state-space behavioral characterization allow a consistent interpretation of the seemingly conflicting observations among multiple tests. Interestingly, these behavioral differences were not observed if the aggressive encounter happened to a stranger mouse. Additionally, traumatized mice showed rebound responses to their partners after the long separation. In contrast, mice pair-housed with their attacked partners after the aggressive encounters still showed a difference in social interactions, while a difference in spontaneous behaviors did not occur. Accordingly, we propose that social relationship is the single common factor underlying the otherwise independent development of behavioral differences in this mouse paradigm and that the gained insights could have parallels in human PTSD development.",

    "abstract": "Cortical responses to sensory stimuli are highly variable, and sensory cortex exhibits intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Here, by recording over 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we show that spontaneous activity reliably encodes a high-dimensional latent state, which is partially related to the mouses ongoing behavior and is represented not just in visual cortex but across the forebrain. Sensory inputs do not interrupt this ongoing signal, but add onto it a representation of visual stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.",

    "abstract": "Protein loops connect regular secondary structures and contain 4-residue beta turns which represent 63% of the residues in loops. The commonly used classification of beta turns (Type I, I, II, II, VIa1, VIa2, VIb, and VIII) was developed in the 1970s and 1980s from analysis of a small number of proteins of average resolution, and represents only two thirds of beta turns observed in proteins (with a generic class Type IV representing the rest). We present a new clustering of beta turn conformations from a set of 13,030 turns from 1078 ultra-high resolution protein structures ([&le;]1.2 [A]). Our clustering is derived from applying the DBSCAN and k-medoids algorithms to this data set with a metric commonly used in directional statistics applied to the set of dihedral angles from the second and third residues of each turn. We define 18 turn types compared to the 8 classical turn types in common use. We propose a new 2-letter nomenclature for all 18 beta-turn types using Ramachandran region names for the two central residues (e.g.,  A and  D for alpha regions on the left side of the Ramachandran map and  a and  d for equivalent regions on the right-hand side; classical Type I turns are  AD turns and Type I turns are  ad). We identify 11 new types of beta turn, 5 of which are sub-types of classical beta turn types. Up-to-date statistics, probability densities of conformations, and sequence profiles of beta turns in loops were collected and analyzed. A library of turn types, BetaTurnLib18, and cross-platform software, BetaTurnTool18, which identifies turns in an input protein structure, are freely available and redistributable from dunbrack.fccc.edu/betaturn and github.com/sh-maxim/BetaTurn18. Given the ubiquitous nature of beta turns, this comprehensive study updates understanding of beta turns and should also provide useful tools for protein structure determination, refinement, and prediction programs.",

Yet a coherent framework describing pulvinar function remains elusive due to its anatomical complexity and involvement in diverse cognitive processes. Here we combined large-scale anatomical circuit mapping with high-density electrophysiological recordings to dissect a homolog of pulvinar in mice, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP). We define three broad LP subregions based on correspondence between input/output connectivity and functional properties. These subregions form corticothalamic loops biased towards ventral or dorsal stream cortical areas and contain separate representations of visual space. To reveal which input sources drive LP activity, we silenced visual cortex or superior colliculus and found they drive visual tuning properties in separate LP subregions. Thus, by specifying the driving input sources, functional properties, and downstream targets of LP circuits, our data provide a roadmap for understanding the mechanisms of higher-order thalamic function in vision.",

    "abstract": "Changes in coloration enable animals to refine their camouflage to match different visual environments. Such plasticity provides ecological benefits and could potentially be exploited to support conservation or stock enhancement efforts. One application could be ensuring that hatchery-reared animals, reared to stock wild populations, are appropriately matched to their environment on release. European lobster (Homarus gammarus) hatcheries aim to restock or enhance local lobster populations by rearing juveniles through their most vulnerable stages, then releasing them into the wild. However, little consideration has been given to their camouflage and the implications of matching individuals to their release site. This study assesses to what extent juvenile lobsters can change coloration to match their background and whether hatchery practices could be altered to enhance lobster camouflage. We test this by switching individuals between black or white backgrounds in the laboratory and monitoring their coloration over time. Our work demonstrates the capacity of juvenile lobsters to change lightness in response to their surroundings. We show that juvenile lobsters are capable of small changes in luminance (perceived lightness) to better match their background over 2-3 weeks. These changes potentially correspond to improved camouflage, based on a model of predator (European pollack, Pollachius pollachius) vision. However, over a longer period (5 weeks), lobsters maintained on either background converged on the same darker coloration, suggesting that lobsters also experience changes in appearance associated with ontogeny. By refining the approaches used here, there is potential for hatcheries to rear lobsters on backgrounds that better match their release site. However, such manipulations should be considered in the context of ontogenetic changes and release timing (which varies between stocking programmes). This study highlights the potential to use colour change in stocking and aquaculture, as well as gaps that could be addressed through further research in this area.",

Here we develop a new approach to assess how the genetic variation inherent in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity. We do this by determining both the transcriptome and full-length sequences of all viral genes in single influenza-infected cells. Most cells are infected by virions with defects such as amino-acid mutations, internal deletions, or failure to express a gene. We identify instances of each type of defect that increase the likelihood that a cell activates an innate-immune response. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects, and sometimes occurs even when a cell is infected by a virion that expresses unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that viral genetic variation substantially contributes to but does not fully explain the heterogeneity in single influenza-infected cells.",

    "abstract": "The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins is crucial in pharmaceutical sciences. The experimental validation of interactions in genomic drug discovery is laborious and expensive; hence, there is a need for efficient and accurate in-silico techniques which can predict potential drug-target interactions to narrow down the search space for experimental verification.\\n\\nIn this work, we propose a new framework, namely, Multi Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization, which predicts the interactions between drugs and proteins from three inputs: known drug-target interaction network, similarities over drugs and those over targets. The proposed method focuses on finding a low-rank interaction matrix that is structured by the proximities of drugs and targets encoded by graphs. Previous works on Drug Target Interaction (DTI) prediction have shown that incorporating drug and target similarities helps in learning the data manifold better by preserving the local geometries of the original data. But, there is no clear consensus on which kind and what combination of similarities would best assist the prediction task. Hence, we propose to use various multiple drug-drug similarities and target-target similarities as multiple graph Laplacian (over drugs/targets) regularization terms to capture the proximities exhaustively.\\n\\nExtensive cross-validation experiments on four benchmark datasets using standard evaluation metrics (AUPR and AUC) show that the proposed algorithm improves the predictive performance and outperforms recent state-of-the-art computational methods by a large margin.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThis work introduces a computational approach, namely Multi-Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization (MGRNNM), to predict potential interactions between drugs and targets. The novelty of MGRNNM lies in structuring drug-target interactions by multiple proximities of drugs and targets. There have been previous works which have graph regularized Matrix factorization and Matrix completion algorithms to incorporate the standard chemical structure drug similarity and genomic sequence target protein similarity, respectively. We introduce multiple drug-graph laplacian and target-graph laplacian regularization terms to the standard matrix completion framework to predict the missing values in the interaction matrix. The graph Laplacian terms are constructed from various kinds and combinations of similarities over drugs and targets (computed from the interaction matrix itself). In addition to this, we further improve the prediction accuracy by sparsifying the drug and target similarity matrices, respectively. For performance evaluation, we conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that MGRNNM clearly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods under three different cross-validation settings, in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR).",

    "abstract": "Copy-number variants (CNVs) are a major cause of several genetic disorders, making their detection an essential component of genetic analysis pipelines. Current methods for detecting CNVs from exome sequencing data are limited by high false positive rates and low concordance due to the inherent biases of individual algorithms. To overcome these issues, calls generated by two or more algorithms are often intersected using Venn-diagram approaches to identify \\\"high-confidence\\\" CNVs. However, this approach is inadequate, as it misses potentially true calls that do not have consensus from multiple callers. Here, we present CN-Learn, a machine-learning framework (https://github.com/girirajanlab/CN_Learn) that integrates calls from multiple CNV detection algorithms and learns to accurately identify true CNVs using caller-specific and genomic features from a small subset of validated CNVs. Using CNVs predicted by four exome-based CNV callers (CANOES, CODEX, XHMM and CLAMMS) from 503 samples, we demonstrate that CN-Learn identifies true CNVs at higher precision (~90%) and recall (~85%) rates while maintaining robust performance even when trained with minimal data (~30 samples). CN-Learn recovers twice as many CNVs compared to individual callers or Venn diagram-based approaches, with features such as exome capture probe count, caller concordance and GC content providing the most discriminatory power. In fact, about 58% of all true CNVs recovered by CN-Learn were either singletons or calls that lacked support from at least one caller. Our study underscores the limitations of current approaches for CNV identification and provides an effective method that yields high-quality CNVs for application in clinical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "The role of increased predator numbers in the general decline of bird populations in the late 20th century remains controversial, particularly in the case of the Eurasian Sparrowhawk, for which there are contradictory results concerning its effect on the abundance of potential prey species. Previous studies of breeding season census data for Sparrowhawks and prey species in Britain have measured predator abundance either as raw presence-absence data or as an estimate derived from spatially explicit modelling, and have found little evidence of association between predator and prey populations. Here, a predator index derived from site-level binary logistic modelling was used in a regression analysis of breeding census data on 42 prey species, with significant effects emerging in 27 species (16 positive, 11 negative). The frequency of significant positive associations may indicate the tracking of prey abundance by Sparrowhawks, which would tend to cancel out any negative predation effect on prey populations, rendering it difficult to detect using census data. If so, the negative effects that have emerged for some species may underestimate the impact of increased Sparrowhawk numbers on the prey populations concerned. Nevertheless, estimates of the effect on national populations of prey species, obtained by combining effect sizes with a measure of the increase in site occupancy by the predator, suggest the possibility of a substantial impact. It cannot, therefore, be ruled out that the increase in abundance and range expansion of Sparrowhawks made a significant contribution to contemporaneous declines in the populations of many of its prey species.",

    "abstract": "Visual gamma oscillations are generated through interactions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and are strongly modulated by sensory input. A moderate increase in excitatory drive to the visual cortex via increasing contrast or motion velocity of drifting gratings results in strengthening of the gamma response (GR). However, increasing the velocity beyond some  transition point leads to the suppression of the GR. There are two theoretical models that can explain such suppression. The  excitatory drive model infers that, at high drifting rates, GR suppression is caused by excessive excitation of inhibitory neurons. Since contrast and velocity have an additive effect on excitatory drive, this model predicts that the GR  transition point for low-contrast gratings would be reached at a higher velocity, as compared to high-contrast gratings. The alternative  velocity tuning model implies that the GR is maximal when the drifting rate of the grating corresponds to the preferable velocity of the motion-sensitive V1 neurons. This model predicts that lowering contrast either will not affect the transition point or will shift it to a lower drifting rate. We tested these models with magnetoencephalography-based recordings of the GR during presentation of low (50%) and high (100%) contrast gratings drifting at four velocities. We found that lowering contrast led to a highly reliable shift of the GR suppression transition point to higher velocities, thus supporting the excitatory drive model. No effects of contrast or velocity were found for the alpha-beta response power. The results have important implications for the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and the development of gamma-based biomarkers of brain disorders.",

In Sudan, MDR-TB represents a growing threat and one of the most important challenges that faced national tuberculosis program to establish a comprehensive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis management system.\\n\\nObjectiveTo characterize the diversity and frequency of mutations in Sudanese MDR-TB strains isolated from Wad Madani, Al-Gadarif and Khartoum using 16S rRNA and phylogeny approach.\\n\\nMaterial and MethodsA total of 60 MDR-TB isolates from Wad-Madani, Al-Gadarif and Khartoum were tested with molecular LPA (Genotype MTBDR plus) and GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and Spoligotyping to confirm their resistance to RIF and INH. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using in silico tools.\\n\\nResultThis study revealed the circulation of different Sudanese MDR-TB strains isolated from Wad Madani and Al-Gadarif belonging to two distinct common ancestors. Two isolates from Wad Madani (isolate3 and isolate11) found in one main group which characterized by a novel mutation G511T in the 530 loop.\\n\\nConclusionThe recurrence of C217A mutation in Wad Madani (isolate11) indicates the spread of this mutation in Sudanese MDR-TB strains and the diversity of this inheritance leading to generate new G511T novel mutation. So, understanding the molecular characterization of resistance mechanisms in MD-TB can facilitate the early detection of resistance, the choice of appropriate treatment and ultimately the management of MD-TB transmission.

    "abstract": "AbstractSuper-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) offers a simple and affordable alternative to other super-resolution (SR) imaging techniques. The theoretical resolution enhancement of SOFI scales linearly with the cumulants order, while imaging conditions are less phototoxic to living samples as compared to other SR methods. High order SOFI could, therefore, be a method of choice for dynamic live cell imaging. However, due to cusp-artifacts and to dynamic range expansion of pixel intensities, this promise has not been materialized as of yet. Here we investigated and compared high order moments vs. high order cumulants SOFI reconstructions. We demonstrate that even-order moments reconstructions are intrinsically free of cusp artifacts, allowing for a subsequent deconvolution operation to be performed, hence enhancing the resolution even further. High order moments reconstructions performance was examined for various (simulated) conditions and applied to (experimental) imaging of QD labeled microtubules in fixed cells, and actin stress fiber dynamics in live cells.",

    "abstract": "Colour morphs associated with different physiological adaptations offer unique opportunities to study the genomic basis of otherwise elusive adaptive traits. These complex balanced polymorphisms are often controlled by groups of tightly linked genes, and understanding how these  supergenes evolve and are maintained is an active area of research in evolutionary biology (Schwander et al. 2014, Thompson and Jiggins 2014). Within the Atlantic, the common murre (Uria aalge, a colonial seabird) displays a plumage colour dimorphism ( bridled and  unbridled) that seems to be associated with differences in thermal adaptation (Birkhead 1984; Reiertsen et al. 2012). The genes associated with bridling and how these genes affect thermal adaptation are unknown. Using whole genome resequencing, we investigate the genomic basis of differences in colouration and thermal adaptation between the two morphs, and how the association between the two traits is maintained despite random mating. We identify a 60 kb genomic region of high differentiation laying in the intergenic area amongst three candidate genes for colouration and thermal adaptation: retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB), thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 2 (NR1D2 or Rev-erb{beta}). Differentiation is due to a complex copy number variant (CNV) that suppresses recombination locally. We show that this CNV acts as a  supergene and maintain association between regulatory elements likely affecting gene expression of one or more of the identified candidate genes. Our analyses also provide insights into the origin of the dimorphism: while copy number proliferation in the unbridled haplotype was potentially mediated by transposable elements (TEs), the bridled haplotype seems to have introgressed from the more cold-adapted sister species, the thick-billed murre (U. lomvia). Our results highlight the role of copy number variants in adaptation, especially when association among traits is maintained in the face of gene flow. They also shed light into the molecular mechanisms of adaptive thermogenesis in birds, which is poorly understood.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDifferences in plumage colour in Atlantic common murres are associated with different thermal adaptations\\nC_LIO_LIA single region is highly differentiated between bridled and unbridled morphs\\nC_LIO_LIA complex copy number variant in a non-coding region underlies the dimorphism\\nC_LIO_LITransposable elements and adaptive introgression from the thick-billed murre seem to explain the origin of the dimorphism\\nC_LI",

To assess whether wheat may have undiscovered associations of these types, we tested if N/P-starved Triticum aestivum show microbiome profiles that are simultaneously different from those of N/P-amended plants and those of their own bulk soils. The bacterial and fungal communities of root, rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples from the Historical Dryland Plots (Lethbridge, Canada), which hold T. aestivum that is grown both under N/P fertilization and in conditions of extreme N/P-starvation, were taxonomically described and compared (bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal Internal Transcribed Spacers - ITS). As the list may include novel N- and/or P-providing wheat partners, we then identified all the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were proportionally enriched in one or more of the nutrient starvation- and plant-specific communities.

By studying salivary and fecal microbial strain populations of 310 species in 470 individuals from five countries, we found that transmission to, and subsequent colonization of, the large intestine by oral microbes is common and extensive among healthy individuals. We found evidence for a vast majority of oral species to be transferable, with increased levels of transmission in colorectal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis patients and, more generally, for species described as opportunistic pathogens.

    "abstract": "Hybrid male sterility contributes to speciation by restricting gene flow between related taxa. Detailed cytological characterizations of reproductive organs in hybrid males is important for identifying phenotypes that can help guide searches of speciation genes. To investigate possible cellular causes of hybrid male sterility, we performed crosses between closely related species of the Anopheles gambiae complex: An. merus with An. gambiae or An. coluzzii. We demonstrate that hybrid male sterility in African malaria mosquitoes involves two defects in the reciprocal crosses: a premeiotic arrest of germline stem cells in degenerate testes and a failure of the reductional meiotic division of primary spermatocytes in normal-like testes. The premeiotic arrest in degenerate testes of hybrids is accompanied by a strong suppression of meiotic and postmeiotic genes. Unlike pure species, sex chromosomes in normal-like testes of F1 hybrids are largely unpaired during meiotic prophase I and all chromosomes show various degrees of insufficient condensation. Instead of entering reductional division in meiosis I, primary spermatocytes prematurely undergo an equational mitotic division producing nonmotile diploid sperm. Thus, our study identified cytogenetic errors in interspecies hybrids that arise during the early stages of postzygotic isolation.",

    "abstract": "We previously found relationships between body condition and physiological function affecting health and welfare of female tourist camp elephants in Thailand, and used that approach to conduct a similar study of bulls elephants in the same camps (n = 13). Elephants received a body condition score (BCS) every other month, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations were measured in twice monthly samples for 1 year. Effects of season, camp management and tourist activity on lipid profiles [total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides (TG)] and metabolic factors [insulin, glucose, fructosamine, glucose to insulin ratio (G:I)] were determined and correlated to measures of body condition, testosterone and adrenal function. Positive correlations were found between BCS and TG, between FGM and TG, HDL and glucose, and between testosterone and HDL (p<0.05), whereas BCS and testosterone were both negatively associated with the G:I (p<0.05). Elevated FGM concentrations were associated with altered lipid profiles and metabolic status and were higher in winter compared to summer and rainy seasons. Insulin and glucose levels were higher, while the G:I was lowest, in the winter season. Strong positive associations (p<0.001) were found between TC and HDL, LDL and HDL and glucose, and glucose and insulin. By contrast, negative relationships (p<0.001) were found between the G:I and HDL and glucose, and between insulin and G:I. Differences also were found between High and Low tourist season months for FGM, insulin, and G:I, which may be related to tourist activities. Last, there was notable variation among the camps in measured parameters, which together with the tourist season effect suggests camp management related to tourism may affect physiological function and welfare; some negatively like feeding high calorie treats, but others are positively, like exercise. Last, compared to females, bulls elephants appear to be in better physical health.",

    "abstract": "Inferring past demographic histories is crucial in population genetics, and the amount of complete genomes now available should in principle facilitate this inference. In practice, however, the available inferential methods suffer from severe limitations. Although hundreds complete genomes can be simultaneously analyzed, complex demographic processes can easily exceed computational constraints, and the procedures to evaluate the reliability of the estimates contribute to increase the computational effort. Here we present an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework, based on the Random Forest algorithm, to infer complex past population processes using complete genomes. To do this, we propose to summarize the data by the full genomic distribution of the four mutually exclusive categories of segregating sites (FDSS), a statistic fast to compute from unphased genome data. We constructed an efficient ABC pipeline and tested how accurately it allows one to recognize the true model among models of increasing complexity, using simulated data and taking into account different sampling strategies in terms of number of individuals analyzed, number and size of the genetic loci considered. We tested the power of the FDSS to be informative about even complex evolutionary histories and compared the results with those obtained summarizing the data through the unfolded Site Frequency Spectrum, thus highlighting for both statistics the experimental conditions maximizing the inferential power. Finally, we analyzed two datasets, testing models (a) on the dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of Africa and (b) the evolutionary relationships of the three species of Orangutan inhabiting Borneo and Sumatra.",

While many studies have been conducted in genetic variation underlying lipid levels, they mainly comprise individuals of European ancestry and thus their transferability to non-European populations is unclear. We performed genome-wide (GWAS) and imputed transcriptome-wide association studies of four lipid traits in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos cohort (HCHS/SoL, n = 11,103), replicated top hits in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, n = 3,855), and compared the results to the larger, predominantly European ancestry meta-analysis by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC, n = 196,475). In our GWAS, we found significant SNP associations in regions within or near known lipid genes, but in our admixture mapping analysis, we did not find significant associations between local ancestry and lipid phenotypes. In the imputed transcriptome-wide association study in multiple tissues and in different ethnicities, we found 59 significant gene-tissue-phenotype associations (P < 3.61x10-8) with 14 unique significant genes, many of which occurred across multiple phenotypes, tissues, and ethnicities and replicated in MESA (45/59) and in GLGC (44/59). These include well-studied lipid genes such as SORT1, CETP, and PSRC1, as well as genes that have been implicated in cardiovascular phenotypes, such as CCL22 and ICAM1. The majority (40/59) of significant associations colocalized with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), indicating a possible mechanism of gene regulation in lipid level variation.

    "abstract": "Sex-differences in cancer occurrence and mortality are evident across tumor types; men exhibit higher rates of incidence and often poorer responses to treatment. Targeted approaches to the treatment of tumors that account for these sex-differences require the characterization and understanding of the fundamental biological mechanisms that differentiate them. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with the incidence rapidly rising. HCC exhibits a male-bias in occurrence and mortality, but previous studies have failed to explore the sex-specific dysregulation of gene expression in HCC. Here, we characterize the sex-shared and sex-specific regulatory changes in HCC tumors in the TCGA LIHC cohort. By using a sex-specific differential expression analysis of tumor and tumor-adjacent samples, we uncovered etiologically relevant genes and pathways differentiating male and female HCC. While both sexes exhibited activation of pathways related to apoptosis and cell cycle, males and females differed in the activation of several signaling pathways, with females showing PPAR pathway enrichment while males showed PI3K, 305 PI3K/AKT, FGFR, EGFR, NGF, GF1R, Rap1, DAP12, and IL-2 signaling pathway enrichment. Using eQTL analyses, we discovered germline variants with differential effects on tumor gene expression between the sexes. 24.3% of the discovered eQTLs exhibit differential effects between the sexes, illustrating the substantial role of sex in modifying the effects of eQTLs in HCC. The genes that showed sex-specific dysregulation in tumors and those that harbored a sex-specific eQTL converge in clinically relevant pathways, suggesting that the molecular etiologies of male and female HCC are partially driven by differential genetic effects on gene expression. Overall, our results provide new insight into the role of inherited genetic regulation of transcription in modulating sex-differences in HCC etiology and provide a framework for future studies on sex-biased cancers.",

    "abstract": "RLIM, also called RNF12, is an X-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is a pleotropic protein acting as a negative regulator of LIM-homeodomain transcription factors and of SMAD7, an antagonist of the BMP and TGF{beta} pathways. Mutations in RLIM are associated with variable congenital malformations in human. The molecular mechanism causing these malformations is still poorly understood.\\n\\nIn this study, we used a conventional knockout (KO) mouse model to phenotypically characterize male mutants and to investigate the effect of Rlim mutation on BMP pathway signalling. Only 50% of KO male neonates survive and are significantly smaller. We show that Rlim deletion alters lung branching and maturation resulting in severe respiratory distress and neonatal death. Except for a single case of cardiac interventricular septal defect, no other malformations that mimic the human condition were observed. Western blot analysis shows that RLIM deficiency is associated with an increase of its target SMAD7 levels and a loss of SMAD1/5/9 activation. Interestingly, SMAD5 levels were diminished, suggesting another regulatory loop between RLIM and the BMP pathway.\\n\\nIn conclusion, RLIM is important for lung development in mice and exerts this function in part through intracellular propagation of BMP signalling.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRLIM is an X-linked gene encoding an enzyme that regulates a number of proteins including SMAD7, an antagonist of BMP pathway. RLIM mutations are associated with intellectual disability and several congenital malformations in boys. In mice, RLIM is thought to be nonessential for embryos development. Using a mouse model in which Rlim is deleted, we show that 50% of males carrying the deletion display respiratory distress and die short after birth. No congenital malformations mimicking the human phenotype have been observed. Histological analysis of lung samples show that Rlim is critical for late lung development and maturation. The analysis of lung samples by western blot, a technique that quantifies proteins, is consistent with a dysregulation of BMP pathway. These finding confirm the importance of RLIM for murine embryos development and provide a link between human RLIM pathology and BMP pathway.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial pathogens affix wall teichoic acids (WTAs) to their surface. These highly abundant anionic glycopolymers have critical functions in bacterial physiology and their susceptibility to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. The membrane-associated TagA glycosyltranserase (GT) catalyzes the first-committed step in WTA biosynthesis and is a founding member of the WecB/TagA/CpsF GT family, more than 6,000 enzymes that synthesize a range of extracellular polysaccharides through a poorly understood mechanism. Crystal structures of TagA from T. italicus in its apo- and UDP-bound states reveal a novel GT fold, and coupled with biochemical and cellular data define the mechanism of catalysis. We propose that enzyme activity is regulated by interactions with the bilayer, which trigger a structural change that facilitates proper active site formation and recognition of the enzymes lipid-linked substrate. These findings inform upon the molecular basis of WecB/TagA/CpsF activity and could guide the development of new anti-microbial drugs.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGram-positive bacteria cause thousands of deaths in the United States each year and are a growing health concern because many bacterial strains have become resistant to commonly used antibiotics. One of the most abundant polymers displayed on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria is wall teichoic acid (WTA), a negatively charged carbohydrate polymer that has critical functions in cell division, morphology, adhesion and pathogenesis. The WTA biosynthetic pathway has drawn significant interest as a drug target because clinically important methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains that lack WTA are defective in host colonization and re-sensitized to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. To understand how bacteria produce WTA, we determined the structure and deduced the enzymatic mechanism of TagA, an important enzyme that is required for WTA synthesis. This research reveals a new method for enzyme regulation, whereby peripheral membrane association enables TagA to adopt its active form as a monomer. As TagA enzymes are highly conserved in bacteria, they can be expected to operate through a similar mechanism. The results of this work provide insight into WTA biosynthesis and could lead to innovative approaches to treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that are structural mimetics of peptides (e.g. small molecules) have been plagued by problems associated with oral availability and transcellular movement. Vector-mediated transport, where a potentially therapeutic drug is covalently linked to another molecule that is a ligand for an active transport or transcytosis system, was developed as an approach for moving a drug across the blood-brain-barrier. We now report a vector approach that produced peptides with oral activity, blood-brain-barrier transport, and extended in vivo half-life. Generating these properties requires secondary structure stabilization into a {beta} hairpin, and the addition of a C-terminal dipeptide sequence composed of non-polar residues. Peptides with biological activity incompatible with these derivatizations were covalently linked to a model transport vector, producing a chimera with the therapeutic activity of the peptide and the transport properties of the vector. Our platform technology may be a general approach for the design of drug-like peptides.",

    "abstract": "Prions are pathological isoforms of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). PrPC interacts with copper through unique octarepeat and non-octarepeat (non-OR) binding sites. Previous works on human PrPC suggest that copper binding to the non-OR region may have a role during prion conversion. The molecular details of copper coordination within the non-OR region are not well characterized. By means of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, we have investigated the Cu(II) structural effects on the protein folding and its coordination geometries when bound to the non-OR region of recombinant PrPC (recPrP) from animal species considered high or less resistant to TSE. As TSE-resistant model, we used ovine PrPC carrying the protective polymorphism at residues A136, R154 and R171 (OvPrP ARR); while as highly TSE-susceptible PrPC models we employed OvPrP with polymorphism V136, R154 and Q171 (OvPrP VRQ) and Bank vole recPrP (BvPrP). Our results reveal that Cu(II) affects the structural plasticity of the non-OR region leading to a more compacted conformation of recPrP. We also identified two Cu(II) coordinations in the non-OR region of these animal species. In type-1 coordination present in OvPrP ARR, Cu(II) is coordinated by four residues (S95, Q98, M109 and H111). Conversely, the type-2 coordination is present in OvPrP VRQ and BvPrP, where Cu(II) is coordinated by three residues (Q98, M109 and H111) and by one water molecule, making the non-OR region more flexible and open to the solvent. These changes in copper coordination in prion resistant and susceptible species provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the resistance or susceptibility of certain species to TSE.",

    "abstract": "Cells must appropriately sense and integrate multiple metabolic resources to commit to proliferation. Here, we report that cells regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolic homeostasis through tRNA U34-thiolation. Despite amino acid sufficiency, tRNA-thiolation deficient cells appear amino acid starved. In these cells, carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis decreases, and trehalose synthesis increases, resulting in a starvation-like metabolic signature. Thiolation mutants have only minor translation defects. However, these cells exhibit strongly decreased expression of phosphate homeostasis genes, resulting in an effectively phosphate-limited state. Reduced phosphate enforces a metabolic switch, where glucose-6-phosphate is routed towards storage carbohydrates. Notably, trehalose synthesis, which releases phosphate and thereby restores phosphate availability, is central to this metabolic rewiring. Thus, cells use thiolated tRNAs to perceive amino acid sufficiency, and balance carbon and amino acid metabolic flux to maintain metabolic homeostasis, by controlling phosphate availability. These results further biochemically explain how phosphate availability determines a switch to a  starvation-state.",

In against other cases of the conglomerates formation, the TFAAA-6 forms highly anisometric crystalline structures (strings). Herewith, the spontaneous resolution was not observed in the racemic solution of TFAAA-5 in heptane, where the isometric precipitate was formed. The latter was also observed in the TFAAA-5 solutions in heptane with small enantiomeric excess (EE), down to 2%. With that, the homochiral strings formed in the TFAAA-5 solutions in heptane with larger EEs. In this case, the strings formed from the excess of one of the enantiomers remained in solution after precipitation of the racemic residual. This process leads to the enhancement of chiral polarization in systems close to racemic and can explain the chiral purity of the living cell.",

We first systematically identified novel instances of degrons across the human proteome using a random forest classifier, and validated them exploiting somatic mutations across more than 7,000 tumors. We detected signals of positive selection across these novel degrons and revealed new instances involved in cancer development.

Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 [A] resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.",

However current limitations in multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput collectively constitute a major barrier for comprehensive single-cell profiling of proteins. Here, we report Immunostaining with Signal Amplification By Exchange Reaction (Immuno-SABER), a rapid, highly multiplexed signal amplification method that simultaneously tackles these key challenges. Immuno-SABER utilizes DNA-barcoded antibodies and provides a method for highly multiplexed signal amplification via modular orthogonal DNA concatemers generated by Primer Exchange Reaction. This approach offers the capability to preprogram and control the amplification level independently for multiple targets without in situ enzymatic reactions, and the intrinsic scalability to rapidly amplify and image a large number of protein targets. We validated our approach in diverse sample types including cultured cells, cryosections, FFPE sections, and whole mount tissues. We demonstrated independently tunable 5-180-fold amplification for multiple targets, covering the full signal range conventionally achieved by secondary antibodies to tyramide signal amplification, as well as simultaneous signal amplification for 10 different proteins using standard equipment and workflow. We further combined Immuno-SABER with Expansion Microscopy to enable rapid and highly multiplexed super-resolution tissue imaging. Overall, Immuno-SABER presents an effective and accessible platform for rapid, multiplexed imaging of proteins across scales with high sensitivity.",

Here we show that lung-specific loss of the gene encoding the histone methyltransferase MLL4 (alias KMT2D; a COMPASS-like enzyme), which is ranked the most highly inactivated epigenetic modifier in lung cancer, strongly promotes lung adenocarcinoma in mice. Mll4 loss upregulated tumor-promoting programs, including glycolysis. The pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis preferentially impeded tumorigenic growth of human lung cancer cells bearing MLL4-inactivating mutations. Mll4 loss widely impaired epigenomic signals for super-enhancers and enhancers, including the super-enhancer for the circadian rhythm repressor gene Per2, and decreased Per2 expression. Per2 downregulated several glycolytic pathway genes. These findings uncover a distinct tumor-suppressive epigenetic mechanism in which MLL4 enhances Per2-mediated repression of pro-tumorigenic glycolytic genes via super-enhancer activation to suppress lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis and also implicate a glycolysis-targeting strategy as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of MLL4- mutant lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The ability to rapidly learn from high-dimensional data to make reliable bets about the future outcomes is crucial in many contexts. This could be a fly avoiding predators, or the retina processing gigabytes of data almost instantaneously to guide complex human actions. In this work we draw parallels between such tasks, and the efficient sampling of complex biomolecules with hundreds of thousands of atoms. For this we use the Predictive Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework developed and used for the first two classes of problems, and re-formulate it for the sampling of biomolecular structure and dynamics, especially when plagued with rare events. Our method considers a given biomolecular trajectory expressed in terms of order parameters or basis functions, and uses a deep neural network to learn the minimally complex yet most predictive aspects of this trajectory, viz the PIB. This information is used to perform iterative rounds of biased simulations that enhance the sampling along the PIB to gradually improve its accuracy, directly obtaining associated thermodynamic and kinetic information. We demonstrate the method on two test-pieces, including benzene dissociation from the protein lysozyme, where we calculate the dissociation pathway and timescales slower than milliseconds. Finally, by performing an analysis of residues contributing to the PIB, we predict the critical mutations in the system which would be most impactful on the stability of the crucial but ephemeral transition state. We believe this work marks a big step forward in the use of predictive artificial intelligence ideas for the sampling of biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Aristolochic acid (AA) derived from traditional Chinese herbal remedies has recently been statistically associated with human liver cancer; however, the causal relationships between AA and liver cancer and the underlying evolutionary process of AA-mediated mutagenesis during tumorigenesis are obscure. Here, we subjected mice, including Pten-deficient ones, to aristolochic acid I (AAI) alone or a combination of AAI and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), which may induce liver injury. Significantly, AAI promoted the development of liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, in a dose-dependent manner, and it increased the incidence of liver cancer, together with CCl4 or Pten deficiency. AAI could lead to DNA damage and AAI-DNA adducts that initiate liver cancer via characteristic A>T transversions, as indicated by the comprehensive genomic analysis, which revealed recurrent mutations in Hras and some genes encoding components of the Ras/Raf, PI3K, Notch, Hippo, Wnt, DNA polymerase family and the SWI/SNF complex, some of which are also often found in human liver cancer. Mutational signature analysis across human cancer types revealed that the AA-related dominant signature was especially implicated in liver cancer in China, based on very stringent criteria derived from the animal cancer form, in which mutations of TP53 and JAK1 are prone to be significantly enriched. Interestingly, AAI-mediated characteristic A>T mutations were the earliest genetic event driving malignant subclonal evolution in mouse and human liver cancer. In general, this study provides documented evidence for AA-induced liver cancer with featured mutational processes during malignant clonal evolution, laying a solid foundation for the prevention and diagnosis of AA-associated human cancers, especially liver cancer.",

Using CyTOF, we demonstrate a systemic reduction in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated surveillance in SR-tTA/Tet-O-MYCON mice bearing MYC-driven T-lymphomas, due to an arrest in NK cell maturation. Inactivation of lymphoma-intrinsic MYC releases the brakes on NK maturation restoring NK homeostasis. Lymphoma-intrinsic MYC arrests NK maturation by transcriptionally repressing STAT1/2 and secretion of Type I Interferons (IFNs). Treating T-lymphoma-bearing mice with Type I IFN improves survival by rescuing NK cell maturation. In MYC-driven BL patients, low expression of both STAT1 and STAT2 correlates significantly with the absence of activated NK cells and predicts unfavorable clinical outcomes. Adoptive transfer of mature NK cells is sufficient to delay both T-lymphoma growth and recurrence post MYC inactivation. Our studies thus provide a rationale for developing NK cell-based therapies to effectively treat MYC-driven lymphomas in the future.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

We have examined Wnt gene expression and signaling after injury and we show by in situ hybridization that Wnts are activated by acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity. Following injury, peri-injury hepatocytes become Wnt-responsive, expressing the Wnt target gene Axin2. Lineage tracing of peri-injury Axin2+ hepatocytes shows that during recovery, the injured parenchyma becomes repopulated and repaired by Axin2+ descendants. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we show that endothelial cells are the major source of Wnts following acute CCl4 toxicity. Induced loss of {beta}-catenin in peri-injury hepatocytes results in delayed repair and ultimately to injury-induced lethality, while loss of Wnt production from endothelial cells leads to a delay in the proliferative response after injury.\\n\\nConclusionOur Pindings highlight the importance of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in restoring tissue integrity following acute liver toxicity and establishes a role of endothelial cells as an important Wnt-producing regulator of liver tissue repair following localized liver injury.",

One possibility is that spontaneous activity provides contextual information in cortical computations, replaying previously learned patterns of activity5-8 that conditions the cortex to respond more efficiently, based on past experience. To test this, we measured the response of neuronal populations in mouse primary visual cortex with chronic two-photon calcium imaging during a visual habituation to a specific oriented stimulus. We unexpectedly found that, during habituation, spontaneous activity increased in neurons across the full range of orientation selectivity, eventually matching that of evoked levels. The increase in spontaneous activity strongly correlated with the degree of habituation. In fact, boosting spontaneous activity with two-photon optogenetic stimulation to the levels of stimulus-evoked activity induced habituation in naive animals. Our study shows that cortical spontaneous activity is causally linked to habituation, which unfolds by minimizing the difference between spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity levels, rendering the cortex less responsive. We also show how manipulating spontaneous activity can accelerate this type of learning. We hypothesize that spontaneous activity in visual cortex gates incoming sensory information.",

    "abstract": "The effect of urban noise on animal communication systems is one of the best examples of how anthropogenic change affects animal social behaviour. Urban noise often drives shifts in acoustic properties of signals but the consequences of noise for the honesty of signals - that is, how well they predict signaler behaviour, is unclear. Here we examine whether honesty of aggressive signaling changes in urban living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Aggressive signaling in song sparrows consists of close-range signals in two modalities that predict a subsequent attack: the low amplitude soft songs (an acoustic signal) and wing waves (a visual signal). Male song sparrows living in urban habitats display more territorial aggression than males living in rural habitats, but whether the honesty of close-range signals is affected by urbanization has not been examined. If soft songs are less effective in urban noise, we predict that they would be less reliably associated with attack in these habitats compared to rural habitats. We found that while acoustic noise was higher in urban habitats, the urban birds still sang more soft songs than rural birds during a simulated territorial intrusion. Furthermore, high rates of soft songs and low rates of loud songs predicted attacks in both habitats. Finally, we found evidence for a potential multimodal shift: urban birds tended to give proportionally more wing waves than soft songs than rural birds. These results indicate that urbanization might have a limited effect on the overall honesty of aggressive signals in song sparrows.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in systems neuroscience is to understand how the brains structural architecture gives rise to its complex functional dynamics. Here, we address this challenge by examining the inter-ictal activity of five patients with medically refractory epilepsy during [~] 15 hours of multi-channel intracranial recording. By constructing a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM) of the observed neural dynamics, we seek to uncover the fundamental relationship between functional activity and its underlying structural substrate. Despite only incorporating the pairwise correlations in the observed neural activity, we find that the pairwise MEM robustly fits large-scale patterns of inter-ictal power dynamics across a wide range of frequency bands, notably displaying time-invariance and cross-frequency similarity. Furthermore, across all frequency bands, we demonstrate that the pairwise MEM accurately identifies the structural white matter connections between brain regions, outperforming other common model-free measures of functional connectivity. Together, our findings show that a simple pairwise MEM, which is explicitly ignorant of higher-order correlations between three or more brain regions, not only captures complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity across the frequency spectrum, but also suggests that the network of structural connections in the human brain is a plausible scaffold capable of supporting observed wide-band neural dynamics.",

We examined intentional binding in alternated action-outcome dyads.

Participants reproduced the duration of alternated keypress-tone dyads or the temporal interval between a dyad embedded in the alternations. The reproduced duration was shorter in the active than in the passive condition, suggesting the intentional binding in action-outcome alternations. In contrast, the reproduced interval between a dyad was longer in the active condition and did not correlate with the reproduced duration. These results suggest that subjective time during actions relies not only on an internal clock but also on postdictive biases that are switched based on what we recall.",

Yet, the possibility that plants emit airborne sounds when stressed - similarly to many animals - has not been investigated. Here we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that stressed plants emit airborne sounds that can be recorded remotely, both in acoustic chambers and in greenhouses. We recorded [~]65 dBSPL ultrasonic sounds 10 cm from tomato and tobacco plants, implying that these sounds could be detected by some organisms from up to several meters away. We developed machine learning models that were capable of distinguishing between plant sounds and general noises, and identifying the condition of the plants - dry, cut, or intact - based solely on the emitted sounds. Our results suggest that animals, humans, and possibly even other plants, could use sounds emitted by a plant to gain information about the plants condition. More investigation on plant bioacoustics in general and on sound emission in plants in particular may open new avenues for understanding plants and their interactions with the environment, and it may also have a significant impact on agriculture.",

    "abstract": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been implicated in signaling information about expected outcomes to facilitate adaptive or flexible behavior. Current proposals focus on signaling of expected reward values versus the representation of a value-agnostic cognitive map of the task. While often suggested as mutually exclusive, these alternatives may represent two extreme ends of a continuum determined by the complexity of the environment and the subjects experience in it. As learning proceeds, an initial, detailed cognitive map might be acquired, based largely on external information. With more experience, this hypothesized map can then be tailored to include relevant abstract hidden cognitive constructs. This might default to expected values in situations where other attributes are minimized or largely irrelevant, whereas in richer tasks, a more detailed structure might continue to be represented, at least where relevant to behavior, and possibly alongside value. Here we sought to arbitrate between these options by recording single unit activity from the OFC in rats navigating an odor sequence task analogous to a spatial maze. The odor sequences provided a clearly mappable state space, with 24 unique \\\"positions\\\" defined by sensory information, likelihood of reward, or both. Consistent with the hypothesis that the OFC represents a cognitive map tailored to the subjects intentions or plans, we found a close correspondence between how subjects behavior suggested they were using the sequences, and the neural representations of the sequences in OFC ensembles. Multiplexed with this value-invariant representation of the task, we also found a representation of the expected value at each location. Thus value and task structure are co-existing and potentially dissociable components of the neural code in OFC.",

In rats, prelimbic cortex (PL) is positioned to influence sequence memory through extensive top down inputs to the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (RE) and perirhinal cortex (PER), regions heavily interconnected with the hippocampus. Here, we tested the hypothesis that specific PLRE and PLPER projections regulate sequence memory retrieval using an hM4Di synaptic-silencing approach. First, we show that the suppression of PL activity impairs sequence memory. Second, we show that inhibiting PLRE and PLPER pathways effectively eliminated sequence memory. Last, we performed a sequential lag analysis showing that the PLRE pathway contributes to a working memory retrieval strategy, and the PLPER pathway contributes to a temporal context memory retrieval strategy. These results demonstrate that the PLRE and PLPER pathways serve as top down mechanisms that control sequence memory retrieval strategies.",

We developed inception loops, a closed-loop experimental paradigm that combines in vivo recordings with in silico nonlinear response modeling to identify the Most Exciting Images (MEIs) for neurons in mouse V1. When presented back to the brain, MEIs indeed drove their target cells significantly better than the best stimuli identified by linear models. The MEIs exhibited complex spatial features that deviated from the textbook ideal of V1 as a bank of Gabor filters.

    "abstract": "Neuroplasticity forms the basis for neuronal circuit complexity and can determine differences between otherwise similar circuits. Although synaptic plasticity is fairly well characterized, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic plasticity, especially its transcriptional regulation. We show that the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf), best known as the master regulator of melanocytic cell fate and differentiation, plays a central role in homeostatic intrinsic plasticity of olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons. Mitral and tufted (M/T) neurons from Mitf mutant mice are hyperexcitable due to reduced Type-A potassium current (IA) and they exhibit reduced expression of Kcnd3, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel subunit (Kv4.3) important for generating the IA. Furthermore, expression of the Mitf and Kcnd3 genes is activity-dependent in OB projection neurons, The MITF protein binds to and activates expression from Kcnd3 regulatory elements. Activity can therefore affect Kcnd3 expression directly via MITF. Moreover, Mitf mutant mice have changes in olfactory habituation and have increased habitutation for an odourant following long-term exposure, indicating that regulation of Kcnd3 is pivotal for long-term olfactory adaptation. Our findings show that Mitf acts as a direct regulator of intrinsic homeostatic feedback, plays a key role in olfactory adaptation and links neuronal activity, transcriptional changes and neuronal function.\n\nSignificance statementA direct, Mitf-dependent link between neuronal activity and homeostatic changes in the expression of a key potassium channel subunit is demonstrated in projection neurons of the mouse OB. This is one of the first studies that directly link activity and genetically defined changes in intrinsic plasticity, leading to changes in neuronal response. These findings broaden the general understanding of transcriptional regulation of homeostatic intrinsic plasticity in learning and memory. The results are also important for understanding the role of Mitf in other cell types. Regulation of intrinsic plasticity has wide-ranging implications and fundamental importance for neurological diseases such as neurodegeneration, autism and epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are highly repetitive regions capping the chromosomes and composed of multiple units of hexa-nucleotides, TTAGGG, making their quantification difficult. Most of the methods developed to estimate telomeres are extensively cumbersome and expensive. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based assay is relatively easy and cheaper method that applies SyBr Green dye chemistry to measure telomere length. As SyBr Green dye fluoresces after intercalation into the dsDNA, lack of differentiation between specific PCR target products and unspecific products is a limitation and it affects accuracy in quantitation of telomeres. To overcome the limitations of SyBr Green, we developed a dual labeled fluorescence probe based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to measure the telomere length. This robust, accurate and highly reproducible (R2=0.96) proprietary method (patent pending), yet cost effective and easy, utilizes a probe that targets specifically the telomeric DNA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsertions/deletions (InDels) and more specifically presence/absence variations (PAVs) are pervasive in several species and have strong functional and phenotypic effect by removing or drastically modifying genes. Genotyping of such variants on large panels remains poorly addressed, while necessary for approaches such as association mapping or genomic selection.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed, as a proof of concept, a new high-throughput and affordable approach to genotype InDels. We first identified 141,000 InDels by aligning reads from the B73 line against the genome of three temperate maize inbred lines (F2, PH207, and C103) and reciprocally. Next, we designed an Affymetrix(R) Axiom(R) array to target these InDels, with a combination of probes selected at breakpoint sites (13%) or within the InDel sequence, either at polymorphic (25%) or non-polymorphic sites (63%) sites. The final array design is composed of 662,772 probes and targets 105,927 InDels, including PAVs ranging from 35bp to 129kbp. After Affymetrix(R) quality control, we successfully genotyped 86,648 polymorphic InDels (82% of all InDels interrogated by the array) on 445 maize DNA samples with 422,369 probes. Genotyping InDels using this approach produced a highly reliable dataset, with low genotyping error (~3%), high call rate (~98%), and high reproducibility (>95%). This reliability can be further increased by combining genotyping of several probes calling the same InDels (<0.1% error rate and >99.9% of call rate for 5 probes). This \\\"proof of concept\\\" tool was used to estimate the kinship matrix between 362 maize lines with 57,824 polymorphic InDels. This InDels kinship matrix was highly correlated with kinship estimated using SNPs from Illumina 50K SNP arrays.\\n\\nConclusionsWe efficiently genotyped thousands of small to large InDels on a sizeable number of individuals using a new Affymetrix(R) Axiom(R) array. This powerful approach opens the way to studying the contribution of InDels to trait variation and heterosis in maize. The approach is easily extendable to other species and should contribute to decipher the biological impact of InDels at a larger scale.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome evolution promotes diversity within a population via mutations, recombination, and whole-genome duplication. However, quantifying precisely these factors in diploid hybrid genomes is challenging. Here we present an integrated experimental and computational workflow to accurately track the mutational landscape of yeast diploid hybrids (MuLoYDH) in terms of single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, copy-number variants and loss-of-heterozygosity.\n\nResultsHaploid Saccharomyces parents were combined into diploid hybrids with fully phased genome and controlled levels of heterozygosity. The resulting hybrids represented the ancestral state and were evolved under different laboratory protocols. Variant simulations enabled to efficiently integrate competitive and standard mapping, depending on local levels of heterozygosity and read length. Experimental validations proved high accuracy and resolution of our computational approach. Finally, applying MuLoYDH to four different diploids revealed striking genetic background effects. Homozygous S. cerevisiae showed ~4-fold higher mutation rate compared to S. paradoxus. In contrast, interspecies hybrids exhibited mutation rates similar to intraspecies hybrids despite 10-fold higher heterozygosity. MuLoYDH unveiled that a substantial fraction of the genome (~200 bp per generation) was shaped by loss-of-heterozygosity and this process was strongly inhibited by high levels of heterozygosity.\n\nConclusionsWe report a comprehensive framework for characterizing the mutational spectrum of yeast diploid hybrids with unprecedented resolution, which can be generalised to other genetic systems. Applying MuLoYDH to laboratory-evolved hybrids provided novel quantitative insights into the evolutionary processes that mould yeast genomes.",

Here we show that only human memory CD8 T cells have remarkably high synapse propensity compared to naive counterparts. Such a dichotomy between naive and memory cells is not observed within the human CD4 or murine CD8 T cell population. Increased surface expression of LFA1 contributes to the higher synapse propensity in human memory CD8 T cells.

    "abstract": "A widely accepted rodent model to study cocaine addiction involves allowing animals continuous access to drug during long self-administration sessions ( Long-access or LgA). This produces continuously high brain concentrations of drug during each session. This might not model the pharmacokinetics of cocaine use in experienced human users, which are thought to involve intermittently spiking brain cocaine concentrations within and between bouts of use. Intermittent-access (IntA) cocaine self-administration models this spiking pattern in rats. IntA is also particularly effective in increasing incentive motivation for drug. Most IntA studies have been conducted in male rats. Both humans and non-human animals can show sex differences in all phases of the addiction process. We compared cocaine use in female and male rats that self-administered the drug (0.25 mg/kg/injection, i.v.) during 10 daily, 6-h LgA or IntA sessions. Cocaine intake was greatest under LgA, and female LgA rats escalated their intake. However, only IntA rats (both sexes) developed locomotor sensitization to self-administered cocaine and sensitization was greatest in the females. Five and 25 days after the last self-administration session, we quantified incentive motivation for cocaine by measuring breakpoints for the drug (0.083-0.75 mg/kg/injection) under progressive ratio. Breakpoints were similar in IntA and LgA rats. There were no sex differences in breakpoints under LgA. However, under IntA, females reached higher breakpoints for cocaine than males. Thus, LgA might be best suited to study sex differences in cocaine intake, while IntA might be best suited to study sex differences in incentive motivational processes in cocaine addiction.",

While it is known that quantitative resistance in the host and quantitative virulence in the pathogen largely mediate this pathosystem, how this pathogen interacts with the extensive host diversity is unknown. Does this pathogen have quantitative virulence efficiency on all hosts or individual solutions for each host? To address this question, we generated an infectivity matrix of 98 strains of Botrytis cinerea on 90 genotypes representing eight host plants. This experimental infectivity matrix showed that the predominant sources of quantitative variation are between host species and among pathogen strains. Furthermore, the eight eudicot hosts interacted individually with Botrytis cinerea strains independently of the evolutionary relatedness between hosts. An additive quantitative model can explain the complexity of these interactions in which Botrytis host specificity and general virulence have distinct polygenic architectures.",

    "abstract": "In creating vaccines against infectious agents, there is often a desire to direct an immune response toward a particular conformational epitope on an antigen. We present a method, called Protect, Modify, Deprotect (PMD), to generate immunogenic proteins aimed to direct a vaccine-induced antibody response toward an epitope defined by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). The mAb is used to protect the target epitope on the protein. Then, the remaining exposed surfaces of the protein are modified to render them non-immunogenic. Finally, the epitope is deprotected by removal of the mAb. The resultant protein is modified at surfaces other than the target epitope. We validate PMD using the well-characterized antigen, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). Then, we demonstrate the utility of PMD using influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Specifically, we use a mAb to protect a highly conserved epitope on the stem domain of HA. Exposed surface amines are then modified by introducing short polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. The resultant antigen shows markedly reduced binding to mAbs that target the variable head region of HA, while maintaining binding to mAbs at the epitope of interest in the stem region. This antigenic preference is also observed with yeast cells displaying antibody fragments. Antisera from guinea pigs immunized with the PMD-modified HA show increased cross-reactivity with HAs from other influenza strains, as compared to antisera obtained with unmodified HA trimers. PMD has the potential to direct an antibody response at high-resolution and could be used in combination with other such strategies. There are many attractive targets for the application of PMD.",

    "abstract": "An ideal model of perceptual processing would be congruent with experimentally-observed perceptual performance and be theoretically generalizable. In the extant models with experimental predictive power, the most-invoked signal processing paradigms are rate-distortion theory, efficient coding, and Bayesian inference. A theoretical reconciliation of these alternatives has yet to emerge. Here I endeavor to constrain the model space by clarifying which processing paradigms align with natural selection objectives. I find that signal processing and fitness objectives often deviate; for example, in a finite game where risk-avoidant bet-hedging beats maximization of average performance. When these objectives do align, the specific signal processing performance metric that aligns with fitness over the most general set of circumstances is the minimization of utility-weighted signal distortion. Together, these results reveal that selection favors perceptual system adaptations to (at least) three types of noise; environmental, encoding, and decoding; and establish utility-weighted distortion minimization as the optimal adaptation to the second.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) activity is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation. Studies aiming to understand the impact of ER on cancer-associated phenotypes have largely been limited to its transcriptional activity. Herein, we demonstrate that ER coordinates its transcriptional output with selective modulation of mRNA translation. Importantly, translational perturbations caused by depletion of ER largely manifest as \\\"translational offsetting\\\" of the transcriptome, whereby amounts of translated mRNA and protein levels are maintained constant despite changes in mRNA abundance. Transcripts whose levels, but not polysome-association, are reduced following ER depletion lack features which limit translational efficiency including structured 5UTRs and miRNA target sites. In contrast, mRNAs induced upon ER depletion whose polysome-association remains unaltered are enriched in codons requiring U34-modified tRNAs for efficient decoding. Consistently, ER regulates levels of U34-modification enzymes, whereas altered expression of U34-modification enzymes disrupts ER dependent translational offsetting. Altogether, we unravel a hitherto unprecedented mechanism of ER-dependent orchestration of transcriptional and translational programs, and highlight that translational offsetting may be a pervasive mechanism of proteome maintenance in hormone-dependent cancers.",

Previous analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host health and disease status, genotype and diet. Here, we developed a method of predicting biological age of the host based on the microbiological profiles of gut microbiota using a curated dataset of 1,165 healthy individuals (3,663 microbiome samples). Our predictive model, a human microbiome clock, has an architecture of a deep neural network and achieves the accuracy of 3.94 years mean absolute error in cross-validation. The performance of the deep microbiome clock was also evaluated on several additional populations. We further introduce a platform for biological interpretation of individual microbial features used in age models, which relies on permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects. This approach has allowed us to define two lists of 95 intestinal biomarkers of human aging. We further show that this list can be reduced to 39 taxa that convey the most information on their hosts aging. Overall, we show that (a) microbiological profiles can be used to predict human age; and (b) microbial features selected by models are age-related.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity can be represented by a variety of different dimensions (e.g. functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, genetic diversity and taxonomic diversity). While the many different representations of biodiversity can lead to a more complete description of communities, they also lead to a degree of  fragmentation of the biodiversity concept. Developing a unified measure that integrates all the dimensions of biodiversity is a theoretical solution for this problem, however, it remains an operationally utopian task. Alternatively, quantifying the dimensionality of biodiversity is a way to integrate the different dimensions of biological diversity. This concept is explored in the present study. We define the dimensionality of diversity as the number of different diversity metrics needed to effectively describe biodiversity. We provide a solution that joins the two components of dimensionality (correlation and the variation of each diversity metric) in the same framework, allowing us to quantify dimensionality. We show, through a simulation study, that considering the correlation among dimensions with the variation of each dimension offers important information that is neglected when only correlation information (the component used in the current methodology to measure dimensionality) is considered. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed framework by investigating the dimensionality of South American small mammal communities (cricetids and marsupials). Our example demonstrates that the taxonomic dimension of diversity captures most of the spatial variation among these communities. We conclude by highlighting the greater understanding of dimensionality that is obtained through this method, as well as the insights it provides into the importance of each diversity metric to the whole biodiversity space, insights which can not be obtained through the current common method.",

Here we show that Oenothera drummondii flowers, exposed to the playback sound of a flying bee or to synthetic sound-signals at similar frequencies, produced sweeter nectar within 3 minutes, potentially increasing the chances of cross pollination. We found that the flowers vibrated mechanically in response to these sounds, suggesting a plausible mechanism where the flower serves as the plants auditory sensory organ. Both the vibration and the nectar response were frequency-specific: the flowers responded to pollinator sounds, but not to higher frequency sound. Our results document for the first time that plants can rapidly respond to pollinator sounds in an ecologically relevant way. Sensitivity of plants to pollinator sound can affect plant-pollinator interactions in a wide range of ways: Plants could allocate their resources more adequately, focusing on the time of pollinator activity; pollinators would then be better rewarded per time unit; flower shape may be selected for its effect on hearing ability, and not only on signaling; and pollinators may evolve to make sounds that the flowers can hear. Finally, our results suggest that plants may be affected by other sounds as well, including antropogenic ones.",

By using the gene expression imputation models fitted from reference datasets that have both genetic and transcriptomic data, TWAS facilitates gene-based tests with GWAS data while accounting for the reference transcriptomic data. The existing TWAS tools like PrediXcan and FUSION use parametric imputation models that have limitations for modeling the complex genetic architecture of transcriptomic data. Therefore, we propose an improved Bayesian method that assumes a data-driven nonparametric prior to impute gene expression. Our method is general and flexible and includes both the parametric imputation models used by PrediXcan and FUSION as special cases. Our simulation studies showed that the nonparametric Bayesian model improved both imputation R2 for transcriptomic data and the TWAS power over PrediXcan. In real applications, our nonparametric Bayesian method fitted transcriptomic imputation models for 2X number of genes with 1.7X average regression R2 over PrediXcan, thus improving the power of follow-up TWAS. Hence, the nonparametric Bayesian model is preferred for modeling the complex genetic architecture of transcriptomes and is expected to enhance transcriptome-integrated genetic association studies. We implement our Bayesian approach in a convenient software tool \\\"TIGAR\\\" (Transcriptome-Integrated Genetic Association Resource), which imputes transcriptomic data and performs subsequent TWAS using individual-level or summary-level GWAS data.",
