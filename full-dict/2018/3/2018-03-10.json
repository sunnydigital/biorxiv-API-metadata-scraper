    "abstract": "Individuals with psychiatric disorders have elevated rates of autoimmune comorbidity and altered immune signaling. It is unclear whether these altered immunological states have a shared genetic basis with those psychiatric disorders. The present study sought to use existing summary-level data from previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to determine if commonly varying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are shared between psychiatric and immune-related phenotypes. We estimated heritability and examined pair-wise genetic correlations using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics (HESS) methods. Using LDSC, we observed significant genetic correlations between immune-related disorders and several psychiatric disorders, including anorexia nervosa, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, smoking behavior, and Tourette syndrome. Loci significantly mediating genetic correlations were identified for schizophrenia when analytically paired with Crohns disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. We report significantly correlated loci and highlight those containing genome-wide associations and candidate genes for respective disorders. We also used the LDSC method to characterize genetic correlations amongst the immune-related phenotypes. We discuss our findings in the context of relevant genetic and epidemiological literature, as well as the limitations and caveats of the study.",

    "abstract": "Any individuals genome contains [~]4-5 million genetic variants that differ from reference, and understanding how these variants give rise to trait diversity and disease susceptibility is a central goal of human genetics1. A vast majority (96-99%) of an individuals variants are common, though at a population level the overwhelming majority of variants are rare2-5. Because of their scarcity in an individuals genome, rare variants that play important roles in complex traits are likely to have large functional effects6,7. Mutations that cause an exon to be skipped can have severe functional consequences on gene function, and many known disease-causing mutations reduce or eliminate exon recognition8. Here we explore the extent to which rare genetic variation in humans results in near complete loss of exon recognition. We developed a Multiplexed Functional Assay of Splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS) that allows us to measure exon inclusion in thousands of human exons and surrounding intronic sequence simultaneously. We assayed 27,733 extant variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)9 within or adjacent to 2,339 human exons, and found that 3.8% (1,050) of the variants, almost all of which were extremely rare, led to large-effect defects in exon recognition. Importantly, we find that 83% of these splice-disrupting variants (SDVs) are located outside of canonical splice sites, are distributed evenly across distinct exonic and intronic regions, and are difficult to predict a priori. Our results indicate that loss of exon recognition is an important and underappreciated means by which rare variants exert large functional effects, and that MFASS enables their empirical assessment for splicing defects at scale.",

    "abstract": "Sequence clustering is a fundamental step in analyzing DNA sequences. Widely-used software tools for sequence clustering utilize greedy approaches that are not guaranteed to produce the best results. These tools are sensitive to one parameter that determines the similarity among sequences in a cluster. Often times, a biologist may not know the exact sequence similarity. Therefore, clusters produced by these tools do not likely match the real clusters comprising the data if the provided parameter is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the mean shift algorithm, an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, which has been used successfully thousands of times in fields such as image processing and computer vision. The theory behind the mean shift algorithm, unlike the greedy approaches, guarantees convergence to the modes, e.g. cluster centers. Here we describe the first application of the mean shift algorithm to clustering DNA sequences. MeShClust is one of few applications of the mean shift algorithm in bioinformatics. Further, we applied supervised machine learning to predict the identity score produced by global alignment using alignment-free methods. We demonstrate MeShClusts ability to cluster DNA sequences with high accuracy even when the sequence similarity parameter provided by the user is not very accurate.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insects live in teeming societies with thousands of their kin. In this crowded environment, workers combat disease by removing or burying their dead or diseased nestmates. For honey bees, we found that hygienic brood-removal behavior is triggered by two odorants - {beta}-ocimene and oleic acid - which are released from brood upon freeze-killing. {beta}-ocimene is a co-opted pheromone that normally signals larval food-begging, whereas oleic acid is a conserved necromone across arthropod taxa. Interestingly, the odorant blend can induce hygienic behavior more consistently than either odorant alone. We suggest that the volatile {beta}-ocimene flags hygienic workers attention, while oleic acid is the death cue, triggering removal. Bees with high hygienicity detect and remove brood with these odorants faster than bees with low hygienicity, and both molecules are strong ligands for hygienic behavior-associated odorant binding proteins (OBP16 and OBP18). Odorants that induce low levels of hygienic behavior, however, are weak ligands for these OBPs. We are therefore beginning to paint a picture of the molecular mechanism behind this complex behavior, using odorants associated with freeze-killed brood as a model.",

However, measurements of the intrinsic force, velocity and ATPase activityof myosin have not provided a consistent mechanism to link mutations to muscle pathology. An alternative modelpositsthat mutations in myosin affect the stability ofa sequestered, super-relaxed state (SRX) of the proteinwith very slow ATP hydrolysis and thereby change the number of myosin heads accessible to actin. Here, using a combination of biochemical and structural approaches, we show that purified myosin enters aSRX thatcorresponds to a folded-back conformation, which in muscle fibersresults insequestration of heads around the thick filament backbone. Mutations that cause HCM destabilize this state, while the small molecule mavacamtenpromotes it.

Among the most important factors governing the distributions and the coexistence of species are the spatiotemporal changes occurring in the microhabitat heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the heterogeneity of microhabitats and how they have an effect in the spatial segregation of two species of small mammals (i. e., Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis), which coexist in a temperate, mixed forest. We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.",

Here, we show that Acr production does not guarantee phage replication, but instead, infections fail when phage population numbers fall below a critical threshold.

The existence and importance of LD motifs beyond the paxillin family is poorly understood. To enable a proteome-wide assessment of these motifs, we developed an active-learning based framework that iteratively integrates computational predictions with experimental validation. Our analysis of the human proteome identified a dozen proteins that contain LD motifs, all being involved in cell adhesion and migration, and revealed a new type of inverse LD motif consensus. Our evolutionary analysis suggested that LD motif signalling originated in the common unicellular ancestor of opisthokonts and amoebozoa by co-opting nuclear export sequences. Inter-species comparison revealed a conserved LD signalling core, and reveals the emergence of species-specific adaptive connections, while maintaining a strong functional focus of the LD motif interactome. Collectively, our data elucidate the mechanisms underlying the origin and adaptation of an ancestral SLiM.",

    "abstract": "It is likely that there are constraints on how evolution can progress, and well-known evolutionary phenomena such as convergent evolution, rapid adaptation, and genic evolution would be difficult to explain under the absence of any such evolutionary constraint. One dimension of constraint results from a finite number of environmental conditions, and thus natural selection scenarios, leading to convergent phenotypes. This limits which genetic variants are adaptive, and consequently, constrains how variation is inherited across generations. Another, less explored dimension of evolution is functional constraint at the molecular level. Some widely accepted examples for this dimension of evolutionary constraint include genetic linkage, codon position, and architecture of developmental genetic pathways, that together constrain how evolution can shape genomes through limiting which mutations can increase fitness. Genomic architecture, which describes how all gene products interact, has been discussed to be another dimension of functional genetic constraint. This notion had been largely discredited by the modern synthesis, especially because macroevolution was not always found to be perfectly deterministic. But debates on whether evolutionary constraint stems mostly from environmental (extrinsic) or genetic (intrinsic) factors have mostly been held at the intellectual level using sporadic evidence. Quantifying the relative contributions of these different dimensions of constraint is, however, fundamentally important to understand the mechanistic basis of seemingly deterministic evolutionary outcomes. In some model organisms, genetic constraint has already been quantitatively explored. Forays into testing the relationship between genomic architecture and evolution included studies on protein evolutionary rate variation in essential versus nonessential genes, and observations that the number of protein interactions within a cell (gene pleiotropy) determines the fitness effect of mutations. In this contribution, existing evidence for functional genetic constraint as shaping evolutionary outcomes is reviewed and testable hypotheses are defined for functional genetic constraint influencing (i) convergent evolution, (ii) rapid adaptation, and genic adaptation. An analysis of the yeast interactome incorporating recently published data on its evolution, reveals new support for the existence of genomic architecture as a functional genetic dimension of evolutionary constraint. As functional genetic networks are becoming increasingly available, evolutionary biologists should strive to evaluate functional genetic network constraint, against variables describing complex phenotypes and environments, for better understanding commonly observed deterministic patterns of evolution in non-model organisms. This may help to quantify the extrinsic versus intrinsic dimensions of evolutionary constraint, and result in a better understanding of how fast, effectively, or deterministically organisms adapt.\\n\\nGlossary",

Additionally, many such disorders demonstrate polygenic overlap, in which risk alleles are shared at associated genetic loci. However, there are currently no well-developed statistical methods that can be utilized to detect specific subsets of SNPs involved in the shared polygenicity of phenotypes. In this paper, we illustrate how elastic nets, with appropriate adaptation in selecting the penalty parameter, can be utilized for narrowing the range of SNPs involved in shared polygenicity. We first develop the method when individual-level data from genomewide association studies (GWASs) are available; we also extend the approach so that it can be used when only summary level data from GWASs are available. We illustrate and assess the performance of the proposed methods using extensive simulations, and by applying the methods to summary level data from a pair of related GWASs with fasting glucose level and BMI as the phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The value of iron-based MRI changes for the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimers disease (AD) depends on an association between cortical iron accumulation and AD pathology. Therefore, this study determined the cortical distribution pattern of MRI contrast changes in cortical regions selected based on the known distribution pattern of tau pathology and investigated whether MRI contrast changes reflect the underlying AD pathology in the different lobes.[Formula]-weighted MRI was performed on post-mortem cortical tissue of controls, late-onset AD, and early-onset AD followed by histology and correlation analyses. Combining ex-vivo high-resolution MRI and histopathology revealed that: LOAD and EOAD have a different distribution pattern of AD pathological hallmarks and MRI contrast changes over the cortex, with EOAD showing more severe MRI changes; (2) per lobe, severity of AD pathological hallmarks correlates with iron accumulation, and hence with MRI. Therefore, iron-sensitive MRI sequences allow detection of the cortical distribution pattern of AD pathology ex-vivo.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

The method is so efficient that it is now used in holothuriculture to get fertilised eggs even outside the reproductive period of the aquacultured species. We here isolate and identify from echinoid spawns the molecule responsible for the induction of the oocyte maturation in the Mediterranean holothuroid Holothuria tubulosa and the Indo-Pacific Holothuria scabra. The use of proteinase K and dialysing membranes indicates that the active molecule is a protein with a molecular weight superior to 12,000 kDa. The active molecule has been isolated on G-100 Sephadex chromatography column. Active chromatographic fractions include seven proteins identified with nanoLC-MS/MS technique. One of them, identify as a thioredoxin-2 and to which the name Trx-REES has been given, leads up to levels of maturation similar to those obtained with the REES and with a commercial thioredoxin extracted from Escherichia coli. Occurrence of thioredoxin in REES was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, and the maturation-inducing properties of thioredoxin were positively checked in using anti-thioredoxin antibodies. A peptide of 6 AAs corresponding to the active site of Trx-REES, composed of WCNPCK, was synthesised and its efficiency in holothuroid oocyte maturation tested. At some concentrations, the peptide was 1.2 times more active than the REES.",

An easy and robust method to modify the surfaces of cells directly to incorporate novel functionalities is highly desirable. However, many current methods for cell-surface engineering interfere with cells endogenous properties. Here we report an enzymatic approach that enables the transfer of biomacromolecules, such as a full length IgG antibody, to the glycocalyx on the surfaces of live cells when the antibody is conjugated to the enzymes natural donor substrate GDP-fucose. This method is fast and biocompatible with little interference to cells endogenous functions. We applied this method to construct two antibody-cell conjugates (ACCs) using different immune cells, and the modified cells exhibited specific tumor targeting and resistance to inhibitory signals produced by tumor cells, respectively. Remarkably, Herceptin-NK-92MI conjugates exhibits enhanced activities to induce the lysis of HER2+ cancer cells both ex vivo and in a murine tumor model, indicating its potential for further development as a clinical candidate.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, lipid membranes have become standard models for examining the biophysics and biochemistry of cell membranes. Interrogation of lipid domains within biomembranes is generally done with fluorescence microscopy via exogenous chemical probes. However, most fluorophores have limited partitioning tunability, with the majority segregating in the least biologically relevant domains (i.e., low-density liquid domains). Therefore, a molecular-level picture of the majority of non-labeled lipids forming the membrane is still elusive. Here, we present simple, label-free imaging of domain formation in lipid monolayers, with chemical selectivity in unraveling lipid and cholesterol composition in all domain types. Exploiting conventional vibrational contrast in spontaneous Raman imaging, combined with chemometrics analysis, allows for examination of ternary systems containing saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol. We confirm features commonly observed by fluorescence microscopy, and provide an unprecedented analysis of cholesterol distribution at the single-membrane level.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=197 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/279794_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (76K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1395718org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1851c93org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1702f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c33555_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Early agriculturalists from Man Bac in Vietnam possessed a mixture of East Asian (southern Chinese farmer) and deeply diverged eastern Eurasian (hunter-gatherer) ancestry characteristic of Austroasiatic speakers, with similar ancestry as far south as Indonesia providing evidence for an expansive initial spread of Austroasiatic languages.

    "abstract": "Although the genome of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, was first made available in 2005, with additional strains reported later, the intrinsic genome complexity of this parasite (abundance of repetitive sequences and genes organized in tandem) has traditionally hindered high-quality genome assembly and annotation. This also limits diverse types of analyses that require high degree of precision. Long reads generated by third-generation sequencing technologies are particularly suitable to address the challenges associated with T. cruzi{acute}s genome since they permit directly determining the full sequence of large clusters of repetitive sequences without collapsing them. This, in turn, allows not only accurate estimation of gene copy numbers but also circumvents assembly fragmentation. Here, we present the analysis of the genome sequences of two T. cruzi clones: the hybrid TCC (DTU TcVI) and the non-hybrid Dm28c (DTU TcI), determined by PacBio SMRT technology. The improved assemblies herein obtained permitted us to accurately estimate gene copy numbers, abundance and distribution of repetitive sequences (including satellites and retroelements). We found that the genome of T. cruzi is composed of a \\\"core compartment\\\" and a \\\"disruptive compartment\\\" which exhibit opposite gene and GC content composition. New tandem and disperse repetitive sequences were identified, including some located inside coding sequences. Additionally, homologous chromosomes were separately assembled, allowing us to retrieve haplotypes as separate contigs instead of a unique mosaic sequence. Finally, manual annotation of surface multigene families MUC and trans-sialidases allows now a better overview of these complex groups of genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSex chromosome evolution is a dynamic process that can proceed at varying rates across lineages. For example, different chromosomes can be sex-linked between closely related species, whereas other sex chromosomes have been conserved for >100 million years. Cases of long-term sex chromosome conservation could be informative of factors that constrain sex chromosome evolution. Cytological similarities between the X chromosomes of the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) and most flies suggest that they may be homologous--possibly representing an extreme case of long-term conservation.\\n\\nResultsTo test the hypothesis that the cockroach and fly X chromosomes are homologous, we analyzed whole genome sequence data from cockroach. We found evidence in both sequencing coverage and heterozygosity that a significant excess of the same genes are on both the cockroach and fly X chromosomes. We also present evidence that the candidate X-linked cockroach genes may be dosage compensated in hemizygous males. Consistent with this hypothesis, three regulators of transcription and chromatin on the fly X chromosome are conserved in the cockroach genome.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results support our hypothesis that the German cockroach shares the same X chromosome as most flies. This may represent convergent evolution of the X chromosome in the lineages leading to cockroaches and flies. Alternatively, the common ancestor of most insects may have had an X chromosome that resembled the extant cockroach and fly X. Cockroaches and flies diverged [~]400 million years ago, which would be the longest documented conservation of a sex chromosome. Cockroaches and flies have different mechanisms of sex determination, raising the possibility that the X chromosome was conserved despite evolution of the sex determination pathway.",

Here we present the first map of regulatory elements across the development and ageing of an animal, identifying 42,245 elements accessible in at least one C. elegans stage. Based on nuclear transcription profiles, we define 15,714 protein-coding promoters and 19,231 putative enhancers, and find that both types of element can drive orientation-independent transcription. Additionally, hundreds of promoters produce transcripts antisense to protein coding genes, suggesting involvement in a widespread regulatory mechanism. We find that the accessibility of most elements is regulated during development and/or ageing and that patterns of accessibility change are linked to specific developmental or physiological processes. The map and characterization of regulatory elements across C. elegans life provides a platform for understanding how transcription controls development and ageing.",

Dilution cultures containing saturated alkane concentrations were sampled at zero, one and 10 days, and alkB and cyp153A1 alkane hydroxylase gene libraries and 16S rRNA sequences were analyzed. The initial sediment had the most diverse alkane hydroxylase sequences and phylogenetic composition whereas treated sediments became less functionally and phylogenetically diverse with alkane substrates apparently enriching a few dominant taxa. All 1-and 10-day samples were dominated by Pseudomonas- type alkane hydroxylase sequences except in dodecane treatments where primarily Rhodococcus--type alkane hydroxylases were detected. 16S rRNA profiling revealed that the Gammaproteobacteria, particularly Pseudomonas, dominated all one day samples, especially the n- hexane and gasoline treatments (63.2 and 47.2% respectively) and the 10-day n- hexane treatment (which contained 60.8% Pseudomonas and 18.6%Marinobacter). In contrast, the 10 days of dodecane treatment enriched for Actinobacteria (26.2% Rhodococcus and 32.4%Mycobacterium) and gasoline treatment enriched for Firmicutes (29.7%; mainly Bacillus, Lysinibacillus and Rumelibacillus). Our data indicate that fringing tidal marshes contain microbial communities with alkane-degrading abilities similar to larger meadow marshes, and support the hypothesis that alkane exposure reduces the functional and phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities in an alkane-specific manner. Further research to evaluate the ability of such fringing marsh communities to rebound to pre-pollutant diversity levels should be conducted to better assess the threat of petroleum to these habitats.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genomes evolve in complex ecosystems and are best understood in this natural context, but replicating such conditions in the lab is challenging. We used transposon sequencing to define the fitness consequences of gene disruption in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus grown in natural freshwater, compared to axenic growth in common laboratory media. Gene disruptions in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways and in metabolic substrate transport machinery impaired fitness in both lake water and defined minimal medium relative to complex peptone broth. Fitness in lake water was enhanced by insertions in genes required for flagellum biosynthesis and reduced by insertions in genes involved in biosynthesis of the holdfast surface adhesin. We further uncovered numerous hypothetical and uncharacterized genes for which disruption impaired fitness in lake water, defined minimal medium, or both. At the genome scale, the fitness profile of mutants cultivated in lake water was more similar to that in complex peptone broth than in defined minimal medium. Microfiltration of lake water did not significantly affect the terminal cell density or the fitness profile of the transposon mutant pool, suggesting that Caulobacter does not strongly interact with other microbes in this ecosystem on the measured timescale. Fitness of select mutants with defects in cell surface biosynthesis and environmental sensing were significantly more variable in lake water than in defined medium, presumably owing to day-to-day heterogeneity in the lake environment. This study reveals genetic interactions between Caulobacter and a natural freshwater environment, and provides a new avenue to study gene function in complex ecosystems.",

We hypothesized that the experience of ED1 can substantially influence later relapse behavior, and that dorsal raphe serotonin (DR 5-HT) signaling to dorsal hippocampus (DH) may be involved.\\n\\nMethodsWe used pharmacological inhibition of dorsal hippocampus 5-HT1A/1B receptors (via WAY100,635 plus GR127935), and chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal raphe-dHPC signaling to test the roles of these pathways on cocaine-seeking 2 weeks after ED1. We also tested specific effects of 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor antagonism on conditioned place preference for cocaine.\\n\\nResultsInhibition of DR-DH signaling via DREADDs or 5-HT1A/1B antagonists decreased ED1 drug-seeking with persistent effects on cocaine-seeking 2 weeks later, confirming the involvement of 5-HT signaling to dorsal hippocampus in driving drug-seeking persistence. Administration of a 5-HT1B antagonist alone on ED1 transiently decreased drug-associated memory performance in CPP, whereas administration of a 5-HT1A antagonist had no effect on memory but blocked CPP on a subsequent test 24h later.\\n\\nConclusionsWe conclude that blockade of DR inputs or 5HT1 signaling in DH on ED1 prevents recall of the drug-associated context and reduces drug seeking via antagonism of 5-HT1B receptors, and consolidates the memory of the newly non-drug context via antagonism of 5-HT1A receptors. Thus, treatments that modulate 5-HT-dependent memory mechanisms during initial abstinence may facilitate later maintenance of abstinence.",

    "abstract": "Brain stimulation technologies have seen increasing application in basic science investigations, specifically towards the goal of improving memory functioning. However, proposals concerning the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive enhancement often rely on simplified notions of excitation and, most applications examining the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on functional neuroimaging measures have been limited to univariate analyses of brain activity. We present here analyses using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) analysis in order to quantify the effect of TMS on memory representations. To test whether an increase in local excitability in PFC can have measurable influences on upstream representations in earlier temporal memory regions, we compared 1Hz and 5Hz stimulation to the left dorsolateral PFC. We found that 10 minutes of 5Hz rTMS, relative to 1Hz, had multiple effects on neural representations: 1) greater RSA during both encoding and retrieval, 2) greater ERS across all items, and, critically, 3) increasing ERS in MTL with increasing univariate activity in DLPFC, and greater functional connectivity for hits than misses between these regions. These results provide the first evidence of rTMS enhancing semantic representations and strengthen the idea that rTMS may affect the reinstatement of previously experienced events in upstream regions.",

    "abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWASs) for complex traits have implicated thousands of genetic loci. Most GWAS-nominated variants lie in noncoding regions, complicating the systematic translation of these findings into functional understanding. Here, we leverage convolutional neural networks to assist in this challenge. Our computational framework, peaBrain, models the transcriptional machinery of a tissue as a two-stage process: first, predicting the mean tissue specific abundance of all genes and second, incorporating the transcriptomic consequences of genotype variation to predict individual abundance on a subject-by-subject basis. We demonstrate that peaBrain accounts for the majority (>50%) of variance observed in mean transcript abundance across most tissues and outperforms regularized linear models in predicting the consequences of individual genotype variation. We highlight the validity of the peaBrain model by calculating non-coding impact scores that correlate with nucleotide evolutionary constraint that are also predictive of disease-associated variation and allele-specific transcription factor binding. We further show how these tissue-specific peaBrain scores can be leveraged to pinpoint functional tissues underlying complex traits, outperforming methods that depend on colocalization of eQTL and GWAS signals. We subsequently derive continuous dense embeddings of genes for downstream applications, and identify putatively functional eQTLs that are missed by high-throughput experimental approaches.",

    "abstract": "Liability to alcohol dependence (AD) is heritable, but little is known about its complex polygenic architecture or its genetic relationship with other disorders. To discover loci associated with AD and characterize the relationship between AD and other psychiatric and behavioral outcomes, we carried out the largest GWAS to date of DSM - IV diagnosed AD. Genome - wide data on 14,904 individuals with AD and 37,944 controls from 28 case / control and family - based studies were meta - analyzed, stratified by genetic ancestry (European, N = 46,568; African; N = 6,280). Independent, genome - wide significant effects of different ADH1B variants were identified in European (rs1229984; p = 9.8E - 13) and African ancestries (rs2066702; p = 2.2E - 9). Significant genetic correlations were observed with schizophrenia, ADHD, depression, and use of cigarettes and cannabis. There was only modest genetic correlation with alcohol consumption and inconsistent associations with problem drinking. The genetic underpinnings of AD only partially overlap with those for alcohol consumption, underscoring the genetic distinction between pathological and non - pathological drinking behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and variability. Integration of RA synovial genome-scale transcriptomic profiling of different patient cohorts can provide insights on the causal basis of drug responses. A normalized compendium was built that consists of 256 RA synovial samples that cover an intersection of 11,769 genes from 11 datasets. Differentially expression genes (DEGs) that were identified in three independent methods were fed into functional network analysis, with subsequent grouping of the samples based on a non-negative matrix factorization method. Finally, we built a predictive model for treatment response by using RA-relevant pathway activation scores and four machine learning classification techniques. We identified 876 up-regulated DEGs including 24 known genetic risk factors and 8 drug targets. DEG-based subgrouping revealed 3 distinct RA patient clusters with distinct activity signatures for RA-relevant pathways. In the case of infliximab, we constructed a classifier of drug response that was highly accurate with an AUC/AUPR of 0.92/0.86. The most informative pathways in achieving this performance were the NF{kappa}B-, Fc{varepsilon}RI- TCR-, and TNF signaling pathways. Similarly, the expression of the HMMR, PRPF4B, EVI2A, RAB27A, MALT1, SNX6, and IFIH1 genes contributed in predicting the patient outcome. Construction and analysis of normalized synovial transcriptomic compendia can provide useful insights for understanding RA-related pathway involvement and drug responses for individual patients. The efficacy of a predictive model for personalized drug response has been demonstrated and can be generalized to several drugs, co-morbidities, and other relevant features.",
