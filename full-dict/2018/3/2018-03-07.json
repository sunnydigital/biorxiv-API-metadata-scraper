    "abstract": "This article presents a practical roadmap for scholarly publishers to implement data citation in accordance with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP), a synopsis and harmonization of the recommendations of major science policy bodies. It was developed by the Publishers Early Adopters Expert Group as part of the Data Citation Implementation Pilot (DCIP) project, an initiative of FORCE11.org and the NIH BioCADDIE program. The structure of the roadmap presented here follows the \\\"life of a paper\\\" workflow and includes the categories Pre-submission, Submission, Production, and Publication. The roadmap is intended to be publisher-agnostic so that all publishers can use this as a starting point when implementing JDDCP-compliant data citation. Authors reading this roadmap will also better know what to expect from publishers and how to enable their own data citations to gain maximum impact, as well as complying with what will become increasingly common funder mandates on data transparency.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies report sex differences in some, but not all, responses to cannabinoids in rats. The majority of studies use parenteral injection, however most human use is via smoke inhalation and, increasingly, vapor inhalation. The aim of this study was to compare thermoregulatory and locomotor responses to inhaled {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and their combination using an e-cigarette based model in male and female rats.\\n\\nGroups of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (N=8 per group) were implanted with radiotelemetry devices for the assessment of body temperature and locomotor activity. Animals were then exposed to THC or CBD vapor (4 puffs/5 minutes) using a propylene glycol (PG) vehicle. THC dose was adjusted via the concentration in the vehicle (12.5-200 mg/ml) and CBD (100, 400 mg/mL) dose was also adjusted by varying the inhalation duration (10-40 minutes). Anti-nociception was evaluated using a tail-withdrawal assay following vapor inhalation.\\n\\nTHC inhalation reduced body temperature and increased tail-withdrawal latency in both sexes equivalently and in a concentration-dependent manner. Female temperature, activity and anti-nociceptive responses to THC did not differ between the estrus and diestrus phases. CBD inhalation alone induced hypothermia and suppressed locomotor activity in both males and females. Co-administration of THC with CBD, in a 1:4 ratio, significantly decreased temperature and activity in an approximately additive manner and to similar extent in each sex.\\n\\nIn summary the inhalation of THC or CBD, alone and in combination, produces approximately equivalent effects in male and female rats. Sex differences were subtle and mostly reflected in a more prolonged body temperature disruption in females.",

    "abstract": "Gene tagging with fluorescent proteins is essential to investigate the dynamic properties of cellular proteins. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for inserting fluorescent markers into all alleles of the gene of interest (GOI) and permits functionality and physiological expression of the fusion protein. It is essential to evaluate such genome-edited cell lines carefully in order to preclude off-target effects caused by either (i) incorrect insertion of the fluorescent protein, (ii) perturbation of the fusion protein by the fluorescent proteins or (iii) non-specific genomic DNA damage by CRISPR/Cas9. In this protocol1, we provide a step-by-step description of our systematic pipeline to generate and validate homozygous fluorescent knock-in cell lines.\\n\\nWe have used the paired Cas9D10A nickase approach to efficiently insert tags into specific genomic loci via homology-directed repair with minimal off-target effects. It is time- and cost-consuming to perform whole genome sequencing of each cell clone. Therefore, we have developed an efficient validation pipeline of the generated cell lines consisting of junction PCR, Southern Blot analysis, Sanger sequencing, microscopy, Western blot analysis and live cell imaging for cell cycle dynamics. This protocol takes between 6-9 weeks. Using this protocol, up to 70% of the targeted genes can be tagged homozygously with fluorescent proteins and result in physiological levels and phenotypically functional expression of the fusion proteins.\\n\\nEditorial SummaryThis protocol provides a detailed workflow describing how to insert fluorescent markers into all alleles of a gene of interest using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology and how to generate and validate homozygous fluorescent knock-in cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Early warning signals of sudden regime shifts are a widely studied phenomenon for their ability to quantify a systems proximity to a tipping point to a new and contrasting dynamical regime. However, this effect has been little studied in the context of the complex interactions between disease dynamics and vaccinating behaviour. Our objective was to determine whether critical slowing down (CSD) occurs in a multiplex network that captures opinion propagation on one network layer and disease spread on a second network layer. We parameterized a network simulation model to represent a hypothetical self-limiting, acute, vaccine-preventable infection with shortlived natural immunity. We tested five different network types: random, lattice, small-world, scale-free, and an empirically derived network. For the first four network types, the model exhibits a regime shift as perceived vaccine risk moves beyond a tipping point from full vaccine acceptance and disease elimination to full vaccine refusal and disease endemicity. This regime shift is preceded by an increase in the spatial correlation in non-vaccinator opinions beginning well before the bifurcation point, indicating CSD. The early warning signals occur across a wide range of parameter values. However, the more gradual transition exhibited in the empirically-derived network underscores the need for further research before it can be determined whether trends in spatial correlation in real-world social networks represent critical slowing down. The potential upside of having this monitoring ability suggests that this is a worthwhile area for further research.",

Estrogen receptor  (ER) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are expressed in the uterus and their ligands have opposing effects on uterine growth. In endometrial tumors with high ER expression, we surprisingly found that expression of GR is associated with poor prognosis. Dexamethasone reduced normal uterine growth in vivo; however, this growth inhibition was abolished in estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. We observed low genomic binding site overlap when ER and GR are induced with their respective ligands; however, upon simultaneous induction they co-occupy more sites. GR binding is significantly altered by estradiol with GR recruited to ER bound loci that become more accessible upon estradiol induction. Gene expression responses to co-treatment were more similar to estradiol, but with novel regulated genes. Our results suggest phenotypic and molecular interplay between ER and GR in endometrial cancer.",

    "abstract": "Central to building and reorganizing cytoskeletal arrays is the creation of new polymers. While nucleation has been the major focus of study for new microtubule generation, severing has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to create new polymers, a mechanism recently shown to drive the reorientation of cortical arrays of higher plants in response to blue light perception. As severing produces new plus ends behind the stabilizing GTP-cap, an important and unanswered question is how these are stabilized in vivo to promote net microtubule generation. Here we identify the conserved protein CLASP as a potent stabilizer of new plus ends created by katanin severing and find that CLASP is required for rapid cortical array reorientation. In clasp mutants both rescue of shrinking plus ends and the regrowth of plus ends immediately after severing are reduced, computational modeling reveals that it is the specific stabilization of severed ends that explains CLASPs function in promoting microtubule amplification by severing and cortical array reorientation.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering cis-regulation, the code by which transcription factors (TFs) interpret regulatory DNA sequence to control gene expression levels, is a long-standing challenge. Previous studies of native or engineered sequences have remained limited in scale. Here, we use random sequences as an alternative, allowing us to measure the expression output of over 100 million synthetic yeast promoters. Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94% of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89% from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis-regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin. Such massive-throughput regulatory assays of random DNA provide the diverse examples necessary to learn complex models of cis-regulatory logic.",

    "abstract": "This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 \"fast\" (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLUex. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLUex away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLUex results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low ([~]1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLUex rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population ([~]1%), is only accessible when GLUex is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLUex protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the brain, the roles and mechanisms of sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-selective ion channels are well established. In contrast, chloride-selective channels have been studied much less and are not sufficiently understood, despite known associations of chloride-channel defects with brain disorders. The most broadly expressed voltage-activated chloride channel in the brain is CLC-2 (one of 9 human CLC homologs). In this work, we use simulations to model the conformational dynamics of the CLC-2 chloride ion channel selectivity filter (SF), which is the part of the protein that controls whether the channel is in an ion-conducting or non-conducting state. Our analysis identifies four primary conformational states and a specific progression through these states. Our results are consistent with structural and functional data in the literature and provide a high-resolution model for guiding further studies of CLC-2. These results will inform our understanding of how CLC-2 governs electrical activity and ion homeostasis in the brain.",

We describe the population structure and genetic diversity of a broad range of co-occurring Pseudomonas syringae isolated from infected and uninfected kiwifruit during an outbreak of bleeding canker disease caused by P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) in New Zealand. Overall population structure was clonal and affected by ecological factors including infection status and cultivar. Most isolates are members of a new clade in phylogroup 3 (PG3a), also present on kiwifruit leaves in China and Japan. Stability of the polymorphism between pathogenic Psa and commensal P. syringae PG3a isolated from the same leaf was tested using reciprocal invasion from rare assays in vitro and in planta. P. syringae G33C (PG3a) inhibited Psa NZ54, while the presence of Psa NZ54 enhanced the growth of P. syringae G33C. This effect could not be attributed to virulence activity encoded by the Type 3 secretion system of Psa. Together our data contribute toward the development of an ecological perspective on the genetic structure of pathogen populations.\\n\\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANT STATEMENTBacterial pathogen populations are often studied with little consideration of co-occurring microbes and yet interactions between pathogens and commensals can affect both population structure and disease progression. A fine-scale sampling of commensals present on kiwifruit leaves during an outbreak of bleeding canker disease caused by P. syringae pv. actinidiae reveals a clonal population structure. A new clade of non-pathogenic P. syringae (PG3a) appears to be associated with kiwifruit on a global scale. The presence of PG3a on kiwifruit has significant effects on the outcome of infection by P. syringae pv. actinidiae. This emphasises the value of studying the effect of co-occurring bacteria on pathogen-plant interactions.",

Aberrations from the reward-maximizing solutions, either across subjects or across different sessions for the same subject, are often interpreted as reflecting poor learning or physical limitations. Here we show that such aberrations may instead reflect the involvement of additional satisficing and heuristic principles. For an asymmetric-reward perceptual decision-making task, three monkeys produced adaptive biases in response to changes in reward asymmetries and perceptual sensitivity. Their choices and response times were consistent with a normative accumulate-to-bound process. However, their context-dependent adjustments to this process deviated slightly but systematically from the reward-maximizing solutions. These adjustments were instead consistent with a rational process to find satisficing solutions based on the gradient of each monkeys reward-rate function. These results suggest new dimensions for assessing the rational and idiosyncratic aspects of flexible decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) accurately models associative learning observed in animals, where they learn to associate outcome predicting environmental states, termed conditioned stimuli (CS), with the value of outcomes, such as rewards, termed unconditioned stimuli (US). A component of TDRL is the value function, which captures the expected cumulative future reward from a given state. The value function can be modified by changes in the animals knowledge, such as by the predictability of its environment. Here we show that primary motor cortical (M1) neurodynamics reflect a TD learning process, encoding a state value function and reward prediction error in line with TDRL. M1 responds to the delivery of reward, and shifts its value related response earlier in a trial, becoming predictive of an expected reward, when reward is predictable due to a CS. This is observed in tasks performed manually or observed passively, as well as in tasks without an explicit CS predicting reward, but simply with a predictable temporal structure, that is a predictable environment. M1 also encodes the expected reward value associated with a set of CS in a multiple reward level CS-US task. Here we extend the Microstimulus TDRL model, reported to accurately capture RL related dopaminergic activity, to account for M1 reward related neural activity in a multitude of tasks.\\n\\nSignificance statementThere is a great deal of agreement between aspects of temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) models and neural activity in dopaminergic brain centers. Dopamine is know to be necessary for sensorimotor learning induced synaptic plasticity in the motor cortex (M1), and thus one might expect to see the hallmarks of TDRL in M1, which we show here in the form of a state value function and reward prediction error during. We see these hallmarks even when a conditioned stimulus is not available, but the environment is predictable, during manual tasks with agency, as well as observational tasks without agency. This information has implications towards autonomously updating brain machine interfaces as others and we have proposed and published on.",

    "abstract": "The schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated gene, BRD1, encodes a scaffold protein that in complex with epigenetic modifiers regulate gene sets enriched for psychiatric disorder risk. Preclinical evidence from male Brd1+/- mice has previously implicated BRD1 with phenotypes of translational relevance to schizophrenia. Here we describe the phenotype of female Brd1+/- mice and report attenuated dendritic architecture and monoaminergic dysregulation accompanied by sex-specific changes in affective behaviors. In accordance, global gene expression profiling reveals regional dysregulation of gene sets enriched with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia risk in female and male Brd1+/- mice, respectively. Independent of sex, however, differentially expressed genes cluster in common functional pathways associated with psychiatric disorders, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation as well as G-protein coupled-, and nuclear receptor mediated signaling. Accordingly, we provide in vitro evidence that BRD1 modulates the transcriptional drive of a subset of nuclear receptors (e.g. the vitamin D and glucocorticoid receptors). Moreover, we demonstrate enrichment of psychiatric disorder risk in the target genes of nuclear receptors, sex-biased expression of several nuclear receptor genes in the adult brain of Brd1+/- mice, and that sex-biased genes in general are enriched with nuclear receptor genes particularly at the earliest developmental stage of the human brain. Overall, our data suggests that the spatio-temporal interaction between BRD1 and subsets of nuclear receptors in the brain is sex-biased and that hampered BRD1 mediated regulation of target genes governed by certain nuclear receptors may significantly contribute to sex differences in psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "Acid stress caused by lactate increment can lead to the growth inhibition of bacteria and yes has not been fully defined. Regulons, serve as co-regulated gene groups contribute to the transcriptional regulation of microbe genome, have the potential in understanding the underlying regulatory mechanism. Lactococcus lactis is one of the most important Gram-positive lactic acid-producing bacteria, widely used in food industry and has been proved to have advantages in oral delivery of drug and vaccine. In this study, we designed a novel computational pipeline, RECTA, for regulon prediction. The pipeline carried out differentially expressed gene prediction, gene co-expression analysis, cis-regulatory motif finding, and comparative genomic study to predict and validate regulons related to acid stress response in Lactococcus lactis MG1363. A total of 51 regulons were identified, and 14 of them have computational verified significance. Among these 14 regulons, five of them were computationally predicted to be connected with acid stress response with (i) known transcriptional factors in MEME suite database successfully mapped in Lactococcus lactis MG1363; and (ii) differentially expressed genes between pH values of 6.5 (control) and 5.1 (treatment). Validated by 36 literature confirmed acid stress response related proteins and genes, 33 genes in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 were found having orthologous genes using BLAST, associated to six regulons. An acid response related regulatory network was constructed, involving two trans-membrane proteins, eight regulons (llrA, llrC, hllA, ccpA, NHP6A, rcfB, regulons #8 and #39), nine functional modules, and 33 genes with orthologous genes known to be associated to acid stress. Our RECTA pipeline provides an effective way to construct a reliable gene regulatory network based on regulon elucidation. The predicted resistance pathways could serve as promising candidates for better acid tolerance engineering in Lactococcus lactis. It has a strong application power and can be effectively applied to other bacterial genomes, where the elucidation of the transcriptional regulation network is needed.",

    "abstract": "It is an uninformative truism to state that the brain operates at multiple spatial and temporal scales, each with each own set of emergent phenomena. More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.\n\nHere we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.\n\nTo help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.",

    "abstract": "A robust regulation of plant immune responses requires multitude of positive and negative regulators that act in concert. The immune-associated nucleotide-binding (IAN) gene family members are associated with immunity in different organisms, although no characterization of their function has been carried out to date in plants. In this work, we analyzed the expression patterns of IAN genes and found that IAN9 is repressed upon pathogen infection or treatment with immune elicitors. IAN9 encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein that genetically behaves as a negative regulator of immunity. A novel ian9 mutant generated by CRISPR/Cas9 shows increased resistance to Pseudomonas syringae, while transgenic plants overexpressing IAN9 show a slight increase in susceptibility. In vivo immunoprecipitation of IAN9-GFP followed by mass spectrometry analysis revealed that IAN9 associates with a previously uncharacterized C3HC4-type RING finger domain-containing protein that we named IAP1, for IAN9-associated protein 1, which also acts as a negative regulator of basal immunity. Interestingly, neither ian9 or iap1 mutant plants show any obvious developmental phenotype, suggesting that they display enhanced inducible immunity rather than constitutive immune responses. Since both IAN9 and IAP1 have orthologs in important crop species, they could be suitable targets to generate plants more resistant to diseases caused by bacterial pathogens without yield penalty.",

    "abstract": "Body size is a quantitative trait that is closely associated to fitness and under the control of both genetic and environmental factors. While developmental plasticity for this and other traits is heritable and under selection, little is known about the genetic basis for variation in plasticity that can provide the raw material for its evolution. We quantified genetic variation for body size plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring thorax and abdomen length of females reared at two temperatures from a panel representing naturally segregating alleles, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found variation between genotypes for the levels and direction of thermal plasticity in size of both body parts. We then used a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach to unravel the genetic basis of inter-genotype variation in body size plasticity, and used different approaches to validate selected QTLs and to explore potential pleiotropic effects. We found mostly \\\"private QTLs\\\", with little overlap between the candidate loci underlying variation in plasticity for thorax versus abdomen size, for different properties of the plastic response, and for size versus size plasticity. We also found that the putative functions of plasticity QTLs were diverse and that alleles for higher plasticity were found at lower frequencies in the target population. Importantly, a number of our plasticity QTLs have been targets of selection in other populations. Our data sheds light onto the genetic basis of inter-genotype variation in size plasticity that is necessary for its evolution.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe environmental conditions under which development takes place can affect developmental outcomes and lead to the production of phenotypes adjusted to the environment adults will live in. This developmental plasticity, which can help organisms cope with environmental heterogeneity, is heritable and under selection. Plasticity can itself evolve, a process that will be partly dependent on the available genetic variation for this trait. Using a wild-derived D. melanogaster panel, we identified DNA sequence variants associated to variation in thermal plasticity for body size. We found that these variants correspond to a diverse set of gene functions. Furthermore, their effects differ between body parts and properties of the thermal response, which can, therefore, evolve independently. Our results shed new light onto a number of key questions about the long discussed genes for plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Purine homeostasis is ensured through a metabolic network widely conserved from prokaryotes to humans. Purines can either be synthesized de novo, reused, or produced by interconversion of extant metabolites using the so-called recycling pathway. Although thoroughly characterized in microorganisms, such as yeast or bacteria, little is known about the regulation of this biosynthesis network in metazoans. In humans, several diseases are linked to purine biosynthesis deficiencies through yet poorly understood etiologies. Particularly, the deficiency in Adenylosuccinate Lyase (ADSL), one enzyme involved both in the purine de novo and recycling pathways, causes severe muscular and neuronal symptoms. In order to address the mechanisms underlying this deficiency, we established Caenorhabditis elegans as a metazoan model organism to study purine metabolism, while focusing on ADSL. We show that the purine biosynthesis network is functionally conserved in C. elegans. Moreover, ADSL is required for developmental timing and germline stem cell maintenance, and muscle integrity. Our results allow to ascribe developmental and tissue specific phenotypes to separable steps of the purine metabolic network in an animal model. Particularly, the muscle, germline and developmental defects are linked specifically to the ADSL role in the purine recycling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is a critical component of an organisms ability to thrive in an ever-changing environment. The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, adapts to unfavorable environmental conditions by pausing reproductive development and entering a stress-resistant larval stage known as dauer. The transition into dauer is marked by vast morphological changes - including remodeling of epidermis, neurons and muscle. Though many of these dauer-specific traits have been described, the molecular basis of dauer-specific remodeling is still poorly understood. Here we show that the nidogen-domain containing protein DEX-1 functions downstream of the dauer decision to facilitate stage-specific tissue remodeling during dauer morphogenesis. DEX-1 was previously shown to regulate sensory dendrite formation during embryogenesis. We find that DEX-1 is also required for the proper remodeling of the stem cell-like epidermal seam cells and maintenance of seam cell quiescence during dauer. dex-1 mutant dauers lack distinct lateral cuticular alae during dauer and have increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Furthermore, we find that DEX-1 mediated seam cell remodeling is required for proper dauer mobility. We show that DEX-1 acts cell autonomously in the seam cells during dauer and that dex-1 expression during dauer is regulated through DAF-16/FOXO-mediated derepression. Finally, we show that dex-1 interacts with a family of zona pellucida-domain encoding genes to regulate dauer-specific epidermal remodeling. Taken together, our data indicates that DEX-1 plays a central role in C. elegans epidermal remodeling during dauer.",

Despite life-long neoteny in nature and in captive-bred colonies, metamorphosis of these animals can be experimentally induced by administering Thyroid hormones (THs). However, biological consequences of this experimental procedure, such as host microbiota response and implications for regenerative capacity, remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically compared host bacterial microbiota associated with skin, stomach, gut tissues and fecal samples based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, along with limb regenerative capacity, between neotenic and metamorphic Axolotls. Our results show that distinct bacterial communities inhabit individual organs of Axolotl and undergo substantial restructuring through metamorphosis. Drastic restructuring was observed for skin microbiota, highlighted by a major transition from Firmicutes-enriched to Proteobacteria-enriched relative abundance and precipitously decreased diversity. Remarkably, shifts in microbiota was accompanied by a steep reduction in limb regenerative capacity. Fecal microbiota of neotenic and metamorphic Axolotl shared relatively higher similarity, suggesting that diet continues to shape microbiota despite fundamental transformations in the host digestive organs. The results provide novel insights into microbiological and regenerative aspects of Axolotl metamorphosis and will establish a baseline for future in-depth studies.",

The carbon catabolite repression represents a global regulatory system, allowing the bacteria to express genes involved in carbon utilization and metabolization of the preferred carbon source. In Staphylococcus aureus, regulation of catabolite repressing genes is mediated by the carbon catabolite protein A (CcpA). Here, we have identified a CcpA-dependent small non-coding RNA, RsaI that is inhibited by high glucose concentrations. RsaI represses the translation of mRNAs encoding a major permease of glucose uptake, the FN3K enzyme that protects proteins against damages caused by high glucose concentrations, and IcaR, the transcriptional repressor of exopolysaccharide production. Besides, RsaI regulates the activities of other sRNAs responding to the uptake of glucose-6 phosphate or NO. Finally, RsaI inhibits the expression of several enzymes involved in carbon catabolism pathway, and activates genes involved in energy production, fermentation and NO detoxification when the glucose concentration decreases. This multifunctional RNA provides a signature for a metabolic switch when glucose is scarce and growth is arrested.",

We establish a general model for chemical reaction systems that properly accounts for energetics, kinetics and conservation laws. We find that (1) some systems are collectively-catalytic (e.g., the citric acid cycle), while others self-replicate as a whole (e.g., the formose reaction); (2) side reactions do not always inhibit such systems; (3) many alternative chemical universes often contain one or more such systems; (4) in some self-replicating systems, the entropy of certain parts spontaneously decreases; (5) complex self-replicating molecules emerge spontaneously from simple reaction systems through a sequence of transitions.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary origin of obesity is classically believed to be genetic or developmentally induced thrift, as an adaptation to ancestral feast and famine conditions. However, recently the thrift family of hypotheses have attracted serious criticism necessitating alternative thinking. Optimization of foraging behaviour is an important aspect of behavioural evolution. For a species evolved for optimizing nutritional benefits against predation or other foraging risks, reduction in foraging risk below a threshold dramatically increases the steady-state body weight. In modern life where feeding is detached from foraging, the behavioural regulation mechanisms are likely to fail resulting into escalation of adiposity. At a proximate level the signalling pathways for foraging optimization involve fear induced signal molecules in the brain including Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART) interacting with adiposity signals such as leptin. While leptin promotes the expression of the fear peptides, the fear peptides promote anorectic action of leptin. This interaction promotes foraging drive and risk tolerance when the stored energy is low and suppresses hunger and foraging drive when the perceived risk is high. The ecological model of foraging optimization and the molecular model of interaction of these peptides converge in the outcome that the steady state adiposity is an inverse square root function of foraging risk. The foraging optimization model is independent of thrift or insurance hypotheses, but not mutually exclusive. We review existing evidence and suggest testable predictions of the model. Understanding obesity simultaneously at proximate and ultimate levels is likely to suggest effective means to curb the obesity epidemic.",

    "abstract": "Selection pressure impacts genomes unevenly, as different genes adapt with differential speed to establish an organisms optimal fitness. Plant pathogens co-evolve with their hosts, which implies continuously adaption to evade host immunity. Effectors are secreted proteins that mediate immunity evasion, but may also typically become recognized by host immune receptors. To facilitate effector repertoire alterations, in many pathogens, effector genes reside in dynamic genomic regions that are thought to display accelerated evolution, a phenomenon that is captured by the two-speed genome hypothesis. The genome of the vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae has been proposed to obey to a similar two-speed regime with dynamic, lineage-specific regions that are characterized by genomic rearrangements, increased transposable element activity and enrichment in in planta-induced effector genes. However, little is known of the origin of, and sequence diversification within, these lineage-specific regions. Based on comparative genomics among Verticillium spp. we now show differential sequence divergence between core and lineage-specific genomic regions of V. dahliae. Surprisingly, we observed that lineage-specific regions display markedly increased sequence conservation. Since single nucleotide diversity is reduced in these regions, host adaptation seems to be merely achieved through presence/absence polymorphisms. Increased sequence conservation of genomic regions important for pathogenicity is an unprecedented finding for filamentous plant pathogens and signifies the diversity of genomic dynamics in host-pathogen co-evolution.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) aims to extract the magnetic susceptibility of tissue from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phase measurements. The mapping of magnetic susceptibility in vivo has gained broad interest in several fields of science and medicine because it yields relevant information on biological tissue properties, predominantly myelin, iron and calcium. Thereby, QSM can also reveal pathological changes of these key components in devastating diseases such as Parkinsons disease, Multiple Sclerosis, or hepatic iron overload. As QSM requires the solution of an ill-posed field-to-source-inversion, current techniques utilize manual optimization of regularization parameters to balance between smoothing, artifacts and quantification accuracy. We trained a fully convolutional deep neural network - DeepQSM - to invert the magnetic dipole kernel convolution. This network is capable of solving the ill-posed field-to-source inversion on real-world in vivo MRI phase data without the need for manual parameter tuning, which proves that this network has generalized the underlying mathematical principle of the dipole inversion. We demonstrate that DeepQSMs susceptibility maps enable identification of deep brain substructures that are not visible in MRI phase data and provide information on their respective magnetic tissue properties. We illustrate DeepQSMs clinical relevance in a patient with multiple sclerosis showing its sensitivity to white matter lesions. In summary, DeepQSM can be used to determine the composition of myelin sheets of nerve fibers in the brain, and to assess quantitative information on iron homeostasis and its dysregulation, and will subsequently contribute to a better understanding of these biological processes in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Oocyte quality control culls eggs with defects in meiosis. In mouse, oocyte death is triggered by defects in chromosome synapsis and recombination, which involve repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) between homologous chromosomes. We show that RNF212, a SUMO ligase required for crossing over, also mediates oocyte quality control. Both physiological apoptosis and wholesale oocytes elimination in meiotic mutants require RNF212. RNF212 sensitizes cells to DSB-induced apoptosis within a narrow window when chromosomes desynapse during the transition into quiescence. Analysis of DNA damage during this transition implies that RNF212 impedes DSB repair. Consistently, RNF212 is required for HORMAD1, a negative regulator of inter-sister recombination, to associate with desynapsing chromosomes. We infer that oocytes impede repair of residual DSBs to retain a \\\"memory\\\" of meiotic defects that enables quality control processes. These results define the logic of oocyte quality control and suggest RNF212 variants may influence transmission of defective genomes.",

    "abstract": "When three cyanobacterial proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, are incubated with ATP in vitro, the phosphorylation level of KaiC hexamers shows stable oscillation with approximately 24 h period. In order to understand this KaiABC clockwork, we need to analyze both the macroscopic synchronization of a large number of KaiC hexamers and the microscopic reactions and structural changes in individual KaiC molecules. In the present paper, we explain two coarse-grained theoretical models, the many-molecule (MM) model and the single-molecule (SM) model, to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings. In the simulation results with these models, ATP hydrolysis drives oscillation of individual KaiC hexamers and ATP hydrolysis is necessary for synchronizing oscillations of a large number of KaiC hexamers. Sensitive temperature dependence of the lifetime of the ADP bound state in the CI domain of KaiC hexamers makes the oscillation period temperature insensitive. ATPase activity is correlated to the frequency of phosphorylation oscillation in the single molecule of KaiC hexamer, which should be the origin of the observed ensemble-level correlation between the ATPase activity and the frequency of phosphorylation oscillation. Thus, the simulation results with the MM and SM models suggest that ATP hydrolysis randomly occurring in each CI domain of individual KaiC hexamers is a key process for oscillatory behaviors of the ensemble of many KaiC hexamers.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCyanobacterial proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, can reconstitute a circadian clock when they are incubated with ATP in vitro. In order to understand this prototypical oscillator, we need to analyze both synchronization of a macroscopically large number of oscillating molecules and microscopic reactions in individual molecules. We introduced two theoretical models to unify macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints. Simulation results suggest that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for synchronization and temperature compensation and that ATPase activity is correlated to the oscillation frequency in individual molecules.

    "abstract": "Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling path- ways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca2+-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question.\\n\\nHere, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca2+ modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity.\\n\\nThis work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCalmodulin is a protein involved in the regulation of a variety of cell signaling pathways. It acts by making usually calcium-insensitive proteins sensitive to changes in the calcium concentration inside the cell. Its two lobes bind calcium and allow the energetically unfavorable exposure of hydrophobic residues to the aqueous environment which can then bind target proteins. The mechanisms behind the simultaneous specificity and variation of target protein binding is yet unknown but will aid understanding of the calcium-signaling and regulation that occur in many of our cellular processes.\\n\\nHere, we used molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis techniques to investigate what effect calcium has on the binding modes of calmodulin. The simulations and analyses allow us to observe and differentiate specific states. One domain of calmodulin is shown to be selective with binding involving short- distance interactions between hydrophobic residues, while the other binds target proteins through a more flexible mechanism involving long-distance electrostatic interactions.",

In the breast, studies have demonstrated a pro-tumorigenic role for adipocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which breast cancer cells coopt adipocytes remain elusive. Studying breast tumors and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse models, we show that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in NAT. We investigated the tumor-adipocyte interface and find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP, a critical lipolysis-inducing signaling molecule, is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We found that gap junction formation depends upon connexin 31 (Cx31), and that Cx31 is essential for breast tumor growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo. Thus, direct tumor cell-adipocyte interaction is critical for tumorigenesis, and may serve as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\nOne sentence summaryGap junctions between breast cancer cells and adipocytes transfer cAMP and activate lipolysis in the breast tumor microenvironment.",

However, untimely activation of the MUS81 complex in S-phase is dangerous. Little is known about the regulation of the human MUS81 complex and how deregulated activation affects chromosome integrity. Here, we show that the CK2 kinase phosphorylates MUS81 at Serine 87 in late-G2/mitosis, and upon mild replication stress. Phosphorylated MUS81 interacts with SLX4, and this association promotes the function of the MUS81 complex. In line with a role in mitosis, phosphorylation at Serine 87 is suppressed in S-phase and is mainly detected in the MUS81 molecules associated with EME1. Loss of CK2-dependent MUS81 phosphorylation contributes modestly to chromosome integrity, however, expression of the phosphomimic form induces DSBs accumulation in S-phase, because of unscheduled targeting of HJ-like DNA intermediates, and generates a wide chromosome instability phenotype. Collectively, our findings describe a novel regulatory mechanism controlling the MUS81 complex function in human cells. Furthermore, they indicate that, genome stability depends mainly on the ability of cells to counteract targeting of branched intermediates by the MUS81/EME1 complex in S-phase, rather than on a correct MUS81 function in mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is revolutionising biodiversity monitoring, but has unrealised potential for ecological hypothesis generation and testing. Here, we validate this potential in a large-scale analysis of vertebrate community data generated by eDNA metabarcoding of 532 UK ponds. We test biotic associations between the threatened great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and other vertebrates as well as abiotic factors influencing T. cristatus detection at the pondscape. Furthermore, we test the status of T. cristatus as an umbrella species for pond conservation by assessing whether vertebrate species richness is greater in ponds with T. cristatus and higher T. cristatus Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) scores. T. cristatus detection was positively correlated with amphibian and waterfowl species richness. Specifically, T. cristatus was positively associated with smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common coot (Fulica atra), and common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), but negatively associated with common toad (Bufo bufo). T. cristatus detection did not significantly decrease as fish species richness increased, but negative associations with common carp (Cyprinus carpio), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) were identified. T. cristatus detection was negatively correlated with mammal species richness, and T. cristatus was negatively associated with grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). T. cristatus detection was negatively correlated with larger pond area, presence of inflow, and higher percentage of shading, but positively correlated with HSI score, supporting its application to T. cristatus survey. Vertebrate species richness was significantly higher in T. cristatus ponds and broadly increased as T. cristatus HSI scores increased. We reaffirm reported associations (e.g. T. cristatus preference for smaller ponds) but also provide novel insights, including a negative effect of pond inflow on T. cristatus. Our findings demonstrate the prospects of eDNA metabarcoding for ecological hypothesis generation and testing at landscape scale, and dramatic enhancement of freshwater conservation, management, monitoring and research.",

    "abstract": "Large chromosomal rearrangements are thought to facilitate adaptation to heterogeneous environments by limiting genomic recombination. Indeed, inversions have been implicated in adaptation along environmental clines and in ecotype specialisation. Here, we combine classical ecological studies and population genetics to investigate an inversion polymorphism previously documented in Europe among natural populations of the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida along a latitudinal cline in North America. We test if the inversion is present in North America and polymorphic, assess which environmental conditions modulate the inversion karyotype frequencies, and document the relationship between inversion karyotype and adult size. We sampled nearly 2,000 flies from 20 populations along several environmental gradients to quantify associations of inversion frequencies to heterogeneous environmental variables. Genotyping and phenotyping showed a widespread and conserved inversion polymorphism between Europe and America. Variation in inversion frequency was significantly associated with environmental factors, with parallel patterns between continents, indicating that the inversion may play a role in local adaptation. The three karyotypes of the inversion are differently favoured across micro-habitats and represent life-history strategies likely maintained by the collective action of several mechanisms of balancing selection. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that inversions are facilitators of adaptation and enhance within-species diversity.",

    "abstract": "Interest in reconstructing demographic histories has motivated the development of methods to estimate locus-specific pairwise coalescence times from whole-genome sequence data. We developed a new method, ASMC, that can estimate coalescence times using only SNP array data, and is 2-4 orders of magnitude faster than previous methods when sequencing data are available. We were thus able to apply ASMC to 113,851 phased British samples from the UK Biobank, aiming to detect recent positive selection by identifying loci with unusually high density of very recent coalescence times. We detected 12 genome-wide significant signals, including 6 loci with previous evidence of positive selection and 6 novel loci, consistent with coalescent simulations showing that our approach is well-powered to detect recent positive selection. We also applied ASMC to sequencing data from 498 Dutch individuals (Genome of the Netherlands data set) to detect background selection at deeper time scales. We observed highly significant correlations between average coalescence time inferred by ASMC and other measures of background selection. We investigated whether this signal translated into an enrichment in disease and complex trait heritability by analyzing summary association statistics from 20 independent diseases and complex traits (average N=86k) using stratified LD score regression. Our background selection annotation based on average coalescence time was strongly enriched for heritability (p = 7x10-153) in a joint analysis conditioned on a broad set of functional annotations (including other background selection annotations), meta-analyzed across traits; SNPs in the top 20% of our annotation were 3.8x enriched for heritability compared to the bottom 20%. These results underscore the widespread effects of background selection on disease and complex trait heritability.",

Here, we estimate the correlation of genetic effects at the top associated cis-expression (cis-eQTLs or cis-mQTLs) between brain and blood for genes expressed (or CpG sites methylated) in both tissues, while accounting for errors in their estimated effects (rb). Using publicly available data (n = 72 to l,366), we find that the genetic effects of cis-eQTLs (PeQTL < 5x10-8) or mQTLs (PmQTL < 1x10-10) are highly correlated between independent brain and blood samples ([Formula] with SE = 0.015 for cis-eQTL and [Formula] with SE = 0.006 for cis-mQTLs). Using meta-analyzed brain eQTL/mQTL data (n = 526 to 1,194), we identify 61 genes and 167 DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with 4 brain-related traits and disorders. Most of these associations are a subset of the discoveries (97 genes and 295 DNAm sites) using data from blood with larger sample sizes (n = l,980 to 14,115). We further find that cis-eQTLs with tissue-specific effects are approximately uniformly distributed across all the functional annotation categories, and that mean difference in gene expression level between brain and blood is almost independent of the difference in the corresponding cis-eQTL effect. Our results demonstrate the gain of power in gene discovery for brain-related phenotypes using blood cis-eQTL or cis-mQTL data with large sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "The iconic orange clownfish, Amphiprion percula, is a model organism for studying the ecology and evolution of reef fishes, including patterns of population connectivity, sex change, social organization, habitat selection and adaptation to climate change. Notably, the orange clownfish is the only reef fish for which a complete larval dispersal kernel has been established and was the first fish species for which it was demonstrated that anti-predator responses of reef fishes could be impaired by ocean acidification. Despite its importance, molecular resources for this species remain scarce and until now it lacked a reference genome assembly. Here we present a de novo chromosome-scale assembly of the genome of the orange clownfish Amphiprion percula. We utilized single-molecule real-time sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences to produce an initial polished assembly comprised of 1,414 contigs, with a contig N50 length of 1.86 Mb. Using Hi-C based chromatin contact maps, 98% of the genome assembly were placed into 24 chromosomes, resulting in a final assembly of 908.8 Mb in length with contig and scaffold N50s of 3.12 and 38.4 Mb, respectively. This makes it one of the most contiguous and complete fish genome assemblies currently available. The genome was annotated with 26,597 protein coding genes and contains 96% of the core set of conserved actinopterygian orthologs. The availability of this reference genome assembly as a community resource will further strengthen the role of the orange clownfish as a model species for research on the ecology and evolution of reef fishes.",

However, despite recent progress in spatially resolved transcriptomics, spatial mapping of genomic data in a high-throughput and high-resolution manner has been challenging due to current technical limitations. Here, we describe a novel approach, phenotype-based high-throughput laser-aided isolation and sequencing (PHLI-seq), which enables high-throughput isolation of a single-cell or a small number of cells and their genome-wide sequence analysis to construct genomic maps within cancer tissue in relation to the phenotypes of the cells. By applying PHLI-seq, we reveal the heterogeneity of breast cancer tissues at a high resolution and map the genomic landscape of the cells to their corresponding spatial locations and phenotypes in the tumour mass. Additionally, with different staining modalities, the genotypes of the cells can be connected to corresponding phenotypic information of the tissue. Together with the spatially resolved genomic analysis, we can infer the histories of heterogeneous cancer cells in two or three dimensions, providing significant insight into cancer biology and precision medicine.",

However, since most nucleosomes in metazoans are poorly positioned it is unknown to which extent the bulk genomic nucleosome repeat length (NRL) reflects the regularity and spacing of nucleosome arrays at individual loci. We describe a new approach to map nucleosome array regularity and spacing through sequencing oligonucleosome-derived DNA by Illumina sequencing as well as emergent nanopore-technology. This revealed modulation of array regularity and NRL depending on functional chromatin states independently of nucleosome phasing and even in unmappable regions. We also found that nucleosome arrays downstream of silent promoters are considerably more regular than those downstream of highly expressed ones, despite more extensive nucleosome phasing of the latter. Our approach is generally applicable and provides an important parameter of chromatin organisation that so far had been missing.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial genus Staphylococcus comprises diverse species with most being described as colonizers of human and animal skin. A relational analysis of features that discriminate its species and contribute to niche adaptation and survival remains to be fully described. In this study, an interspecies, whole-genome comparative analysis of 21 Staphylococcus species was performed based on their orthologues. Three well-defined multi-species groups were identified: group A (including aureus/epidermidis); group B (including saprophyticus/xylosus) and group C (including pseudintermedius/delphini). The machine learning algorithm Random Forest was applied to identify variable orthologues that drive formation of the Staphylococcus species groups A-C. Orthologues driving staphylococcal infrageneric diversity comprised regulatory, metabolic and antimicrobial resistance proteins. Notably, the BraSR (NsaRS) two-component system (TCS) and its associated BraDE transporters that regulate antimicrobial resistance distinguish group A Staphylococcus species from others in the genus that lack the BraSR TCS. Divergence of BraSR and GraSR antimicrobial peptide survival TCS and their associated transporters was observed across the staphylococci, likely reflecting niche specific evolution of these TCS/transporters and their specificities for AMPs. Experimental evolution, with selection for resistance to the lantibiotic nisin, revealed multiple routes to resistance and differences in the selection outcomes of the BraSR- positive species S. hominis and S. aureus. Selection supported a role for GraSR in nisin survival responses of the BraSR-negative group B species S. saprophyticus. Our study reveals diversification of antimicrobial-sensing TCS across the staphylococci and hints at differential relationships between GraSR and BraSR in those species positive for both TCS.\\n\\nImportanceThe genus Staphylococcus includes species that are commensals and opportunist pathogens of humans and animals. Identifying the features that discriminate species of staphylococci is relevant to understanding niche selection and the structure of their microbiomes. Moreover, the determinants that structure the community are relevant for strategies to modify the frequency of individual species associated with dysbiosis and disease. In this study, we identify orthologous proteins that discriminate genomes of staphylococci. In particular, species restriction of a major antimicrobial survival system, BraSR (NsaRS), to a group of staphylococci dominated by those that can colonize human skin. The diversity of antimicrobial sensing loci was revealed by comparative analysis and experimental evolution with selection for nisin resistance identified the potential for variation in antimicrobial sensing in BraRS-encoding staphylococci. This study provides insights into staphylococcal species diversity.",

The modified dilution method is the most commonly utilised empirical approach to estimate virus-induced killing rates of phytoplankton. The lysis rate estimates of the modified dilution method are based on models of virus-host interactions involving only a single virus and a single host population. Here, using modelling approaches, we examine the robustness of the modified dilution method in multi-strain, complex communities. We assume that strains differ in their life history traits, including growth rates (of hosts) and lysis rates (by viruses). We show that trait differences affect resulting experimental dynamics such that lysis rates measured using the modified dilution method may be driven by the fastest replicating strains; which are not necessarily the most abundant in situ.

We studied the impact on the structure and expression of host chromatin by the human retrovirus HTLV-1. We show that HTLV-1 disrupts host chromatin structure by forming loops between the provirus and the host genome; certain loops depend on the critical chromatin architectural protein CTCF, which we recently showed binds to the HTLV-1 provirus. Finally, we show that the provirus causes two distinct patterns of abnormal transcription of the host genome in cis: bidirectional transcription in the host genome immediately flanking the provirus, and clone-specific transcription in cis at non-contiguous loci up to >300 kb from the integration site. We conclude that HTLV-1 causes insertional mutagenesis up to the megabase range in the host genome in >104 persistently-maintained HTLV-1+ T-cell clones in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The formation of inosine at the wobble position of eukaryotic tRNAs is an essential modification catalyzed by the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex. In humans, a valine to methionine mutation (V144M) in ADAT3 that originated [~]1,600 years ago is the most common cause of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability (ID) in Arabia. Here, we show that ADAT3-V144M exhibits perturbations in subcellular localization and has increased propensity to form aggregates associated with cytoplasmic chaperonins. While ADAT2 co-expression can suppress the aggregation of ADAT3-V144M, the ADAT2/3 complexes assembled with ADAT3-V144M exhibit defects in adenosine deaminase activity. Moreover, extracts from cell lines derived from ID-affected individuals expressing only ADAT3-V144M display a reduction in tRNA deaminase activity. Notably, we find that the same cell lines from ID-affected individuals exhibit decreased wobble inosine in certain tRNAs. These results identify a role for ADAT2-dependent localization and folding of ADAT3 in wobble inosine modification that is crucial for the developing human brain.",

    "abstract": "The striatum is thought to play a central role in action selection and reinforcement, and optogenetic experiments suggest differential roles for direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs). However, the encoding of value-related information in dMSNs and iMSNs during adaptive decision-making is not well understood. We trained mice on a dynamic foraging task where they had to learn the value of different options based on their recent history of choices and outcomes. Single-cell calcium imaging in dorsomedial striatum revealed that dMSNs and iMSNs were oppositely modulated by the updated value of the different options. Additionally, we found that iMSNs were more active as animals slowed between trials, likely reflecting ongoing changes in motivational state. Together, our results demonstrate that co-activation of dMSNs and iMSNs during action initiation does not simply encode action identity, but instead reflects pathway-specific encoding of movement, motivation, and value information necessary for adaptive decision-making.",

This enables us to integrate our knowledge of what was said previously, in order to interpret the current dialogue. Here, we selectively manipulated knowledge about the narrative content of dialogues between two people, presented in short videos. The videos were clips taken from television situation comedies and the speech in the first-half of the clip could either be presented normally (high context) or spectrally rotated in order to render it unintelligible (low context). Knowledge of the preceding narrative boosted memory for the following dialogues as well as increased the inter-subject semantic similarity of recalled descriptions of the dialogues. Sharing knowledge of the preceding narrative across participants had two effects on fMRI markers of neural processing: (1) it strengthened temporal inter-subject correlations in regions including the left angular (AG) and inferior frontal gyri (IFG), and (2) it increased spatial inter-subject pattern similarity in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATL). We argue that these brain regions, which are known to be involved in semantic processing, support the activation and integration of prior knowledge, which helps people to better understand and remember dialogues as they unfold.",

Subject-specificity of SC-FC fit is achieved only for one of the six datasets, the multi-modal Glasser HCP parcellated dataset.

    "abstract": "It has been argued that the brain is a prediction machine that continuously learns how to make better predictions about the stimuli received from the external environment. It builds a model of the world around us and uses this model to infer the external stimulus. Predictive coding has been proposed as a mechanism through which the brain might be able to build such a model of the external environment. However, it is not clear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain while complying with the architectural constraints imposed by the brain. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training. Despite the novel features of these objects the model is able to infer the latent representations for them. Furthermore, the reconstructions of the original images obtained from these latent representations preserve the important details of these objects.",

    "abstract": "The brain combines sounds from the two ears, but what is the algorithm used to achieve this summation of signals? Here we combine psychophysical amplitude modulation discrimination and steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) data to investigate the architecture of binaural combination for amplitude-modulated tones. Discrimination thresholds followed a  dipper shaped function of pedestal modulation depth, and were consistently lower for binaural than monaural presentation of modulated tones. The EEG responses were greater for binaural than monaural presentation of modulated tones, and when a masker was presented to one ear, it produced only weak suppression of the response to a signal presented to the other ear. Both data sets were well-fit by a computational model originally derived for visual signal combination, but with suppression between the two channels (ears) being much weaker than in binocular vision. We suggest that the distinct ecological constraints on vision and hearing can explain this difference, if it is assumed that the brain avoids over-representing sensory signals originating from a single object. These findings position our understanding of binaural summation in a broader context of work on sensory signal combination in the brain, and delineate the similarities and differences between vision and hearing.",

We test the effect of tFUS on 7T BOLD fMRI signals from individual finger representations in the human primary motor cortex (M1) and connected cortical motor regions. Participants (N = 5) performed a cued finger tapping task in a 7T MRI scanner with their thumb, index, and middle fingers to produce a BOLD signal for individual M1 finger representations during either tFUS or sham neuromodulation to the thumb representation.\\n\\nResultsResults demonstrated a statistically significant increase in activation volume of the M1 thumb representation for the tFUS condition as compared to sham. No differences in percent BOLD changes were found. This effect was spatially confined as the index and middle finger M1 finger representations did not show similar significant changes in either percent change or activation volume. No effects were seen during tFUS to M1 in the supplementary motor area (SMA) or the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd).\\n\\nConclusionsSingle element tFUS can be paired with high field MRI that does not induce significant artifact. tFUS increases activation volumes of the targeted finger representation that is spatially restricted within M1 but does not extend to functionally connected motor regions.",

This advances our previous work showing that KMO blockade protects against acute lung injury and AKI in experimental multiple organ failure caused by acute pancreatitis. We show that KMO is highly expressed in the kidney and exerts major metabolic control over the biologically-active kynurenine metabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine, kynurenic acid and downstream metabolites. In experimental AKI induced by unilateral kidney IRI, Kmonull mice had preserved renal function, reduced renal tubular cell injury, and fewer infiltrating neutrophils compared to wild-type (Kmowt) control mice. Together, these data confirm that flux through KMO contributes to AKI after IRI, and supports the rationale for KMO inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to protect against AKI during critical illness.",

These approximations capture in a simple way the stochasticity of gene expression and the propagation of expression noise in networks and circuits. By using partial omega expansions, piecewise deterministic approximations can be formally derived from the more commonly used Markov pure jump processes (chemical master equation). We are interested in time dependent multivariate distributions that describe the stochastic dynamics of the gene networks. This problem is difficult even in the simplified framework of piecewise-determinisitic processes. We consider three methods to compute these distributions: the direct Monte-Carlo, the numerical integration of the Liouville-master equation and the push-forward method. This approach is applied to multivariate fluctuations of gene expression, generated by gene circuits. We find that stochastic fluctuations of the proteome and much less those of the transcriptome can discriminate between various circuit topologies.",

Nematode control often involves the use of nematicides, but many of them including non-selective fumigants have been phased out, particularly due to ecotoxicological concerns. Thus new control strategies are urgently needed. Spirotetramat (SPT) is used as phloem-moble systemic insecticide targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) of pest insects and mites upon foliar application. Our studies revealed that SPT known to be activated in planta to SPT-enol acts as a developmental inhibitor of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii. Exposure to SPT-enol leads to larval arrest and disruption of the life cycle. Furthermore, SPT-enol inhibits nematode ACC activity, affects storage lipids, fatty acid composition and disrupts surface coat synthesis. Silencing of H. schachtii ACC by RNAi induced similar phenotypes and thus mimics the effects of SPT-enol, supporting the conclusion that SPT-enol acts on nematodes by inhibiting ACC. Our studies demonstrated that the inhibition of de novo lipid biosynthesis by interfering with nematode ACC is a new nematicidal mode of action addressed by spirotetramat, a well-known systemic insecticide for sucking pest control.",

Among the most important factors governing the distributions and the coexistence of species are the spatiotemporal changes occurring in the microhabitat heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the heterogeneity of microhabitats and how they have an effect in the spatial segregation of two species of small mammals (i. e., Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis), which coexist in a temperate, mixed forest. We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.",

    "abstract": "More than a decade of DNA barcoding encompassing about five million specimens covering 100,000 animal species supports the generalization that mitochondrial DNA clusters largely overlap with species as defined by domain experts. Most barcode clustering reflects synonymous substitutions. What evolutionary mechanisms account for synonymous clusters being largely coincident with species? The answer depends on whether variants are phenotypically neutral. To the degree that variants are selectable, purifying selection limits variation within species and neighboring species may have distinct adaptive peaks. Phenotypically neutral variants are only subject to demographic processes--drift, lineage sorting, genetic hitchhiking, and bottlenecks. The evolution of modern humans has been studied from several disciplines with detail unique among animal species. Mitochondrial barcodes provide a commensurable way to compare modern humans to other animal species. Barcode variation in the modern human population is quantitatively similar to that within other animal species. Several convergent lines of evidence show that mitochondrial diversity in modern humans follows from sequence uniformity followed by the accumulation of largely neutral diversity during a population expansion that began approximately 100,000 years ago. A straightforward hypothesis is that the extant populations of almost all animal species have arrived at a similar result consequent to a similar process of expansion from mitochondrial uniformity within the last one to several hundred thousand years.",

    "abstract": "The degradation of epigenetic control with age is associated with progressive diseases of ageing, including cancers, immunodeficiency and diabetes. Reduced caloric intake slows the effects of aging and age-related diseases, a process likely to be mediated by the impact of caloric restriction on epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation. We used whole genome bisulphite sequencing to study how DNA methylation patterns change with diet in a small invertebrate, the crustacean Daphnia magna. Daphnia show the classic response of longer life under CR, and they reproduce clonally, which permits the study of epigenetic changes in the absence of genetic variation. Global CpG methylation was 0.7-0.9%, and there was no difference in overall methylation levels between normal and calorie restricted replicates. However, 453 regions were differentially methylated (DMRs) between the normally fed and calorie restricted (CR) replicates. Of these 61% were hypomethylated in the CR group, and 39% were hypermethylated in the CR group. Gene Ontogeny (GO) term enrichment of hyper and hypo-methylated genes showed significant over- and under-representation in three molecular function terms and four biological process GO terms. Notable among these were kinase and phosphorylation activity, which have a well-known functional link to cancers.",

    "abstract": "T cell search behavior is dictated by their need to encounter their specific antigen to eliminate target cells. However, mechanisms controlling effector T cell motility are highly tissue-dependent. Specifically, how diabetogenic T cells encounter their target beta cells in dispersed islets throughout the pancreas during autoimmune diabetes remains unclear. Using intra-vital 2-photon microscopy in a mouse model of diabetes, we found that CXCR3 chemokine downregulated CD8+ T cell motility specifically within islets, promoting effector cell confinement to their target sites. In contrast, T cell velocity and directionality in the exocrine tissue were enhanced along blood vessels and extra-cellular matrix fibers. This guided migration implicated integrin-dependent interactions, since integrin blockade impaired exocrine T cell motility. In addition, integrin {beta}1 blockade decreased CD4+ T cell effector phenotype specifically in the pancreas. Thus, we unveil an important role for integrins in the pancreas during autoimmune diabetes that may have important implications for the design of new therapies.",

Automatic processes regulating exercise behaviors may partly explain this paradox. Yet, these processes have only been investigated with behavioral paradigms based on reaction times. Here, using electroencephalography, we investigated the cortical activity underlying automatic approach and avoidance tendencies toward stimuli depicting physical activity and sedentary behaviors in 29 young adults who were physically active (n=14) or physically inactive but with the intention of becoming physically active (n=15). Behavioral results showed faster reactions when approaching physical activity compared to sedentary behaviors and when avoiding sedentary behaviors compared to physical activity. These faster reactions were more pronounced in physically active individuals and were associated with changes during sensory integration (earlier onset latency and larger positive deflection of the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials) but not during motor preparation (no effect on the response-locked lateralized readiness potentials). Faster reactions when avoiding sedentary behaviors compared to physical activity were also associated with higher conflict monitoring (larger early and late N1 event-related potentials) and higher inhibition (larger N2 event-related potentials), irrespective of the usual level of physical activity. These results suggest that additional cortical resources were required to counteract an attraction to sedentary behaviors. Data and Materials [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1169140].",

    "abstract": "Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is fundamental for maintaining our health and well-being, and SWS is typically reduced in stress-related sleep disturbances and age-related sleep disorders. We have previously reported that exposure to hypnotic suggestions before sleep effectively increases the duration of SWS during a midday nap in younger and older women suggestible for hypnosis.\\n\\nHowever, it remains unclear whether this beneficial effect of hypnosis on SWS can be generalized to night-time sleep and men. Therefore, we tested the effect of the hypnotic suggestions on SWS across an 8 hours night-time sleeping interval in 43 healthy young French-speaking subjects (19 males) of high and low suggestibility. In accordance with our previous results, listening to hypnotic suggestions before sleep increased the amount of SWS in highly suggestible subjects significantly by 13 min compared to a control condition in both genders. Particularly in the first hour, slow-wave activity was significantly increased after hypnosis as compared to the control night in high suggestible. The hypnosis-induced benefits on objective sleep parameters were also reflected in increased subjective sleep quality ratings. Our results demonstrate that hypnotic suggestions are an effective tool to deepen sleep and improve sleep quality also across a whole night of sleep in young healthy men and women. Our findings provide an important basis for the examination and potential application of hypnosis to improve deep sleep in populations with sleep disturbances.",

To better understand how spatial integration is dynamically coordinated across layers we recorded single- and multi-unit activity and local field potentials across V1 layers of awake mice, and used dynamic Bayesian model comparisons to identify when laminar activity and inter-laminar functional interactions showed surround suppression, the hallmark of spatial integration. We found that surround suppression is strongest in layer 3 (L3) and L4 activity, showing rapidly sharpening receptive fields and increasing suppression strength. Importantly, we also found that specific directed functional connections were strongest for intermediate stimulus sizes and suppressed for larger ones, particularly for the L3->L5 and L3->L1 connections. Taken together, the results shed light on the different functional roles of cortical layers in spatial integration and show how L3 dynamically coordinates activity across a cortical column depending on spatial context.",

This neural shortcut has been demonstrated in animals but has rarely been shown in the human brain. Importantly, it remains unclear whether such a pathway might influence neural activity and behaviour. We conducted a multimodal neuroimaging study of 622 participants from the Human Connectome Project. We applied probabilistic tractography to diffusion-weighted images, reconstructing a subcortical pathway to the amygdala from the superior colliculus via the pulvinar. We then computationally modelled the flow of neural activity during a face-viewing task and found strong evidence for a functionally-afferent subcortical pathway. Critically, individuals with greater fibre density in this pathway also had stronger dynamic coupling and enhanced fearful face recognition. Our findings provide converging evidence for the recruitment of an afferent subcortical route to the amygdala in the human brain that facilitates fear recognition.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional correlations between two variables have limited implications for causality. We show here that in a homeostatic system with three or more inter-correlated variables, it is possible to make causal inferences from steady-state data. Every putative pathway between three variables makes a set of differential predictions that can be tested with steady state data. For example, among 3 variables, A, B and C, the coefficient of determination, [Formula] is predicted by the product of [Formula] and [Formula] for some pathways, but not for others. Residuals from a regression line are independent of residuals from another regression for some pathways, but positively or negatively correlated for certain other pathways. Different pathways therefore have different prediction signatures, which can be used to accept or reject plausible pathways. We apply these principles to test the classical pathway leading to a hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic insulin-resistant, or pre-diabetic state using four different sets of epidemiological data. Currently, a set of indices called HOMA-IR and HOMA-{beta} are used to represent insulin resistance and glucose-stimulated insulin response by {beta} cells respectively. Our analysis shows that if we assume the HOMA indices to be faithful indicators, the classical pathway must in turn, be rejected. Among the populations sampled, the classical pathway and faithfulness of the HOMA indices cannot be simultaneously true. The principles and tools described here can find wide application in inferring plausible regulatory mechanisms in homeostatic systems based on epidemiological data.",

    "abstract": "Significant sex differences are observed in colon cancer, and understanding these differences is essential to advance disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Males have a higher risk of developing colon cancer and a lower survival rate than women. However, the molecular features that drive these sex differences are poorly understood. We used both transcript-based and gene regulatory network methods to analyze RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for 445 patients with colon cancer. We compared gene expression between tumors in men and women and found no significant sex differences except for sex-chromosome genes. We then inferred patient-specific gene regulatory networks, and found significant regulatory differences between males and females, with drug and xenobiotics metabolism via cytochrome P450 pathways more strongly targeted in females. This finding was validated in a dataset that included 1,193 patients from five independent studies. While targeting of the drug metabolism pathway did not change the overall survival for males treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, females with greater targeting had an increase in 10-year overall survival probability, with 89% (95% CI: 78%-100%) survival compared to 61% (95% CI: 45%-82%) for women with lower targeting, respectively (p=0.034). Our network analysis uncovered patterns of transcriptional regulation that differentiate male and female colon cancer. Most importantly, targeting of the drug metabolism pathway was predictive of survival in women who received adjuvant chemotherapy. This network-based approach can be used to investigate the molecular features that drive sex differences in other cancers and complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Referenced abstractThe interaction between high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and the gut microbiome has a strong impact on the onset of insulin resistance (IR)1-3. In particular, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and dietary fats trigger low-grade inflammation4 through activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a process called metabolic endotoxemia5. However, little is known about how the microbiome can mitigate this process. Here, we investigate longitudinal physiological and metabotypical responses of C57BL/6 mice to HFD feeding. A series of in vivo experiments with choline supplementation, then blocking trimethylamine (TMA) production and administering TMA, demonstrate that this microbiome-associated metabolite decouples inflammation and IR from obesity in HFD. Through in vitro kinome screens and in silico molecular dynamics studies, we reveal TMA specifically inhibits Interleukin-1 Receptor-associated Kinase 4 (IRAK-4), a central kinase integrating signals from various TLRs and cytokine receptors. Consistent with this, genetic ablation and chemical inhibition of IRAK-4 result in similar metabolic and immune improvements in HFD. In summary, TMA appears as a key microbial effector inhibiting IRAK-4 and mediating metabolic and immune effects with benefits upon HFD. Thereby we highlight the critical contribution of the microbial signalling metabolome in homeostatic regulation of host disease and the emerging role of the kinome6 in microbial-mammalian chemical crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Summary:\\n\\nAneuploidy, the gain or loss of chromosomes, arises through problems in chromosome segregation during mitosis or meiosis and has been implicated in cancer and developmental abnormalities in humans [1]. Possible routes to aneuploidy include a compromised spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), cohesion defects, centrosome amplification, as well as improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments [2]. However, none of these established routes takes into account the intrinsic features of the kinetochore - the critical chromosomal interface with spindle microtubules. Kinetochore size and respective microtubule binding capacity varies between different animal and plant species [3-10], among different chromosomes from the same species (including humans) [3, 11-15], and in response to microtubule attachments throughout mitosis [16-18]. How kinetochore size impacts chromosome segregation remains unknown. Addressing this fundamental question in human cells is virtually impossible, because most of the 23 pairs of chromosomes cannot be morphologically distinguished, while detection of 2-3 fold differences in kinetochore size is limited by diffraction and cannot be resolved by conventional light microscopy in living cells. Here we used the unique cytological attributes of female Indian muntjac, the mammal with the lowest known chromosome number (n=3), to track individual chromosomes with distinct kinetochore sizes throughout mitosis. We found that chromosomes with larger kinetochores bi-orient more easily and are biased to congress to the equator in a motor-independent manner. However, they are also more prone to establish erroneous merotelic attachments and lag behind during anaphase. Thus, we uncovered an intrinsic kinetochore feature - size - as an important determinant of chromosome segregation fidelity.",
