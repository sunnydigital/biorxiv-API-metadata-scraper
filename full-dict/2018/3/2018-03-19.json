    "abstract": "FGIN-1-27 is an agonist at the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a cholesterol transporter that is associated with neurosteroidogenesis. This protein has been identified as a peripheral binding site for benzodiazepines; in anamniotes, however, a second TSPO isoform that is absent in amniotes has been implicated in erythropoiesis. Functional conservation of the central benzodiazepine-binding site located in the GABAA receptors has been demonstrated in anamniotes and amniotes alike; however, it was not previously demonstrated for TSPO. The present investigation explored the behavioral effects of FGIN-1-27 on an anxiety test in zebrafish (Danio rerio, Family: Cyprinide) and on a mixed anxiety/panic test on wall lizards (Tropidurus oreadicus, Family: Tropiduridae). Results showed that FGIN-1-27 reduced anxiety-like behavior in the zebrafish light/dark preference test similar to diazepam, but with fewer sedative effects. Similarly, FGIN-1-27 also reduced anxiety- and fear-like behaviors in the defense test battery in wall lizards, again producing fewer sedative-like effects than diazepam; the benzodiazepine was also unable to reduce fear-like behaviors in this species. These results A) underline the functional conservation of TSPO in defensive behavior in anamniotes; B) strengthen the proposal of using anamniote behavior as models in behavioral pharmacology; and C) suggest TSPO/neurosteroidogenesis as a target in treating anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Habits form a crucial component of behavior. In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that many immune diseases occur at different rates among people with schizophrenia compared to the general population. Here, we evaluated whether this phenotypic correlation between immune diseases and schizophrenia might be explained by shared genetic risk factors (genetic correlation). We used data from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia (N=35,476 cases and 46,839 controls) to compare the genetic architecture of schizophrenia to 19 immune diseases. First, we evaluated the association with schizophrenia of 581 variants previously reported to be associated with immune diseases at genome-wide significance. We identified three variants with pleiotropic effects, located in regions associated with both schizophrenia and immune disease. Our analyses provided the strongest evidence of pleiotropy at rs1734907 ([~]85kb upstream of EPHB4), a variant which was associated with increased risk of both Crohns disease (OR = 1.16, P = 1.67x10-13) and schizophrenia (OR = 1.07, P = 7.55x10-6). Next, we investigated genome-wide sharing of common variants between schizophrenia and immune diseases using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and cross-trait LD Score regression (LDSC). PRS revealed significant genetic overlap with schizophrenia for narcolepsy (p=4.1x10-4), primary biliary cirrhosis (p=1.4x10-8), psoriasis (p=3.6x10-5), systemic lupus erythematosus (p=2.2x10-8), and ulcerative colitis (p=4.3x10-4). Genetic correlations between these immune diseases and schizophrenia, estimated using LDSC, ranged from 0.10 to 0.18 and were consistent with the expected phenotypic correlation based on epidemiological data. We also observed suggestive evidence of sex-dependent genetic correlation between schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (interaction p=0.02), with genetic risk scores for multiple sclerosis associated with greater risk of schizophrenia among males but not females. Our findings suggest that shared genetic risk factors contribute to the epidemiological co-occurrence of schizophrenia and certain immune diseases, and suggest that in some cases this genetic correlation is sex-dependent.\n\nAuthor SummaryImmune diseases occur at different rates among patients with schizophrenia compared to the general population. While the reasons for this phenotypic correlation are unclear, shared genetic risk (genetic correlation) has been proposed as a contributing factor. Prior studies have estimated the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and a handful of immune diseases, with conflicting results. Here, we performed a comprehensive cross-disorder investigation of schizophrenia and 19 immune diseases. We identified three individual genetic variants associated with both schizophrenia and immune diseases, including a variant near EPHB4 - a gene whose protein product guides the migration of lymphocytes towards infected cells in the immune system and the migration of neuronal axons in the brain. We demonstrated significant genome-wide genetic correlation between schizophrenia and narcolepsy, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. Finally, we identified a potential sex-dependent pleiotropic effect between schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Our findings point to shared genetic risk for schizophrenia and at least a subset of immune diseases, which likely contributes to their epidemiological co-occurrence. These results raise the possibility that the same genetic variants may exert their effects on neurons or immune cells to influence the development of psychiatric and immune disorders, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Frameshift protein sequences encoded by alternative reading frames of coding genes have been considered meaningless, and frameshift mutations have been considered of little importance for the molecular evolution of coding genes and proteins. However, functional frameshifts have been found widely existing. It was puzzling how a frameshift protein kept its structure and functionality while its amino-acid sequence was changed substantially. Here we show that frame similarities between frameshifts and wild types are higher than random similarities and are defined at the genetic code, gene, and genome levels. In the standard genetic code, frameshift codon substitutions are more conservative than random substitutions. The frameshift tolerability of the standard genetic code ranks in the top 2.0-3.5% of alternative genetic codes, showing that the genetic code is nearly optimal for frameshift tolerance. Furthermore, frameshift-resistant codons (codon pairs) appear more frequently than expected in many genes and certain genomes, showing that the frameshift optimality is reflected not only in the genetic code but more importantly, in its allowance of further optimizing the frameshift tolerance of a particular gene or genome, which shed light on the role of frameshift mutations in molecular and genomic evolution.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms for repairing DNA damages and point mutations have been well understood but it remains unclear how a frameshift mutation is repaired. Here we report that frameshift reversion occurs in E. coli more frequently than expected and appears to be a targeted gene repair signaled by premature termination codons (PTCs), producing high-level variations in the repaired genes. Genome resequencing shows that the revertant genome is highly stable, and the single-molecule variations in the repaired genes are derived from RNA editing. A multi-omics analysis shows that the expression levels change greatly in most the DNA and RNA manipulating genes. DNA replication, transcription, RNA editing, RNA degradation, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination were upregulated in the frameshift or revertant, but the base excision repair was not. Moreover, genes and transposons in a duplicate region silenced in wild type E. coli were activated in the frameshift. Finally, we propose a nonsense-mediated gene revising (NMGR) model for frame repair, which also acts as a driving force for molecular evolution. In essence, nonsense mRNAs are recognized, edited, and transported to template the repair of the coding gene by RNA-directed DNA repair, nucleotide excision, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination. Thanks to NMGR, the mutation rate temporarily rises in a frameshift gene, bringing genetic diversity while repairing the frameshift mutation and accelerating the evolution process without a high mutation rate in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Thaumarchaea are ubiquitous in marine habitats where they participate in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Although metatranscriptomes suggest thaumarchaea are active microbes in marine waters, we understand little about how thaumarchaeal gene expression patterns relate to substrate utilization and activity. Here, we report the global transcriptional response of the marine ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeon  Candidatus Nitrosopelagicus brevis str. CN25 to ammonia limitation using RNA-Seq. We further describe the genome and transcriptome of Ca. N. brevis str. U25, a new strain capable of urea utilization. Ammonia limitation in CN25 resulted in reduced expression of transcripts coding for ammonia oxidation proteins, and increased expression of a gene coding an Hsp20-like chaperone. Despite significantly different transcript abundances across treatments, two ammonia monooxygenase subunits (amoAB), a nitrite reductase (nirK), and both ammonium transporter genes were always among the most abundant transcripts, regardless of growth state. Ca. N. brevis str. U25 cells expressed a urea transporter 139-fold more than the urease catalytic subunit ureC. Gene co-expression networks derived from culture transcriptomes and ten thaumarchaea-enriched metatranscriptomes revealed a high degree of correlated gene expression across disparate environmental conditions and identified a module of genes, including amoABC and nirK, that we hypothesize to represent the core ammonia oxidation machinery.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementDiscovering gene function in fastidious or uncultivated lineages remains one of the biggest challenges in environmental microbiology. Here, we use an approach that combines controlled laboratory experiments with in situ transcript abundance data from the environment to identify genes that share similar transcription patterns in marine ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaea. These findings demonstrate how transcriptomes from microbial cultures can be used together with complex environmental samples to identify suites of co-expressed genes that are otherwise enigmatic and provide new insights into the mechanism of ammonia oxidation. Our results add to the growing body of literature showing that relatively small changes in transcript abundance are linked to large changes in growth in organisms with reduced genomes, suggesting they have limited capacity for metabolic regulation or that they rely on mechanisms other than transcriptional regulation to deal with a fluctuating environment.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100048). For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) are expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favour individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Here we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge by measuring survival, through mark recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach, as a function of the plasticity of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioural thermal preference and the thermal sensitivity of metabolism in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog Pleurodema thaul. Overall, our results indicate that thermal acclimation in this population is not being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival decreased in individuals with less tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated (probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year) and increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were non-significant.",

    "abstract": "The human reference genome serves as the foundation for genomics by providing a scaffold for alignment of sequencing reads, but currently only reflects a single consensus haplotype, which impairs read alignment and downstream analysis accuracy. Reference genome structures incorporating known genetic variation have been shown to improve the accuracy of genomic analyses, but have so far remained computationally prohibitive for routine large-scale use. Here we present a graph genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million indels. Our Graph Genome Pipeline requires 6.5 hours to process a 30x coverage WGS sample on a system with 36 CPU cores compared with 11 hours required by the GATK Best Practices pipeline. Using complementary benchmarking experiments based on real and simulated data, we show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, or about 20,000 additional variants being detected per sample, while variant calling specificity is unaffected. Structural variations (SVs) incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is a significant advance towards fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses.",

The modulation effect was localized to the prefrontal cortices, the globus pallidus, and an interoceptive network including the right anterior insula (RAI) and anterior cingulate cortex (RACC). Importantly, our Granger causality analysis provides the first evidence for increased causal flow of heartbeat information from the RAI to the RACC during sad face perception.

Zebrafish has recently gained wide attention as a behavioral model to study the neurobehavioral effects of acute and chronic alcohol use, including withdrawal. The literature, however, is very contradictory on findings regarding withdrawal effects, with some studies reporting increased anxiety, while others report no effect. A meta-analytic approach was taken to find the sources of this heterogeneity, and ethanol concentration during exposure and exposure duration were found to be the main sources of variation. A conceptual replication was also made using continuous exposure for 16 days in waterborne ethanol (0.5%) and assessing anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark test after 60 min withdrawal. Withdrawal was shown to reduce preference for darkness, consistent with decreased anxiety, but to increase risk assessment, consistent with increased anxiety. Animals were also subjected to the withdrawal protocol and injected with pilocarpine in a sub-convulsive dose to assess susceptibility to epileptic seizure-like behavior. The protocol was sufficient to increase susceptibility to epileptic seizure-like behavior in animals exposed to ethanol. Finally, withdrawal also decreased catalase activity in the brain, but not in the head kidney, suggesting mechanisms associated with the behavioral effects of ethanol withdrawal.",

However, because linkage equilibrium implicates a broad region surrounding each identified locus, the causal genes often remain unknown. This problem is especially pronounced in non-human, non-model species where functional annotations are sparse and there is frequently little information available for prioritizing candidate genes.\\n\\nResultsTo address this issue, we developed a computational approach called Camoco (Co-Analysis of Molecular Components) that systematically integrates loci identified by GWAS with gene co-expression networks to prioritize putative causal genes. We applied Camoco to prioritize candidate genes from a large-scale GWAS examining the accumulation of 17 different elements in maize seeds. Camoco identified statistically significant subnetworks for the majority of traits examined, producing a prioritized list of high-confidence causal genes for several agronomically important maize traits. Two candidate genes identified by our approach were validated through analysis of mutant phenotypes. Strikingly, we observed a strong dependence in the performance of our approach on the type of co-expression network used: expression variation across genetically diverse individuals in a relevant tissue context (in our case, maize roots) outperformed other alternatives.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates that co-expression networks can provide a powerful basis for prioritizing candidate causal genes from GWAS loci, but suggests that the success of such strategies can highly depend on the gene expression data context. Both the Camoco software and the lessons on integrating GWAS data with co-expression networks generalize to species beyond maize.",

    "abstract": "PREMISE OF THE STUDYA period of allopatry is widely believed to be essential for the evolution of reproductive isolation. However, strict allopatry may be difficult to achieve in some cosmopolitan, spore-dispersed groups, like mosses. Here we examine the genetic and genome size diversity in Mediterranean populations of the moss Ceratodon purpureus s.l. to evaluate the role of allopatry and ploidy change in population divergence.\\n\\nMETHODSWe sampled populations of the genus Ceratodon from mountainous areas and lowlands of the Mediterranean region, and from western and central Europe. We performed phylogenetic and coalescent analyses on sequences from five nuclear introns and a chloroplast locus to reconstruct their evolutionary history. We also estimated the genome size using flow cytometry, employing propidium iodide, and determined their sex using a sex-linked PCR marker.\\n\\nKEY RESULTSTwo well differentiated clades were resolved, discriminating two homogeneous groups: the widespread C. purpureus and a local group mostly restricted to the mountains in southern Spain. The latter also possessed a genome size 25% larger than the widespread C. purpureus, and the samples of this group consist entirely of females. We also found hybrids, and some of them had a genome size equivalent to the sum of the C. purpureus and Spanish genome, suggesting that they arose by allopolyploidy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that a new species of Ceratodon arose via peripatric speciation, potentially involving a genome size change and a strong female-biased sex ratio. The new species has hybridized in the past with C. purpureus.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has sought to quantify head impact exposure using wearable kinematic sensors. However, many sensors suffer from poor accuracy in estimating impact kinematics and count, motivating the need for additional independent impact exposure quantification for comparison. Here, we equipped seven collegiate American football players with instrumented mouthguards, and video recorded practices and games to compare video-based and sensor-based exposure rates and impact location distributions. Over 50 player-hours, we identified 271 helmet contact periods in video, while the instrumented mouthguard sensor recorded 2,032 discrete head impacts. Matching video and mouthguard real-time stamps yielded 193 video-identified helmet contact periods and 217 sensor-recorded impacts. To compare impact locations, we binned matched impacts into frontal, rear, side, oblique, and top locations based on video observations and sensor kinematics. While both video-based and sensor-based methods found similar location distributions, our best method utilizing integrated linear and angular position only correctly predicted 81 of 217 impacts. Finally, based on the activity timeline from video assessment, we also developed a new exposure metric unique to American football quantifying number of cross-verified sensor impacts per player-play. We found significantly higher exposure during games (0.35, 95% CI: 0.29-0.42) than practices (0.20, 95% CI: 0.17-0.23) (p<0.05). In the traditional impacts per player-hour metric, we observed higher exposure during practices (4.7) than games (3.7) due to increased player activity in practices. Thus, our exposure metric accounts for variability in on-field participation. While both video-based and sensor-based exposure datasets have limitations, they can complement one another to provide more confidence in exposure statistics.",

Aberrations from the reward-maximizing solutions, either across subjects or across different sessions for the same subject, are often interpreted as reflecting poor learning or physical limitations. Here we show that such aberrations may instead reflect the involvement of additional satisficing and heuristic principles. For an asymmetric-reward perceptual decision-making task, three monkeys produced adaptive biases in response to changes in reward asymmetries and perceptual sensitivity. Their choices and response times were consistent with a normative accumulate-to-bound process. However, their context-dependent adjustments to this process deviated slightly but systematically from the reward-maximizing solutions. These adjustments were instead consistent with a rational process to find satisficing solutions based on the gradient of each monkeys reward-rate function.

    "abstract": "During the plant life cycle, diverse signalling inputs are continuously integrated and engage specific genetic programs depending on the cellular or developmental context. Consistent with an important role in this process, HECATE (HEC) bHLH transcription factors display diverse functions, from photomorphogenesis to the control of shoot meristem dynamics and gynoecium patterning. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their functional versatility and the deployment of specific HEC sub-programs still remain elusive.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we systematically identified proteins with the capacity to interact with HEC1, the best characterized member of the family, and integrated this information with our data set of direct HEC1 target genes. The resulting core genetic modules were consistent with specific developmental functions of HEC1, including its described activities in light signalling, gynoecium development and auxin homeostasis. Importantly, we found that in addition, HEC genes play a role in the modulation of flowering time and uncovered that their role in gynoecium development may involve the direct transcriptional regulation of NGATHA1 (NGA1) and NGA2 genes. NGA factors were previously shown to contribute to fruit development, but our data now show that they also modulate stem cell homeostasis in the SAM.\\n\\nTaken together, our results suggest a molecular network underlying the functional versatility of HEC transcription factors. Our analyses have not only allowed us to identify relevant target genes controlling shoot stem cell activity and a so far undescribed biological function of HEC1, but also provide a rich resource for the mechanistic elucidation of further context dependent HEC activities.\\n\\nSignificance statementAlthough many transcription factors display diverse regulatory functions during plant development, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains poor. Here, by reconstructing the regulatory modules orchestrated by the bHLH transcription factor HECATE1 (HEC1), we defined its regulatory signatures and delineated a regulatory network that provides a molecular basis for its functional versatility. In addition, we uncovered a function for HEC genes in modulating flowering time and further identified downstream signalling components balancing shoot stem cell activity.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing studies applied to large populations or biobanks with extensive phenotyping raise new analytic challenges. The need to consider many variants at a locus or group of genes simultaneously and the potential to study many correlated phenotypes with shared genetic architecture provide opportunities for discovery and inference that are not addressed by the traditional one variant, one phenotype association study. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model comparison approach that we refer to as MRP (Multiple Rare-variants and Phenotypes) for rare-variant association studies that considers correlation, scale, and direction of genetic effects across a group of genetic variants, phenotypes, and studies. The approach requires only summary statistic data. To demonstrate the efficacy of MRP, we apply our method to exome sequencing data (N = 184,698) across 2,019 traits from the UK Biobank, aggregating signals in genes. MRP demonstrates an ability to recover previously-verified signals such as associations between PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol levels. We additionally find MRP effective in conducting meta-analyses in exome data. Notable non-biomarker findings include associations between MC1R and red hair color and skin color, IL17RA and monocyte count, IQGAP2 and mean platelet volume, and JAK2 and platelet count and crit (mass). Finally, we apply MRP in a multi-phenotype setting; after clustering the 35 biomarker phenotypes based on genetic correlation estimates into four clusters, we find that joint analysis of these phenotypes results in substantial power gains for gene-trait associations, such as in TNFRSF13B in one of the clusters containing diabetes and lipid-related traits. Overall, we show that the MRP model comparison approach is able to improve upon useful features from widely-used meta-analysis approaches for rare variant association analyses and prioritize protective modifiers of disease risk.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThreat detection is essential for protecting individuals from precarious situations. Early studies suggested a network of amygdala, limbic regions and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) involved in fear processing. Excitability regulation in the dmPFC might be crucial for physiological fear processing, while an abnormal excitability pattern could lead to mental illness. Non-invasive paradigms to measure excitability regulation during fear processing in humans are missing.\\n\\nMethodsWe adapted an experimental approach of excitability characterization using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC during an instructed fear paradigm to dynamically dissect its role in fear processing. Event-related (ERP) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) were analyzed to trace dmPFC excitability in healthy young volunteers (n = 40, age = 27.6 {+/-} 5.7 years, 22 females). Moreover, we linked the excitability regulation patterns to individual structural MRI-derived properties of gray matter microstructural integrity of the fear network.\\n\\nResultsAn increased cortical excitability was demonstrated in the threat (T) condition in comparison to no-threat (NT) as showed by increased amplitude of evoked potentials. Furthermore, TMS over the dmPFC induced markedly increased evoked responses during T condition in relation to NT. Moreover, we found that the structural integrity of the dmPFC and the amygdala predict excitability regulation patterns as measured by ERP and TEP during fear processing.\\n\\nConclusionsWe describe the dynamic range of excitability regulation in dmPFC during fear processing. The applied paradigm can be used to non-invasively track response abnormalities to threat stimuli in healthy subjects or patients with mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "In T cells, T cell receptor (TCR) signalling initiates downstream transcriptional mechanisms for T cell activation and differentiation. Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Treg) require TCR signals for their suppressive function and maintenance in the periphery. It is, however, unclear how TCR signalling controls the transcriptional programme of Treg. Since most of studies identified the transcriptional features of Treg in comparison to naive T cells, the relationship between Treg and non-naive T cells including memory-phenotype T cells (Tmem) and effector T cells (Teff) is not well understood. Here we dissect the transcriptomes of various T cell subsets from independent datasets using the multidimensional analysis method Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). We show that resting Treg share gene modules for activation with Tmem and Teff. Importantly, Tmem activate the distinct transcriptional modules for T cell activation, which are uniquely repressed in Treg. The activation signature of Treg is dependent on TCR signals, and is more actively operating in activated Treg. Furthermore, by analysing single cell RNA-seq data from tumour-infiltrating T cells, we revealed that FOXP3 expression occurs predominantly in activated T cells. Moreover, we identified FOXP3-driven and T follicular helper (Tfh)-like differentiation pathways in tumour microenvironments, and their bifurcation point, which is enriched with recently activated T cells. Collectively, our study reveals the activation mechanisms downstream of TCR signals for the bifurcation of Treg and Teff differentiation and their maturation processes.",

Appling empirical dynamic modelling that acknowledges nonlinear dynamics on nine subpopulations of tiger mosquitos from three neighbouring reef islets of the Raiatea atoll, we identified temperature, precipitation, dew point, air pressure, and mean tide level as causal environmental variables. Interestingly, responses of subpopulations in close proximity (100-500 m) differed with respect to their causal environmental variables and the time delay of effect, highlighting complexity in mosquito-environment causality network. Moreover, we demonstrated how to explore the effects of changing environmental variables on number and strength of mosquito outbreaks, providing a new framework for pest control and disease vector ecology.",

This has largely been ascribed to long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses onto pyramidal neurons, while a contribution from intracortical inhibition has been controversial. Here we used optogenetics to probe feedforward thalamocortical and feedback intracortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratios following brief MD. While thalamocortical inputs onto pyramidal neurons were depressed, there was stronger depression onto PV+ interneurons, which shifted the thalamocortical-evoked E-I ratio toward excitation. In contrast, feedback intracortical E-I ratio was shifted toward inhibition, and a computational model of layer 4 demonstrated that these opposing shifts produced an overall suppression of layer 4 excitability. Thus, feedforward and feedback E-I ratios onto the same postsynaptic target can be independently regulated by visual experience, and enhanced feedback inhibition is the primary driving force behind loss of visual responsiveness.",

Mean-variance QTL mapping is based on the double generalized linear model, which elaborates on the standard linear model by incorporating not only a linear model for the data itself, but also a linear model for the residual variance. Its potential for use in QTL mapping has been described previously, but it remains underutilized, with certain key advantages undemonstrated until now. In the first case study, we use mean-variance QTL mapping to reanalyze a reduced complexity intercross of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice examining circadian behavior and find a mean-controlling QTL for circadian wheel running activity that was not detected by traditional interval mapping. Mean-variance QTL mapping was more powerful than traditional interval mapping at the QTL because it accounted for the fact that mice homozygous for the C57BL/6N allele had less residual variance than the other mice. In the second case study, we reanalyze an intercross between C57BL/6J and C58/J mice examining anxiety-like behaviors, and identify a variance-controlling QTL for rearing behavior. This QTL was not identified in the original analysis because traditional interval mapping does not target variance QTL.",

The master tumor suppressor miRNA miR-34a was found to be toxic through such a G-rich 6mer seed suggesting that certain tumor suppressive miRNAs use a toxic 6mer seed to kill cancer cells. An analysis of all mature miRNAs suggests that most miRNAs evolved to avoid guanine at the 5' end of the 6mer seed sequence of the predominantly expressed arm.

    "abstract": "The plant immune system involves a large family of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) intracellular immune receptors. These immune receptors often function to directly or indirectly mediate the perception of specific pathogen effector proteins secreted into the cell. Activation of these immune receptors typically results in activation of the immune system and subsequent suppression of pathogen proliferation. Although many examples of NLR receptors are known, a mechanistic understanding of how receptor activation ultimately leads to an immune response is not well understood. A subset of the NLR proteins contain a TIR domain at their N terminus (TNL). One such TNL, the N gene, was previously shown to depend on a non-TIR NLR protein, N requirement gene 1 (NRG1) for immune function. We tested additional NLR proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana for dependency on NRG1. We found that two additional TIR-NLR proteins, Roq1 and RPP1, also require NRG1 but that two coiled-coil NLR proteins, Bs2 and Rps2, do not. This finding suggests that NRG1 may be a conserved component of TNL signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is an important target class of proteins for drug discovery, with over 27% of FDA-approved drugs targeting GPCRs. However, being a membrane protein, it is difficult to obtain the 3D crystal structures of GPCRs for virtual screening of ligands by molecular docking. Thus, we evaluated the virtual screening performance of homology models of human GPCRs with respect to the corresponding crystal structures. Among the 19 GPCRs involved in this study, we observed that 10 GPCRs have homology models that have better or comparable performance with respect to the corresponding X-ray structures, making homology models a viable choice for virtual screening. For a small subset of GPCRs, we also explored how certain methods like consensus enrichment and sidechain perturbation affect the utility of homology models in virtual screening, as well as the selectivity between agonists and antagonists. Most notably, consensus enrichment across multiple homology models often yields results comparable to the best performing model, suggesting that ligand candidates predicted with consensus scores from multiple models can be the optimal option in practical applications where the performance of each model cannot be estimated.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework to parameterise a mathematical model of cell invasion that describes how a population of melanoma cells invades into human skin tissue. Using simple experimental data extracted from complex experimental images, we estimate three model parameters:(i) the melanoma cell proliferation rate,{lambda} ; (ii) the melanoma cell diffusivity, D; and (iii){delta} , a constant that determines the rate that melanoma cells degrade the skin tissue. The Bayesian sequential learning frame-work involves a sequence of increasingly-sophisticated experimental data from:(i) a spatially uniform cell proliferation assay; (ii) a two-dimensional circular barrier assay; and, (iii) a three-dimensional invasion assay. The Bayesian sequential learning approach leads to well-defined parameter estimates. In contrast, taking a naive approach that attempts to estimate all parameters from a single set of images from the same experiment fails to produce meaningful results. Overall our approach to inference is simple-to-implement, computationally efficient, and well-suited for many cell biology phenomena that can be described by low dimensional continuum models using ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. We anticipate that this Bayesian sequential learning framework will be relevant in other biological contexts where it is challenging to extract detailed, quantitative biological measurements from experimental images and so we must rely on using relatively simple measurements from complex images.",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. The Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive coding, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to unify understandings of life and cognition within general mathematical frameworks derived from information theory, statistical physics and machine learning. Furthermore, it has been argued that one such proposal, active inference, combines both information and control theory and has its roots in cybernetics studies of the brain. The connections between information and control theory have been discussed since the 1950s by scientists like Shannon and Kalman and have recently risen to prominence in modern stochastic optimal control theory. How-ever, the implications of the confluence of these two theoretical frame-works for the biological sciences have been slow to emerge. Here we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, we need to consider how existing control theoretical approaches to biological systems relate to it. In this work we will focus on PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, one of the most common types of regulators employed in engineering and more recently used to explain behaviour in biological systems, e.g. chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae or robust adaptation in biochemical networks. Using active inference, we derive a probabilistic interpretation of PID controllers, showing how they can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation once we use only simple linear generative models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBisPin is a new multiprocess bisulfite-treated short DNA read mapper written in Python 2.7. It performs alignments using BFAST, leveraging its multithreading functionality and thorough hash-based indexing strategy. BisPin is feature rich and supports directional, nondirectional, PBAT, and hairpin construction strategies. BisPin approaches read mapping by converting the Cs to Ts and the Gs to As in both the reads and the reference genome. BisPin uses fast rescoring to disambiguate ambiguously aligned reads for a superior amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers. The performance of BisPin was evaluated on both real and simulated data in comparison to other read mappers.\\n\\nBFAST-Gap is a modified version of BFAST meant for Ion Torrent reads. It uses a parameterized logistic function to determine the weights of the gap open and extension penalties based on the homopolymer run length of the DNA read. This is because the Ion Torrent sequencing technology can overcall and undercall homopolymer runs. BisPin works with both BFAST-Gap and BFAST. BFAST-Gap is compatible with indexes built with BFAST. There are few mappers that specifically address Ion Torrent data. BFAST-Gap works with Illumina reads as well.\\n\\nResultsBisPin with BFAST consistently had a higher amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers on real data using a variety of construction strategies. Using a hairpin validation strategy, BisPin was superior using the maximum score, and it mapped 73% of reads correctly.\\n\\nBisPin with BFAST-Gap on Ion Torrent reads with a logistic gap open penalty function improved mapping accuracy with real and simulated data. On simulated bisulfite Ion Torrent data, the area under the curve was improved by approximately seven, and on one real data set, the uniquely mapped percent was improved by seven percent. BFAST-Gap performed better than TMAP on simulated regular Ion Torrent reads, and TMAP is designed for Ion Torrent reads. Other read mappers had worse performance.\\n\\nConclusionsBisPin and BFAST-Gap have consistently good accuracy with a variety of data. BisPin is feature-rich. This makes BisPin and BFAST-Gap useful additions to read mapping software.",

    "abstract": "DNase-seq and ATAC-seq are broadly used methods to assay open chromatin regions genome-wide. The single nucleotide resolution of DNase-seq has been further exploited to infer transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in regulatory regions via footprinting. Recent studies have demonstrated the sequence bias of DNase I and its adverse effects on footprinting efficiency. However, footprinting and the impact of sequence bias have not been extensively studied for ATAC-seq. Here, we undertake a systematic comparison of the two methods and show that a modification to the ATAC-seq protocol increases its yield and its agreement with DNase-seq data from the same cell line. We demonstrate that the two methods have distinct sequence biases and correct for these protocol-specific biases when performing footprinting. Despite differences in footprint shapes, the locations of the inferred footprints in ATAC-seq and DNase-seq are largely concordant. However, the protocol-specific sequence biases in conjunction with the sequence content of TFBSs impacts the discrimination of footprint from background, which leads to one method outperforming the other for some TFs. Finally, we address the depth required for reproducible identification of open chromatin regions and TF footprints.",

RNAi in non-bilaterians - sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians - appears to be more diverse than that of bilaterians, and includes structurally variable miR-NAs in sponges, an enormous number of piRNAs in cnidarians and the absence of miRNAs in ctenophores and placozoans.\\n\\nResultsHere we identify thousands of endo-siRNAs and piRNAs from the sponge Amphimedon queens-landica, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis using a computational approach that clusters mapped small RNA sequences and annotates each cluster based on the read length and relative abundance of the constituent reads. This approach was validated on 11 small RNA libraries in Drosophila melanogaster, demonstrating the successful annotation of RNAi associated loci with properties consistent with previous reports. In the non-bilaterians we uncover seven new miRNAs from Amphimedon and four from Nematostella as well as sub-populations of candidate cis-natural antisense transcript (cis-NAT) endo-siRNAs. In the ctenophore, the absence of miRNAs is confirmed and an abundance of endo-siRNAs is revealed. Analysis of putative piRNA structure suggests that conserved localised secondary structures in primary transcripts may be important for the production of mature piRNAs in Amphimedon and Nematostella, as is also the case for endo-siRNAs.\\n\\nConclusionTogether, these findings suggest that the last common ancestor of animals did not have the entrained RNAi system that typifies bilaterians. Instead it appears that bilaterians, cnidarians, ctenophores and sponges express unique repertoires and combinations of miRNAs, piRNAs and endo-siRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Spatial patterns are ubiquitous on the subcellular, cellular and tissue level, and can be studied using imaging techniques such as light and fluorescence microscopy. Imaging data provide quantitative information about biological systems, however, mechanisms causing spatial patterning often remain illusive. In recent years, spatio-temporal mathematical modelling helped to overcome this problem. Yet, outliers and structured noise limit modelling of whole imaging data, and models often consider spatial summary statistics. Here, we introduce an integrated data-driven modelling approach that can cope with measurement artefacts and whole imaging data. Our approach combines mechanistic models of the biological processes with robust statistical models of the measurement process. The parameters of the integrated model are calibrated using a maximum likelihood approach. We used this integrated modelling approach to study in vivo gradients of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21). CCL21 gradients guide dendritic cells and are important in the adaptive immune response. Using artificial data, we verified that the integrated modelling approach provides reliable parameter estimates in the presence of measurement noise and that bias and variance of these estimates are reduced compared to conventional approaches. The application to experimental data allowed the parameterisation and subsequent refinement of the model using additional mechanisms. Among others, model-based hypothesis testing predicted lymphatic vessel dependent concentration of heparan sulfate, the binding partner of CCL21. The selected model provided an accurate description of the experimental data and was partially validated using published data. Our findings demonstrate that integrated statistical modelling of whole imaging data is computationally feasible and can provide novel biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD) are characterized by an abnormally high phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau and truncation of its C-terminus. Tau hyperphosphorylation may result from the downregulation of phosphatases, especially protein phosphatase 2A. In an attempt to model and analyze these molecular events we treated SH-SY5Y cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. In addition to the low molecular weight tau, such treatment lead to the appearance of heat-stable protein species with apparent high molecular weight around 100 kDa, which were immunoreactive to tau antibodies against phosphorylated Ser202 and phosphorylated Ser396. Based on the observation that high molecular weight tau-immunoreactive proteins (HMW-TIP) correspond to the predicted size of two monomers of tau, one possibility is that HMW-TIP represent tau oligomers. The absence of HMW-TIP detection by anti-total tau antibodies used may be a consequence of epitope masking, or a combination of epitope masking and protein truncation. We noted the stability of HMW-TIP in the presence of strong denaturing agents, such as urea and guanidine, as well as upon partial dephosphorylation by the alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, as HMW-TIP did not dissociate the presence of {beta}-mercaptoethanol, it was also independent from disulfide bonds. Taken together, these data show that OA treatment of SH-SY5Y cells induces the appearance of HMW-TIP, which may represent tau oligomer or tau-crossreactive phospho-proteins. Our findings have implications for further studies of tau under the conditions of protein phosphatase downregulation.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiopathies, or biliary diseases, account for a significant proportion of adult and paediatric liver disease. In these pathologies, iterative cycles of damage and repair result in the development of a regenerative microenvironment surrounding the bile ducts, which orchestrates both epithelial proliferation and also biliary fibrosis. Ultimately, fibrosis at the cost of repair results in cholestasis and liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation. Whilst the fibrogenic mechanisms in hepatocellular disease have been widely studied, little is known about the processes that regulate biliary scarring. We sought to determine how the injured biliary epithelium communicates to adjacent stromal cells to regulate scar formation, and to identify therapeutically targetable pathways that could be inhibited to reduce biliary scarring, whilst maintaining the pro-regenerative stroma. Using human tissue, bile duct organoids and animal models of biliary disease, we show that non-canonical Wnt signalling is important in initiating biliary scarring. This process is driven by myeloid Wnt5a and acts through epithelial Vangl2, which is upstream of Jnk/cJun signalling. Activation of this pathway drives a pro-fibrotic signalling process which instructs portal fibroblasts to synthesise collagen. Finally, we determine that therapeutic Wnt ligand inhibition reduces biliary scarring, identifying non-canonical Wnt signalling as a novel target for anti-fibrotic therapy in cholestatic biliary disease.",

To develop a new toolset for manipulation of RNA, we first implemented a member of type VI CRISPR systems, Cas13a from Leptotrichia shahii (LshCas13a) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an important model organism employed by biologists to study key cellular mechanisms conserved from yeast to humans. While it was shown to knock down targeted endogenous genes transcripts, differently from previous studies in E. coli, no collateral cleavage of other non-specific RNA by activated Cas13a-crRNA complex was detected in fission yeast. Second, we engineered a RNA-editing system by tethering an inactive form of LshCas13a (dCas13) to the catalytic domain of human Adenosine Deaminase Act on RNA 2 (hADAR2d), which was shown to be programmable with crRNA to target messenger RNAs and precisely edit specific nucleotide residues. We optimized the system parameters using a dual-florescence reporter and demonstrated its utility in editing of randomly selected endogenous genes transcripts. Our engineered RNA-editing system enables a new toolset for transcriptomic manipulation that is widely applicable in basic genetic and biotechnological research.",

The Leptopilina genus has enormous value in the biological control of pests as well as in understanding several aspects of host-parasitoid biology. However, none of the members of Figitidae family has their genomes sequenced. In order to improve the understanding of the parasitoid wasps by generating genomic resources, we sequenced the whole genome of L. boulardi.\\n\\nFindingsHere, we report a high-quality genome of L. boulardi, assembled from 70Gb of Illumina reads and 10.5Gb of PacBio reads, forming a total coverage of 230X. The 375Mb draft genome has an N50 of 275Kb with 6315 scaffolds >500bp, and encompasses >95% complete BUSCOs.

    "abstract": "LD Score Regression (LDSC) has been widely applied to the results of genome-wide association studies. However, its estimates of SNP heritability are derived from an unrealistic model in which each SNP is expected to contribute equal heritability. As a consequence, LDSC tends to over-estimate confounding bias, under-estimate the total phenotypic variation explained by SNPs, and provide misleading estimates of the heritability enrichment of SNP categories. Therefore, we present SumHer, software for estimating SNP heritability from summary statistics using more realistic heritability models. After demonstrating its superiority over LDSC, we apply SumHer to the results of 24 large-scale association studies (average sample size 121 000). First we show that these studies have tended to substantially over-correct for confounding, and as a result the number of genome-wide significant loci has under-reported by about 20%. Next we estimate enrichment for 24 categories of SNPs defined by functional annotations. A previous study using LDSC reported that conserved regions were 13-fold enriched, and found a further twelve categories with above 2-fold enrichment. By contrast, our analysis using SumHer finds that conserved regions are only 1.6-fold (SD 0.06) enriched, and that no category has enrichment above 1.7-fold. SumHer provides an improved understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, which enables more efficient analysis of future genetic data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAvian keratin disorder (AKD) is an epizootic of debilitating beak deformities, first documented in black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in Alaska during the late 1990s. Similar deformities have now been recorded in dozens of species of birds across multiple continents. Despite this, the etiology of AKD has remained elusive, making it difficult to assess the impacts of this disease on wild populations. We previously identified an association between infection with a novel picornavirus, Poecivirus, and AKD in a small cohort of black-capped chickadees.\\n\\nMethodsTo test if the association between Poecivirus and AKD holds in a lager study population, we used targeted PCR followed by Sanger sequencing to screen 124 symptomatic and asymptomatic black-capped chickadees for Poecivirus infection. We further compared the efficacy of multiple non-terminal field sampling methods (buccal swabs, cloacal swabs, fecal samples, and blood samples) for Poecivirus screening. Finally, we used both in situ hybridization and a strand-specific expression assay to localize Poecivirus to beak tissue of AKD-positive individuals and to determine if virus is actively replicating in beak tissue.\\n\\nResultsPoecivirus was detected in 29/29 (100%) individuals with AKD, but only 9/95 (9.5%) asymptomatic individuals with apparently normal beaks (p < 0.0001). We found that cloacal swabs are the most sensitive of these sample types for detecting Poecivirus in birds with AKD, but that buccal swabs should be combined with cloacal swabs in evaluating the infection status of asymptomatic birds. Finally, we used both in situ hybridization and a strand-specific expression assay to localize Poecivirus to beak tissue of AKD-positive individuals and to provide evidence of active viral replication.\\n\\nConclusionThe data presented here show a strong, statistically significant relationship between Poecivirus infection and AKD, and provide evidence that Poecivirus is indeed an avian virus, infecting and actively replicating in beak tissue of AKD-affected BCCH. Taken together, these data corroborate and extend the evidence for a potential causal association between Poecivirus and AKD in the black-capped chickadee. Poecivirus continues to warrant further investigation as a candidate agent of AKD.",

    "abstract": "Microbial diversity in the environment is mainly concealed within the rare biosphere, which is arbitrarily defined as all species with <0.1% relative abundance. While dormancy explains a low-abundance state very well, the cellular mechanisms leading to rare but active microorganisms are not clear. We used environmental systems biology to genomically and metabolically characterize a cosmopolitan sulfate reducer that is of low abundance but highly active in peat soil, where it contributes to counterbalance methane emissions. We obtained a 98%-complete genome of this low-abundance species, Candidatus Desulfosporosinus infrequens, by metagenomics. To test for environmentally relevant metabolic activity of Ca. D. infrequens, anoxic peat soil microcosms were incubated under diverse in situ-like conditions for 36 days and analyzed by metatranscriptomics. Compared to the no-substrate control, transcriptional activity of Ca. D. infrequens increased 56- to 188-fold in incubations with sulfate and acetate, propionate, lactate, or butyrate, revealing a versatile substrate use. Cellular activation was due to a significant overexpression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and carbon-degradation pathways, but not of genes encoding DNA or cell replication. We show for the first time that a rare biosphere member transcribes metabolic pathways relevant for carbon and sulfur cycling over prolonged time periods while being growth-arrested in its lag phase.\\n\\nSignificanceThe microbial rare biosphere represents the largest pool of biodiversity on Earth and constitutes, in sum of all its members, a considerable part of a habitats biomass. Dormancy or starvation are typically used to explain a low-abundance state. We show that low-abundance microorganisms can be highly metabolically active while being growth-arrested over prolonged time periods. We show that this is true for microbial keystone species, such as a cosmopolitan but low-abundance sulfate reducer in wetlands that is involved in counterbalancing greenhouse gas emission. Our results challenge the central dogmas \\\"metabolic activity translates directly into growth\\\" as well as \\\"low abundance equals little ecosystem impact\\\" and provide an important step forward in understanding rare biosphere members relevant for ecosystem functions.",

As an alternative and complementary model, we previously proposed that, in general, soluble cellular macromolecules including chaperones with large excluded volume and surface charges exhibit the intrinsic chaperone activity to prevent aggregation of their connected polypeptides, irrespective of the connection types, and thus to aid productive protein folding. As a proof of concept, we here demonstrated that a model soluble protein with an inactive protease domain robustly exerted chaperone activity toward various proteins harboring a short protease-recognition tag of 7 residues in Escherichia coli. The chaperone activity of this protein was similar or even superior to that of representative E. coli chaperones in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro refolding experiments confirmed the in vivo results. Our findings revealed that a soluble protein exhibits the intrinsic chaperone activity, which is manifested, upon binding to aggregation-prone proteins. This study gives new insights into the ubiquitous chaperoning role of cellular macromolecules in protein-folding assistance and aggregation inhibition underlying the maintenance of protein solubility and proteostasis in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Antibody engineering is performed to improve therapeutic properties by directed evolution, usually by high-throughput screening of phage or yeast display libraries. Engineering antibodies in mammalian cells offers advantages associated with expression in their final therapeutic format (full-length glycosylated IgG), however, the inability to express large and diverse libraries severely limits their potential throughput. To address this limitation, we have developed homology-directed mutagenesis (HDM), a novel method which extends the concept of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). HDM leverages oligonucleotides with degenerate codons to generate site-directed mutagenesis libraries in mammalian cells. By improving HDM efficiency (>35-fold) and combining mammalian display screening with next-generation sequencing (NGS), we validated this approach can be used for key applications in antibody engineering at high-throughput: rational library construction, novel variant discovery, affinity maturation, and deep mutational scanning (DMS). We anticipate that HDM will be a valuable tool for engineering and optimizing antibodies in mammalian cells, and eventually enable directed evolution of other complex proteins and cellular therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPersistent atrial fibrillation (AF) has remained a challenging clinical problem. The mechanisms of persistent AF are still subject to debate. Both a single mother-rotor with fibrillatory conduction and multiple meandering spiral waves have been proposed to explain persistent AF. Previous frequency domain studies have reported the presence of dominant frequency (DF) gradient (a marker of single mother-rotor) in paroxysmal, but not persistent AF.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe performed temporally-dense high-resolution frequency domain analysis of 10-40 minutes segments of intracardiac signals recorded in 24 patients undergoing ablation of persistent AF. We observed two predominant patterns. The expected signature of the mother-rotor mechanism was observed in 38% of the patients. The frequency pattern in 54% consisted of two or more distinct frequency peaks with no obvious gradient, which is consistent with multiple separate primary spiral waves in electrophysiologically heterogeneous areas of atria. The average measured number of rotors per case was 1.71 {+/-} 0.32, which provides a lower limit on the actual number of rotors. The single-zone pattern was exclusively seen in patients who were on a membrane-active antiarrhythmic medication at the time of ablation (P < 0.005).\\n\\nConclusionsAF is a heterogeneous disorder. High-frequency resolution analysis is a useful tool to detect the underlying mechanisms of AF and to classify it into patterns consistent with a single mother-rotor vs. multiple meandering wavelets.",

During the process of investigating dietary effects on gene regulation in L1 stage worms by single-worm RNA-Seq, we found that the density of resuspended L1 larvae affects expression of many mRNAs. Specifically, a number of genes related to metabolism and signalling are highly expressed in worms arrested at low density, but are repressed at higher arrest densities. We generated a GFP reporter strain based on one of the most density-dependent genes in our dataset - lips-15 - and confirmed that this reporter was expressed specifically in worms arrested at relatively low density. Finally, we show that conditioned media from high density L1 cultures was able to downregulate lips-15 even in L1 animals arrested at low density, and experiments using daf-22 mutant animals demonstrated that this effect is not mediated by the ascaroside family of signalling pheromones. Together, our data implicate a soluble signalling molecule in density sensing by L1 stage C. elegans, and provide guidance for design of experiments focused on early developmental gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying genetic introgression between sexual species and polyploid lineages traditionally thought to be asexual is an important step in understanding what factors drive the longevity of putatively asexual groups. However, the presence of multiple distinct subgenomes within a single lineage provides a significant logistical challenge to evaluating the origin of genetic variation in most polyploids. Here, we capitalize on three recent innovations--variation generated from ultraconserved elements (UCEs), bioinformatic techniques for assessing variation in polyploids, and model-based methods for evaluating historical gene flow--to measure the extent and tempo of introgression over the evolutionary history of an allopolyploid lineage of all-female salamanders and two ancestral sexual species. We first analyzed variation from more than a thousand UCEs using a reference mapping method developed for polyploids to infer subgenome specific patterns of variation in the all-female lineage. We then used PHRAPL to choose between sets of historical models that reflected different patterns of introgression and divergence between the genomes of the parental species and the same genomes found within the polyploids. Our analyses support a scenario in which the genomes sampled in unisexuals salamanders were present in the lineage [~]3.4 million years ago, followed by an extended period of divergence from their parental species. Recent secondary introgression has occurred at different times between each sexual species and their representative genomes within the unisexuals during the last 500,000 years. Sustained introgression of sexual genomes into the unisexual lineage has been the defining characteristic of their reproductive mode, but this study provides the first evidence that unisexual genomes have also undergone long periods of divergence without introgression. Unlike other unisexual, sperm-dependent taxa in which introgression is rare, the alternating periods of divergence and introgression between unisexual salamanders and their sexual relatives could reveal the scenarios in which the influx of novel genomic material is favored and potentially explain why these salamanders are among the oldest described unisexual animals.",

Called SOUP, for Semi-sOft clUstering with Pure cells, this novel algorithm reveals the clustering structure for both pure cells, which belong to one single cluster, as well as transitional cells with soft memberships. SOUP involves a two-step process: identify the set of pure cells and then estimate a membership matrix. To find pure cells, SOUP uses the special block structure the K cell types form in a similarity matrix, devised by pairwise comparison of the gene expression profiles of individual cells. Once pure cells are identified, they provide the key information from which the membership matrix can be computed. SOUP is applicable to general clustering problems as well, as long as the unrestrictive modeling assumptions hold. The performance of SOUP is documented via extensive simulation studies. Using SOUP to analyze two single cell data sets from brain shows it produce sensible and interpretable results.",

    "abstract": "Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within and surrounding the complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene show some of the strongest genome-wide association signals with late-onset Alzheimers disease. Some studies have suggested that this association signal is due to a duplication allele (CR1-B) of a low copy repeat (LCR) within the CR1 gene, which increases the number of complement C3b/C4b-binding sites in the mature receptor. In this study, we develop a triplex paralogue ratio test (PRT) assay for CR1 LCR copy number allowing large numbers of samples to be typed with a limited amount of DNA. We also develop a CR1-B allele-specific PCR based on the junction generated by an historical non-allelic homologous recombination event between CR1 LCRs. We use these methods to genotype CR1 and measure CR1-B allele frequency in both late-onset and early-onset cases and unaffected controls from the United Kingdom. Our data support an association of late-onset Alzheimers disease with the CR1-B allele, and confirm that this allele occurs most frequently on the risk haplotype defined by SNV alleles. Furthermore, regression models incorporating CR1-B genotype provide a bitter fit to our data compared to incorporating the SNP-defined risk haplotype, supporting the CR1-B allele as the variant underlying the increased risk of late-onset Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations are a characteristic symptom of psychotic mental health conditions that are also experienced by many individuals without a clinical diagnosis. Research has linked the experience of hallucinations in schizophrenia to differences in the length of the paracingulate sulcus (PCS), a structure in the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain which has previously been associated with the ability to differentiate perceived and imagined information. We investigated whether this notion of a specific morphological basis for hallucinations in the paracingulate cortex extends to individuals without a clinical diagnosis by testing the hypothesis that non-clinical individuals with hallucinations have shorter PCS than non-clinical individuals without hallucinations. Structural MRI scans were examined from three demographically matched groups of individuals: 50 patients with psychotic diagnoses who experienced auditory verbal hallucinations, 50 non-clinical individuals with auditory verbal hallucinations, and 50 healthy control subjects with no life-time history of hallucinations. Measurements of paracingulate sulcal length were compared between the groups and the results verified using automated data-driven gyrification analyses. Patients with hallucinations had shorter PCS than both healthy controls and non-clinical individuals with hallucinations, with no difference between non-clinical individuals with hallucinations and healthy controls. These findings suggest that the association of shorter PCS length with hallucinations is specific to patients with a psychotic disorder. This presents challenges for continuum models of psychosis and suggests possible differences in the mechanisms underlying hallucinations in clinical and non-clinical groups.",

We found that GABAergic periglomerular interneuron populations in the olfactory bulb endogenously respond not only to odors but also to visual, auditory, and somatosensory stimuli in waking (but not anesthetized) mice. When these stimuli predict future odors, they evoke enhanced interneuron activity during the time odor normally occurs. When expectations are violated by omitting an expected \\\"warning tone\\\" before an odor, odor presentation evokes a burst of interneuron activity. The resulting GABA release presynaptically suppresses neurotransmitter release from the axon terminals of olfactory sensory neurons, the cells that transduce odor in the nasal epithelium and communicate this information to the brain. Expectations, even those evoked by cues in other sensory modalities, can thus affect the very first neurons in the olfactory system.",

Identification of the signaling interaction at cellular resolution is technically challenging, especially in a developing embryo.

This is achieved by generation of a systems-level cell contact map that consists of 1,114 highly confident intercellular contacts by modeling analysis and is validated through cell membrane labeling coupled with cell lineage analysis. We apply the map to identify cell pairs between which a Notch signaling interaction takes place. By generating expression patterns for two ligands and two receptors of Notch signaling pathway with cellular resolution using automated expression profiling technique, we are able to refine existing and identify novel Notch interactions during C. elegans embryogenesis. Targeted cell ablation followed by cell lineage analysis demonstrates the roles of signaling interactions over cell division in breaking fate symmetry. We finally develop a website that allows online access to the cell-cell contact map for mapping of other signaling interaction in the community. The platform can be adapted to establish cellular interaction from any other signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of immunoglobulin repertoires (Ig-seq) is a powerful method for quantitatively interrogating B cell receptor sequence diversity. When applied to human repertoires, Ig-seq provides insight into fundamental immunological questions, and can be implemented in diagnostic and drug discovery projects. However, a major challenge in Ig-seq is ensuring accuracy, as library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms can introduce substantial errors and bias that compromise immunological interpretation. Here, we have established an approach for performing highly accurate human Ig-seq by combining synthetic standards with a comprehensive error and bias correction pipeline. First, we designed a set of 85 synthetic antibody heavy chain standards (in vitro transcribed RNA) to assess correction workflow fidelity. Next, we adapted a library preparation protocol that incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UIDs) for error and bias correction which, when applied to the synthetic standards, resulted in highly accurate data. Finally, we performed Ig-seq on purified human circulating B cell subsets (naive and memory), combined with a cellular replicate sampling strategy. This strategy enabled robust and reliable estimation of key repertoire features such as clonotype diversity, germline segment and isotype subclass usage, and somatic hypermutation (SHM). We anticipate that our standards and error and bias correction pipeline will become a valuable tool for researchers to validate and improve accuracy in human Ig-seq studies, thus leading to potentially new insights and applications in human antibody repertoire profiling.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid cells localize to peripheral tissues in a wide range of pathologic contexts. However, appreciation of distinct myeloid subtypes has been limited by the signal averaging inherent to bulk sequencing approaches. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map cellular heterogeneity in lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin injury in mice. We first developed a computational framework that enables unbiased, granular cell-type annotation of scRNA-seq. This approach identified a macrophage subpopulation that was specific to injured lung and notable for high expression of Cx3cr1+ and MHCII genes. We found that these macrophages, which bear a gene expression profile consistent with monocytic origin, progressively acquire alveolar macrophage identity and localize to sites of fibroblast accumulation. Probing their functional role, in vitro studies showed a trophic effect of these cells on fibroblast activation, and ablation of Cx3cr1-expressing cells suppressed fibrosis in vivo. We also found by gene set analysis and immunofluorescence that markers of these macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with lung fibrosis compared with healthy controls. Taken together, our results uncover a specific pathologic subgroup of macrophages with markers that could enable their therapeutic targeting for fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae can acquire antibiotic resistance by activation of competence and subsequent DNA uptake. Several antibiotics induce competence by disrupting protein-quality control or perturbing DNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that aztreonam (AZT) and clavulanic acid (CLA) also promote competence. We show that both compounds induce cell chain formation by targeting the D,D-carboxypeptidase PBP3. In support of the hypothesis that chain formation promotes competence, we demonstrate that an autolysin mutant (lytB) is hypercompetent. As competence is initiated by the binding of a small extracellular peptide (CSP) to a membrane-anchored receptor (ComD), we wondered if chain formation alters CSP diffusion and thereby sensing by ComD. Indeed, the presence of AZT or CLA affects competence synchronization by switching CSP-based quorum sensing to autocrine-like signaling, as CSP is retained to chained cells and no longer shared in a common pool. Together, these insights demonstrate the versatility of quorum sensing in integrating different stresses and highlight that certain antibiotics should be prescribed with care not to drive the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Acetate, agonist for the free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R/GPR43), triggers an increase in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ in neutrophils without any assembly of the superoxide generating NADPH-oxidase. We show that the phenylacetamide compound 58 (Cmp58; (S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3-dimethyl-N-(5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)butanamide, lacking a direct activating effect on neutrophils, acts as a positive allosteric FFA2R modulator that turns acetate into a potent activating agonist that triggers an assembly of the NADPH-oxidase. The NADPH-oxidase activity could be further increased in neutrophils treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF. Many neutrophil chemoattractant receptors are stored in secretory organelles but no FFA2R mobilization was induced in neutrophils treated with TNF. The receptor selectivity was demonstrated through the inhibition of the neutrophil response induced by the combined action of acetate and Cmp58 by the FFA2R antagonist CATPB. Allosteric modulators that positively co-operate with natural FFA2R agonists and prime neutrophils in their response to such agonists, may serve as good tools for further unraveling the physiological functions of the FFA2R and its involvement in various diseases. In this study, allosteric modulation of FFA2R is introduced as a novel receptor selective mechanism to prime neutrophils to produce increased amounts of reactive oxygen species.",

    "abstract": "SummaryMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory and autoimmune disease, in which various immune cell types and autoreactive T cells exert a pathogenic activity. This disease is also associated with increased transcription of several endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) normally kept in check by heterochromatin. Here, we have uncovered an organic pollutant dieldrin that activates several HERVs associated with MS and allowing us to examine the mechanism of their activation. Dieldrin singles out by its ability to simultaneously activate the MAP kinase and the PI3K pathways, while also triggering calcium dependent peptidylarginine deiminase activity. It was this association of pathways that caused HERV activation, a phenomenon that was only part of more generally increased transcription of heterochromatic regions. The HERV transcripts were generally not polyadenylated. Some arose as a consequence of activation of HERV-based enhancers, while others were the result of unusually strong activation at some mostly transcription factor genes causing transcription to leak out of the HERV-free region that surrounds them. Altogether, our data emphasized the hazard associated with simultaneous activation of multiples signaling pathways by xenobiotics, while also providing a very general toolbox for the interpretation of HERV transcription.",

    "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria are a diverse group of microorganisms with the ability to use geomagnetic fields for direction sensing. This magnetotactic behavior can help microorganisms move towards favorable habitats for optimal growth and reproduction. Highly efficient genomic editing is very useful for a comprehensive understanding of the magnetotactic mechanism at the molecular level. In this study, we adapted an engineered CRISPR-cas9 system for efficient inactivation of gene in a widely used magnetotactic bacteria model strain, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. By combining an engineered nuclease-deficient Cas9 and single-guide RNA, a CRISPR interference system was successfully developed to silence amb0994 expression. More importantly, we succeeded in the construction of a single amb0994 gene deletion mutant using CRISPR-Cas9 with approximate 60-fold high efficiency compared to classical homology double-crossing replacement procedure. This mutant synthesized normally the magnetosomes, but reacted quicker and with less time than the wild-type strain to abrupt magnetic field reversals. A dynamics simulation by modeling M. magneticum AMB-1 cell as an ellipsoid showed that the difference of the motions between wild and{Delta} amb0994 is due to flagellar influence. The behavior observation being consistent with dynamics simulation indicated that Amb0994 is involved in the cellular response to magnetic torque change via controlling flagella. Besides the contribution to a better understanding of the magnetotaxis mechanism, this study demonstrates the CRISPR system as a useful genetic toolbox for high-efficiency genome editing in magnetotactic bacteria.",

Such conditions are frequently suspected but unidentified at PICU admission. Compassionate and effective care is greatly assisted by definitive diagnostic information. There is therefore a need to provide a rapid genetic diagnosis to inform clinical management.\\n\\nTo date, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) approaches have proved successful in diagnosing a proportion of children with rare diseases, but results may take months to report or require the use of equipment and practices not compatible with a clinical diagnostic setting. We describe an end-to-end workflow for the use of rapid WGS for diagnosis in critically ill children in a UK National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic setting.\\n\\nMethodsWe sought to establish a multidisciplinary Rapid Paediatric Sequencing (RaPS) team for case selection, trio WGS, a rapid bioinformatics pipeline for sequence analysis and a phased analysis and reporting system to prioritise genes with a high likelihood of being causal. Our workflow was iteratively developed prospectively during the analysis of the first 10 children and applied to the following 14 to assess its utility.\\n\\nFindingsTrio WGS in 24 critically ill children led to a molecular diagnosis in ten (42%) through the identification of causative genetic variants.

In the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH), we recently showed that paw innervating Mrgprd+ non-peptidergic nociceptors display distinctive central arbor morphologies that well correlate with increased synapse transmission efficiency and heightened sensitivity of distal limb skin. Given that peripheral and central arbor formation of Mrgprd+ neurons co-occurs around the time of birth, we tested whether peripheral cues from different skin areas and/or postnatal reorganization mechanisms could instruct this somatotopic difference among central arbors. We found that, while terminal outgrowth/refinement occurs during early postnatal development in both the skin and the DH, postnatal refinement of central terminals precedes that of peripheral terminals. Further, we used single-cell ablation of Ret to genetically disrupt epidermal innervation of Mrgprd+ neurons and revealed that the somatotopic difference among their central arbors was unaffected by this manipulation. Finally, we saw that region-specific Mrgprd+ central terminal arbors are present from the earliest postnatal stages, before skin terminals are evident. Together, our data indicate that region-specific organization of Mrgprd+ neuron central arbors develops independently of peripheral target innervation and is present shortly after initial central terminal formation, suggesting that either cell-intrinsic and/or DH local signaling may establish this somatotopic difference.",

In sharp contrast, in IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a disorder characterized by polarized Ig class switching, most TFH cells in tertiary and secondary lymphoid organs make IL-4. Human IL-4+ TFH cells do not express GATA-3 but express nuclear BATF, and the transcriptomes of IL-4 secreting TFH cells differ both from PD1hi TFH cells that do not secrete IL-4 and IL4-secreting non-TFH cells. Unlike IgG4-RD, IL-4+ TFH cells are rarely found in tertiary lymphoid organs in Sjogrens syndrome, a disorder in which IgG4 is not elevated. The proportion of CD4+IL-4+BATF+ T cells as well as of CD4+IL-4+CXCR5+ T cells in IgG4-RD tissues correlates tightly with tissue IgG4 plasma cell numbers and plasma IgG4 levels in patients but not with the total plasma levels of other isotypes.

    "abstract": "A key assumption of models of infectious disease is that population-scale spread is driven by transmission between host individuals at small scales. This assumption, however, is rarely tested, likely because observing disease transmission between host individuals is non-trivial in many infectious diseases. Quantifying the transmission of insect baculoviruses at a small scale is in contrast straightforward. We fit a disease model to data from baculovirus epizootics (= epidemics in animals) at the scale of whole forests, while using prior parameter distributions constructed from branch-scale experiments. Our experimentally-constrained model fits the large-scale data very well, supporting the role of small-scale transmission mechanisms in baculovirus epizootics. We further compared our experimentally-based model to an unconstrained model that ignores our experimental data, serving as a proxy for models that include large-scale mechanisms. This analysis supports our hypothesis that small-scale mechanisms are important, especially individual variability in host susceptibility to the virus. Comparison of transmission rates in the two models, however, suggests that large-scale mechanisms increase transmission compared to our experimental estimates. Our study shows that small-scale and large-scale mechanisms drive forest-wide epizootics of baculoviruses, and that synthesizing mathematical models with data collected across scales is key to understanding the spread of infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection, responsible for millions of infections each year. Despite this high prevalence, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of Chlamydia pathogenesis has been difficult due to limitations in genetic tools and its intracellular developmental cycle. Within a host epithelial cell, chlamydiae replicate within a vacuole called the inclusion. Many Chlamydia-host interactions are thought to be mediated by the Inc family of type III secreted proteins that are anchored in the inclusion membrane, but their array of host targets are largely unknown. To investigate how the inclusion membrane proteome changes over the course of an infected cell, we have adapted the APEX system of proximity-dependent biotinylation. APEX is capable of specifically labeling proteins within a 20 nm radius in living cells. We transformed C. trachomatis to express the enzyme APEX fused to known inclusion membrane proteins, allowing biotinylation and pull-down of inclusion-associated proteins. Using quantitative mass spectrometry against APEX labeled samples, we identified over 400 proteins associated with the inclusion membrane at early, middle, and late stages of epithelial cell infection. This system was sensitive enough to detect inclusion interacting proteins early in the developmental cycle, at 8 hours post infection, a previously intractable time point. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a novel, early association between C. trachomatis inclusions and endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES), functional regions of the ER where COPII-coated vesicles originate. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ERES function severely restricted early chlamydial growth and the development of infectious progeny.

Furthermore, the data derived from proteomic mapping of Chlamydia inclusions has illuminated an important functional role for ERES in promoting chlamydial developmental growth.",

    "abstract": "1There is a growing interest in vertically transmitted viruses. Field studies show that virus infection frequency often varies in space and time. In order to understand the spatial variation of virus prevalence, we designed a mathematical model describing the infection dynamics of a biparentally inherited virus in a two-population model. Model parameters are paternal and maternal transmission rates, cost of infection, and up to two migration rates. We investigated three different population structures: (1) a single panmictic host population, (2) two populations connected by unidirectional migration (mainland-island model), and (3) two populations connected by two-way migration. According to the results, the parameter space can be divided in three zones: (1) viral spread, (2) no viral spread, (3) bistability (in a single population) or stable infection polymorphism (in the two-population models). The finding of bistability is interesting and new. It shows that infected and uninfected populations can stably coexist, if migration is below a critical value, and if the cost of infection is moderately high. In summary, our results show that spatial structure of host populations is an important factor in determining geographical differences of vertically transmitted viruses.",

    "abstract": "Microscopic marine planktons have played a major role in the Earths ecosystem and accounts for half the globes primary production. Predicting the fate of marine planktons is imperative to understanding how ocean life will change in future centuries and how organisms have adapted to changes in the past over long timescales (over thousands of years). Studies of revived resting spores of marine diatoms will serve as excellent proxies of environmental change in marine environments. Thus far, only about a century old marine diatom resting spores could be revived. This severely limited the use of diatom resting spores to investigate the effects of environmental perturbations over longer time scales. Here, we, for the first time report revival of thousands of years old resting spores from the deposits of ancient diatoms (Chaetoceros) in sub-seafloor sediments using a revival protocol that involved recreating the ancient environmental conditions (salinity, temperature and light). Our revived diatom resting spores samples range from recent (0-80 years) to [~]7200 years old. Importantly, we also extracted the DNA from the ancient resting spores of Chaetoceros species from the Baltic Sea. Our findings will enable us to compare DNA sequence data obtained from these natural archives of resurrected organisms and provide predictive models to forecast evolutionary responses of natural populations to environmental changes resulting from natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climate change\\n\\nSignificance StatementOur results address the important topic of adaptive evolution in marine species due to climate and environmental change induced due to anthropogenic perturbations. We present a new model system Chaetoceros muelleri which will help us address important evolutionary and long-term adaptation questions across evolutionary timescales. Our study reports (1) the revival of recent (0-80 years) to ancient (7200 years old) resting spores of Chaetoceros (2) the extraction of DNA and amplification of chloroplast and ribosomal genes from recent and ancient ([~]1300 years old) resting spores of Chaetoceros (3) Radiocarbon dating to determine age of sediments (4) Identification of species by reviving the resting spores (5) Baltic sea an excellent ecosystem to study long-term effects of environment on species adaptation",

What mechanisms underlie these changes? Basolateral amygdala neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (BLA[-&gt;]NAc) preferentially encode positive valence, whereas those targeting the centromedial amygdala (BLA[-&gt;]CeM) preferentially encode negative valence. Longitudinal in vivo two-photon calcium imaging revealed that BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons were more active, while BLA[-&gt;]CeM neurons were less active, following just 1 day of food deprivation. Photostimulating BLA[-&gt;]CeM neurons inhibited BLA[-&gt;]NAc neurons at baseline, but food deprivation rapidly converted this inhibition into facilitation, supporting a model wherein BLA[-&gt;]NAc excitability mediates invigorated food-seeking behavior after deprivation. Indeed, inhibiting BLA[-&gt;]NAc reduced motivation for a caloric reinforcer in food deprived animals. Taken together, negative valence overrides positive valence processing in satiety, but changing homeostatic needs alter reward value via a rapid shift in the balance between projection-defined populations of BLA neurons.",

It is tempting to account for it as resulting from the (unknown) participant-specific history and thus treat it as a measurement noise. Here we quantify idiosyncratic choice biases in a perceptual discrimination task and a motor task. We report substantial and significant biases in both cases that cannot be accounted for by the experimental context. Then, we present theoretical evidence that even in idealized experiments, in which the settings are symmetric, idiosyncratic choice bias is expected to emerge from the dynamics of competing neuronal networks. We thus argue that idiosyncratic choice bias reflects the microscopic dynamics of choice and therefore is virtually inevitable in any comparison or decision task.",

Here, with third-generation in situ HCR, we augment these capabilities using probes and amplifiers that combine to provide automatic background suppression throughout the protocol, ensuring that even if reagents bind non-specifically within the sample they will not generate amplified background. Automatic background suppression dramatically enhances performance and robustness, combining the benefits of higher signal-to-background with the convenience of using unoptimized probe sets for new targets and organisms. In situ HCR v3.0 enables multiplexed quantitative mRNA imaging with subcellular resolution in the anatomical context of whole-mount vertebrate embryos, multiplexed quantitative mRNA flow cytometry for high-throughput single-cell expression profiling, and multiplexed quantitative single-molecule mRNA imaging in thick autofluorescent samples.\\n\\nSUMMARYIn situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) v3.0 exploits automatic background suppression to enable multiplexed quantitative mRNA imaging and flow cytometry with dramatically enhanced ease-of-use and performance.",

Structural variants disrupting TAD boundaries have been implicated both in cancer and developmental disease; this likely occurs via  enhancer hijacking, whereby removal of the TAD boundary exposes enhancers to new target transcription start sites (TSSs). With this functional role, we hypothesized that boundaries would display evidence for negative selection. Here we demonstrate that the chromatin landscape constrains structural variation both within healthy humans and across primate evolution. In contrast, in patients with developmental delay, variants occur remarkably uniformly across genomic features, suggesting a potentially broad role for enhancer hijacking in human disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDetailed molecular analyses of cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium hold promise in identifying cellular phenotypes that drive tissue pathology and joint damage. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) RA/SLE network aims to deconstruct autoimmune pathology by examining cells within target tissues through multiple high-dimensional assays. Robust standardized protocols need to be developed before cellular phenotypes at a single cell level can be effectively compared across patient samples.\\n\\nMethodsMultiple clinical sites collected cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments from arthroplasty and synovial biopsy in a 10%-DMSO solution. Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation parameters were optimized for viable cell extraction and surface protein preservation for cell sorting and mass cytometry, as well as for reproducibility in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cryopreserved synovial samples were collectively analyzed at a central processing site by a custom-designed and validated 35-marker mass cytometry panel. In parallel, each sample was flow sorted into fibroblast, T cell, B cell, and macrophage suspensions for bulk population RNA-seq and plate-based single cell CEL-Seq2 RNA-seq.\\n\\nResultsUpon dissociation, cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments yielded a high frequency of viable cells, comparable to samples undergoing immediate processing. Optimization of synovial tissue dissociation across six clinical collection sites with [~]30 arthroplasty and [~]20 biopsy samples yielded a consensus digestion protocol using 100{micro}g/mL of Liberase TL enzyme. This protocol yielded immune and stromal cell lineages with preserved surface markers and minimized variability across replicate RNA-seq transcriptomes. Mass cytometry analysis of cells from cryopreserved synovium distinguished: 1) diverse fibroblast phenotypes, 2) distinct populations of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells, and 3) multiple CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation states. Bulk RNA sequencing of sorted cell populations demonstrated robust separation of synovial lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Single cell RNA-seq produced transcriptomes of over 1000 genes/cell, including transcripts encoding characteristic lineage markers identified.\\n\\nConclusionWe have established a robust protocol to acquire viable cells from cryopreserved synovial tissue with intact transcriptomes and cell surface phenotypes. A centralized pipeline to generate multiple high-dimensional analyses of synovial tissue samples collected across a collaborative network was developed. Integrated analysis of such datasets from large patient cohorts may help define molecular heterogeneity within RA pathology and identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The Sxy (TfoX) protein is required for expression of a distinct subset of the genes regulated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) in the model organisms Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Vibrio cholerae. Genetic studies have established that CRP and Sxy co-activate transcription at gene promoters containing DNA binding sites called CRP-S sites. In contrast, CRP acts without Sxy at gene promoters containing canonical CRP-N sites, suggesting that Sxy makes physical contacts with CRP and/or DNA to assist in transcriptional activation at CRP-S promoters. Despite growing interest in Sxys activity as a transcription factor, Sxy remains poorly characterized due to a lack of reliable phenotypes in E. coli. Experiments are further hampered by growth inhibition and formation of inclusion bodies when Sxy is overexpressed. In this study we applied diverse phenotypic and molecular assays to test for postulated Sxy functions and interactions. Mutations in conserved regions of Sxy and truncations in the Sxy C-terminus abolish transcriptional activation of a CRP-S promoter, and a 37 amino acid truncation of the C-terminus relieves the growth inhibition normally caused by Sxy overexpression. Sxy was unable to augment weakened CRP interactions to restore carbon metabolism phenotypes. Bandshift analysis and chromatin pull-down assays of Sxy-CRP-DNA interactions yielded intriguing evidence of CRP-Sxy and Sxy-DNA physical interactions. However, despite the careful application of standard protein purification protocols and quality control steps for nickel affinity column purification, protein mass spectrometry revealed the enrichment of additional DNA-binding proteins in nickel column eluates, presenting a probable source of artefactual protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction results. These findings highlight the importance of extensive controls and phenotypic assays for the study of poorly characterized and recalcitrant proteins like Sxy.",

LncRNA Oip5-as1 facilitates stem cell self-renewal in mouse by sponging mmu-miR-7 and modulating NANOG level, yet its role in cancer is less understood. We analyzed OIP5-AS1 expression in oral tumors and in TCGA datasets. We observed overexpression of OIP5-AS1 in oral tumors (P<0.001) and in tumors of epithelial origin from TCGA. OIP5-AS1 expression was strongly associated with undifferentiated tumors (P=0.0038). In silico analysis showed miR-7 binding site is conserved in mouse and human OIP5-AS1. However, human NANOG 3-UTR lost the binding site for hsa-miR-7a-3. Therefore, we screened for other miRNAs that can be sponged by OIP5-AS1 and identified six potential miRNAs and their downstream target genes. Expression analysis showed downregulation of miRNAs and upregulation of downstream target genes, particularly in undifferentiated tumors with high-level of OIP5-AS1 suggesting that OIP5-AS1 could post-transcriptionally modulate the downstream target genes. Further, systematic epigenomic analysis of OIP5-AS1 promoter revealed binding motifs for MYC, NANOG and KLF4 suggesting that OIP5-AS1 could be transactivated by stemness-associated transcription factors in cancer. Overexpression of OIP5-AS1 in undifferentiated oral tumors may confer poor prognosis through maintenance of cancer stemness.",
