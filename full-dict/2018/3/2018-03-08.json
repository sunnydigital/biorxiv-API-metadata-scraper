    "abstract": "AbstractPhelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder in which one copy of the SHANK3 gene is missing or mutated, leading to a global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism. Multiple intragenic promoters and alternatively spliced exons are responsible for the formation of numerous isoforms. Many genetically-modified mouse models of PMS have been generated but most disrupt only some of the isoforms. In contrast, the vast majority of known SHANK3 mutations found in patients involve deletions that disrupt all isoforms. Here, we report the production and thorough behavioral characterization of a new mouse model in which all Shank3 isoforms are disrupted. Our mice are more severely affected than previously published models. While the deficits were typically more pronounced in homozygotes, an intermediate phenotype was observed for heterozygotes in many paradigms. As in other Shank3 mouse models, stereotypies, including increased grooming, were observed. Additionally, both sensory and motor deficits were detected in neonatal and adult mice. While social behaviors were not strongly impacted, Shank3-deficient mice displayed a strong escape behavior and avoidance of inanimate objects indicating increased novelty-induced anxiety. Similarly, increased freezing was observed during fear conditioning training and amygdala-dependent cued retrieval. Finally, deficits were observed in both initial training and reversal in the Barnes maze and in contextual fear memory that are memory tasks involving hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. This new mouse model of PMS, engineered to most closely represent human mutations, recapitulates core symptoms of PMS providing improvements for both construct and face validity, compared to previous models.\\n\\nSignificant statementPhelan-McDermid syndrome, caused by happloinsufficiency of Shank3, is a severe and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This study investigates the behavioral consequences of a disruption of all Shank3 isoforms in neonatal and adult mice using a detailed battery of tests tailored to investigate core symptoms and usual comorbidities of PMS. We found that our new model is more severely affected than previously published mouse models with only partial deletions of Shank3 and more closely recapitulates symptoms of PMS thus providing improvements for both construct and face validity. Our results highlight the significance of using a mouse model with a complete deletion of Shank3 for studying mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder and PMS, carrying preclinical studies and testing test novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "We present a theory and computational models to couple the electric field induced by magnetic stimulation to neuronal membranes. The response of neuronal membranes to induced electric fields is examined under different time scales, and the characteristics of the primary and secondary electric fields from electromagnetic induction and charge accumulation on conductivity boundaries, respectively, are analyzed. Based on the field characteristics and decoupling of the longitudinal and transverse field components along the neural cable, quasi-potentials are a simple and accurate approximation for coupling of magnetically induced electric fields to neurons and a modified cable equation provides theoretical consistency for magnetic stimulation. The conventional and modified cable equations are used to simulate magnetic stimulation of long peripheral nerves by circular and figure-8 coils. Activation thresholds are obtained over a range of lateral and vertical coil positions for two nonlinear membrane models representing unmyelinated and myelinated axons and also for undulating myelinated axons. For unmyelinated straight axons, the thresholds obtained with the modified cable equation are significantly lower due to transverse polarization, and the spatial distributions of thresholds as a function of coil position differ significantly from predictions by the activating function. For myelinated axons, the transverse field contributes negligibly to activation thresholds, whereas axonal undulation can increase or decrease thresholds depending on coil position. The analysis provides a rigorous theoretical foundation and implementation methods for the use of the cable equation to model neuronal response to magnetically induced electric fields. Experimentally observed stimulation with the electric fields perpendicular to the nerve trunk cannot be explained by transverse polarization alone and is likely due to nerve fiber undulation and other geometrical inhomogeneities.",

    "abstract": "We use Brownian dynamics simulations to study the formation of chromatin loops through diffusive sliding of molecular slip links, mimicking the behaviour of cohesin-like molecules. We recently proposed that diffusive sliding is sufficient to explain the extrusion of chromatin loops of hundreds of kilo-base-pairs (kbp), which may then be stabilised by interactions between cohesin and CTCF proteins. Here we show that the elasticity of the chromatin fibre strongly affects this dynamical process, and find that diffusive loop extrusion is more efficient on stiffer chromatin regions. Efficiency is also enhanced if cohesin loading sites are close to regions where CTCF is bound. In light of the heterogeneous physical properties of eukaryotic chromatin, we suggest that our results should be relevant to the looping and organisation of interphase chromosomes in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Wild relatives provide an important source of useful traits in wheat breeding. Wheat and wild relative hybrids have been widely used in breeding programs to introduce such traits into wheat. However, successful introgression is limited by the low frequency of homoeologous crossover (CO) between wheat and wild relative chromosomes. Hybrids between wheat carrying a 70Mb deletion on chromosome 5B (ph1b) and wild relatives, have been exploited to increase the level of homoeologous CO, allowing chromosome exchange between their chromosomes. In ph1b-rye hybrids, CO number increases from a mean of 1 CO to 7 COs per cell. CO number can be further increased up to a mean of 12 COs per cell in these ph1b hybrids by treating the plants with Hoagland solution. More recently, it was shown that the major meiotic crossover gene ZIP4 on chromosome 5B (TaZIP4-B2) within the 70Mb deletion, was responsible for the restriction of homoeologous COs in wheat-wild relative hybrids, confirming the ph1b phenotype as a complete Tazip4-B2 deletion mutant (Tazip4-B2 ph1b). In this study, we have identified the particular Hoagland solution constituent responsible for the increased chiasma frequency in Tazip4-B2 ph1b mutant-rye hybrids and extended the analysis to Tazip4-B2 TILLING and CRISPR mutant-Ae variabilis hybrids. Chiasma frequency at meiotic metaphase I, in the absence of each Hoagland solution macronutrient (NH4 H2PO4, KNO3, Ca (NO3)2{middle dot}4H2O or Mg SO4{middle dot}7H2O) was analysed. A significant decrease in homoeologous CO frequency was observed when the Mg2+ ion was absent. A significant increase of homoeologous CO frequency was observed in all analysed hybrids, when plants were irrigated with a 1mM Mg2+ solution. These observations suggest a role for magnesium supplementation in improving the success of genetic material introgression from wild relatives into wheat.",

The Z-ring recruits the division machinery and directs local cell wall remodeling for constriction. The organization and dynamics of protofilaments within the Z-ring coordinate local cell wall synthesis during cell constriction, but their regulation is largely unknown. The disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) region of Caulobacter crescentus FtsZ (CcFtsZ) regulates polymer structure and turnover in solution in vitro, and regulates Z-ring structure and activity of cell wall enzymes in vivo. To investigate the contributions of the CTL to the polymerization properties of FtsZ on its physiological platform, the cell membrane, we reconstituted CcFtsZ polymerization on supported lipid bilayers (SLB) and visualized polymer dynamics and structure using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Unlike E. coli FtsZ protofilaments that organized into large, bundled patterns, CcFtsZ protofilaments assembled into small, dynamic clusters on SLBs. Moreover, CcFtsZ lacking its CTL formed large networks of straight filament bundles that underwent slower turnover than the dynamic clusters of wildtype FtsZ. Our in vitro characterization provides novel insights into species- and CTL-dependent differences between FtsZ assembly properties that are relevant to Z-ring assembly and function on membranes in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis and degradation are intricate biological processes involving more than a hundred proteins operating in a highly orches-trated fashion. Despite the progress, few options are available to access translation in live animals as the increase in animals complexity limits the repertoire of experimental tools that could be applied to observe and manipulate processes within animals body, organs, and individual cells. It this study, we developed a labeling-free method for measuring organ- and cell-type specific translation elongation rates. It is based on a time-resolved delivery of translation initiation and elongation inhibitors in live animals followed by ribosome profiling. It also reports translation initiation sites in an organ-specific manner. Using this method, we found that the elongation rates differ among mouse organs and determined them to be 6.8, 5.2, and 4.4 amino acids per sec for liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, respectively.\\n\\nSignificanceProtein synthesis is a vital biological process. Modern methods of genome editing enable generation of sophisticated animal models to study the regulation of protein synthesis in health end disease. However, the methods that could track various steps of translation at a gene level resolution in vivo are lacking, particularly in complex vertebrates, such as mice and rats. Here, we measured the translation elongation rate in several organs by delivering inhibitors specific to certain phases of translation directly through the mouse bloodstream. This study lays out a path for interrogating translation in animals in response to various genetic and dietary interventions.",

    "abstract": "The neuroscientific study of human navigation has been con-strained by the prerequisite of traditional brain imaging studies that re-quire participants to remain stationary. Such imaging approaches neglect a central component that characterizes navigation -the multisensory ex-perience of self-movement. Navigation by active movement through space combines multisensory perception with internally generated self-motion cues. We investigated the spatial micro genesis during free ambulatory exploration of interactive sparse virtual environments using motion cap-ture synchronized to high resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data as well psychometric and self-report measures. In such environments, map-like allocentric representations must be constructed out of transient, egocentric first-person perspective 3-D spatial information. Considering individual differences of spatial learning ability, we studied if changes in exploration behavior coincide with spatial learning of an environment. To this end, we analyzed the quality of sketch maps (a description of spatial learning) that were produced after repeated learning trials for differently complex maze environments. We observed significant changes in active exploration behavior from the first to the last exploration of a maze: a decrease in time spent in the maze predicted an increase in subsequent sketch map quality. Furthermore, individual differences in spatial abilities as well as differences in the level of experienced immersion revealed an impact on the quality of spatial learning. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to observe behavioral changes associated with spatial learning, opening the way to the study of cortical dynamics of navigation.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art single particle tracking (SPT) techniques can generate long trajectories with high temporal and spatial resolution. This offers the possibility of mechanistically interpreting particle movements and behaviour in membranes. To this end, a number of statistical techniques have been developed that partition SPT trajectories into states with distinct diffusion signatures, allowing a statistical analysis of diffusion state dynamics and switching behaviour. Here we develop a confinement model, within a hidden Markov framework, that switches between phases of free diffusion, and confinement in a harmonic potential well. By using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to fit this model, automated partitioning of individual SPT trajectories into these two phases is achieved, which allows us to analyse confinement events. We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm on a previously published dataset, where gold nanoparticle (AuNP) tagged GM1 lipids were tracked in model membranes. We performed a comprehensive analysis of confinement events, demonstrating that there is heterogeneity in the lifetime, shape, and size of events, with confinement size and shape being highly conserved within trajectories. Our observations suggest that heterogeneity in confinement events is caused by both individual nanoparticle characteristics and the binding site environment. The individual nanoparticle heterogeneity ultimately limits the ability of iSCAT to resolve molecular dynamics to the order of the tag size; homogeneous tags could potentially allow the resolution to be taken below this limit by deconvolution methods. In a wider context, the presented harmonic potential well confinement model has the potential to detect and characterise a wide variety of biological phenomena, such as hop diffusion, receptor clustering, and lipid rafts.",

    "abstract": "Most avidin-based handles in force spectroscopy are tetravalent biotin binders. Tetravalency presents two issues: multiple pulling geometries as well as multiple targets bound simultaneously. Additionally, such tetravalent handles require elaborate purification protocols in order to reassemble. A stoichiometric, monomeric variant of streptavidin (mcSA2) had been engineered previously. It is readily expressed and purified, and it binds biotin with a nanomolar KD. For atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS), we fused the monomeric streptavidin with a small protein domain as an experimental fingerprint and to improve solubility. A ybbR-tag was additionally included for covalent site-specific tethering. Rupture forces of the mcSA2:biotin complex were found to be in a comparable range above 150 pN at force loading rates of 1E4 pN/s as for previously published, tetravalent streptavidin:biotin systems. Additionally, when tethering mcSA2 from its C-terminus, rupture forces were found to be slightly higher than when tethered N-terminally. Due to its monomeric nature, mcSA2 could also be chemically denatured and subsequently refolded - and thus regenerated during an experiment, in case the handle gets misfolded or clogged. We show that mcSA2 features a straightforward expression and purification with flexible tags, high stability, regeneration possibilities and an unambiguous pulling geometry. Combined, these properties establish mcSA2 as a reliable handle for single-molecule force spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "In vivo, cells can reside in diverse physical and biochemical environments. For example, epithelial cells typically live in a two-dimensional (2D) environment while metastatic cancer cells can move through dense three-dimensional (3D) matrices. These distinct environments impose different kinds of mechanical forces on cells, and thus potentially can influence the mechanism of cell migration. For example, cell movement on 2D flat surfaces is mostly driven by forces from focal adhesion and actin polymerization, while in confined geometries, it can be driven by water permeation. In this work, we utilize a two-phase model of the cellular cytoplasm, where the mechanics of the cytosol and the F-actin network are treated on an equal footing. Using conservation laws and simple force balance considerations, we are able to describe the contribution of water flux, actin polymerization and flow, and focal adhesions to cell migration in both 2D surfaces and in confined spaces. The theory shows how cell migration can seamlessly transition from a focal adhesion- and actin-based mechanism on 2D surfaces to a water-based mechanism in confined geometries.",

    "abstract": "Historic hunting has led to severe reductions of many marine mammal species across the globe. After hunting ceased, some populations have recovered to pre-exploitation levels, and may again act as a top-down regulatory force on marine ecosystems. Also the harbour seal population in the international Wadden Sea grew at an exponential rate following a ban on seal hunting in 1960s, and the current number [~]38,000 is close to the historic population size. Here we estimate the impact of the harbour seal predation on the fish community in the Wadden Sea and nearby coastal waters.\\n\\nFish remains in faecal samples and published estimates on the seals daily energy requirement were used to estimate prey selection and the magnitude of seal consumption. Estimates on prey abundance were derived from demersal fish surveys, and fish growth was estimated using a Dynamic Energy Budget model. GPS tracking provided information on where seals most likely caught their prey.\\n\\nHarbour seals from the Dutch Wadden Sea fed predominantly on demersal fish, e.g. flatfish species (flounder, sole, plaice, dab), but also sandeel, cod and whiting. Total fish biomass in the Wadden Sea was insufficient to sustain the estimated prey consumption of the entire seal population year-round. This probably explains why seals also acquire prey further offshore in the adjacent North Sea, only spending 13% of their diving time in the Wadden Sea. Still, seal predation was estimated to cause an average annual mortality of 43% and 60% on fish in the Wadden Sea and adjacent coastal zone, respectively. There were however large sources of uncertainty in the estimate, including the migration of fish between the North Sea and Wadden Sea, and catchability estimates of the fish survey sampling gear, particularly for sandeel and other pelagic fish species.\\n\\nOur estimate suggested a considerable top-down control by harbour seals on demersal fish. However predation by seals may also alleviate density-dependent competition between the remaining fish, increasing fish growth, and partly compensating for the reduction in fish numbers. This study shows that recovering coastal marine mammal populations could potentially become an important component in the functioning of shallow coastal systems.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens are exposed to toxic levels of copper during infection and copper tolerance may be a general virulence mechanism used by bacteria to resist host defences. In support of this, inactivation of copper-exporter genes has been found to reduce the virulence of bacterial pathogens in vivo. Here we investigate the role of copper-hypertolerance in methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We show that a copper-hypertolerance locus (copB-mco), carried on a mobile genetic element, is prevalent in a collection of invasive S. aureus strains and more widely among clonal complex 22, 30 and 398 strains. The copB and mco genes encode a copper efflux pump and a multicopper oxidase, respectively. Isogenic mutants lacking copB or mco had impaired growth in subinhibitory concentrations of copper. Transfer of a copB-mco encoding plasmid to a naive clinical isolate resulted in a gain of copper hypertolerance and enhanced bacterial survival inside primed macrophages. The copB and mco genes were upregulated within infected macrophages and their expression was dependent on the copper sensitive operon repressor CsoR. Isogenic copB and mco mutants were impaired in their ability to persist intracellularly in macrophages and were less resistant to phagocytic killing in human blood than the parent strain. The importance of copper-regulated genes in resistance to phagocytic killing was further elaborated using mutants expressing a copper-insensitive variant of CsoR. Our findings suggest that the gain of mobile genetic elements carrying copper-hypertolerance genes contributes to the evolution of virulent strains of S. aureus, better equipped to resist killing by host immune cells.",

    "abstract": "A diverse range of DNA sequences derived from circoviruses (family Circoviridae) have been identified in samples obtained from humans and domestic animals, often in association with pathological conditions. In the majority of cases, however, little is known about the natural biology of the viruses from which these sequences are derived. Endogenous circoviral elements (CVe) are DNA sequences derived from circoviruses that occur in animal genomes and provide a useful source of information about circovirus-host relationships. In this study we screened genome assemblies of 675 animal species and identified numerous circovirus-related sequences, including the first examples of CVe derived from cycloviruses. We confirmed the presence of these CVe in the germline of the elongate twig ant (Pseudomyrmex gracilis), thereby establishing that cycloviruses infect insects. We examined the evolutionary relationships between CVe and contemporary circoviruses, showing that CVe from ants and mites group relatively closely with cycloviruses in phylogenies. Furthermore, the relatively random interspersal of CVe from insect genomes with cyclovirus sequences recovered from vertebrate samples, suggested that contamination might be an important consideration in studies reporting these viruses. Our study demonstrates how endogenous viral sequences can inform metagenomics-based virus discovery. In addition, it raises doubts about the role of cycloviruses as pathogens of humans and other vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of the brain from a connectivity perspective is unveiling novel insights into brain structure and function. Discovery is, however, hindered by the lack of prior knowledge used to make hypotheses. On the other hand, exploratory data analysis is made complex by the high dimensionality of data. Indeed, in order to assess the effect of pathological states on brain networks, neuroscientists are often required to evaluate experimental effects in case-control studies, with hundreds of thousand connections.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to identify the multivariate relationships in brain connections that characterise two distinct groups, hence permitting the investigators to immediately discover sub-networks that contain information about the differences between experimental groups. In particular, we are interested in data discovery related to connectomics, where the connections that characterize differences between two groups of subjects are found. Nevertheless, those connections not necessarily maximize accuracy in classification since this does not guarantee reliable interpretation of specific differences between groups. In practice, our method exploits recent machine learning techniques employing sparsity to deal with weighted networks describing the whole-brain macro connectivity. We evaluated our technique on functional and structural connectomes from human and mice brain data. In our experiments, we automatically identified disease-relevant connections in datasets with supervised and unsupervised anatomy-driven parcellation approaches, and by using high-dimensional datasets.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks are composed of sub-networks that are often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is marked by cognitive dysfunction emerging from neuropathological processes impacting brain function. AD affects brain dynamics at the local level, such as changes in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations, as well as long-range changes to the global network. Individual differences in these changes as they relate to behaviour are poorly understood. Here, we use a multi-scale neurophysiological model, \\\"The Virtual Brain (TVB)\\\", based on empirical multi-modal neuroimaging data, to study how local and global dynamics correlate with individual differences in cognition. In particular, we modeled individual resting-state functional activity of 124 individuals across the behavioral spectrum from healthy aging, to amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), to AD. The model parameters required to accurately simulate empirical functional brain imaging data correlated significantly with cognition, and exceeded the predictive capacity of empirical connectomes.",

    "abstract": "In real life, behavior is influenced by dynamically changing contextual factors and is rarely limited to simple tasks and binary choices. For a meaningful interpretation of brain dynamics underlying more natural cognitive processing in active humans, ecologically valid test scenarios are essential. To understand whether brain dynamics in restricted artificial lab settings reflect the neural activity in complex natural environments, we systematically tested the eventrelated P300 in both settings. We developed an integrative approach comprising an initial P300-study in a highly controlled laboratory set-up and a subsequent validation within a realistic driving scenario. Using a simulated dialog with a speech-based input system, increased P300 amplitudes reflected processing of infrequent and incorrect auditory feedback events in both the laboratory setting and the real world setup. Environmental noise and movement-related activity in the car driving scenario led to higher data rejection rates but revealed no effect on signal-to-noise ratio in theta and alpha frequency band or the amplitudes of the event-related P300. Our results demonstrate the possibility to investigate cognitive functions like context updating in highly adverse driving scenarios and encourage the consideration of more realistic task settings in prospective brain imaging approaches.",
