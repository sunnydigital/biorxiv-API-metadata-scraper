    "abstract": "The placement of angiosperms and Gnetales in seed plant phylogeny remains one of the most enigmatic problems in plant evolution, with morphological analyses (which have usually included fossils) and molecular analyses pointing to very distinct topologies. Almost all morphology-based phylogenies group angiosperms with Gnetales and certain extinct seed plant lineages, while most molecular phylogenies link Gnetales with conifers. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic signal present in published seed plant morphological datasets. We use parsimony, Bayesian inference, and maximum likelihood approaches, combined with a number of experiments with the data, to address the morphological-molecular conflict. First, we ask whether the lack of association of Gnetales with conifers in morphological analyses is due to an absence of signal or to the presence of competing signals, and second, we compare the performance of parsimony and model based approaches with morphological datasets. Our results imply that the grouping of Gnetales and angiosperms is largely the result of long branch attraction, consistent across a range of methodological approaches. Thus, there is a signal for the grouping of Gnetales with conifers in morphological matrices, but it was swamped by convergence between angiosperms and Gnetales, both situated on long branches. However, this effect becomes weaker in more recent analyses, as a result of addition and critical reassessment of characters. Even when a clade including angiosperms and Gnetales is still weakly supported by parsimony, model-based approaches favor a clade of Gnetales and conifers, presumably because they are more resistant to long branch attraction. Inclusion of fossil taxa weakens rather than strengthens support for a relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales. Our analyses finally reconcile morphology with molecules in favoring a relationship of Gnetales to conifers, and show that morphology may therefore be useful in reconstructing other aspects of the phylogenetic history of the seed plants.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphic phenotypes of mammalian coat color have been important to the study of genetics and evolution, but little is known about the heritability and fitness consequences of variation in complex coat pattern traits in wild populations. Understanding the current evolution of coat patterns requires reliably measuring traits, quantifying heritability of the traits, and identifying the fitness consequences of specific phenotypes. Giraffe coat markings are highly variable and it has been hypothesized that variation in coat patterns most likely affects fitness by camouflaging neonates against predators. We quantified spot pattern traits of wild Masai giraffes using image analysis software, determined whether spot pattern traits were heritable, and assessed whether variation in heritable spot pattern traits was related to fitness as measured by juvenile survival. The methods we described comprise a framework for objective quantification of mammalian coat pattern traits based on photographic coat pattern data. We demonstrated that characteristics of giraffe coat spot shape are heritable. We did not find evidence for juvenile survival consequences of variation in spot traits, suggesting that spot traits are currently not under strong directional, disruptive, or stabilizing selection for neonate camouflage in our study population, but our sample size could not detect small differences in survival. Spot trait variation also may be more relevant to other components of fitness, such as adult survival or fecundity. We hope this case study will inspire further investigations of coat pattern traits.",

In this work we study the properties of LD Score regression, a recently developed method for using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to ensure that confounding does not inflate the number of false positives. We do not treat the effects of genetic variation as a random variable and thus are able to obtain results about the unbiasedness of this method. We demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce estimates of confounding at null SNPs that are unbiased or conservative under fairly general conditions. This robustness holds in the case of the parent genotype affecting the offspring phenotype through some environmental mechanism, despite the resulting correlation over SNPs between LD Scores and the degree of confounding. Additionally, we demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce reasonably robust estimates of the genetic correlation, even when its estimates of the genetic covariance and the two univariate heritabilities are substantially biased.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTunicates are the closest relatives of vertebrates and are widely used as models to study the evolutionary developmental biology of chordates. Their phylogeny, however, remains poorly understood and to date, only the 18S rRNA nuclear gene and mitogenomes have been used to delineate the major groups of tunicates. To resolve their evolutionary relationships and provide a first estimate of their divergence times, we used a transcriptomic approach to build a phylogenomic dataset including all major tunicate lineages, consisting of 258 evolutionarily conserved orthologous genes from representative species.\\n\\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses using site-heterogeneous CAT mixture models of amino acid sequence evolution resulted in a strongly supported tree topology resolving the relationships among four major tunicate clades: 1) Appendicularia, 2) Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia, 3) Molgulidae, and 4) Styelidae + Pyuridae. Notably, the morphologically derived Thaliacea are confirmed as the sister-group of the clade uniting Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia within which the precise position of the model ascidian genus Ciona remains uncertain. Relaxed molecular clock analyses accommodating the accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates reveal ancient diversification (~450-350 million years ago) among the major groups and allow comparing their evolutionary age with respect to the major vertebrate model lineages.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study represents the most comprehensive phylogenomic dataset for the main tunicate lineages. It offers a reference phylogenetic framework and first tentative timescale for tunicates, allowing the direct comparison with vertebrate model species in comparative genomics and evolutionary developmental biology studies.",

    "abstract": "The origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the legs epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments",

Whereas the binding profiles of multiple transcription factors (TFs) have been investigated, integrative analysis with the large body of public data available so as to provide an overview of the function of such noncoding regions has remained a challenge. Here we have fully integrated public ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data (n ~ 70,000), including those for 743 human transcription factors (TFs) with 97 million binding sites, and have devised a data- mining platform --designated ChIP-Atlas--to identify significant TF-genome, TF-gene, and TF-TF interactions. Using this platform, we found that TFs enriched at macrophage or T-cell enhancers also accumulated around risk loci for autoimmune diseases, whereas those enriched at hepatocyte or macrophage enhancers were preferentially detected at loci associated with HDL-cholesterol levels. Of note, we identified \\\"hotspots\\\" around such risk loci that accumulated multiple TFs and are therefore candidates for causal variants. Integrative analysis of public chromatin-profiling data is thus able to identify TFs and tissues associated with heritable disorders.",

    "abstract": "While Langevin integrators are popular in the study of equilibrium properties of complex systems, it is challenging to estimate the timestep-induced discretization error: the degree to which the sampled phase-space or configuration-space probability density departs from the desired target density due to the use of a finite integration timestep. In [1], Sivak et al. introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the KL divergence, in phase space, but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties, which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.",

In eukaryotes, oscillatory dynamics are thought to arise from interactions at the protein and RNA levels; however, the role of non-coding RNA in regulating these dynamics remains understudied. In this work, using a mathematical model, we show how non-coding RNA acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges in a conserved miRNA - transcription factor feedback motif, can give rise to oscillatory behaviour. Control of these non-coding RNA can dynamically create oscillations or stability, and we show how this behaviour predisposes to oscillations in the stochastic limit. These results, supported by emerging evidence for the role of miRNA sponges in development, point towards key roles of different species of miRNA sponges, such as circular RNA, potentially in the maintenance of yet unexplained oscillatory behaviour. These results help to provide a paradigm for understanding functional differences between the many redundant, but distinct RNA species thought to act as miRNA sponges in nature, such as long non-coding RNA, pseudogenes, competing mRNA, circular RNA, and 3 UTRs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe analyze the effects of a newly discovered species of non-coding RNA, acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, on intracellular signalling dynamics.

    "abstract": "Despite advances in experimental techniques and accumulation of large datasets concerning the composition and properties of the cortex, quantitative modeling of cortical circuits under in-vivo-like conditions remains challenging. Here we report and publicly release a biophysically detailed circuit model of layer 4 in the mouse primary visual cortex, receiving thalamo-cortical visual inputs. The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHow can we capture the incredible complexity of brain circuits in quantitative models, and what can such models teach us about mechanisms underlying brain activity? To answer these questions, we set out to build extensive, bio-realistic models of brain circuitry employing systematic datasets on brain structure and function. Here we report the first modeling results of this project, focusing on the layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse. Our simulations reproduced a variety of experimental observations in a large battery of visual stimuli. The results elucidated circuit mechanisms determining patters of neuronal activity in layer 4 - in particular, the roles of feedforward thalamic inputs and specific patterns of intracortical connectivity in producing tuning of neuronal responses to the orientation of motion. Simplification of neuronal models led to specific deficiencies in reproducing experimental data, giving insights into how biological details contribute to various aspects of brain activity. To enable future development of more sophisticated models, we make the software code, the model, and simulation results publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 as a highly transmissible pathogenic human betacoronavirus. The viral spike glycoprotein (S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host protein receptor and mediates fusion of the viral and host membranes, making S essential to viral entry into host cells and host species tropism. As SARS-CoV enters host cells, the viral S undergoes two proteolytic cleavages at S1/S2 and S2 sites necessary for efficient membrane fusion. Here, we present a cryo-EM analysis of the trimeric SARS-CoV S interactions with ACE2 and of the trypsin-cleaved S. Surprisingly, neither binding to ACE2 nor cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational changes within S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2. These observations suggest that S2 cleavage does not occur in the S prefusion conformation and that additional triggers may be required.",

    "abstract": "Many membrane proteins are thought to function as oligomers, but measuring membrane protein dimerization in native lipid membranes is particularly challenging. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are non-invasive, optical methods of choice that have been applied to the analysis of dimerization of single-spanning membrane proteins. The effects inherent to such two-dimensional systems, such as excluded volume of polytopic transmembrane proteins, proximity FRET, and rotational diffusion of fluorophore dipoles, complicate interpretation of FRET data and have not been typically accounted for. Here, using FRET and FCS we introduce methods to measure surface protein density and to estimate kappa squared, and we use Monte Carlo simulations of the FRET data to account for the proximity FRET effect occurring in confined 2D environments. We then use FRET and FCS to analyze the dimerization of human rhomboid protease RHBDL2 in its native lipid membranes. While previous reports have proposed that rhomboid proteases dimerize and this allosterically activates them, we find no evidence for stable oligomers of RHBDL2 in lipid membranes of human cells. This indicates that the rhomboid transmembrane core may be intrinsically monomeric. Finally, our findings will find use in the application of FRET and FCS for the analysis of oligomerization of transmembrane proteins in lipid membranes.",

    "abstract": "A complete description of the pathways and mechanisms of protein folding requires a detailed structural and energetic characterization of the folding energy landscape. Simulations, when corroborated by experimental data yielding global information on the folding process, can provide this level of insight. Molecular Dynamics (MD) has been associated often to force spectroscopy experiments to decipher the unfolding mechanism of titin Ig-like single- or multi-domain, the giant multi-modular protein from sarcomere, yielding information on the sequential events during titin unfolding under stretching. Here, we used high-pressure NMR to monitor the unfolding of titin I27 Ig-like single-domain and tandem. Since this method brings residue-specific information on the folding process, it can provide quasi-atomic details on this process, without the help of MD simulations. Globally, the results of our high-pressure analysis are in agreement with previous results obtained by the association of experimental measurements and MD simulation and/or protein engineering, although the intermediate folding state caused by the early detachment of the AB {beta}-sheet, often reported in previous works based on MD or force spectroscopy, cannot be detected. On the other hand, the AG parallel {beta}-sheet of the {beta}-sandwich has been confirmed as the Achilles heel of the 3D scaffold: its disruption yields complete unfolding, with very similar characteristics (free energy, unfolding volume, kinetics constant rates) for the two constructs.",

    "abstract": "Individual skeletal muscle fibers have been used to examine a wide variety of cellular functions and pathologies. Among other parameters, skeletal muscle action potential propagation has been measured to assess the integrity and function of skeletal muscle. In this paper, we utilize Di-8-ANEPPS, a potentiometric dye and mag-fluo-4, a low-affinity intracellular calcium indicator to non-invasively and reliably measure action potential conduction velocity in skeletal muscle. We used an extracellular bipolar electrode to generate an electric field that will initiate an action potential at one end of the fiber or the other. Using enzymatically dissociated flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers, we demonstrate the strength and applicability of this technique. Using high-speed line scans, we estimate the conduction velocity to be approximately 0.4 m/s. In addition to measuring the conduction velocity, we can also measure the passive electrotonic potentials elicited by pulses by either applying tetrodotoxin (TTX) or reducing the bath sodium levels. We applied these methodologies to FDB fibers under elevated extracellular potassium conditions, and found that the conduction velocity is significantly reduced compared to our control concentration. Lastly, we have constructed a circuit model of a skeletal muscle in order to predict passive polarization of the fiber by the field stimuli. Our predictions from the model fiber closely resemble the recordings acquired from in vitro assays. With these techniques, we can examine how many different pathologies and mutations affect skeletal muscle action potential propagation. Our work demonstrates the utility of using Di-8-ANEPPS or mag-fluo-4 to non-invasively measure action potential conduction velocity.",

To support the development of specific inhibitors of CAMKKs we have determined the crystal structure of CAMKK1 with two ATP-competitive inhibitors. The structures reveal small but exploitable differences between CAMKK1 and CAMKK2, despite the high sequence identity, which could be used in the generation of specific inhibitors. Screening of a kinase inhibitor library revealed molecules that bind potently to CAMKK1. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the most potent inhibitors had binding energies largely dependent on favourable enthalpy. Together, the data provide a foundation for future inhibitor development activities.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) has been suggested as one of the major processes expanding the diversity of proteomes in multicellular organisms. Mutually exclusive exons (MXE) provide one form of AS that is less likely to disrupt protein structure and is over-represented in the proteome compared to other forms of AS. We used domain structure information from the CATH classification to perform a systematic structural analysis of the effects of MXE splicing in high quality animal genomes (e.g. human, fly, mouse and 2 fishes) and we were able to annotate approximately 50% of MXE events with structural information. For those MXE events which can be mapped to a structure, we found that although embedded in domains, they were strongly enriched in surface exposed residues. We also demonstrated that the variable residues between splicing events lie close to known and/or predicted functional sites. We present some examples of MXE events in proteins that have important roles in cells. This work presents the first large scale systematic study of the structural/functional effects of MXE splicing using predominantly domain based modelling and functional annotation tools. Our study supports and expands on previous work in this field and helps to build a picture of how MXE events facilitate evolution of new functions.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase deficiency in human somatic cells results in telomere erosion and senescence. Small RNAs that target telomeres have been observed in diverse organisms but their functions are not well characterized. We define an endogenous small RNA pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that promotes heterochromatin formation at telomeres via Dicer, the perinuclear Argonaute protein WAGO-1 and the nuclear Argonaute protein HRDE-1. Loss of telomerase induces biogenesis of siRNAs that target the telomeric lncRNA TERRA, whereas loss of both telomerase and small RNA-mediated telomeric silencing induces TERRA expression, DNA damage, and an accelerated sterility phenotype. These phenotypes can be rescued by exogenous telomeric siRNAs or by loss of the DNA damage response protein EXO-1. Thus, endogenous siRNAs interact with TERRA to promote heterochromatin formation in a manner that is critical for the stability of naturally eroding telomeres. We propose that small RNA-mediated genome silencing could be broadly relevant to regulation of proliferative aging.",

On the other hand, studies on its common polymorphisms with breast cancer are very limited. In this study, we aimed to assess the presence and frequency of 4 common polymorphisms of the GR gene in the cancerous tissue samples from breast cancer patients in the Turkish population and compare them with healthy individuals. Methods: DNA samples from 86 Turkish female breast cancer patients and 86 healthy controls analysed for BclI, Tth111I, N363S and ER22/23EK polymorphisms of GR gene by PCR-RFLP. Results: N363S polymorphism was not observed in study samples. Frequency of BclI polymorphism did not differ between cases and controls but it associated with family history of cancer. The polymorphic allele frequency of Tth111I and ER22/23EK was found to be higher in cases compared to healthy samples (p<0.05). Also, a haplotype containing polymorphic variants of these two polymorphisms found to be associated with breast cancer.

    "abstract": "The genetic formation of Central and South Asian populations has been unclear because of an absence of ancient DNA. To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asia--consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVC--and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. Our results show how ancestry from the Steppe genetically linked Europe and South Asia in the Bronze Age, and identifies the populations that almost certainly were responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across much of Eurasia.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryGenome wide ancient DNA from 357 individuals from Central and South Asia sheds new light on the spread of Indo-European languages and parallels between the genetic history of two sub-continents, Europe and South Asia.",

However, limited eQTL sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restricts our ability to detect associations. Here we propose an efficient statistical method that leverages the substantial sharing of eQTLs across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes: MulTiXcan. MulTiXcan integrates evidence across multiple panels while taking into account their correlation. We apply our method to a broad set of complex traits available from the UK Biobank and show that we can detect a larger set of significantly associated genes than using each panel separately. To improve applicability, we developed an extension to work on summary statistics: S-MulTiXcan, which we show yields highly concordant results with the individual level version. Results from our analysis as well as software and necessary resources to apply our method are publicly available.",

This polygonal behavior emerges from periodic switching between the flagellar beating patterns of helical swimming 6, 9 and spinning 10 behaviors. We develop and experimentally validate a biophysical model that describes the phase relationship between the eyespot, cell orientation, light detection, and cellular reorientation, that accounts for all three behavioral states. Coordinated switching between these behaviors allows ballistic, superdiffusive, diffusive, or subdiffusive motion 11,12 (i.e., the tuning of the diffusion constant over 3 orders of magnitude) and enables navigation in structured light fields, e.g., edge avoidance and gradient descent.

The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.",

It is currently un-known if cracks in meniscus have these consequences; if they do, this would have repercussions for management of meniscus pathology. The objective of this study was to determine if a short crack in meniscus tissue, which mimics a preclinical meniscus tear, (a) causes crack growth and reduces effective strength, (b) creates a near-tip strain concentration, and (c) creates unloaded regions on either side of the crack. Specimens with and without cracks were tested in uniaxial tension and compared in terms of macroscopic stress-strain curves and digital image correlation strain fields. The strain fields were used as an indicator of stress concentrations and unloaded regions. Effective strength was found to be insensitive to the presence of a crack (potential effect < 0.86 s.d.; {beta} = 0.2), but significant strain concentrations, which have the potential to lead to long-term accumulation of tissue or cell damage, were observed near the crack tip.",

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset contains 173 early and 177 late stage samples of LIHC, was extensively analysed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early and late stages of LIHC samples with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC 0.58 with accuracy 78.87% on validation dataset. Further, we also analysed genomics and epigenomics profiles of normal and LIHC samples and developed model to classify LIHC samples with AUROC 0.99. In addition, multiclass models developed for classifying samples in normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved accuracy of 76.54% and AUROC of 0.86.\\n\\nConclusionOur study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to classification of LIHC and normal samples. Comprehensive analysis, differentially expressed RNA transcripts, methylated CpG sites in LIHC samples and prediction models are available from CancerLSP (http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cancerlsp/).",

    "abstract": "Attempts to identify and understand selection pressures responsible for local adaptation are central to evolutionary research. We tested whether populations of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), sampled across a heterogeneous environment, have more strongly diverged at quantitative traits than expected from genetic drift. We genotyped 387 trees from 19 Swiss populations at 374 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate their demographic distances, and used these to generate a null expectation for divergence in a multi-trait space including morphology and life-history traits obtained from a published common garden trial. Local soil and historical climate data were used to identify the selective environment of the source populations. Our results revealed a strong selection on height driven by temperature: trees from warm sites evolved to become taller than those from cooler sites. The evolution of growth rate, growth duration and bud break were correlated, and populations evolved towards two extreme strategies, \\\"start early and grow slow\\\" or \\\"start late and grow fast\\\", driven by precipitation seasonality. We conclude that local climate has shaped the morphology and life-history of silver fir populations since they recolonized the Alps. Our methodology provides a show-case for empirical evaluation of adaptive evolutionary strategies combining genetic data and common gardens.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities can evade competitive exclusion by diversifying into distinct ecological niches. This spontaneous diversification often occurs amid a backdrop of directional selection on other microbial traits, where competitive exclusion would normally apply. Yet despite their empirical relevance, little is known about how diversification and directional selection combine to determine the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within a community. To address this gap, we introduce a simple, empirically motivated model of eco-evolutionary feedback based on the competition for substitutable resources. Individuals acquire heritable mutations that alter resource uptake rates, either by shifting metabolic effort between resources or by increasing overall fitness. While these constitutively beneficial mutations are trivially favored to invade, we show that the accumulated fitness differences can dramatically influence the ecological structure and evolutionary dynamics that emerge within the community. Competition between ecological diversification and ongoing fitness evolution leads to a state of diversification-selection balance, in which the number of extant ecotypes can be pinned below the maximum capacity of the ecosystem, while the ecotype frequencies and genealogies are constantly in flux. Interestingly, we find that fitness differences generate emergent selection pressures to shift metabolic effort toward resources with lower effective competition, even in saturated ecosystems. We argue that similar dynamical features should emerge in a wide range of models with a mixture of directional and diversifying selection.",

We performed a meta-analysis of seven studies (a total of 1825 stool samples from 684 infants) to investigate effects of EBF compared to non-EBF on infant gut microbiota across different populations. In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age. These consistent findings across vastly different populations suggest that one of the mechanisms of short and long-term benefits of EBF may be alteration in gut microbes.",

    "abstract": "Chronically implantable neurostimulation devices are becoming a clinically viable option for treating patients with neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. Neurostimulation offers the ability to probe and manipulate distributed networks of interacting brain areas in dysfunctional circuits. Here, we use tools from network control theory to examine the dynamic reconfiguration of functionally interacting neuronal ensembles during targeted neurostimulation of cortical and subcortical brain structures. By integrating multi-modal intracranial recordings and diffusion tensor imaging from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we test hypothesized structural and functional rules that predict altered patterns of synchronized local field potentials. We demonstrate the ability to predictably reconfigure functional interactions depending on stimulation strength and location. Stimulation of areas with structurally weak connections largely modulates the functional hubness of downstream areas and concurrently propels the brain towards more difficult-to-reach dynamical states. By using focal perturbations to bridge large-scale structure, function, and markers of behavior, our findings suggest that stimulation may be tuned to influence different scales of network interactions driving cognition.",

    "abstract": "Imputation has been widely utilized to aid and interpret the results of Genome-Wide Association Studies(GWAS). Imputation can increase the power to identify associations when the causal variant was not directly observed or typed in the GWAS. There are two broad classes of methods for imputation. The first class imputes the genotypes at the untyped variants given the genotypes at the typed variants and then performs a statistical test of association at the imputed variants. The second class of methods, summary statistic imputation, directly imputes the association statics at the untyped variants given the association statistics observed at the typed variants. This second class of methods is appealing as it tends to be computationally efficient while only requiring the summary statistics from a study while the former class requires access to individual-level data that can be difficult to obtain. The statistical properties of these two classes of imputation methods have not been fully understood. In this paper, we show that the two classes of imputation methods are equivalent, i.e., have identical asymptotic multivariate normal distributions with zero mean and minor variations in the covariance matrix, under some reasonable assumptions. Using this equivalence, we can understand the effect of imputation methods on power. We show that a commonly employed modification of summary statistic imputation that we term summary statistic imputation with variance re-weighting generally leads to a loss in power. On the other hand, our proposed method, summary statistic imputation without performing variance re-weighting, fully accounts for imputation uncertainty while achieving better power.",

In this study, azotobacters, as being one potential biological regulator to enhance crops nitrogen utilization efficiency, were selected and the effects of Bt maize and non-Bt maize infected by Azospirillum brasilense and Azotobacter chroococcum on development and food utilization of target Mythimna separate were studied under ambient and elevated CO2. The results indicated that azotobacter infection significantly increased larval life-span, pupal duration, RCR and AD of M. separata, and significantly decreased RGR, ECD and ECI of M. separata fed on Bt maize; There were opposite trends in development and food utilization of M. separata fed on non-Bt maize infected with azotobacters compared with the buffer control regardless of CO2 level. Presumably, the application of azotobacter infection could make Bt maize facing lower field hazards from the target pest of M. separate, and finally improve the resistance of Bt maize against target lepidoptera pests especially under elevated CO2.\\n\\nSummary statementElevated CO2 effect on development and food utilization of target armyworm Mythimna separata fed on Bt maize infected by azotobacter, Azospirillum brasilense and Azotobacter chroococcum",

However, the mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain unclear. We examined sex differences in human myocardial gene expression in response to ischemia.\\n\\nMethodsLeft ventricular biopsies from 68 male and 46 female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery were obtained at baseline and after a median 74 minutes of cold cardioplegic arrest/ischemia and respective transcriptomes were quantified by RNA-Seq.

Cell-type enrichment analysis. was used to obtain an estimate of the identity and relative proportions of different cell types present in each sample.\\n\\nResultsA sex-specific response to ischemia was observed for 271 genes. Functional annotation analysis revealed sex-specific modulation of the oxytocin signaling pathway and common pathway of fibrin clot formation. The eQTL analysis identified variant-by-sex interaction eQTLs at baseline and post-ischemia, indicative of sex differences in the genotypic effects on gene expression, and cell-type enrichment analysis showed sex-bias in proportion of specific cell types.\\n\\nConclusionIn response to myocardial ischemia, the human left ventricle demonstrates changes in gene expression that differ between the sexes.

    "abstract": "Soft-tissue sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous and often aggressive mesenchymal cancers. Many of them are associated with poor outcome, in part because biomarkers that can reliably identify high-risk patients are lacking. Studies on sarcomas often are limited by small sample sizes rendering the identification of novel biomarkers difficult when focusing only on individual cohorts. However, the increasing number of publicly available  omics data opens inroads to overcome this obstacle.\\n\\nHere, we combine high-throughput transcriptome analyses, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays to show that high adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (AMPD2) is a robust prognostic biomarker for worse patient outcome in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). Publicly available gene expression and survival data for UPS from two independent studies, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the CINSARC reference dataset, were subjected to survival association testing. Genes, whose high expression was significantly correlated with worse outcome in both cohorts (overall and metastasis-free survival), were considered as prognostic marker candidates. The best candidate, AMPD2, was validated on protein level in an independent tissue microarray. Analysis of DNA copy-number and matched gene expression data indicated that high AMPD2 expression is significantly correlated with copy-number gains at the AMPD2 locus. Gene-set enrichment analyses of AMPD2 co-expressed genes in both UPS gene expression datasets suggested that highly AMPD2 expressing tumors are enriched in gene signatures involved in tumorigenesis. Consistent with this prediction in primary tumors, knockdown of AMPD2 by RNA interference with pooled siRNAs or a doxycycline-inducible shRNA construct in the UPS cell line FPS-1 markedly inhibited proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.\\n\\nCollectively, these results provide evidence that AMPD2 may serve as a novel biomarker for outcome prediction in UPS. Our study exemplifies how the integration of available  omics data, immunohistochemical analyses, and functional experiments can identify novel biomarkers even in a rare sarcoma, which may serve as a blueprint for biomarker identification for other rare cancers.",

    "abstract": "When vertebrates face acute stressors, their bodies rapidly undergo a repertoire of physiological and behavioral adaptations, which is termed the stress response (SR). Rapid physiological changes in heart rate and blood sugar levels occur via the interaction of glucocorticoids and their cognate receptors following hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. These physiological changes are observed within minutes of encountering a stressor and the rapid time domain rules out genomic responses that require gene expression changes. Although behavioral changes corresponding to physiological changes are commonly observed, it is not clearly understood to what extent HPA axis activation dictates adaptive behavior. We hypothesized that rapid locomotor response to acute stressors in zebrafish requires HPI axis activation. In teleost fish, interrenal cells (I) are functionally homologous to the adrenal gland cortical layer. We derived 8 frameshift mutants in genes involved in HPI axis function: two mutants in exon 2 of mc2r (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor), two in each of exon 2 and exon 5 of nr3c1 (glucocorticoid receptor), and two in exon 2 of nr3c2 (mineralocorticoid receptor). Exposing larval zebrafish to mild environmental stressors, acute changes in salinity or light illumination, results in a rapid locomotor response. We show here that this locomotor response requires a functioning HPI axis via the action of mc2r (adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor) and the canonical glucocorticoid receptor encoded by nr3c1 gene, but not mineralocorticoid receptor (nr3c2). Our rapid behavioral assay paradigm based on HPI axis biology may prove useful to screen for genetic, pharmacological, or environmental modifiers of the HPA axis.\\n\\nSignificanceAltered HPA axis activity is acknowledged as a causative and critical prognostic factor in many psychiatric disorders including depression. Nonetheless, genome wide association studies (GWAS) on depression have revealed conflicting findings about susceptibility loci, while identifying several genetic loci that warrant further investigations in the process. Such findings indicate that psychiatric disorders with complex genetic foundations require functional studies as well as genetic analyses. We developed a sensitive behavioral assay paradigm that leverages the genetic amenability and rapid development of zebrafish and demonstrated that our assay system reliably detects changes in HPA axis responsiveness. Our functional genetics and behavioral assay approach provides a useful platform to discover novel genetic, pharmacological, or environmental modifiers of the HPA axis.",

Inappropriate antibiotic claims fell from 552 to 533 claims per 1,000 beneficiaries, a 4.1% decrease (CI 3.9-4.3). Individual antibiotics had heterogeneous changes in use. For example, azithromycin claims per beneficiary decreased by 18.4% (CI 18.2-18.7) while levofloxacin claims increased by 28.1% (CI 27.5-28.6). Azithromycin use associated with each of the potentially appropriate and inappropriate respiratory diagnoses we considered decreased, while levofloxacin use associated with each of those diagnoses increased.\\n\\nConclusionAmong US Medicare beneficiaries, overall antibiotic use and inappropriate use declined modestly, but individual drugs experienced divergent changes in use. Trends in drug use across indications were stronger than trends in use for individual indications, suggesting that guidelines and concerns about antibiotic resistance were not major drivers of change in antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Infectious disease transmission in animals is an inherently spatial process in which a hosts home location and their social mixing patterns are important, with the mixing of infectious individuals often different to that of susceptible individuals. Although incidence data for humans have traditionally been aggregated into low-resolution data sets, modern representative surveillance systems such as electronic hospital records generate high volume case data with precise home locations. Here, we use a high resolution gridded spatial transmission model of arbitrary resolution to investigate the theoretical relationship between population density, differential population movement and local variability in incidence. We show analytically that uniform local attack rate is only possible for individual pixels in the grid if susceptible and infectious individuals move in the same way. Using a population in Guangdong, China, for which a robust quantitative description of movement is available (a movement kernel), and a natural history consistent with pandemic influenza; we show that for the estimated kernel, local cumulative incidence is positively correlated with population density when susceptible individuals are more connected in space than infectious individuals. Conversely, when infectious individuals are more connected, local cumulative incidence is negatively correlated with population density. The amplitude of correlation is substantial for the estimated kernel. However, the strength and direction of correlation changes sign for other kernel parameter values. These results describe a precise relationship between the spatio-social mixing of infectious and susceptible individuals and local variability in attack rates, and suggest a plausible mechanism for the counter-intuitive scenario in which local incidence is lower on average in less dense populations. Also, these results suggest that if spatial transmission models are implemented at high resolution to investigate local disease dynamics, including micro-tuning of interventions, the underlying detailed assumptions about the mechanisms of transmission become more important than when similar studies are conducted at larger spatial scales.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe know that some places have higher rates of infectious disease than others. However, at the moment, we usually only measure these differences for large towns and cities. With modern data, such as those we can get from mobile phones, we can measure rates of infection at much smaller scales. In this paper, we used a computer simulation of an epidemic to propose ways that rates of incidence in small local areas might be related to population density. We found that if infectious people are better connected than non-infectious people, perhaps because they receive visitors, then, on average, higher density areas would have lower rates of infection. If infectious people were less connected than non-infectious people then higher density areas would have higher rates of infection. As data get more accurate, this type of analysis will allow us to propose and test ways to optimize interventions such as the delivery of vaccines and antivirals during a pandemic.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the thousands of deaths due the unprecedented ebola outbreak that stroke West Africa (2014-2016), national health systems in affected countries were deeply challenged impacting a number of diseases control programs. Here we describe the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a deadly neglected tropical disease due to a trypanosome transmitted by tsetse flies for which no vaccine nor chemoprophylaxis exists. Data are presented for the disease focus of Boffa in Guinea where a pilot elimination project combining medical screening and vector control was launched in 2012. During ebola, HAT active screening activities were postponed and passive surveillance also was progressively impaired. However, tsetse control using small insecticide impregnated targets could be maintained. The over two years disruption of screening activities led to a dramatic increase of HAT prevalence, from 0.7% in 2013 (21/2885) to 2% (69/3448) in 2016, reaching epidemic levels (>5%) in some villages. In deep contrast, control levels reached in 2013 (0.1%; 7/6564) were maintained in areas covered with impregnated targets as no cases were found in 2016 (0/799). In Boffa, ebola has thus incidentally provided a unique framework to assess the impact of current HAT control strategies. A first lesson is that the \\\"screen and treat\\\" strategy is fragile as rapid bursts of the disease may occur in case of disruption. A second lesson is that vector control reducing human-tsetse contacts, even implemented alone, is effective in providing a good level of protection against infection. This advocates for a greater attention being paid to the combination of tsetse control together with medical activities in aiming to reach the HAT elimination objective in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), is highly prevalent in the United States. Epidemiological systems for surveillance of CKD rely on data that are based solely on the NHANES survey, which does not include many patients with the most severe and less frequent forms of CKD. We investigated the feasibility of estimating CKD prevalence from the large-scale community disease detection Kidney Early Evaluation and Program (KEEP, n = 127,149). We adopted methodologies from the field of web surveys to address the self-selection bias inherent in KEEP. Primary outcomes studied were CKD Stage 3-5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and CKD Stage 4-5 (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2). The unweighted prevalence of Stage 4-5 CKD was higher in KEEP (1.00%, 95%CI: 0.94-1.05%) than in NHANES (0.51%, 95% CI: 0.43-0.59%). Application of a selection model with IPW of variables related to demographics, recruitment and socio-economic factors resulted in estimates similar to NHANES (0.55%, 95% CI: 0.50-0.60%). Weighted prevalence of Stages 3-5 CKD in KEEP was 6.45% (95% CI: 5.70 7.28%) compared to 6.73% (95% CI: 6.30-7.19%) for NHANES. Application of methodologies that address the self-selection bias in the KEEP program may allow the use of this large, geographically diverse dataset for CKD surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Social contact data are increasingly being used to inform models for infectious disease spread with the aim of guiding effective policies on disease prevention and control. In this paper, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. Our primary focus is to identify the designs that have worked best and the most important determinants and to highlight the most robust [fi]ndings.\\n\\nTwo publicly accessible online databases were systematically searched for articles regarding social contact surveys. PRISMA guidelines were followed as closely as possible. In total, 64 social contact surveys were identi[fi]ed. These surveys were conducted in 24 countries, and more than 80% of the surveys were conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools/universities (37%) and health care/conference/research institutes (5%). The majority of studies did not focus on a speci[fi]c age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective and prospective designs were used mostly (45% and 41% of the surveys, respectively) with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The de[fi]nition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g. a non-physical contact may require conversation, close proximity or both. Age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend) and household size were identi[fi]ed as relevant determinants for contact pattern across a large number of studies. The surveys present a wide range of study designs. Throughout, we found that the overall contact patterns were remarkably robust for the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, de[fi]nition of contact), we could identify a common practice approach that can be used to facilitate comparison between studies and for benchmarking future studies.",

    "abstract": "The role of chorioamnionitis (CA) in the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is difficult to establish, because CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants frequently present different baseline characteristics. We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting on the association between CA and ROP. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles. Studies were included if they examined preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500g) infants and reported primary data that could be used to measure the association between exposure to CA and the presence of ROP. Of 748 potentially relevant studies, 50 studies met the inclusion criteria (38,986 infants, 9,258 CA cases). Meta-analysis showed a significant positive association between CA and any stage ROP (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 1.74). CA was also associated with severe (stage [&ge;]3) ROP (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.89). Exposure to funisitis was associated with a higher risk of ROP than exposure to CA in the absence of funisitis. Additional meta-analyses showed that infants exposed to CA had lower gestational age (GA) and lower birth weight (BW). Meta-regression showed that lower GA and BW in the CA-exposed group was significantly associated with a higher risk of ROP. In conclusion, our study confirms that CA is a risk factor for developing ROP. However, part of the effects of CA on the pathogenesis of ROP may be mediated by the role of CA as an etiological factor for very preterm birth.",

However, empirical studies suggest that some synonymous mutations can have phenotypic consequences. Here we show that in contrast to the current dogma, natural selection on gene-specific codon usage bias is common across Eukaryota. Furthermore, by using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that specific combinations of rare codons contribute to the spatial and sex-related regulation of some protein-coding genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Together, these data indicate that natural selection can shape gene-specific codon usage bias, which therefore, represents an overlooked genomic feature that is likely to play an important role in the spatial and temporal regulation of gene functions. Hence, the broadly accepted dogma that synonymous mutations are in general functionally neutral should be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Immune correlates for protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and other intracellular pathogens are largely undetermined. Whether there is a role for antibody-mediated immunity is controversial. Rhodococcus equi is an intracellular pathogen causing severe pneumonia in young horse foals, eliciting a disease with many similarities to TB including intracellular residence, formation of granulomas and induction of severe respiratory distress. No purified vaccine antigens exist for R. equi or Mtb infections. Both express the microbial surface polysaccharide antigen poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG). Vaccination of pregnant mares with a synthetic PNAG oligosaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid elicited antibody that transferred to foals via colostrum and provided nearly complete protection against R. equi pneumonia in a randomized, controlled, blinded challenge trial. Infusion of PNAG-hyperimmune plasma protected 100% of foals against R. equi pneumonia. Vaccination induced opsonic antibodies that killed extracellular and intracellular R. equi and other intracellular pathogens. Killing of intracellular organisms was dependent on antibody recognition of surface expression of PNAG on infected macrophages, complement deposition and PMN-assisted lysis of infected macrophages. Protection also correlated with PBMC release of interferon-{gamma} in response to PNAG. Antibody-mediated opsonic killing and interferon-{gamma} release in response to PNAG may protect against disease caused by intracellular bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus infection induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular signalling pathway composed of three branches, triggered by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to high ER load. We have used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate holistically the transcriptional and translational response to cellular infection by murine hepatitis virus (MHV), often used as a model for the Betacoronavirus genus to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 also belongs. We found the UPR to be amongst the most significantly up-regulated pathways in response to MHV infection. To confirm and extend these observations, we show experimentally the induction of all three branches of the UPR in both MHV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Over-expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 or S proteins alone is itself sufficient to induce the UPR. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of the UPR greatly reduced the replication of both MHV and SARS-CoV-2, revealing the importance of this pathway for successful coronavirus replication. This was particularly striking when both IRE1 and ATF6 branches of the UPR were inhibited, reducing SARS-CoV-2 virion release [~]1,000-fold. Together, these data highlight the UPR as a promising antiviral target to combat coronavirus infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in over 100 million cases since the end of 2019. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without any special treatment. However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems like chronic respiratory disease are more likely to develop a serious illness. So far, more than 2 million people have died of COVID-19. Unfortunately, there is no specific medication for this viral disease.\n\nIn order to produce viral proteins and to replicate their genetic information, all coronaviruses use a cellular structure known as the endoplasmic reticulum or ER. However, the massive production and modification of viral proteins stresses the ER and this activates a compensatory cellular response that tries to reduce ER protein levels. This is termed the unfolded protein response or UPR. We believe that coronaviruses take advantage of the activation of the UPR to enhance their replication.\n\nThe UPR is also activated in some types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and UPR inhibitor drugs have been developed to tackle these diseases. In this work, we have tested some of these compounds in human lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that virus production was reduced 1000-fold in human lung cells.",

    "abstract": "How living cells employ counting mechanisms to regulate their numbers or density is a long-standing problem in developmental biology that ties directly with organism or tissue size. Diverse cells types have been shown to regulate their numbers via secretion of factors in the extracellular space. These factors act as a proxy for the number of cells and function to reduce cellular proliferation rates creating a negative feedback. It is desirable that the production rate of such factors be kept as low as possible to minimize energy costs and detection by predators. Here we formulate a stochastic model of cell proliferation with feedback control via a secreted extracellular factor. Our results show that while low levels of feedback minimizes random fluctuations in cell numbers around a given set point, high levels of feedback amplify Poisson fluctuations in secreted-factor copy numbers. This trade-off results in an optimal feedback strength, and sets a fundamental limit to noise suppression in cell numbers. Intriguingly, this fundamental limit depends additively on two variables: relative half-life of the secreted factor with respect to the cell proliferation rate, and the average number of factors secreted in a cells lifespan. We further expand the model to consider external disturbances in key physiological parameters, such as, proliferation and factor synthesis rates. Intriguingly, while negative feedback effectively mitigates disturbances in the proliferation rate, it amplifies disturbances in the synthesis rate. In summary, these results provide unique insights into the functioning of feedback-based counting mechanisms, and apply to organisms ranging from unicellular prokaryotes and eukaryotes to human cells.",
