    "abstract": "Prokaryotes are under nearly constant attack by viral pathogens. To protect against this threat of infection, bacteria and archaea have evolved a wide array of defense mechanisms, singly and in combination. While immune diversity in a single organism likely reduces the chance of pathogen evolutionary escape, it remains puzzling why many prokaryotes also have multiple, seemingly redundant, copies of the same type of immune system. Here, we focus on the highly flexible CRISPR adaptive immune system, which is present in multiple copies in a surprising 28% of the prokaryotic genomes in RefSeq. We use a comparative genomics approach looking across all prokaryotes to demonstrate that, on average, organisms are under selection to maintain more than one CRISPR array. We hypothesize that a tradeoff between memory span and learning speed could select for both \\\"long-term memory\\\" and \\\"short-term memory\\\" CRISPR arrays, and we go on to develop a mathematical model to show that such a tradeoff could, in theory, lead to selection for multiple arrays.",

    "abstract": "Introns are removed by the spliceosome, a large macromolecular complex composed of five ribonucleoprotein subcomplexes (U snRNP). The U1 snRNP, which binds to 5 splice sites, plays an essential role in early steps of the splicing reaction. Here, we show that Arabidopsis LUC7 proteins, which are encoded by a three-member gene family in Arabidopsis, are important for plant development and stress resistance. We show that LUC7 are U1 snRNP accessory proteins by RNA immunoprecipitation experiments and LUC7 protein complex purifications. Transcriptome analyses revealed that LUC7 proteins are not only important for constitutive splicing, but also affects hundreds of alternative splicing events. Interestingly, LUC7 proteins specifically promote splicing of a subset of terminal introns. Splicing of LUC7-dependent introns is a prerequisite for nuclear export and some splicing events are modulated by stress in a LUC7-dependent manner. Taken together our results highlight the importance of the U1 snRNP component LUC7 in splicing regulation and suggest a previously unrecognized role of a U1 snRNP accessory factor in terminal intron splicing.",

    "abstract": "Methylation at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is a highly prevalent and reversible modification within eukaryotic mRNAs that has been linked to many stages of RNA processing and fate. Recent studies suggest that m6A deposition and proteins involved in the m6A pathway play a diverse set of roles in either restricting or modulating the lifecycles of select viruses. Here, we report that m6A levels are significantly increased in cells infected with the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Transcriptome-wide m6A-sequencing of the KSHV-positive renal carcinoma cell line iSLK.219 during lytic reactivation revealed the presence of m6A across multiple kinetic classes of viral transcripts, and a concomitant decrease in m6A levels across much of the host transcriptome. However, we found that depletion of the m6A machinery had differential pro- and anti-viral impacts on viral gene expression depending on the cell-type analyzed. In iSLK.219 and iSLK.BAC16 cells the pathway functioned in a pro-viral manner, as depletion of the m6A writer METTL3 and the reader YTHDF2 significantly impaired virion production. In iSLK.219 cells the defect was linked to their roles in the post-transcriptional accumulation of the major viral lytic transactivator ORF50, which is m6A modified. In contrast, although the ORF50 mRNA was also m6A modified in KSHV infected B cells, ORF50 protein expression was instead increased upon depletion of METTL3, or, to a lesser extent, YTHDF2. These results highlight that the m6A pathway is centrally involved in regulating KSHV gene expression, and underscore how the outcome of this dynamically regulated modification can vary significantly between cell types.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn addition to its roles in regulating cellular RNA fate, methylation at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) of mRNA has recently emerged as a mechanism for regulating viral infection. While it has been known for over 40 years that the mRNA of nuclear replicating DNA viruses contain m6A, only recently have studies began to examine the distribution of this modification across viral transcripts, as well as characterize its functional impact upon viral lifecycles. Here, we apply m6A-sequencing to map the location of m6A modifications throughout the transcriptome of the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We show that the m6A machinery functions in a cell type specific manner to either promote or inhibit KSHV gene expression. Thus, the KSHV lifecycle is impacted by the m6A pathway, but the functional outcome may depend on cell lineage specific differences in m6A-based regulation.",

    "abstract": "As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records of the growth of the field over time.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn recent years single-cell RNA-sequeing technologies have emerged that allow scientists to measure the activity of genes in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. This means we can start to look at what each cell in a sample is doing instead of considering an average across all cells in a sample, as was the case with older technologies. However, while access to this kind of data presents a wealth of opportunities it comes with a new set of challenges. Researchers across the world have developed new methods and software tools to make the most of these datasets but the field is moving at such a rapid pace it is difficult to keep up with what is currently available. To make this easier we have developed the scRNA-tools database and website (www.scRNA-tools.org). Our database catalogues analysis tools, recording the tasks they can be used for, where they can be downloaded from and the publications that describe how they work. By looking at this database we can see that developers have focued on methods specific to single-cell data and that they embrace an open-source approach with permissive licensing, sharing of code and preprint publications.",

In this study, we employed an ATCOPIA93 Long terminal repeats (LTR) promoter-GUS fusion to show that this retrotransposon behaves like an immune-responsive gene during plant defense in Arabidopsis. We also showed that the reactivation of the endogenous ATCOPIA93 copy \\\"EVD\\\", in the presence of bacterial stress, is not only negatively regulated by DNA methylation but also by Polycomb-mediated silencing--a mode of repression typically found at protein-coding and microRNA genes. Interestingly, one of the ATCOPIA93-derived soloLTRs is located upstream of the disease resistance gene RPP4 and is devoid of either DNA methylation or H3K27m3 marks. Through loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that this soloLTR is required for proper expression of RPP4 during plant defense, thus linking the responsiveness of ATCOPIA93 to biotic stress and the co-option of its LTR for plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "Short time-scale observations are valuable for understanding microbial ecological processes. We assessed dynamics in relative abundance and potential activities by sequencing the small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA gene) and rRNA molecules (rRNA) of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota once to twice-daily between March 2014 and May 2014 from the surface ocean off Catalina Island, California. Typically Ostreococcus, Braarudosphaera, Teleaulax, and Synechococcus dominated phytoplankton sequences (including chloroplasts) while SAR11, Sulfitobacter, and Fluviicola dominated non-phytoplankton Bacteria and Archaea. We observed short-lived increases of diatoms, mostly Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros, with quickly responding Bacteria and Archaea including Flavobacteriaceae (Polaribacter & Formosa), Roseovarius, and Euryarchaeota (MGII), notably the exact amplicon sequence variants we observed responding similarly to another diatom bloom nearby, three years prior. We observed correlations representing known interactions among abundant phytoplankton rRNA sequences, demonstrating the biogeochemical and ecological relevance of such interactions: 1) The kleptochloroplastidic ciliate Mesodinium 18S rRNA gene sequences and a single Teleaulax taxon (via 16S rRNA gene sequences) were correlated (Spearman r =0.83) yet uncorrelated to a Teleaulax 18S rRNA gene OTU, or any other taxon (consistent with a kleptochloroplastidic or karyoklepty relationship) and 2) the photosynthetic prymnesiophyte Braarudosphaera bigelowii and two strains of diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A were correlated and each taxon was also correlated to other taxa, including B. bigelowii to a verrucomicrobium and a dictyochophyte phytoplankter (all r > 0.8). We also report strong correlations (r > 0.7) between various ciliates, bacteria, and phytoplankton, suggesting interactions via currently unknown mechanisms. These data reiterate the utility of high-frequency time-series to show rapid microbial reactions to stimuli, and provide new information about in-situ dynamics of previously recognized and hypothesized interactions.",

    "abstract": "Division of labor within and between the worker and queen castes is thought to underlie the tremendous success of social insects. Colonies might benefit if subsets of nurse workers specialize further in caring for larvae of a certain stage or caste, given that larval nutritional requirements depend on stage and caste. We used short- (<1 hr) and long-term (ten days) behavioral observations to determine whether nurses of the pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis) exhibit such specialization. We found that nurses were behaviorally specialized based on larval instar but not on larval caste. This specialization was widespread, with 56% of nurses in the short-term and between 22-27% in the long-term showing significant specialization. Additionally, we identified [~]200 genes that were differentially expressed in nurse head and abdominal tissues between nurses feeding young versus old larvae. These included 18 genes predicted to code for secreted proteins, which may be passed from nurses to larvae via trophallaxis, as well as vitellogenin and major royal jelly protein-1, which have previously been implicated in the transfer of nutrition from nurse to larvae and the regulation of larval development and caste in social insects. Altogether, our results provide the first evidence in any social insect for a division of labor among nurse workers based on larval stage, and our study begins to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this specialization.",

    "abstract": "Test-negative designs have become commonplace in assessments of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness. Vaccine effectiveness is measured from the exposure odds ratio (OR) of vaccination among individuals seeking treatment for acute respiratory illness and receiving a laboratory test for influenza infection. This approach is widely believed to correct for differential healthcare-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. However, the relation of the measured OR to true vaccine effectiveness is poorly understood. We derive the OR under circumstances of real-world test-negative studies. The OR recovers the true vaccine direct effect when two conditions are met: (1) that individuals vaccination decisions are uncorrelated with exposure or susceptibility to infection, and (2) that vaccination confers \\\"all-or-nothing\\\" protection (whereby certain individuals have no protection while others are perfectly protected). Biased effect size estimates arise if either condition is unmet. Such bias may suggest misleading associations of the OR with time since vaccination or the force of infection of influenza. The test-negative design may also fail to correct for differential healthcare-seeking behavior among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons without stringent criteria for enrollment and testing. Our findings demonstrate a need to reassess how data from test-negative studies are interpreted for policy decisions conventionally based on causal inferences.",

We developed a multifunction new method, Topographer to construct a  quantitative Waddingtons landscape of single-cell transcriptomic data. This method is able to identify complex cell-state transition trajectories and to estimate complex cell-type dynamics characterized by fate and transition probabilities. It also infers both marker gene networks and their dynamic changes as well as dynamic characteristics of transcriptional bursting along the cell-state transition trajectories. Applying this method to single-cell RNA-seq data on the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, we not only identified three known cell types but also estimated both their fate probabilities and transition probabilities among them. We found that the percent of genes expressed in a bursty manner is significantly higher at (or near) the branch point ([~]97%) than before or after branch (below 80%), and that both gene-gene and cell-cell correlation degrees are apparently lower near the branch point than away from the branching. Topographer allows revealing of cell fate mechanisms in a coherent way at three scales: cell lineage (macroscopic), gene network (mesoscopic) and gene expression (microscopic).",

    "abstract": "The recognition of the group Archaea as a major branch of the Tree of Life (ToL) prompted a new view of the evolution of biodiversity. The genomic representation of archaeal biodiversity has since significantly increased. In addition, advances in phylogenetic modeling of multi-locus datasets have resolved many recalcitrant branches of the ToL. Despite the technical advances and an expanded taxonomic representation, two important aspects of the origins and evolution of the Archaea remain controversial, even as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the monumental discovery. These issues concern (i) the uniqueness (monophyly) of the Archaea, and (ii) the evolutionary relationships of the Archaea to the Bacteria and the Eukarya; both of these are relevant to the deep structure of the ToL. Here, to explore the causes for this persistent ambiguity, I examine multiple datasets that support contradicting conclusions. Results indicate that the uncertainty is primarily due to a scarcity of information in standard datasets -- the core genes datasets -- to reliably resolve the conflicts. These conflicts can be resolved efficiently by comparing patterns of variation in the distribution of functional genomic signatures, which are less diffused unlike patterns of primary sequence variation. Relatively lower heterogeneity in distribution patterns minimizes uncertainties, which supports statistically robust phylogenetic inferences, especially of the earliest divergences of life. This case study further highlights the limits of primary sequence data in resolving difficult phylogenetic problems and casts doubt on evolutionary inferences drawn solely from the analyses of a small set of core genes.",

Fine mapping and knockdown experiments identify the gene Wolbachia density suppressor (Wds), which dominantly suppresses bacterial transmission from mother to embryo.

    "abstract": "Point spread function (PSF) engineering is used in single emitter localization to measure the emitter position in 3D and possibly other parameters such as the emission color or dipole orientation as well. Advanced PSF models such as spline fits to experimental PSFs or the vectorial PSF model can be used in the corresponding localization algorithms in order to model the intricate spot shape and deformations correctly. The complexity of the optical architecture and fit model makes PSF engineering approaches particularly sensitive to optical aberrations. Here, we present a calibration and alignment protocol for fluorescence microscopes equipped with a spatial light modulator (SLM) with the goal of establishing a wavefront error well below the diffraction limit for optimum application of complex engineered PSFs. We achieve high-precision wavefront control, to a level below 20 m{lambda} wavefront aberration over a 30 minute time window after the calibration procedure, using a separate light path for calibrating the pixel-to-pixel variations of the SLM, and alignment of the SLM with respect to the optical axis and Fourier plane within 3 {micro}m (x/y) and 100 {micro}m (z) error. Aberrations are retrieved from a fit of the vectorial PSF model to a bead z-stack and compensated with a residual wavefront error comparable to the error of the SLM calibration step. This well-calibrated and corrected setup makes it possible to create complex  3D+{lambda} PSFs that fit very well to the vectorial PSF model. Proof-of-principle bead experiments show precisions below 10 nm in x, y, and{lambda} , and below 20 nm in z over an axial range of 1 {micro}m with 2000 signal photons and 12 background photons.",

    "abstract": "A common goal of microbiome studies is the elucidation of community composition and member interactions using counts of taxonomic units extracted from sequence data. Inference of interaction networks from sparse and compositional data requires specialised statistical approaches. A popular solution is SparCC, however its performance limits the calculation of interaction networks for very high-dimensional datasets. Here we introduce FastSpar, an efficient and parallelisable implementation of the SparCC algorithm which rapidly infers correlation networks and calculates p-values using an unbiased estimator. We further demonstrate that FastSpar reduces network inference wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to SparCC. FastSpar source code, precompiled binaries, and platform packages are freely available on GitHub: github.com/scwatts/FastSpar",

    "abstract": "One of the basics and fundamentals problems in ecology is understand the factors that shape the spatial patterns in the distribution of the species and the coexistence of close relatives species. Among the most important factors governing the distributions and the coexistence of species are the spatiotemporal changes occurring in the microhabitat heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the heterogeneity of microhabitats and how they have an effect in the spatial segregation of two species of small mammals (i. e., Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis), which coexist in a temperate, mixed forest. We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.",

    "abstract": "Many brain functions depend on the ability of neural networks to temporally integrate transient inputs to produce sustained discharges. This can occur through cell-autonomous mechanisms in individual neurons or through reverberating activity in recurrently connected neural networks. We report a third mechanism involving temporal integration of neural activity by a network of astrocytes. Previously, we showed that some types of interneurons can generate long-lasting trains of action potentials for tens of seconds (\\\"barrage firing\\\") following repeated depolarizing stimuli. Here, we show that calcium signaling in an astrocytic network correlates with barrage firing; that active depolarization of astrocyte networks by chemical or optogenetic stimulation enhances barrage firing; and that chelating internal calcium, inhibiting release from internal stores, or inhibiting GABA transporters or metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibited barrage firing. Thus, through complex molecular processes, networks of interconnected astrocytes influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural networks by directly integrating neural activity and driving long-lasting barrages of action potentials in some populations of inhibitory interneurons.",

    "abstract": "Human populations out of Africa have experienced at least two bouts of introgression from archaic humans, from Neanderthals and Denisovans. In Papuans there is prior evidence of both these introgressions. Here we present a new approach to detect segments of individual genomes of archaic origin without using an archaic reference genome. The approach is based on a hidden Markov model that identifies genomic regions with a high density of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) not seen in unadmixed populations. We show using simulations that this provides a powerful approach to identifying segments of archaic introgression with a small rate of false detection. Furthermore our approach is able to accurately infer admixture proportions and divergence time of human and archaic populations.\\n\\nWe apply the model to detect archaic introgression in 89 Papuans and show how the identified segments can be assigned to likely Neanderthal or Denisovan origin. We report more Denisovan admixture than previous studies and directly find a shift in size distribution of fragments of Neanderthal and Denisovan origin that is compatible with a difference in admixture time. Furthermore, we identify small amounts of Denisova ancestry in West Eurasians, South East Asians and South Asians.",

    "abstract": "We used transient biochemical and structural kinetics to elucidate the molecular mechanism of mavacamten, an allosteric cardiac myosin inhibitor and prospective treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We find that mavacamten stabilizes an auto-inhibited state of two-headed cardiac myosin, not found in the isolated S1 myosin motor fragment. We determined this by measuring cardiac myosin actin-activated and actin-independent ATPase and single ATP turnover kinetics. A two-headed myosin fragment exhibits distinct auto-inhibited ATP turnover kinetics compared to a single-headed fragment. Mavacamten enhanced this auto-inhibition. It also enhanced auto-inhibition of ADP release. Furthermore, actin changes the structure of the auto-inhibited state by forcing myosin lever-arm rotation. Mavacamten slows this rotation in two-headed myosin but does not prevent it. We conclude that cardiac myosin is regulated in solution by an interaction between its two heads and propose that mavacamten stabilizes this state.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSmall-molecule allosteric effectors designed to target and modulate striated and smooth myosin isoforms for the treatment of disease show promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Beta-cardiac myosin is an especially important target, as heart disease remains a primary cause of death in the U.S. One prevalent type of heart disease is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is hypothesized to result from dysregulated force generation by cardiac myosin. Mavacamten is a potent cardiac myosin ATPase activity inhibitor that improves cardiac output in HCM animal models. Our results show that mavacamten selectively stabilizes a two-head dependent, auto-inhibited state of cardiac myosin in solution. The kinetics and energetics of this state are consistent with the auto-inhibited super-relaxed state, previously only observed in intact sarcomeres.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor Nrf2 is a master regulator of antioxidant and/or electrophile response elements (AREs/EpREs)driven genes involved in homeostasis, detoxification and adaptation to various stresses. The cytoprotective activity of Nrf2, though being oppositely involved in both cancer prevention and progression, is critically controlled by Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) as an adaptor subunit of Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, that is a key sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stresses. Now, we first report a novel naturally-occurring mutant of Keap1, designated Keap1{Delta}C, which lacks most of its C-terminal Nrf2-interacting domain essential for inhibition of the CNC-bZIP factor. This mutant Keap1{Delta}C is yielded by translation from an alternatively mRNA-spliced variant lacking the fourth and fifth exons, but their coding sequences are retained in the wild-type Keap1 locus (with no genomic deletions). Although this variant was found primarily in the human highly-metastatic hepatoma (MHCC97H) cells, it was widely expressed at very lower levels in all other cell lines examined. No matter whether Keap1{Delta}C retains less or no ability to inhibit Nrf2, it functions as a dominant-negative competitor of Keap1 against its inhibition of Nrf2-target genes. This is due to its antagonist effect on Keap1-mediated turnover of Nrf2 protein.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of microbial and viral organisms often generates clonal interference, a mode of competition between genetic clades within a population. In this paper, we show that interference strongly constrains the genetic and phenotypic complexity of evolving systems. Our analysis uses biophysically grounded evolutionary models for an organisms quantitative molecular phenotypes, such as fold stability and enzymatic activity of genes. We find a generic mode of asexual evolution called phenotypic interference with strong implications for systems biology: it couples the stability and function of individual genes to the populations global speed of evolution. This mode occurs over a wide range of evolutionary parameters appropriate for microbial populations. It generates selection against genome complexity, because the fitness cost of mutations increases faster than linearly with the number of genes. Recombination can generate a distinct mode of sexual evolution that eliminates the superlinear cost. We show that positive selection can drive a transition from asexual to facultative sexual evolution, providing a specific, biophysically grounded scenario for the evolution of sex. In a broader context, our analysis suggests that the systems biology of microbial organisms is strongly intertwined with their mode of evolution.",

    "abstract": "MotivationViruses populate their hosts as a viral quasispecies: a collection of genetically related mutant strains. Viral quasispecies assembly refers to reconstructing the strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains, an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference-genome-independent (\\\"de novo\\\") approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. It remains to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs.\\n\\nMethodWe first construct a variation graph, a recently popular, suitable structure for arranging and integrating several related genomes, from the short input contigs, without making use of a reference genome. To obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances.\\n\\nResultsBenchmarking experiments on challenging simulated data sets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates. As a consequence, our method outperforms all state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers that aim at the construction of full-length haplotypes, in terms of various relevant assembly measures.

    "abstract": "Soil microbes are known to be involved in a number of essential ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, plant productivity and the maintenance of plant species diversity. However, how plant species diversity and identity affect soil microbial diversity and community composition is largely unknown. We tested whether, over the course of 11 years, distinct soil bacterial communities developed under plant monocultures and mixtures, and if over this timeframe plants with a monoculture or mixture history changed in the microbial communities they associated with. For eight species, we grew offspring of plants that had been grown for 11 years in the same monocultures or mixtures (monoculture- or mixture-type plants) in pots inoculated with microbes extracted from the monoculture and mixture soils. After five months of growth in the glasshouse, we collected rhizosphere soil from each plant and used 16S-rRNA gene sequencing to determine the community composition and diversity of the bacterial communities. Microbial community structure in the plant rhizosphere was primarily determined by soil legacy (monoculture vs. mixture soil) and by plant species identity, but not by plant legacy (monoculture- vs. mixture-type plants). In seven out of the eight plant species bacterial abundance was larger when inoculated with microbes from mixture soil. We conclude that plant diversity can strongly affect belowground community composition and diversity, feeding back to the assemblage of rhizosphere microbial communities in newly establishing plants. Thereby our work demonstrates that concerns for plant biodiversity loss are also concerns for soil biodiversity loss.",

Previous research has shed light on factors that determine egg quality, however, large gaps remain. Initial development of the embryo relies on maternally-inherited molecules, such as transcripts, deposited in the egg, thus, they would likely reflect egg quality. We performed transcriptome analysis on zebrafish fertilized eggs of different quality from unrelated, wildtype couples to obtain a global portrait of the egg transcriptome to determine its association with developmental competence and to identify new candidate maternal-effect genes.\\n\\nResultsFifteen of the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Gene ontology analysis showed that enriched terms included ribosomes and translation. In addition, statistical modeling using partial least squares regression and genetics algorithm also demonstrated that gene signatures from the transcriptomic data can be used to predict reproductive success. Among the validated DEGs, otulina and slc29a1a were found to be increased in good quality eggs and to be predominantly localized in the ovaries. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutants of each gene revealed remarkable subfertility whereby the majority of their embryos were unfertilizable. The Wnt pathway appeared to be dysregulated in the otulina knockout-derived eggs.\\n\\nConclusionsOur novel findings suggested that even in varying quality of eggs due to heterogeneous causes from unrelated wildtype couples, gene signatures exist in the egg transcriptome, which can be used to predict developmental competence. Further, transcriptomic profiling revealed two new potential maternal-effect genes that have essential roles in vertebrate reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Frequent blooms of phytoplankton occur in coastal upwelling zones creating hotspots of biological productivity in the ocean. As cold, nutrient-rich water is brought up to sunlit layers from depth, phytoplankton are also transported upwards to seed surface blooms that are often dominated by diatoms. The physiological response of phytoplankton to this process, commonly referred to as shift-up, is characterized by rapid growth rates and increases in nitrate assimilation. To examine the molecular underpinnings behind this phenomenon, metatranscriptomics was applied to a simulated upwelling experiment using natural phytoplankton communities from the California Upwelling Zone. An increase in diatom growth following five days of incubation was attributed to the genera Chaetoceros and Pseudo-nitzschia. Here we show that certain bloom-forming diatoms exhibit a distinct transcriptional response that coordinates shift-up where diatoms exhibited the greatest transcriptional change following upwelling; however, comparison of coexpressed genes exposed overrepresentation of distinct sets within each of the dominant phytoplankton groups. The analysis revealed that diatoms frontload genes involved in nitrogen assimilation likely in order to outcompete other groups for available nitrogen during upwelling events. We speculate that the evolutionary success of diatoms may be due, in part, to this proactive response to frequently encountered changes in their environment.",

    "abstract": "The recent nomination by the World Health Organization of Acinetobacter baumannii as the number one priority pathogen for the development of new antibiotics is a direct consequence of its fast evolution of pathogenicity, and in particular of multidrug resistance. While the development of new antibiotics is critical, understanding the mechanisms behind the crescent bacterial pathogenicity is equally relevant. Often, resistance and other bacterial virulence elements are contained on highly mobile pieces of DNA that can easily spread to other bacteria. Prophages are one of the mediators of this form of gene transfer, and have been frequently found in bacterial genomes, often offering advantageous features to the host. Here we question the contribution of prophages for the evolution of A. baumannii pathogenicity. We found prophages to be notably diverse and widely disseminated in A. baumannii genomes. Also remarkably, A. baumannii prophages encode for multiple putative virulence factors that may be implicated in the bacteriums capacity to colonize host niches, evade the host immune system, subsist in unfavorable environments, and tolerate antibiotics. Overall our results point towards a significant contribution of prophages for the dissemination and evolution of pathogenicity in A. baumannii, and highlight their clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia polygenic risk is plausibly manifested by complex transcriptional dysregulation in the brain, involving networks of co-expressed and functionally related genes. The main purpose of this study was to identify and prioritize co-expressed gene sets in a hierarchical manner, based on the strength of the relationships with clinical diagnosis and with the polygenic risk for schizophrenia. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to RNA-quality adjusted DLPFC RNA-Seq data from the LIBD Postmortem Human Brain Repository (90 controls, 74 schizophrenia; Caucasians) to construct co-expression networks and detect modules of co-expressed genes. After internal and external validation, modules of selected interest were tested for enrichment in biological ontologies, association with schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS), with diagnosis and for enrichment in genes within the significant GWAS loci reported by the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (PGC2). The association between schizophrenia genetic signals and modules of co-expression converged on one module showing a significant association with diagnosis, PRS and significant overlap with 36 PGC2 loci genes, deemed as tier 1 (strongest candidates for drug targets). Fifty-three PGC2 loci genes were in modules associated only with diagnosis (tier 2) and 59 in modules unrelated to diagnosis or PRS (tier 3). In conclusion, our study highlights complex relationships between gene co-expression networks in the brain and polygenic risk for SCZ and provides a strategy for using this information in selecting potentially targetable gene sets for therapeutic drug development.",

    "abstract": "Human activity leading to both species introductions and extinctions is widely known to influence diversity patterns on local and regional scales. Yet, it is largely unknown whether the intensity of this activity is enough to affect the configuration of biodiversity at broader levels of spatial organization. Zoogeographical regions, or zooregions, are surfaces of the Earth defined by characteristic pools of species, which reflect ecological, historical, and evolutionary processes acting over millions of years. Consequently, it is widely assumed that zooregions are robust and unlikely to change on a human timescale. Here, however, we show that human-mediated introductions and extinctions can indeed reconfigure the currently recognized zooregions of amphibians, mammals, and birds. In particular, introductions homogenize the African and Eurasian zooregions in mammals; reshape boundaries with the reallocation of Oceania to the New World zooregion in amphibians; and divide bird zooregions by increasing biotic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the combined effect of amphibian introductions and extinctions has the potential to divide two zooregions largely representing the Old and the New World. Interestingly, the robustness of zooregions against changes in species composition may largely explain such zoogeographical changes. Altogether, our results demonstrate that human activities can erode the higher-level organization of biodiversity formed over millions of years. Comparable reconfigurations have previously been detectable in Earths history only after glaciations and mass extinction events, highlighting the profound and far-reaching impact of ongoing human activity and the need to protect the uniqueness of biotic assemblages from the effects of future species introductions and extinctions.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is partitioned into topologically associated domains (TADs) that assemble into compartments of shared chromatin valance. This architecture is influenced by the physical constraints imposed by the DNA polymer, which restricts DNA interactions predominantly to genomic segments from the same chromosome. Here, we report a dramatic divergence from this pattern of nuclear organization that occurs during the differentiation and specification of mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). In situ HiC on FAC-sorted OSNs shows that olfactory receptor (OR) genes from numerous chromosomes make frequent, extensive, and highly specific interchromosomal contacts that strengthen with differentiation. Moreover, in terminally differentiated OSNs, >30 intergenic enhancers generate a multi-chromosomal hub that associates only with the single active OR from a pool of [~]1400 genes. Our data reveal that interchromosomal interactions can form with remarkable stereotypy between like neurons, generating a regulatory landscape for stochastic, monogenic, and monoallelic gene expression.",

    "abstract": "In order to deploy virulence factors at appropriate times and locations, microbes must rapidly sense and respond to various metabolite signals. Previously we showed transient elevation of the methionine-derived metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) in serum during systemic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection. Here we explored the functional consequences of increased MTA concentrations on S. Typhimurium virulence. We found that MTA--but not other related metabolites involved in polyamine synthesis and methionine salvage--reduced motility, host cell pyroptosis, and cellular invasion. Further, we developed a genetic model of increased bacterial endogenous MTA production by knocking out the master repressor of the methionine regulon, metJ. Like MTA treated S. Typhimurium, the {Delta}metJ mutant displayed reduced motility, host cell pyroptosis, and invasion. These phenotypic effects of MTA correlated with suppression of flagellar and Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) networks. {Delta}metJ S. Typhimurium had reduced virulence in oral infection of C57BL/6 mice. Finally, {Delta}metJ bacteria induced a less severe inflammatory cytokine response in a mouse sepsis model. These data provide a possible bacterial mechanism for our previous findings that pretreating mice with MTA dampens inflammation and prolongs survival. Together, these data indicate that exposure of S. Typhimurium to MTA or disruption of the bacterial methionine metabolism pathway is sufficient to suppress SPI-1 mediated processes, motility, and in vivo virulence.\\n\\nSignificanceSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and bacteremia worldwide. Widespread multi-drug resistance, inadequate diagnostics, and the absence of a vaccine for use in humans, all contribute to the global burden of morbidity and mortality associated with S. Typhimurium infection. Here we find that increasing the concentration of the methionine derived metabolite methylthioadenosine, either in S. Typhimurium or in its environment, is sufficient to suppress virulence processes. These findings could be leveraged to inform future therapeutic interventions against S. Typhimurium aimed at manipulating either host or pathogen methylthioadenosine production.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding is a powerful tool for biodiversity assessment and has become increasingly popular in recent years. Although its reliability and applicability have been proven in numerous scientific studies, metabarcoding still suffers from some drawbacks. One is the usually mandatory destruction of specimens before DNA extraction, which is problematic because it does not allow a later taxonomic evaluation of the results. Additionally, metabarcoding often implements a time-consuming step, where specimens need to be separated from substrate or sorted in different size classes. A non-destructive protocol, excluding any sorting step, where the extraction of DNA is conducted from a samples fixative (ethanol) could serve as an alternative. We test an innovative protocol, where the sample preserving ethanol is filtered and DNA extracted from the filter for subsequent DNA metabarcoding. We first tested the general functionality of this approach on 15 mock communities comprising one individual of eight different macroinvertebrate taxa each and tried to increase DNA yield through different treatments (ultrasonic irradiation, shaking, freezing). Application of the method was successful for most of the samples and taxa, but showed weaknesses in detecting mollusc taxa. In a second step, the community composition detected in DNA from ethanol was compared to conventional bulk sample metabarcoding of complex environmental samples. We found that especially taxa with pronounced exoskeleton or shells (Coleoptera, Isopoda) and small taxa (Trombidiformes) were underrepresented in ethanol samples regarding taxa diversity and read numbers. However, read numbers of Diptera (mainly chironomids) and Haplotaxida were higher in ethanol derived DNA samples, which might indicate the detection of stomach content, which would be an additional advantage of this approach. Concerning EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) taxa which are decisive for the determination of ecological statuses, both methods had 46 OTUs in common with 4 unique to the ethanol samples and 10 to the bulk samples. Results indicate that fixative-based metabarcoding is a non-destructive, time-saving alternative for biodiversity assessments focussing on taxa used for ecological status determination. For a comprehensive picture on total biodiversity, the method might however not be sufficient and conventional bulk sample metabarcoding should be applied.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to insecticides has evolved in multiple insect species, leading to increased application rates and even control failures. Understanding the genetic basis of insecticide resistance is fundamental for mitigating its impact on crop production and disease control. We performed a GWAS approach with the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to identify the mutations involved in resistance to two widely used classes of insecticides: organophosphates (OPs, parathion) and pyrethroids (deltamethrin). Most variation in parathion resistance was associated with mutations in the target gene Ace, while most variation in deltamethrin resistance was associated with mutations in Cyp6a23, a gene encoding a detoxification enzyme never previously associated with resistance. A \\\"nested GWAS\\\" further revealed the contribution of other loci: Dscam1 and trpl were implicated in resistance to parathion, but only in lines lacking Wolbachia. Cyp6a17, the paralogous gene of Cyp6a23, and CG7627, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, were implicated in deltamethrin resistance. We observed signatures of recent selective sweeps at all of these resistance loci and confirmed that the soft sweep at Ace is indeed driven by the identified resistance mutations. Analysis of allele frequencies in additional population samples revealed that most resistance mutations are segregating across the globe, but that frequencies can vary substantially among populations. Altogether, our data reveal that the widely used OP and pyrethroid insecticides imposed a strong selection pressure on natural insect populations. However, it remains unclear why, in Drosophila, resistance evolved due to changes in the target site for OPs, but due to a detoxification enzyme for pyrethroids.\\n\\nArticle summaryInsecticides are widely used to control pests and insect vectors of disease. In response to the strong selection pressure exerted by insecticides, resistance has evolved in most insect species. We identified few genes present in several Drosophila melanogaster natural populations implicated in the evolution of resistance against two insecticides widely used today. We identified primary and secondary genes involved in the resistance. Surprisingly, resistance evolved in the target site for one insecticide, but was associated to changes in a novel detoxification enzyme for the other insecticide.",

During MT growth, the Tea2/Tip1/Mal3 complex remains bound to the plus tips of iMT bundles and restricts access to the plus tips by Klp5/Klp6/Mcp1, which accumulates behind it. At cell ends, Klp5/Klp6/Mcp1 invades the space occupied by the Tea2/Tip1/Tea1 kinesin complex triggering its displacement from iMT plus tips and MT catastrophe.

Unfortunately, steps are often hard to resolve, as they are masked by thermal noise. In such cases, details of the mechanochemistry can nonetheless be recovered by analyzing the fluctuations in the recorded traces. Here, we expand upon existing statistical analysis methods, providing two new avenues to extract the motor step size, the effective number of rate-limiting chemical states per translocation step, and the compliance of the link between the motor position and the probe particle. We first demonstrate the power and limitations of these methods using simulated molecular motor trajectories, and we then apply these methods to experimental data of kinesin, the bacterial flagellar motor, and F1-ATPase.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion dynamics in the cellular plasma membrane provides crucial insights into the molecular interactions, organization and bioactivity. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy combined with super-resolution stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy (STED-FCS) measures such dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution and reveals nanoscale diffusion characteristics by measuring the molecular diffusion in conventional confocal mode and super-resolved STED mode sequentially. However, to directly link the spatial and the temporal information, a method that simultaneously measures the diffusion in confocal and STED modes is needed. Here, to overcome this problem, we establish an advanced STED-FCS measurement method; line interleaved excitation scanning STED-FCS (LIESS-FCS) which discloses the molecular diffusion modes at different spatial positions with a single measurement. It relies on fast beam-scanning along a line with alternating laser illumination that yields, for each pixel, the apparent diffusion coefficients for two different observation spot sizes (conventional confocal and super-resolved STED). We demonstrate the potential of the LIESS-FCS approach with simulations and experiments on lipid diffusion in model and live cell plasma membranes. We also apply LIESS-FCS to investigate the spatio-temporal organization of GPI-anchored proteins in the plasma membrane of live cells which interestingly show multiple diffusion modes at different spatial positions.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with neurodegeneration in retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and in brain disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. Lipid storage organelles (lipid droplets, LDs), accumulate in many cell types in response to stress, and it is now clear that LDs function not only as lipid stores but also as dynamic regulators of the stress response. However, whether these LD functions are always protective or can also be deleterious to the cell is unknown. Here, we investigated the consequences of LD accumulation on retinal cell homeostasis in transgenic flies and mice overexpressing fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in retinal pigment cells (RPCs). In wild-type Drosophila, overexpression of dFatp specifically in RPCs resulted in an expansion of LD size in both RPCs and in neighboring photoreceptors but was non-toxic. Similarly, in mice, LD accumulation induced by RPC-specific expression of human FATP1 was non-toxic and promoted mitochondrial energy metabolism in both RPCs and photoreceptor cells. In contrast, RPC-specific dFatp knockdown reduced neurodegeneration in Aats-metFB Drosophila mutants, which carry a defective respiratory chain, indicating that abnormal LD accumulation can be toxic under pathological conditions. Collectively, these findings indicate that FATP-mediated LD formation in RPCs induces a non-autonomous increase of LDs in photoreceptors that promotes homeostasis under physiological conditions but can be deleterious under pathological conditions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLipids are major cell constituents and are present in the membranes, as free lipids in the cytoplasm, or stored in vesicles called lipid droplets (LDs). Under conditions of stress, lipids stored in LDs can be released to serve as substrates for energy metabolism by mitochondria. However, lipid storage is deregulated in many degenerative disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimers disease. Thus, it is unclear whether accumulation of LDs is protective or can also be toxic. To address this question, we examined the consequences of enforced LD accumulation on the health of retinal cells in flies and mice. Like humans, fly and mouse retinas contain retinal pigment cells (RPC) that support the functions of neighboring photoreceptor cells. We found that overexpression of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in RPCs induced accumulation of LDs in both transgenic flies and mice. Moreover, LD accumulation in RPCs had a beneficial effect on juxtaposed photoreceptors under normal physiological conditions, but was toxic under pathological stress conditions. We propose that lipid storage is a mechanism of cellular communication that is essential to maintain photoreceptor health.",

    "abstract": "While recent research indicates that human health depends, in part, upon the symbiotic relationship between gut microbes and their host, the specific interactions between host and microbe that define health are poorly resolved. Metagenomic clinical studies clarify this definition by revealing gut microbial taxa and functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. However, the typical single-disease focus of microbiome studies limits insight into which microbiome features robustly associate with health, indicate general deviations from health, or predict specific diseases. Additionally, the focus on taxonomy may limit our understanding of how the microbiome relates to health given observations that different taxonomic members can fulfill similar functional roles. To improve our understanding of the association between the gut microbiome and health, we integrated about 2,000 gut metagenomes obtained from eight clinical studies in a statistical meta-analysis. We identify characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and beta-dispersion. Moreover, we resolve microbiome modules that stratify diseased individuals from controls in a manner independent of study-specific effects. Many of the differentially abundant functions overlap multiple diseases suggesting a role in host health, while others are specific to a single disease and may associate with disease-specific etiologies. Our results clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics. Ultimately, our study clarifies the definition of a healthy microbiome and how perturbations to it associate with disease.",

    "abstract": "Much of the worldwide dissemination of antibiotic resistance has been driven by resistance gene associations with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and transposons. Although increasing, our understanding of resistance spread remains relatively limited, as methods for tracking mobile resistance genes through multiple species, strains and plasmids are lacking. We have developed a bioinformatic pipeline for tracking variation within, and mobility of, specific transposable elements (TEs), such as transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes. TETyper takes short-read whole-genome sequencing data as input and identifies single-nucleotide mutations and deletions within the TE of interest, to enable tracking of specific sequence variants, as well as the surrounding genetic context(s), to enable identification of transposition events. To investigate global dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and its associated transposon Tn4401, we applied TETyper to a collection of >3000 publicly available Illumina datasets containing blaKPC. This revealed surprising diversity, with >200 distinct flanking genetic contexts for Tn4401, indicating high levels of transposition. Integration of sample metadata revealed insights into associations between geographic locations, host species, Tn4401 sequence variants and flanking genetic contexts. To demonstrate the ability of TETyper to cope with high copy number TEs and to track specific short-term evolutionary changes, we also applied it to the insertion sequence IS26 within a defined K. pneumoniae outbreak.

    "abstract": "AbstractAmyloid formation has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The elongation of amyloid fibers is thermodynamically strongly favorable but kinetic traps exist where the incoming monomer binds in an incompatible conformation that blocks further elongation. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to follow experimentally at the atomic level. It is also too complex to simulate in full detail and thus so far has been explored either through coarse-grained simulations, which may miss many important interactions, or full atomic simulations in which the incoming peptide is constrained to be near the ideal fiber geometry. Here we use an alternate approach starting from a docked complex in which the monomer is from an experimental NMR structure of one of the major conformations in the unbound ensemble, a largely unstructured peptide with the central hydrophobic region in a 310 helix. A 1000 ns full atomic simulation in explicit solvent shows the formation of a metastable intermediate by sequential, concerted movements of both the fiber and monomer. A Markov state model shows the unfolded monomer is trapped at the end of the fiber in a set of interconverting anti-parallel {beta}-hairpin conformations. The simulation here may serve as a model for the binding of other non-{beta}-sheet conformations to amyloid fibers.",

    "abstract": "The deletion of the metabolizing Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) gene was previously associated with multiple cancers, metabolic and autoimmune disorders, as well as drug response. It is unusually common, with allele frequency reaching up to 75% in some human populations. Such high allele frequency of a derived allele with apparent impact on an otherwise conserved gene is a rare phenomenon. To investigate the evolutionary history of this locus, we analyzed 310 genomes using population genetics tools. Our analysis revealed a surprising lack of linkage disequilibrium between the deletion and the flanking single nucleotide variants in this locus, indicating gene conversion events. Tests that measure extended homozygosity and rapid change in allele frequency identified signatures of an incomplete soft-sweep in the locus. Using empirical approaches, we identified the Tanuki haplogroup, which carries the GSTM1 deletion and is found in approximately 70% of East Asian chromosomes. This haplogroup has rapidly increased its frequency in East Asian populations, contributing to a high population differentiation among continental human populations. We showed that extended homozygosity and population differentiation for this haplogroup is incompatible with simulated neutral expectations in East Asian populations. In parallel, we revealed that the Tanuki haplogroup is significantly associated with the expression levels of other GSTM genes. Collectively, our results suggest that the Tanuki haplogroup has likely undergone a soft sweep in East Asia with multiple functional consequences. Our study provides the necessary framework for further studies to elucidate the evolutionary reasons that maintain disease-susceptibility variants in the GSTM1 locus.\\n\\nLay summaryHere, we describe the evolutionary forces that shape the variation in a genomic region, which has been associated with bladder cancer, metabolic and autoimmune disorders and response to different drugs. Our results reveal a new genetic type common in Asian populations that may have important evolutionary and biomedical implications.",

    "abstract": "Most DNA in the genomes of higher organisms does not encode proteins, but is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The biological significance of most lncRNA is largely unclear. Here, we identify a lncRNA (SVALKA) in a cold-sensitive region of the Arabidopsis genome. Mutations in SVALKA affect the timing of maximal CBF1 expression and freezing tolerance. RNAPII read-through transcription of SVALKA results in a cryptic lncRNA overlapping CBF1 on the antisense strand, termed asCBF1. asCBF1 transcription is anti-correlated with CBF1 expression. Our molecular dissection reveals that CBF1 is suppressed by RNAPII collision stemming from the SVALKA-asCBF1 lncRNA cascade. The SVK-asCBF1 cascade provides a mechanism to tightly control CBF1 expression and timing that could be exploited to maximize freezing tolerance with mitigated fitness costs. Inversion of the transcriptional direction of a lncRNA cascade relative to the genes in a co-regulated cluster provides an elegant inbuilt negative feedback for cluster expression. Our results provide a compelling example of local gene regulation by lncRNA transcription having a profound impact on the ability of plants to appropriately acclimate to suboptimal environmental conditions.",

This hub consists of converging transcriptional enhancers3, or \\\"Greek Islands\\\", defined by stereotypic binding of Lhx2 and Ebf on a shared, composite DNA motif5. How this multi-chromosomal hub, or any other genomic compartment, assembles is unknown, and so is the significance of compartmentalization in transcription. Here, we report that LIM domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1), which is recruited by Lhx2 and Ebf to Greek Islands, promotes robust and specific trans interactions between these enhancers. In addition to disrupting Greek Island hubs, Ldb1 deletion also causes significant downregulation of OR transcription. Thus, our data provide insight to the formation of genomic compartments, confirm the essential role of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice, and establish trans enhancement as a mechanism for mammalian gene activation.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing public health problem that increases rates of white matter atrophy and increases the likelihood of ischemic lesions within white matter. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate these changes are unknown. We hypothesized that obesity may alter oligodendrocytes and myelin priming white matter for worsening injury and repair responses after ischemia. C57Bl/6 mice fed a high fat diet (60% kcal from fat) show increased numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), decreased myelin thickness with elevated g-ratios, and shorter paranodal axonal segments, indicating accelerated myelin turnover. Fate mapping of OPCs in PDGFR-CreERT;Rpl22tm1.1Psam mice demonstrated that OPC differentiation rates are enhanced by obesity. Gene expression analyses using a novel oligodendrocyte staging assay demonstrated OPC differentiation is blocked by obesity in between the pre-myelinating and myelinating stage. Using a model of subcortical white matter stroke, the number of stroke-responsive OPCs in obese mice was increased after stroke. At early time points after ischemic white matter stroke, spatial mapping of stroke-responsive OPCs indicates that obesity leads to increased OPCs at the edge of ischemic white matter lesions. At later time points, obesity results in increased OPCs within the ischemic lesion while reducing the number of GST-{pi}-positive mature oligodendrocytes in the lesion core. These data indicate that obesity disrupts normal white matter biology by blocking oligodendrocyte differentiation, leads to an exaggerated response of OPCs to white matter ischemia, and limits remyelination after stroke.\\n\\nSignificance StatementObesity is a growing public health crisis that specifically increases the development of white matter lesions and silent brain infarcts. This relationship implies a direct cellular effect on white matter yet direct evidence is limited. We modeled diet-induced obesity in mice and studied the effect on oligodendrocyte biology and the response to focal white matter stroke. Adult-onset obesity results in thinner myelin, compromised axonal microdomain structure, and blocks the differentiation of OPCs, leaving the white matter with increased numbers of OPCs. After focal white matter stroke in obese mice, the early OPC response to stroke is exaggerated while late reparative OPC differentiation is blocked. These results suggest that obesity specifically blocks OPC differentiation with consequence on brain repair after stroke.",

Using a fast-acting, light-responsive transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that dynamic pulsatile signals reduce cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. We then show that by encoding such signals into a single input, expression mean and variability can be precisely and independently tuned. Further, we construct a light-responsive promoter library and demonstrate how pulsatile signaling also enables graded multi-gene regulation at fixed expression ratios, despite differences in promoter dose-response characteristics. Pulsatile regulation can thus lead to highly beneficial functional behaviors in synthetic biological systems, which previously required laborious optimization of genetic parts or complex construction of synthetic gene networks.",

    "abstract": "The switch of mitochondrial respiration to fermentation as the main pathway to produce ATP through the increase of glycolytic flux is known as the Crabtree effect. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the Crabtree effect may have important applications in ethanol production and lay the groundwork for the Warburg effect, which is essential in the molecular etiology of cancer. A key piece in this mechanism could be Snf1p, which is a protein that participates in the nutritional response that includes glucose metabolism. Thus, this work aimed to recognize the role of the SNF1 complex on the glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration, to gain insights about its relationship with the Crabtree effect. Herein, we found that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown at 1% glucose, mutation of SNF1 gene decreased glycolytic flux, increased NAD(P)H, enhanced HXK2 gene transcription, and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Meanwhile, the same mutation increased the mitochondrial respiration of cells grown at 10% glucose. Moreover, SNF4 gene deletion increased respiration and growth at 1% of glucose. In the case of the GAL83 gene, we did not detect any change in mitochondrial respiration or growth. Altogether, these findings indicate that SNF1 is vital to switch from mitochondrial respiration to fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in arousal and stress responsiveness span numerous psychiatric developmental disorders including depression and anxiety. Arousal is supported by norepinephrine (NE) released from locus coeruleus (LC) neurons onto cortical and limbic areas. During development, the NE system matures in concert with increased exploration of the animals environment. While several psychiatric medications target the LC-NE system, the possibility that its modulation during discreet developmental periods can have long-lasting consequences for mental health has not been explored. We used a pharmacogenetic strategy in mice to reversibly inhibit NE signaling during brief developmental periods to determine the long-lasting impact on adult circuits mediating emotional behavior. We also examine whether disruption of NE signaling during development results in permanent changes within the adult LC-NE system. Finally, we test whether developmental exposure to the -2 receptor agonist guanfacine recapitulates the effect seen with our pharmacogenetic strategy. Our results reveal a sensitive period (postnatal days 10-21) during which alterations in NE signaling result in long-term changes in adult emotional behavior. Changes in NE signaling during this sensitive period results in changes in stress-related LC neuron activity, alterations in -2 autoreceptor function, and circuit-specific molecular changes in LC-NE target regions in adulthood. Treating animals with guanfacine during the sensitive period produced similar results. Our findings indicate an early critical role for NE in sculpting brain circuits that support adult emotional function.",

There are several kinds of connexins (Cx) named based on their weight in kilodaltons. 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) is a small molecule inhibitor (SMI) of Cx26 and Cx32. Knock out of Cx32 and also blockage of Cx32 by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl (2-APB) has been suspected to be beneficial in not only, drug induced liver toxicity, but also in blocking the propagation of an inflammatory signal. If the binding site of 2-APB can be determined, virtual screening for additional, perhaps more specific Cx26 and Cx32 blocking SMI can be carried out. Our modeling suggests that 2-APB binds to similar sites inside the pores of Cx26 and Cx32. Here 2-APB interacts with the conserved ILE82 and THR86. These residues hold the same numbering in both CX26 and CX32.

Many cases of horizontal TE transfer (HTT) been reported in animals and plants, however surprisingly few examples of HTT have been reported in fungi.\\n\\nFindingsHere I report evidence for a novel HTT event in fungi involving Tsu4 in Saccharomyces paradoxus based on (i) high similarity between Tsu4 elements in S. paradoxus and S. uvarum, (ii) a patchy distribution of Tsu4 in S. paradoxus and general absence from its sister species S. cerevisiae, and (iii) discordance between the phylogenetic history of Tsu4 sequences and species in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group. Available data suggests the HTT event likely occurred somewhere in the Nearctic, Neotropic or Indo-Australian part of the S. paradoxus species range, and that a lineage related to S. uvarum or S. eubayanus was the donor species. The HTT event has led to massive proliferation of Tsu4 in the South American lineage of S. paradoxus, which exhibits partial reproductive isolation with other strains of this species because of multiple reciprocal translocations. Full-length Tsu4 elements are associated with both breakpoints of one of these reciprocal translocations.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work shows that comprehensive analysis of TE sequences in essentially-complete genome assemblies derived from long-read sequencing provides new opportunities to detect HTT events in fungi and other organisms. This work also provides support for the hypothesis that HTT and subsequent TE proliferation can induce genome rearrangements that contribute to post-zygotic isolation in yeast.",

    "abstract": "The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a charismatic species that plays a critical role in the pollination of agriculturally important crops and native flora. One emerging field of research is that of the host-associated honey bee microbiome: a group of bacterial phylotypes consistently found within the honey bee, which may play critical roles such as protection from pathogens and nutrient acquisition. In other model systems, host-associated microbial communities are known to participate in a form of bacterial communication known as quorum sensing. This type of communication allows bacteria to sense their environment and respond with changes in gene expression, controlling a number of factors including virulence, biofilm formation, and cell motility. Here, we have investigated the production of a specific quorum sensing molecule by honey bee microbes in vivo and in vitro. We specifically focused on the inter-species signaling molecule, autoinducer-2 (AI-2). We identified the production of AI-2 by both the entire community (using honey bee gut homogenates) and by cultured isolates, using a Vibrio harveyi biosensor. By comparing newly emerged and adult bees, we showed this signal is likely coming from the core microbial community. Finally, using honey bee specific bacterial isolates, we identified changes in biofilm production when isolates are exposed to increased levels of exogenous AI-2. Altogether, these data provide multiple lines of evidence for the presence of quorum sensing inside the honey bee host. The effect of AI-2 on biofilm formation by honey bee specific bacteria identifies one potential avenue for quorum sensing to affect host health.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMicrobial communities associate with every animal on the planet and can have dramatic effects on the health of their host. The honey bee is one such animal, home to a characteristic community of bacteria, which may provide various benefits. Here, we show that these microbes are producing quorum sensing molecules which could support interactions between bacterial members and facilitate host colonization.",

Here we uncover a new role of the RAD51 paralogs at an earlier event in the repair of broken chromosomes. All five RAD51 paralogs affect the balance between double strand break repair pathways. Specifically, they favor homology-mediated repair over non-homologous end-joining. Such role is independent of RAD51 or the checkpoint activity of these proteins. Moreover, it defines a novel control point of double strand break repair independent and subsequent to DNA-end resection initiation.\\n\\nMechanistically, RAD51 paralogs limit the retention of Ku80 at the sites of DNA breaks.

Here we addressed the possibility that lysyl oxidase (LOX) contributes to this phenotype. After overnight serum starvation, pro-LOX levels were elevated compared to wild-type in marrow-derived osteoblasts from male and female TSP2-/- mice. The liberated LOX pro-peptide (LOPP) was faintly visible in serum-starved cultures. When serum was maintained, pro-LOX content was not affected by TSP2 status, but relative LOPP levels were elevated in cultures from female TSP2-/- mice. Two isoforms of pro-LOX at 75 kDa and 50 kDa were detected in detergent soluble protein extracts of diaphyseal tissue from growing mice. In female mice, TSP2 status did not affect detergent soluble pro-LOX content or the relative contribution of each band to the total signal. Instead, levels of the 50 kDa band were reduced in female TSP1-/- samples. In male diaphyseal tissue, total pro-LOX content and the contribution each isoform made to the total signal was not affected by TSP1 or TSP2 status. We did not detect 32 kDa mature LOX in detergent soluble preparations of cells or whole bone tissue. Detergent insoluble hydroxyproline content was reduced in diaphyseal tissue obtained from female TSP1-/- and TSP2-/- mice. In male diaphyseal cortical samples, TSP2 but not TSP1 deficiency was associated with reduced insoluble hydroxyproline content.

    "abstract": "All living organisms have undergone the evolutionary selection under the changing natural environments to survive as diverse life forms. All life processes including normal homeostatic development and growth into organismic bodies with distinct cellular identifications, as well as their adaptive responses to various intracellular and environmental stresses, are tightly controlled by signaling of transcriptional networks towards regulation of cognate genes by many different transcription factors. Amongst them, one of the most conserved is the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) family. They play vital roles essential for cell proliferation, differentiation and maintenance in complex multicellular organisms. Notably, an unresolved divergence on the evolution of bZIP proteins is addressed here. By a combination of bioinformatics with genomics and molecular biology, we have demonstrated that two of the most ancestral family members classified into BATF and Jun subgroups are originated from viruses, albeit expansion and diversification of the bZIP superfamily occur in different vertebrates. Interestingly, a specific ancestral subfamily of bZIP proteins is identified and also designated Nach (Nrf and CNC homology) on account of their highly conservativity with NF-E2 p45 subunit-related factors Nrf1/2. Further experimental evidence reveals that Nach1/2 from the marine bacteria exerts distinctive functions from Nrf1/2 in the transcriptional ability to regulate antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven cytoprotective genes. Collectively, an insight into Nach/CNC-bZIP proteins provides a better understanding of distinct biological functions between these factors selected during evolution from the marine bacteria to human.\\n\\nSignificanceWe identified the novel ancestral subfamily (i.e. Nach) of CNC-bZIP transcription factors with highly conservativity from marine bacteria to human.

The Jun and CNC subfamilies also share a common origin of these bZIP proteins.

The expected multipopulation SFS under a given demographic model can be efficiently computed when the populations in the model are related by a tree, scaling to hundreds of populations. Admixture, back-migration, and introgression are common natural processes that violate the assumption of a tree-like population history, however, and until now the expected SFS could be computed for only a handful of populations when the demographic history is not a tree. In this article, we present a new method for efficiently computing the expected SFS and linear functionals of it, for demographies described by general directed acyclic graphs. This method can scale to more populations than previously possible for complex demographic histories including admixture. We apply our method to an 8-population SFS to estimate the timing and strength of a proposed \\\"basal Eurasian\\\" admixture event in human history.

ElincRNA expression is associated with changes in neighboring gene product abundance and local chromosomal topology, suggesting that transcription at these loci contributes to gene expression regulation in cis. Despite the lack of evidence supporting sequence-dependent functions for most elincRNAs, splicing of these transcripts is unexpectedly common. Whether elincRNA splicing is a mere consequence of their cognate enhancer activity or if it directly impacts enhancer-associated cis-regulation remains unanswered.\\n\\nHere we show that elincRNAs are efficiently and rapidly spliced and that their processing rate is strongly associated with their cognate enhancer activity. This association is supported by: their enrichment in enhancer-specific chromatin signatures; elevated binding of co-transcriptional regulators, including CBP and p300; increased local intra-chromosomal DNA contacts; and strengthened cis-regulation on target gene expression. Using nucleotide polymorphisms at elincRNA splice sites, we found that elincRNA splicing enhances their transcription and directly impacts cis-regulatory function of their cognate enhancers. Importantly, up to 90% of human elincRNAs have nucleotide variants that are associated with both their splicing and the expression levels of their proximal genes.\\n\\nOur results highlight an unexpected contribution of elincRNA splicing to enhancer function.",

Relevant to the p hypothesis, recent genetic research has found surprisingly high genetic correlations between pairs of psychiatric disorders. Here, for the first time we compare genetic correlations from different methods and examine their support for a genetic p factor. We tested the hypothesis of a genetic p factor by using principal component analysis on matrices of genetic correlations between major psychiatric disorders estimated by three methods - family study, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, and Linkage-Disequilibrium Score Regression - and on a matrix of polygenic score correlations constructed for each individual in a UK-representative sample of 7,026 unrelated individuals. All disorders loaded on a first unrotated principal component, which accounted for 57%, 43%, 34% and 19% of the variance respectively for each method. Our results showed that all four methods provided strong support for a genetic p factor that represents the pinnacle of the hierarchical genetic architecture of psychopathology.",

We show that the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) specifically inhibits Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and accompanying IL-10 production. In contrast, 2DG promotes IL-17A production by Th17 cells, even in the presence of IL-2 known to limit Th17 differentiation, whilst totally abrogating the production of IL-10. Notably, rather than inhibiting glycolysis, 2DG acts through the inhibition of glycosylation, which is critical for IL-2R surface expression and downstream signaling in both mouse and man. Strikingly, IL-2 is essential for IL-10 production by Th17 cells, in contrast to its inhibitory effect on the production of IL-17A.

We tested how groups of eastern subterranean termites (Reticulitermes flavipes) deploy these behaviours when presented with a nestmate at different stages of infection with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. As expected, the termites groomed pathogen-exposed individuals significantly more than mock-treated controls; however, grooming levels were significantly higher after spore germination than before. Cannibalism became prevalent only after exposed termites became visibly ill, and burial was rarely observed. These results demonstrate that termites employ different strategies depending on the stage of infection that they encounter. Grooming intensity is linked not only to pathogen presence, but also to germination status, and, given the temporal correlation between cannibalism and visible signs of illness, the host may play a role in triggering its own sacrifice.",

    "abstract": "Negative interspecific mating interactions, known as reproductive interference, can hamper species coexistence in a local patch and promote niche partitioning or geographical segregation of closely related species. Conspecific sperm precedence (CSP), which occurs when females that have mated with both conspecific and heterospecific males preferentially use conspecific sperm for fertilization, might contribute to species coexistence by mitigating the costs of interspecific mating and hybridization. We examined whether two closely related species exhibiting CSP can coexist in a local environment in the presence of reproductive interference. First, using a behaviourally explicit mathematical model, we demonstrated that two species characterized by negative mating interactions are unlikely to coexist because the costs of reproductive interference, such as loss of mating opportunity with conspecific partners, are inevitably incurred when individuals of both species are present. Second, we experimentally demonstrated differences in mating activity and preference in two Harmonia ladybird species known to exhibit CSP. According to the developed mathematical model of reproductive interference, these behavioural differences should lead to local extinction of H. yedoensis because of reproductive interference by H. axyridis. This prediction is consistent with field observations that H. axyridis uses various food sources and habitats whereas H. yedoensis is confined to a less preferred prey item and a pine tree habitat. Finally, by a comparative approach, we showed that niche partitioning or parapatric distribution, but not sympatric coexistence in the same habitat, is maintained between species with CSP belonging to a wide range of taxa, including vertebrates and invertebrates living in aquatic or terrestrial environments. Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that reproductive interference generally destabilizes local coexistence even in closely related species that exhibit CSP.",

    "abstract": "Since at first sight aging seems to be omnipresent, many authors to this very day regard it as an inevitable consequence of the laws of physics. However, studies published in the past two decades have conclusively shown that a number of organisms do not age, or at least do not age on a scale comparable with other aging organisms. This disparity leads us to question why aging evolved in some organisms and not in others. We thus present a mathematical model which simulates evolution in a sexually reproducing population composed of aging and non-aging individuals. We have observed that aging individuals may outcompete non-aging individuals if they have a higher starting fertility or if the main mating pattern in the population is assortative mating. Furthermore, stronger pathogen pressure was found to help the aging phenotype when compared to the non-aging phenotype. Last but not least, the aging phenotype was found to more easily outcompete the non-aging one or to resist the dominance of the latter for a longer period of time in populations composed of dimorphic sexually reproducing individuals compared to populations of hermaphrodites. Our findings are consistent with both classical evolutionary theories of aging and with evolutionary theories of aging which assume the existence of an aging program. They can thus potentially work as a bridge between these two opposing views, suggesting that the truth in fact lies somewhere in between.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis study presents the first mathematical model which simulates the evolution of aging in a population of sexually reproducing organisms. Our model shows that aging individuals may outcompete non-aging individuals in several scenarios known to occur in nature. Our work thus provides important insight into the question why aging has evolved in most, but not all, organisms.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a common, complex neurological disease, where almost 20% of risk heritability can be attributed to common genetic variants, including >230 identified by genome-wide association studies (Patsopoulos et al., 2017). Multiple strands of evidence suggest that the majority of the remaining heritability is also due to the additive effects of individual variants, rather than epistatic interactions between these variants, or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in 68,379 cases and controls that as much as 5% of this heritability is explained by low-frequency variation in gene coding sequence. We identify four novel genes driving MS risk independently of common variant signals, which highlight a key role for regulatory T cell homeostasis and regulation, IFN{gamma} biology and NF{kappa}B signaling in MS pathogenesis. As low-frequency variants do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium with other variants, and as coding variants are more interpretable and experimentally tractable than non-coding variation, our discoveries constitute a rich resource for dissecting the pathobiology of MS.",

It was also calculated using downloaded genotypes of European schizophrenia cases and controls from the CommonMind Consortium.\\n\\nResultsThe PRS for schizophrenia varied significantly between ancestral groups (p < 2*10-16) and was much higher in African than European HapMap subjects. The mean difference between these groups was ten times as high as the mean difference between European schizophrenia cases and controls. The distributions of scores for African and European subjects hardly overlapped.\\n\\nConclusionsThe PRS cannot be regarded as simply a measure of the polygenic contribution to risk of schizophrenia and clearly contains a strong ancestry component. It is possible that this could be controlled for to some extent by incorporating principal components as covariates but doubts remain as to how it should be interpreted. The PRS derived from European subjects cannot be applied to non-Europeans, limiting its potential usefulness and raising issues of inequity.

    "abstract": "While mindfulness is commonly viewed as a skill to be cultivated through practice, untrained individuals can also vary widely in dispositional mindfulness. Prior research has identified static neural connectivity correlates of this trait. Here, we use dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis of resting-state fMRI to study time-varying connectivity patterns associated with naturally varying and objectively measured trait mindfulness. Participants were selected from the top and bottom tertiles of performers on a breath-counting task to form high trait mindfulness (HTM; N = 21) and low trait mindfulness (LTM; N = 18) groups. DFC analysis of resting state fMRI data revealed that the HTM group spent significantly more time in a brain state associated with task-readiness - a state characterized by high within-network connectivity and greater anti-correlations between task-positive networks and the default-mode network (DMN). The HTM group transitioned between brain states more frequently, but the dwell time in each episode of the task-ready state was equivalent between groups. These results persisted even after controlling for vigilance. Across individuals, certain connectivity metrics were weakly correlated with self-reported mindfulness as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, though these did not survive multiple comparisons correction. In the static connectivity maps, HTM individuals had greater within-network connectivity in the DMN and the salience network, and greater anti-correlations between the DMN and task-positive networks. In sum, DFC features robustly distinguish HTM and LTM individuals, and may be useful biological markers for the measurement of dispositional mindfulness.",

    "abstract": "Signals for reward or punishment attract attention preferentially, a principle termed  value-modulated attention capture (VMAC). The mechanisms that govern the allocation of attention resources can be productively described with a terminology that is more often applied to the control of overt behaviours, namely, the distinction between instrumental and Pavlovian control, and between model-free and model-based control. While instrumental control of VMAC can be either model-free or model-based, it is not known whether Pavlovian control of VMAC can be model-based. To decide whether this is possible we measured Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) while 20 healthy adults took part in a novel task. During the learning stage participants underwent aversive threat conditioning with two CSs, one that predicted pain (CS+) and one that predicted safety (CS-). Instructions given prior to the test stage in the task allowed participants to infer whether novel, ambiguous CSs (new CS+/ new CS-) were threatening or safe. Correct inference required combining stored internal representations and new propositional information, the hallmark of model-based control. SSVEP amplitudes quantified the amount of attention allocated to novel CSs on their very first presentation, before they were ever reinforced. We found that SSVEPs were higher for new CS+ than new CS-. Because task design precluded model-free or instrumental control this result demonstrates a model-based Pavlovian control of VMAC. It confirms, in the domain of internal resource allocation, the model-based Pavlovian control of incentive behaviour and underlines the potential transformative role of information as an emotion regulation technique.",

This often requires the animal to derive allocentric information about the environment from egocentric sensory and motor experience. The neural circuits and mechanisms underlying this transformation are currently unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose requisite brain circuitry is relatively simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the preglomerular complex, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the optic tectum with the spatial learning circuits in the dorsolateral pallium. While tectal egocentric information was eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this highly-reliable temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate path-integration that then enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in spatial learning via sequential encounters in all vertebrates.",

To break with this paradigm, we developed NestLink, a binder selection and identification technology able to biophysically characterize thousands of library members at once without handling individual clones at any stage of the process. NestLink builds on genetically fused barcoding peptides, termed flycodes, which are designed for maximal detectability by mass spectrometry and serve as unique molecular identifiers for accurate deep sequencing. We applied NestLink to overcome current limitations of binder generation. Rare binders against an integral membrane protein were identified directly in the cellular environment of a human pathogen. Hundreds of binder candidates were simultaneously ranked according to kinetic parameters. Adverse effects of target immobilization were overcome by selecting nanobodies against an ABC transporter entirely in solution. NestLink may provide a basis for the selection of tailored binder characteristics directly in tissues or in living organisms.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a disease of the genome, but the dramatic inter-patient variability in mutation number is poorly understood. Tumours of the same type can differ by orders of magnitude in their mutation rate. To understand potential drivers and consequences of the underlying heterogeneity in mutation rate across tumours, we evaluated both local and global measures of mutation density: both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks in 2,460 tumours of 38 cancer types. We find that SCNAs in thousands of genes are associated with elevated rates of point-mutations, while similarly point-mutation patterns in dozens of genes are associated with specific patterns of DNA double-stranded breaks. These candidate drivers of mutation density are enriched for known cancer drivers, and preferentially occur early in tumour evolution, appearing clonally in all cells of a tumour. To supplement this understanding of global mutation density, we developed and validated a tool called SeqKat to identify localized \\\"rainstorms\\\" of point-mutations (kataegis). We show that rates of kataegis differ by four orders of magnitude across tumour types, with malignant lymphomas showing the highest. Tumours with TP53 mutations were 2.6-times more likely to harbour a kataegic event than those without, and 239 SCNAs were associated with elevated rates of kataegis, including loss of the tumour-suppressor CDKN2A. We identify novel subtypes of kataegic events not associated with aberrant APOBEC activity, and find that these are localized to specific cellular regions, enriched for MYC-target genes. Kataegic events were associated with patient survival in some, but not all tumour types, highlighting a combination of global and tumour-type specific effects. Taken together, we reveal a landscape of genes driving localized and tumour-specific hyper-mutation, and reveal novel mutational processes at play in specific tumour types.",

    "abstract": "People who score higher on intelligence tests tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors influence both brain size and intelligence. This has led to the hypothesis that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to development of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis with molecular genetic data using discoveries from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We analyzed genetic, brain imaging, and cognitive test data from the UK Biobank, the Dunedin Study, the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), and the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS) (combined N=8,271). We measured genetics using polygenic scores based on published GWAS. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect-sizes were larger in the population-based UK Biobank and Dunedin samples than in the GSP and DNS samples. Sensitivity analysis suggested this effect-size difference partly reflected restricted range of cognitive performance in the GSP and DNS samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative samples should be a priority for neuroscience research. Findings suggest promise for studies integrating GWAS discoveries with brain imaging data to understand neurobiology linking genetics with individual differences in cognitive performance.",

The effects of APOE genotype and sex on game performance was further examined in a smaller lab-based cohort (n = 44).\\n\\nRESULTSBenchmark data showed an effect of sex on wayfinding distance, duration and path integration. Importantly in the lab cohort, performance on allocentric wayfinding levels was reduced in{varepsilon} 4 carriers compared to{varepsilon} 3 carriers, and effect of sex became negligible when APOE status was controlled for. To demonstrate the robustness of this effect and to ensure the quality of data obtained through unmonitored at-home use of the Sea Hero Quest game, post-hoc analysis was carried out to compare performance by the benchmark population to the monitored lab-cohort.\\n\\nDISCUSSIONAPOE {varepsilon}4 midlife carriers exhibit changes in navigation pattern before any symptom onset. This supports the move towards spatial navigation as an early cognitive marker and demonstrates for the first time how the utility of large-scale digital cognitive assessment may hold future promise for the early detection of Alzheimers disease.

    "abstract": "The intention to forget can produce long-lasting effects. This ability has been linked to suppression of both rehearsal and retrieval of unwanted memories - processes that are mediated by prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Here, we describe an alternative account of deliberate forgetting in which the intention to forget is associated with increased engagement with the unwanted information. We used pattern classifiers to decode functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a task in which participants viewed a series of pictures and were instructed to remember or forget each one. Pictures followed by a forget instruction elicited higher levels of processing in ventral temporal cortex compared to those followed by a remember instruction. This boost in processing led to more forgetting, particularly for items that showed moderate (vs. weak or strong) activation. This result is consistent with the non-monotonic plasticity hypothesis, which predicts weakening and forgetting of memories that are moderately activated.",

    "abstract": "The small size of nanoparticles is both an advantage and a problem. Their high surface-area-to-volume ratio enables novel medical, industrial, and commercial applications. However, their small size also allows them to evade conventional filtration during water treatment, posing health risks to humans, plants, and aquatic life. This project aims to remove nanoparticles during wastewater treatment using genetically modified Escherichia coli in two ways: 1) binding citrate-capped nanoparticles with the membrane protein Proteorhodopsin, and 2) trapping nanoparticles using Escherichia coli biofilm produced by overexpressing two regulators: OmpR234 and CsgD. We demonstrate experimentally that Escherichia coli expressing Proteorhodopsin binds to 60 nm citrate-capped silver nanoparticles. We also successfully upregulate biofilm production and show that Escherichia coli biofilms are able to trap 30 nm gold particles. Finally, both Proteorhodopsin and biofilm approaches are able to bind and remove nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment tanks. We envision integrating our trapping system in both rural and urban wastewater treatment plants to efficiently capture all nanoparticles before treated water is released into the environment.\\n\\nFinancial DisclosureThis work was funded by the Taipei American School.

    "abstract": "Size control of internal tubular organs, such as the lungs or vascular system, is critical for proper physiological activity and to prevent disease or malformations. This control incorporates the intrinsic physical anisotropy of tubes to generate proportionate organs that match their function. The exact mechanisms underlying tube size control and how tubular anisotropy is translated at the cellular level are still not fully understood. Here we investigate these mechanisms using the Drosophila tracheal system. We show that the apical polarity protein Crumbs transiently accumulates anisotropically at longitudinal cell junctions during tube elongation. We provide evidence indicating that the accumulation of Crumbs in specific apical domains correlates with apical surface growth. Hence, we propose that the anisotropic accumulation of Crb at the cellular level promotes a bias towards longitudinal membrane growth, orienting cell elongation and, as a consequence, longitudinal growth at the tissue level. We find that Src42A promotes Crb anisotropic accumulation, thereby identifying the first polarised cell behaviour downstream of Src42A. Our results indicate that Src42A activity favours a higher turnover of Crb protein at longitudinal junctions, possibly through a mechanism regulating protein trafficking and/or recycling. We propose a model where Src42A would sense the inherent anisotropic mechanical tension of the tube and translate it into a polarised Crumbs-mediated membrane growth, orienting longitudinal tube growth. This work provides new insights into the key question of how organ growth is controlled and polarised and unveils the function of two conserved proteins, Crumbs and Src42A, with important roles in development and homeostasis as well as in disease, in this biological process.",

In vertebrates, four members have been previously recognized, the ascorbate transporters Slc23a1 and Slc3a2, the nucleobase transporter Slc23a4 and an orphan transporter SLC23A3. Here we identify a fifth member of the vertebrate slc23 complement (slc23a5), expressed in neopterygians (gars and teleosts) and amphibians, and clarify the evolutionary relationships between the novel gene and known slc23 genes. Further comparative analysis puts forward uric acid as the preferred substrate for Slc23a5. Gene expression quantification suggests kidney and testis as major expression sites in Xenopus tropicalis (western clawed frog) and Danio rerio (zebrafish). Additional expression in brain was detected in D. rerio, while in the Neoteleostei Oryzias latipes (medaka) slc23a5 expression is restricted to brain. The biological relevance of the retention of an extra transporter in fish and amphibians is examined: with respect to the (1) antioxidant role of uric and ascorbic acid in seminal fluid and brain, (2) the ability to endogenously synthesize ascorbic acid and (3) the morphological adaptations of the male urogenital system.",

The yearly trio-based mutation rate estimate of ~0.43x10-9 is markedly lower than prior indirect estimates of ~1x10-9 per year from phylogenetic comparisons of the great apes. This suggests either a slowdown over the past 10 million years or an inaccurate interpretation of the fossil record. Here we use sequencing of chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan trios and find that each species has higher estimated mutation rates per year by factors of 1.67+/- 0.22, 1.54+/- 0.2 and 1.84+/- 0.19, respectively. These estimates suggest a very recent and appreciable slowdown in human mutation rate, and, if extrapolated over the great apes phylogeny, yields divergence estimates much more in line with the fossil record and the biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphIdentification of protective and/or pathogenic genetic modifiers provides important insight into the heterogeneity of disease presentations in individuals affected by neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), despite having well-defined pathogenic variants. Targeting modifier genes to improve disease phenotypes could be especially beneficial in cases where the causative genes are large, structurally complex and the mutations are heterogeneous. Here, we report a mutation-independent strategy to upregulate expression of a compensatory disease-modifying gene in Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) using a CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system. MDC1A is caused by nonfunctional Laminin 2, which compromises muscle fibers stability and axon myelination in peripheral nerves 1. Transgenic overexpression of Lama1, encoding a structurally similar protein Laminin 1, ameliorates muscle wasting and paralysis in the MDC1A mouse models, demonstrating its role as a protective disease modifier 2. Yet, upregulation of Lama1 as a postnatal gene therapy is hampered by its large size, which exceeds the current genome packaging capacity of clinically relevant delivery vehicles such as adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs). In this study, we sought to upregulate Lama1 using CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system, comprised of catalytically inactive S. aureus Cas9 (dCas9) fused to VP64 transactivation domains and sgRNAs targeting the Lama1 promoter. We first demonstrated robust upregulation of Lama1 in myoblasts, and following AAV9-mediated intramuscular delivery, in skeletal muscles of dy2j/dy2j mouse model of MDC1A.\\n\\nWe therefore assessed whether systemic upregulation of Lama1 would yield therapeutic benefits in dy2j/dy2j mice. When the intervention was started early in pre-symptomatic dy2j/dy2j mice, Lama1 upregulation prevented muscle fibrosis and hindlimb paralysis. An important question for future therapeutic approaches for a variety of disorders concerns the therapeutic window and phenotypic reversibility. This is particularly true for muscular dystrophies as it has long been hypothesized that fibrotic changes in skeletal muscle represent an irreversible disease state that would impair any therapeutic intervention at advanced stages of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that dystrophic features and disease progression were significantly improved and partially reversed when the treatment was initiated in symptomatic 3-week old dy2j/dy2j mice with already-apparent hind limb paralysis and significant muscle fibrosis.\\n\\nCollectively, our data demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated modulation of a disease modifier gene, which opens up an entirely new and mutation-independent treatment approach for all MDC1A patients. Moreover, this treatment strategy provides evidence that muscle fibrosis can be reversible, thus extending the therapeutic window for this disorder. Our data provide a proof-of-concept strategy that can be applied to a variety of disease modifier genes and a powerful therapeutic approach for various inherited and acquired diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that holistic processing is critical for early face recognition, but recent work has suggested a larger role for feature-based processing. The earliest step in familiar face recognition is thought to be matching a perceptual representation of a familiar face to a stored representation of that face, which is thought to be indexed by the N250r event-related potential (ERP). In the current face priming studies, we investigated whether this perceptual representation can be effectively activated by feature-based processing. In the first experiment, prime images were familiar whole faces, isolated eyes, or isolated mouths. Whole faces and isolated eyes, but not isolated mouths, effectively modulated the N250r. In the second experiment, prime images were familiar whole faces presented either upright or inverted. Inverted face primes were no less effective than upright face primes in modulating the N250r. Together, the results of these studies indicate that activation of the earliest face recognition processes is not dependent on holistic processing of a typically configured face. Rather, feature-based processing can effectively activate the perceptual memory of a familiar face. However, not all features are effective primes as we found eyes, but not mouths, were effective in activating early face recognition.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIHolistic processing is not necessary for early identity recognition of familiar faces.\\nC_LIO_LIInverted faces and isolated features can effectively activate the perceptual memory of a familiar face.\\nC_LIO_LIThis effectiveness was observed for eyes, but not mouths.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A widely used experimental design in multisensory integration is the McGurk paradigm that entail illusory (cross-modal) perception of speech sounds when presented with incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli. However, the distribution of responses across trials and individuals is heterogeneous and not necessarily everyone in a given group of individuals perceives the effect. Nonetheless, existing studies in the field primarily focus on addressing the correlation between subjective behavior and cortical activations to reveal the neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception of McGurk effect, typically in the \\\"frequent perceivers\\\". Additionally, a solely neuroimaging approach does not provide mechanistic explanation for the observed inter-trial or inter-individual heterogeneity. In the current study we employ high density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in a group of 25 human subjects that allow us to distinguish \\\"frequent perceivers\\\" from \\\"rare perceivers\\\" using behavioral responses as well as from the perspective of large-scale brain functional connectivity (FC). Using global coherence as a measure of large-scale FC, we find that alpha band coherence, a distinctive feature in frequent perceivers is absent in the rare perceivers. Secondly, a decrease in alpha band coherence and increase in gamma band coherence occur during illusory perception trials in both frequent and rare perceivers. Source analysis followed up with source time series reconstructions reveals a large scale network of brain areas involving frontal, temporal and parietal areas that are involved in network level processing of cross-modal perception. Finally, we demonstrate that how a biophysically realistic computational model representing the interaction among key neuronal systems (visual, auditory and multisensory cortical regions) can explain the empirical observations. Each system involves a group of excitatory and inhibitory Hindmarsh Rose neurons that are coupled amongst each other. Large-scale FC between areas is conceptualized using coupling functions and the identity of a specific system, e.g., visual/ auditory/ multisensory is chosen using empirical estimates of the time-scale of information processing in these systems. The model predicts that the disappearance of alpha band coherence observed in rare perceivers stems from a negligible direct A-V (audio-visual) coupling however, an increase in indirect interaction via multisensory node leads to enhanced gamma band and reduced alpha band coherences observed during illusory perception. Overall, we establish the mechanistic basis of large-scale FC patterns underlying cross-modal perception.",

    "abstract": "Body measurements can be used in determining body size to monitor the cattle growth and examine the response to selection. Despite efforts putting into the identification of common genetic variants, the mechanism understanding of the rare variation in complex traits about body size and growth remains limited. Here, we firstly performed GWAS study for body measurement traits in Simmental cattle, however there were no SNPs exceeding significant level associated with body measurements. To further investigate the mechanism of growth traits in beef cattle, we conducted whole exome analysis of 20 cattle with phenotypic differences on body girth and length, representing the first systematic exploration of rare variants on body measurements in cattle. By carrying out a three-phase process of the variant calling and filtering, a sum of 1158, 1151, 1267, and 1303 rare variants were identified in four phenotypic groups of two growth traits, higher/ lower body girth (BG_H and BG_L) and higher/lower body length (BL_H and BL_L) respectively. The subsequent functional enrichment analysis revealed that these rare variants distributed in 886 genes associated with collagen formation and organelle organization, indicating the importance of collagen formation and organelle organization for body size growth in cattle. The integrative network construction distinguished 62 and 66 genes with different co-expression patterns associated with higher and lower phenotypic groups of body measurements respectively, and the two sub-networks were distinct. Gene ontology and pathway annotation further showed that all shared genes in phenotypic differences participate in many biological processes related to the growth and development of the organism. Together, these findings provide a deep insight into rare genetic variants of growth traits in cattle and this will have a promising application in animal breeding.",

Studying this phenomenon in thalamic neurons is critical to understanding the first insult implicated in multiple neuro-degenerative disorders. To study these changes we used cyclical stimulations using micro-electrodes to the axon initiation segment of mouse thalamic neurons. Numerical simulation results indicate that axon initiation segment water potential fluctuated sinusoidally on high voltage only. Fluctuations in the amplitude and trend were caused by calcium flow and storage resistance, respectively. The change in axon initiation segment-stored water was proportional to the change rate in water potential. Axon initiation segment diameter increased with fluctuations in calcium free media; moreover, it varied slightly under low voltage conditions. Our results indicate that the changes in axon initiation segment diameter were caused by changes in water potential, which can be attributed to subcellular gated calcium channels within the thalamic neurons.",

    "abstract": "In glioma patients, high levels of glutamate can cause brain edema and seizures. GLAST, a glutamate-aspartate transporter expressed by astrocytes with a role in glutamate uptake, is highly expressed on the plasma membrane of glioblastoma (GBM) cells, and its expression significantly correlates with shortened patient survival. Here, it was demonstrated that inhibition of GLAST expression limited the progression and invasion of GBM xenografts. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure glutamate in GLAST-expressing gliomas showing that these tumors exhibit increased glutamate concentration. Despite their GLAST expression, GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) released rather than took up glutamate due to their lack of Na+/K+-ATPase. Overexpression of Na+/K+-ATPase in these cells restored glutamate uptake and induced apoptosis. The therapeutic relevance of targeting GLAST in gliomas was assessed using the inhibitor UCPH-101. In glioma-bearing mice, a single intratumoral injection of UCPH-101 significantly increased survival by decreasing GLAST expression and inducing apoptosis. Thus, GLAST has a novel role in GBM that appears to have crucial relevance in glutamate trafficking and may thus be a new therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "RNA editing diversifies genomically encoded information to expand the complexity of the transcriptome. In ectothermic organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast, endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements, rarely results in the recoding of amino acids and plays a critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30{degrees}C and can be maintained at 5{degrees}C for many days during torpor. We profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature during hibernation. We identified 5,165 A-to-I editing sites in 1,205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged cold exposure. The majority (99.6%) of the cold-increased editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding regions, 82.7% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body temperature may provide a neuroprotective mechanism to limit aberrant dsRNA accumulation during torpor in the mammalian hibernator.",

    "abstract": "Efficient delivery of therapeutic RNA is the fundamental obstacle preventing its clinical utility. Lipid conjugation improves plasma half-life, tissue accumulation, and cellular uptake of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, the impact of conjugate structure and hydrophobicity on siRNA pharmacokinetics is unclear, impeding the design of clinically relevant lipid-siRNAs. Using a panel of biologically-occurring lipids, we show that lipid conjugation modulates siRNA hydrophobicity and governs spontaneous partitioning into distinct plasma lipoprotein classes in vivo. Lipoprotein binding influences siRNA distribution by delaying renal excretion and promoting uptake into lipoprotein receptor-enriched tissues. Lipid-siRNAs elicit mRNA silencing without causing toxicity in a tissue-specific manner. Lipid-siRNA internalization occurs independently of lipoprotein endocytosis, and is mediated by siRNA phosphorothioate modifications. Although biomimetic lipoprotein nanoparticles have been considered for the enhancement of siRNA delivery, our findings suggest that hydrophobic modifications can be leveraged to incorporate therapeutic siRNA into endogenous lipid transport pathways without the requirement for synthetic formulation.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based representations are considered to be the future for reference genomes, as they allow integrated representation of the steadily increasing data on individual variation. Currently available tools allow de novo assembly of graph-based reference genomes, alignment of new read sets to the graph representation as well as certain analyses like variant calling and haplotyping. We here present a first method for calling ChIP-Seq peaks on read data aligned to a graph-based reference genome. The method is a graph generalization of the peak caller MACS2, and is implemented in an open source tool, Graph Peak Caller. By using the existing tool vg to build a pan-genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, we validate our approach by showing that Graph Peak Caller with a pan-genome reference graph can trace variants within peaks that are not part of the linear reference genome, and find peaks that in general are more motif-enriched than those found by MACS2.",

    "abstract": "MotivationUnique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are added to DNA fragments before PCR amplification to discriminate between alleles arising from the same genomic locus and sequencing reads produced by PCR amplification. While computational methods have been developed to take into account UMI information in genome-wide and single-cell sequencing studies, they are not designed for modern amplicon based sequencing experiments, especially in cases of high allelic diversity. Importantly, no guidelines are provided for the design of optimal UMI length for amplicon-based sequencing experiments.\\n\\nResultsBased on the total number of DNA fragments and the distribution of allele frequencies, we present a model for the determination of the minimum UMI length required to prevent UMI collisions and reduce allelic distortion. We also introduce a user-friendly software tool called AmpUMI to assist in the design and the analysis of UMI-based amplicon sequencing studies. AmpUMI provides quality control metrics on frequency and quality of UMIs, and trims and deduplicates amplicon sequences with user specified parameters for use in downstream analysis.

    "abstract": "MotivationRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate every aspect of RNA metabolism and function. There are hundreds of RBPs encoded in the eukaryotic genomes, and each recognize its RNA targets through a specific mixture of RNA sequence and structure properties. For most RBPs, however, only a primary sequence motif has been determined, while the structure of the binding sites is uncharacterized.\\n\\nResultsWe developed SSMART, an RNA motif finder that simultaneously models the primary sequence and the structural properties of the RNA targets sites. The sequence-structure motifs are represented as consensus strings over a degenerate alphabet, extending the IUPAC codes for nucleotides to account for secondary structure preferences. Evaluation on synthetic data showed that SSMART is able to recover both sequence and structure motifs implanted into 3 UTR-like sequences, for various degrees of structured/unstructured binding sites. In addition, we successfully used SSMART on high-throughput in vivo and in vitro data, showing that we not only recover the known sequence motif, but also gain insight into the structural preferences of the RBP.\\n\\nAvailabilitySSMART is freely available at https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/SSMART_137/\\n\\nContactuwe.ohler@mdc-berlin.de",

    "abstract": "PurposeMutations in GBA cause Gaucher disease when biallelic, and are strong risk factors for Parkinsons disease when heterozygous. GBA analysis is complicated by the nearby pseudogene. We aimed to design and validate a method for sequencing GBA on the Oxford Nanopore MinION.\\n\\nMethodsWe sequenced an 8.9 kb amplicon from DNA samples of 17 individuals, including patients with Parkinsons and Gaucher disease, on older and current (R9.4) flow cells. These included samples with known mutations, assessed in a blinded fashion on the R9.4 data. We used NanoOK for quality metrics, two different aligners (Graphmap and NGMLR), Nanopolish and Sniffles to call variants, and Whatshap for phasing.\\n\\nResultsWe detected all known mutations, including the common p.N409S (N370S) and p.L483P (L444P), and three rarer ones, at the correct zygosity, as well as intronic SNPs. In a sample with the complex RecNciI allele, we detected an additional coding mutation, and a 55-base pair deletion. We confirmed compound heterozygosity where relevant. False positives were easily identified.\\n\\nConclusionThe Oxford Nanopore MinION can detect missense mutations and an exonic deletion in this difficult gene, with the added advantage of phasing and intronic analysis. It can be used as an efficient diagnostic tool.",

    "abstract": "Plant-bacteria associations have been extensively studied for their potential in increasing crop productivity in a sustainable manner. Serratia marcescens is a Gram-negative species found in a wide range of environments, including soil. Here we describe the genome sequencing and assessment of plant-growth promoting abilities of S. marcescens UENF-22GI (SMU), a strain isolated from mature cattle manure vermicompost. In vitro, SMU is able to solubilize P and Zn, to produce indole compounds (likely IAA), to colonize hyphae and counter the growth of two phytopathogenic fungi. Inoculation of maize with SMU remarkably increased seedling growth and biomass under greenhouse conditions. The SMU genome has 5 Mb, assembled in 17 scaffolds comprising 4,662 genes (4,528 are protein-coding). No plasmids were identified. SMU is phylogenetically placed within a clade comprised almost exclusively of environmental strains. We were able to find the genes and operons that are likely responsible for all the interesting plant-growth promoting features that were experimentally described. Genes involved other interesting properties that were not experimentally tested (e.g. tolerance against metal contamination) were also identified. The SMU genome harbors a horizontally-transferred genomic island involved in antibiotic production, antibiotic resistance, and anti-phage defense via a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase-like protein and possible modification of DNA by a deazapurine base, which likely contributes to the SMU competitiveness against other bacteria. Collectively, our results suggest that S. marcescens UENF-22GI is a strong candidate to be used in the enrichment of substrates for plant growth promotion or as part of bioinoculants for Agriculture.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceAccumulating evidence supports cerebellar involvement in mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, little is known about cerebellar involvement in the developmental stages of these disorders. In particular, whether cerebellar morphology is associated with early expression of specific symptom domains remains unclear.\\n\\nObjectiveTo determine the robustness and specificity of associations between cerebellar morphology, general cognitive function, general psychopathology and sub-clinical psychiatric symptom domains in adolescence.\\n\\nDesign, setting and participantsAssessment of parametric structure-function associations between MR-based brain morphometric features and data-driven cognitive and clinical phenotypes in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (N=1401, age-range: 8 - 23).\\n\\nMain outcomes and measuresRobust prediction of cognitive and clinical symptom domain scores from cerebellar, subcortical and cerebro-cortical brain features using machine learning with 10-fold internal cross-validation and permutation-based statistical inference.\\n\\nResultsCerebellar morphology predicted both general cognitive function and general psychopathology (mean Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and observed values: r = .20 and r = .13, respectively; corrected p-values < .0009). Analyses of specific sub-clinical symptom domains revealed significant associations with rates of norm-violating behavior (r = .17; p < .0009), prodromal psychotic symptoms (r = .12; p < .0009) and anxiety symptoms (r = .09; p =.0117). In contrast, we observed no significant associations between cerebellar features and the severity of attention deficits, depressive, manic or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (all rs =< .03, all ps => .1). Associations with norm-violating behavior and prodromal psychotic symptoms were stronger for the cerebellum than for subcortical and cerebro-cortical regions, while anxiety and general cognitive function were related to more global brain morphology patterns. The association between cerebellar volume and prodromal psychotic symptoms, and to a lesser extent norm violating behavior, remained significant when adjusting for potentially confounding factors such as general cognitive function, general psychopathology, parental education level and use of psychoactive substances.\\n\\nConclusions and relevanceThe robust associations with sub-clinical psychiatric symptoms in the age range when these typically emerge highlight the cerebellum as a key brain structure in the development of severe mental disorders.\\n\\nKey pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionsC_ST_ABSIs cerebellar morphology associated with sub-clinical psychiatric symptoms in adolescence? Do such associations show symptom domain specificity or do they rather constitute a marker of general psychopathology?\\n\\nFindingsMachine learning utilizing cerebellar morphology features significantly predicted the severity of prodromal psychotic symptoms, norm-violating behavior and anxiety, but not attention deficits, depressive, manic or obsessive-compulsive sub-clinical symptoms. Associations with prodromal psychotic symptoms were stronger for the cerebellum than for cerebral subcortical and cerebro-cortical regions, and remained significant when adjusting for several potentially confounding factors.\\n\\nMeaningThe cerebellum appears to play a key role in the development of severe mental illness.",
