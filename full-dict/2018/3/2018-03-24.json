    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, every year more than a billion people are infected with vector-borne diseases worldwide. There are no vaccines for most vector-borne diseases. Vector control, therefore, is often the only way to prevent outbreaks. Despite the major impact of vectors on human health, knowledge gaps exist regarding their natural population dynamics. Even the most basic information--such as spatiotemporal abundance-- is not available. Mosquitoes transmit malaria and the viruses causing Yellow Fever, West Nile, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika in the Americas. The Americas have a long history of mosquito control efforts, including the unsustained but successful Aedes aegypti eradication initiative. In the US, municipalities have independently created agencies for mosquito control and monitoring. We propose that the ensemble of US mosquito control agencies can, and should, be used to develop a national--and potentially international--system for Cross-Scale Vector Monitoring and Control (CSVMaC), in which local level monitoring and control efforts are cross-linked by unified real-time data streaming to build the data capital needed to gain a mechanistic understanding of vector population dynamics. Vectors, and the pathogens they transmit, know no jurisdictions. The vision of CSVMaC is, therefore, to provide data for (i) the general study of mosquito ecology and (ii) to inform vector control during epidemics/outbreaks that impact multiple jurisdictions (i.e., counties, states, etc.). We reveal >1000 mosquito control agencies in the US with enormous troves of data that are hidden among many data silos. For CSVMaC, we propose the creation of a nationally-coordinated open-access database to collate mosquito data. The database would provide scientific and public health communities with highly resolved spatiotemporal data on arboviral disease vectors, empowering new interventions and insights while leveraging pre-existing human efforts, operational infrastructure, and investments already funded by taxpayers.",

    "abstract": "Dogs can interpret emotional human faces (especially the ones expressing happiness), yet the cerebral correlates of this process are unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we studied eight awake and unrestrained dogs. In Experiment 1 dogs observed happy and neutral human faces, and found increased brain activity when viewing happy human faces in temporal cortex and caudate. In Experiment 2 the dogs were presented with human faces expressing happiness, anger, fear, or sadness. Using the resulting cluster from Experiment 1 we trained a linear support vector machine classifier to discriminate between pairs of emotions and found that it could only discriminate between happiness and the other emotions. Finally, evaluation of the whole-brain fMRI time courses through a similar classifier allowed us to predict the emotion being observed by the dogs. Our results show that human emotions are specifically represented in dogs brains, highlighting their importance for inter-species communication.",

    "abstract": "Epistemic curiosity (EC) is a cornerstone of human cognition that contributes to the actualization of our cognitive potential by stimulating a myriad of information-seeking behaviours. Yet, its fundamental relationship with uncertainty remains poorly understood, which limits our ability to predict within- and between-individual variability in the willingness to acquire knowledge. Here, a two-step stochastic trivia quiz designed to induce curiosity and manipulate answer uncertainty provided behavioural and neural evidence for an integrative model of EC inspired from predictive coding. More precisely, our behavioural data indicated an inverse relationship between average surprise and EC levels, which depended upon hemodynamic activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex from one trial to another and from one individual to another. Complementary, the elicitation of epistemic surprise and the relief of acute curiosity states were respectively related to ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum activity. Taken together, our results account for the temporal evolution of EC over time, as well as for the interplay of EC, prior knowledge and surprise in controlling memory gain.",

    "abstract": "Although the Factor V Leiden (FVL) gene variant is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis, only 10% of FVL carriers will experience such an event in their lifetime. To identify potential FVL modifier genes contributing to this incomplete penetrance, we took advantage of a perinatal synthetic lethal thrombosis phenotype in mice homozygous for FVL (F5L/L) and haploinsufficient for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (Tfpi+/-) to perform a sensitized dominant ENU mutagenesis screen. Linkage analysis conducted in the 3 largest pedigrees generated from the surviving F5L/L Tfpi+/- mice ( rescues) using ENU-induced coding variants as genetic markers was unsuccessful in identifying major suppressor loci. Whole exome sequencing was applied to DNA from 107 rescue mice to identify candidate genes enriched for ENU mutations. A total of 3,481 potentially deleterious candidate ENU variants were identified in 2,984 genes. After correcting for gene size and multiple testing, Arl6ip5 was identified as the most enriched gene, though not reaching genome-wide significance. Evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 induced loss of function in the top 6 genes failed to demonstrate a clear rescue phenotype. However, a maternally inherited (not ENU-induced) de novo mutation (Plcb4R335Q) exhibited significant co-segregation with the rescue phenotype (p=0.003) in the corresponding pedigree. Thrombosis suppression by heterozygous Plcb4 loss of function was confirmed through analysis of an independent, CRISPR/Cas9-induced Plcb4 mutation (p=0.01).\\n\\nAuthor summaryAbnormal blood clotting in veins (venous thrombosis) or arteries (arterial thrombosis) are major health problems, with venous thrombosis affecting approximately 1 in every thousand individuals annually in the United States. Susceptibility to venous thrombosis is governed by both genes and environment, with approximately 60% of the risk attributed to genetic influences. Though several genetic risk factors are known, >50% of genetic risk remains unexplained. Approximately 5% of people carry the most common known risk factor, Factor V Leiden. However, only 10% of these individuals will develop a blood clot in their lifetime. Mice carrying two copies of the Factor V Leiden mutation together with a mutation in a second gene called tissue factor pathway inhibitor develop fatal thrombosis shortly after birth. To identify genes that prevent this fatal thrombosis, we studied a large panel of mice carrying inactivating gene changes randomly distributed throughout the genome. We identified several genes as potential candidates to alter blood clotting balance in mice and humans with predisposition to thrombosis, and confirmed this protective function for DNA changes in one of these genes (Plcb4).",

    "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is crucial for adaptation and is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders and psychopathology. Human studies of flexibility using reversal learning tasks typically contrast error trials before and after reversal, which provides little information about the mechanisms that support learning and expressing a new response. However, animal studies suggest a specific role in this latter process for the connections between the dorsal striatum and the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamus, a system which may recruit the striatal cholinergic interneurons, but which is not well understood in humans. This study investigated the role of this system in human probabilistic reversal learning, specifically with respect to learning a new response strategy, contrasting its function to that of the better understood orbitoftontal-striatal systems. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data we show that connectivity between the striatum and both the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and CM-Pf pathways increased during reversal, but not initial learning. However, while the strength of lOFC-striatal connectivity was associated with the speed of the reversal, the strength of CM-Pf-striatal connectivity was associated specifically with the quality of the reversal (reduced regressive errors). These findings expand our understanding of flexibility mechanisms in the human brain, bridging the gap with animal studies of this system.",

In this paper we explore those methods using apple cultivars, a model biological system in which discrete groups are pre-defined but in which there is a high level of overall morphological similarity. The effectiveness of morphometric techniques in discovering the groups is evaluated using statistical learning tools. No one technique proved optimal in classification on every occasion, linear morphometric techniques slightly out-performing geometric (72.6% accuracy on test set versus 66.7%). The combined use of these techniques with post-hoc knowledge of their individual successes with particular cultivars achieves a notably higher classification accuracy (77.8%). From this we conclude that even with pre-determined discrete categories, a range of approaches is needed where those categories are intrinsically similar to each other, and we raise the question of whether in studies where potentially continuous natural variation is being categorised the level of match between categories is routinely set too high.",

    "abstract": "Engineering microbial consortia is an important new frontier for synthetic biology given its efficiency in performing complex tasks and endurance to environmental uncertainty. Most synthetic circuits regulate populational behaviors via cell-to-cell communications, which are affected by spatially heterogenous environments. Therefore, it is important to understand the limits on controlling system dynamics that are determined by interconnections among cell agents and provide a control strategy for engineering consortia. Here, we build a network model for a fractional population control circuit in two-strain consortia, and characterize the cell-to-cell communication network by topological properties, such as symmetry, locality and connectivity. Using linear network control theory, we relate the network topology to system outputs tracking performance. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that the minimum network control energy for accurate tracking depends on locality difference between two cell populations spatial distributions and how strongly the controller node contributes to communication strength. To realize a robust consortia, we can manipulate the communication network topology and construct strongly connected consortia by altering chemicals in environments. Our results ground the expected cell population dynamics in its spatially organized communication network, and inspire directions in cooperative control in microbial consortia.",

    "abstract": "Aggregating multiple non-expert opinions into a collective estimate can improve accuracy across many contexts. However, two sources of error can diminish collective wisdom: individual estimation biases and information sharing between individuals. Here we measure individual biases and social influence rules in multiple experiments involving hundreds of individuals performing a classic numerosity estimation task. We first investigate how existing aggregation methods, such as calculating the arithmetic mean or the median, are influenced by these sources of error. We show that the mean tends to overestimate, and the median underestimate, the true value for a wide range of numerosities. Quantifying estimation bias, and mapping individual bias to collective bias, allows us to develop and validate three new aggregation measures that effectively counter sources of collective estimation error. In addition, we present results from a further experiment that quantifies the social influence rules that individuals employ when incorporating personal estimates with social information. We show that the corrected mean is remarkably robust to social influence, retaining high accuracy in the presence or absence of social influence, across numerosities, and across different methods for averaging social information. Utilizing knowledge of estimation biases and social influence rules may therefore be an inexpensive and general strategy to improve the wisdom of crowds.",

Most current approaches to address this problem use primarily somatic mutations, not fully exploiting additional layers of biological information. Here, we describe ModulOmics, a method to de novo identify cancer driver pathways, or modules, by integrating multiple data types (protein-protein interactions, mutual exclusivity of mutations or copy number alterations, transcriptional co-regulation, and RNA co-expression) into a single probabilistic model. To efficiently search the exponential space of candidate modules, ModulOmics employs a two-step optimization procedure that combines integer linear programming with stochastic search. Across several cancer types, ModulOmics identifies highly functionally connected modules enriched with cancer driver genes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. For breast cancer subtypes, the inferred modules recapitulate known molecular mechanisms and suggest novel subtype-specific functionalities. These findings are supported by an independent patient cohort, as well as independent proteomic and phosphoproteomic datasets.",

It is the raw material on which acts selection, it improves species and communities resilience to disturbance and it affects the way species modulate their biotic and abiotic environment. Understanding patterns and underlying determinants of genetic and phenotypic intraspecific diversity is therefore of critical importance for ecological, evolutionary and conservation sciences. Here, focusing on two freshwater fish species (Gobio occitaniae and Phoxinus phoxinus) sampled across a large river basin (the Garonne-Dordogne river basin, France), we used causal analyses to test for genetic-phenotypic intraspecific diversity correlations (GPIDCs) and unravel the processes underlying intraspecific diversity patterns. Genetic diversity was assessed using microsatellite markers and phenotypic diversity was assessed through geometric morphometrics. We found disparities in the distribution of genetic and phenotypic diversity in the two species, suggesting higher level of local adaptation in G. occitaniae, and our results revealed common and contrasted processes shaping diversity at the - and {beta}-level. At the -level, we found no GPIDC in both species despite common relations between isolation and genetic and phenotypic -diversity in G. occitaniae. At the {beta}-level, we found no GPIDC in P. phoxinus but we found a positive GPIDC in G. occitaniae. This correlation appeared to be caused by a direct impact of one facet of intraspecific diversity on the other, and we speculated that it could originate from positive assortative mating. Studying neutral genetic diversity and phenotypic diversity within an integrative framework appears as a valuable way of deciphering the complex and diverse impacts of neutral and adaptive processes on intraspecific diversity patterns.",

    "abstract": "Majority of the genes expressed during spermatogenesis are autosomal. Mice with different deletions of Yq show sub-fertility, sterility and sperm abnormalities. The connection between Yq deletion and autosomal gene regulation is not well understood. We describe a novel mouse Yq-derived long noncoding RNA, Pirmy, which shows unprecedented number of splice variants in testis. Further, Pirmy transcript variants act as templates for several piRNAs. We identified ten differentially expressed autosome-encoded sperm proteins in mutant mice. Pirmy transcript variants have homology to 5/3UTRs of these deregulated autosomal genes. Thus, subfertility in Y-deleted mice appears to be a polygenic phenomenon that is partially regulated epistatically by the Y-chromosome. Our study provides novel insights into possible role of MSY-derived ncRNAs in male fertility and reproduction. Finally, sperm phenotypes from the Y-deleted mice seem to be similar to that reported in inter-specific male-sterile hybrids. Taken together, this study provides novel insights into possible role of Y-derived ncRNAs in male sterility and speciation.",

    "abstract": "Humans can recall a large number of memories years after the events that triggered them. Early studies of humans with amnesia led to the hippocampus being viewed as the critical structure for episodic memory, but human lesions are imprecise, making it difficult to identify the anatomical structures underlying memory impairments. Rodent studies enable great temporal and anatomical precision in hippocampal manipulations, but not investigation of the rich assortment of interleaved memories that occurs in humans. Thus it is not known how lesions restricted to the hippocampus affect the retrieval of multiple sequentially encoded memories. Furthermore, disagreement exists as to whether hippocampal inactivations lead to a temporally graded, or ungraded amnesia, which could be a consequence of different types hippocampal disruption observed in rodent and human studies. In the current study, four rhesus monkeys received bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and were compared to thirteen unoperated controls on recognition and new learning of visual object-in-place scenes. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired compared to controls at remembering scenes that were encoded before the lesion. We did not observe any temporal gradient effect of the lesion on memory recognition, with recent and remote memories being equally affected by the lesion. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions showed no deficits in learning and later recognising new scenes. Thus, the hippocampus, like other cortical regions, may be engaged in the acquisition and storage of new memories, but its role can be taken over by spared regions following a lesion. These findings illustrate the utility of experimental paradigms for studying retrograde and anterograde amnesia that make use of the capacity of nonhuman primates to rapidly acquire many distinct visual memories.",

    "abstract": "Enabling communication for patients in the complete locked-in state (CLIS) has been a major goal for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research over the past 20 years. Last year, two papers were published that claim to have reached this goal: (Chaudhary et al., 2017) were the first to report communication in CLIS using a method based on fNRIS. Few month later, (Guger et al., 2017) claimed that their EEG-based BCI system is able to restore communication in CLIS. This manuscript demonstrates methodological flaws in the analysis of both papers and that their conclusions are invalid. Further, the data from (Chaudhary et al., 2017) is reanalyzed to demonstrate that their results cannot be reproduced and that there is currently no scientifically sound evidence that demonstrates communication in CLIS.",

    "abstract": "One of the main causes for failure in the drug development pipeline or withdrawal post approval is the unexpected occurrence of severe drug adverse events. Even though such events should be detected by in vitro, in vivo, and human trials, they continue to unexpectedly arise at different stages of drug development causing costly clinical trial failures and market withdrawal. Inspired by the \\\"moneyball\\\" approach used in baseball to integrate diverse features to predict player success, we hypothesized that a similar approach could leverage existing adverse event and tissue-specific toxicity data to learn how to predict adverse events. We introduce MAESTER, a data-driven machine learning approach that integrates information on a compounds structure, targets, and phenotypic effects with tissue-wide genomic profiling and our toxic target database to predict the probability of a compound presenting with different types of tissue-specific adverse events. When tested on 6 different types of adverse events MAESTER maintains a high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across both the training data and new test sets. Additionally, MAESTER scores could flag a number of drugs that were approved, but later withdrawn due to unknown adverse events - highlighting its potential to identify events missed by traditional methods. MAESTER can also be used to identify toxic targets for each tissue type. Overall MAESTER provides a broadly applicable framework to identify toxic targets and predict specific adverse events and can accelerate the drug development pipeline and drive the design of new safer compounds.",

    "abstract": "S-type anion channels (SLAC/SLAHs), which play important roles in plant anion (such as nitrate and chloride) transport, growth and development, abiotic stress responses and hormone signaling. However, there is far less information about this family in Rosaceae species. We performed a genome-wide analysis and identified SLAC/SLAH gene family members in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) and four other species of Rosaceae (Malus domestica, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca and Prunus mume). A total of 21 SLAC/SLAH genes were identified from the five Rosaceae species. Based on the structural characteristics and a phylogenetic analysis of these genes, the SLAC/SLAH gene family could be classified into three main groups (I, II and III). The evolutionary analysis showed that the SLAC/SLAH gene family was comparatively conserved during the evolution of Rosaceae species. Transcriptome data demonstrated that PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were detected in all parts of the pear. However, PbrSLAC1 showed a higher expression level in leaf, while PbrSLAH2/3 was mainly expressed in roots. In addition, PbrSLAC/SLAH genes were only located on the plasma membrane in transient expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts cells. These results provide valuable information that increases our understanding of the evolution, expression and functions of the SLAC/SLAH gene family in higher plants.",

    "abstract": "Network analysis helps us to understand how genes jointly affect biological functions. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a frequently used method to build gene co-expression networks. WGCNA may be calculated with signed or unsigned correlations, with both methods having strengths and weaknesses, but both methods fail to capture weak and moderate negative correlations, which may be important in gene regulation. Combining the advantages and removing the disadvantages of both methods in one analysis would be desirable. In this study, we present a combination of signed and unsigned WGCNA (csuWGCNA), which combines the signed and unsigned methods and improves the detection of negative correlations. We applied csuWGCNA in 14 simulated datasets, six ground truth datasets and two large human brain datasets. Multiple metrics were used to evaluate csuWGCNA at gene pair and gene module levels. We found that csuWGCNA provides robust module detection and captures more negative correlations than the other methods, and is especially useful for non-coding RNA such as microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). csuWGCNA enables detection of more informative modules with biological functions than signed or unsigned WGCNA, which enables discovery of novel gene regulation and helps interpretations in systems biology.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms used by cancer cells to resist the severe disruption in protein homeostasis caused by proteasome inhibitors remain obscure. Here, we show this resistance correlates with a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Employing small molecule screens, we identified a striking overlap between compounds that preferentially impede the growth of proteasome inhibitor-resistant cancer cells and those that block the growth of high OXPHOS cells. Elesclomol potently exhibits both characteristics. Using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screening, in vitro validation and NMR spectroscopy we identify mitochondrial protein ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a critical component of mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, as the primary target of elesclomol. In a mouse model of multiple myeloma, inhibition of FDX1 with elesclomol significantly attenuated the emergence of proteasome inhibitor-resistance and markedly prolonged survival. Our work reveals that the mitochondrial Fe-S cluster pathway is a targetable vulnerability in cancers that are resistant to increased proteotoxic burden.",

However, the genomic features of these genes and the relevance of their transcriptional activity for HIV-1 integration have so far remained unclear. Here we show that recurrently targeted genes are delineated with super-enhancer genomic elements and that they cluster in specific spatial compartments of the T cell nucleus. We further show that these gene clusters acquire their location at the nuclear periphery during the activation of T cells. The clustering of these genes along with their transcriptional activity are the major determinants of HIV-1 integration in T cells. Our results show for the first time the relevance of the spatial compartmentalization of the genome for HIV-1 integration, thus further strengthening the role of nuclear architecture in viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation in CF, an in-frame deletion of phenylalanine 508, leads to a trafficking defect and endoplasmic reticulum retention of the protein where it becomes targeted for degradation. Successful clinical deployments of ivacaftor and ivacaftor/lumacaftor combination have been an exciting translational development in treating CF. However, their therapeutic effects are variable between subjects and remain insufficient. We used the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database as our chemical pool to screen for candidates. For in silico screening, we integrated connectivity mapping and CF systems biology to identify candidate therapeutic compounds for CF. Following in silico screening, we validated our candidate compounds with (i) an enteroid-based compound screening assay using CF ({Delta}F508/{Delta}F508-CFTR) patient-derived enteroids, (ii) short-circuit current analysis using polarized CF primary human airway epithelial cells and (iii) Western blots to measure F508-del-CFTR protein maturation. We identified 184 candidate compounds with in silico screening and tested 24 of them with enteroid-based forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay. The top hit compound was PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor that induced swelling in enteroid comparable to known CF corrector (lumacaftor). Further validation with Western blot and short-circuit current analysis showed that PP-2 could correct mutant CFTR mis-folding and restore CFTR-mediated transmembrane current. We have identified PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor, as a novel corrector of {Delta}F508-CFTR. Based on our studies and previous reports, src kinase inhibition may represent a novel paradigm of multi-action therapeutics - corrector, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective - in CF.",
