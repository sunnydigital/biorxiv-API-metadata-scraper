    "abstract": "Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryResting state fMRI has become a ubiquitous tool for measuring connectivity in normal and diseased brains. Current dominant models of connectivity are based on coarse-scale connectivity among brain regions, ignoring fine-scale structure within those regions. We developed a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome that captures both coarse and fine-scale structure of connectivity shared across brains. We showed that this shared fine-scale structure is related to fine-scale distinctions in representation of information, and our model accounts for substantially more shared variance of connectivity compared to previous models. Our model opens new territory -- shared fine-scale structure, a dominant but mostly unexplored component of the human connectome -- for analysis and study.",

    "abstract": "A core regulatory pathway that directs developmental transitions and cellular asymmetries in Agrobacterium tumefaciens involves two overlapping, integrated phosphorelays. One of these phosphorelays putatively includes four histidine sensor kinase homologues, DivJ, PleC, PdhS1, and PdhS2, and two response regulators, DivK and PleD. In several different alphaproteobacteria, this pathway influences a conserved downstream phosphorelay that ultimately controls the phosphorylation state of the CtrA master response regulator. The PdhS2 sensor kinase reciprocally regulates biofilm formation and swimming motility. In the current study the mechanisms by which the A. tumefaciens sensor kinase PdhS2 directs this regulation are delineated. PdhS2 lacking a key residue for phosphatase activity is markedly deficient in proper control of attachment and motility phenotypes, whereas a kinase-deficient PdhS2 mutant is only modestly affected. A genetic interaction between DivK and PdhS2 is revealed, unmasking one of several connections between PdhS2-dependent phenotypes and transcriptional control by CtrA. Epistasis experiments suggest that PdhS2 can function independently of the CckA sensor kinase, the cognate sensor kinase for CtrA which is inhibited by DivK. PdhS2 dynamically localizes to the daughter cell pole in dividing cells. Global expression analysis of the pdhS2 mutant reveals a restricted regulon, functioning through CtrA to separately control motility and regulate levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP), thereby affecting production of adhesive polysaccharides and attachment. We hypothesize that in A. tumefaciens the CtrA regulatory circuit has expanded to include additional inputs through addition of PdhS-type sensor kinases, likely fine-tuning the response of this organism to the soil microenvironment.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial developmental processes, such as morphological transformations and behavioral transitions, are tightly regulated. In many alphaproteobacteria cell division and development are coordinated by a specific suite of conserved histidine kinases and their partnered regulatory proteins. Here we describe how the histidine kinase PdhS2 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens regulates complex phenotypes including biofilm formation and motility. PdhS2 genetically interacts with a single-domain response regulator, DivK, and the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate. PdhS2 dynamically localizes to the new pole of recently divided cells, contributing to the regulatory processes that dictate whether these cells remain motile or initiate biofilm formation. These findings expand our understanding of the complex network that integrates cell division and developmental control in A. tumefaciens and related alphaproteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "The functional neuroimaging literature has become increasingly complex and thus difficult to navigate. This complexity arises from the rate at which new studies are published and from the terminology that varies widely from study-to-study and even more so from discipline-to-discipline. One way to investigate and manage this problem is to build a \\\"semantic space\\\" that maps the different vocabulary used in functional neuroimaging literature. Such a semantic space will also help identify the primary research domains of neuroimaging and their most commonly reported brain regions. In this work, we analyzed the multivariate semantic structure of abstracts in Neurosynth and found that there are six primary domains of the functional neuroimaging literature each with their own preferred reported brain regions. Our analyses also highlight possible semantic sources of reported brain regions within and across domains because some research topics (e.g., memory disorders, substance use disorder) use heterogeneous terminology. Furthermore, we highlight the growth and decline of the primary domains over time. Finally, we note that our techniques and results form the basis of a \\\"recommendation engine\\\" that could help readers better navigate the neuroimaging literature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA central question in bioinformatics is how to minimize arbitrariness and bias in analysis of patterns of enrichment in data. A prime example of such a question is enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in lists of genes. Our paper deals with two issues within this larger question. One is how to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a set of apparently enriched ontologies, and the second how to set that FDR within the context of assessing significance for addressing biological questions, to answer these questions we compare a random resampling method with a commonly used method for assessing FDR, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. We further develop a heuristic method for evaluating Type II (false negative) errors to enable utilization of F-Measure binary classification theory for distinguishing \\\"significant\\\" from \\\"non-significant\\\" degrees of enrichment.\\n\\nResultsThe results show the preferability and feasibility of random resampling assessment of FDR over the analytical methods with which we compare it. They also show that the reasonableness of any arbitrary threshold depends strongly on the structure of the dataset being tested, suggesting that the less arbitrary method of F-measure optimization to determine significance threshold is preferable.\\n\\nConclusionTherefore, we suggest using F-measure optimization instead of placing an arbitrary threshold to evaluate the significance of Gene Ontology Enrichment results, and using resampling to replace analytical methods",

    "abstract": "A key challenge to transferring knowledge between species is that different species have fundamentally different genetic architectures. Initial computational approaches to transfer knowledge across species have relied on measures of heredity such as genetic homology, but these approaches suffer from limitations. First, only a small subset of genes have homologs, limiting the amount of knowledge that can be transferred, and second, genes change or repurpose functions, complicating the transfer of knowledge. Many approaches address this problem by expanding the notion of homology by leveraging high-throughput genomic and proteomic measurements, such as through network alignment.\\n\\nIn this work, we take a new approach to transferring knowledge across species by expanding the notion of homology through explicit measures of functional similarity between proteins in different species. Specifically, our kernel-based method, HO_SCPLOWANDLC_SCPLOW (Homology Assessment across Networks using Diffusion and Landmarks), integrates sequence and network structure to create a functional embedding in which proteins from different species are embedded in the same vector space. We show that inner products in this space capture functional similarity across species, and the vectors themselves are useful for a variety of cross species tasks. We perform the first whole-genome method for predicting phenologs, generating many that were previously identified, but also predicting new phenologs supported from the biological literature. We also demonstrate the HO_SCPLOWANDLC_SCPLOW-embedding captures pairwise gene function, in that gene pairs with synthetic lethal interactions are co-located in HO_SCPLOWANDLC_SCPLOW-space both within and across species. Software for the HO_SCPLOWANDLC_SCPLOW algorithm is available at http://github.com/lrgr/HANDL.",

    "abstract": "The heterotrimeric G protein Gq regulates neuronal activity through distinct downstream effector pathways. In addition to the canonical Gq effector phospholipase C{beta}, the small GTPase Rho was recently identified as a conserved effector of Gq. To identify additional molecules important for Gq signaling in neurons, we performed a forward genetic screen in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for suppressors of the hyperactivity and exaggerated waveform of an activated Gq mutant. We isolated two mutations affecting the MAP kinase scaffold protein KSR-1 and found that KSR-1 modulates locomotion downstream of or in parallel to the Gq-Rho pathway. Through epistasis experiments, we found that the core ERK MAPK cascade is required for Gq-Rho regulation of locomotion, but that the canonical ERK activator LET-60/Ras may not be required. Through neuron-specific rescue experiments, we found that the ERK pathway functions in head acetylcholine neurons to control Gq-dependent locomotion. Additionally, expression of activated LIN-45/Raf in head acetylcholine neurons is sufficient to cause an exaggerated waveform phenotype and hypersensitivity to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, similar to an activated Gq mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that the ERK MAPK pathway modulates the output of Gq-Rho signaling to control locomotion behavior in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic animal behaviors are regulated in part by neural circuits called the central pattern generators (CPGs). Classifying neural population activities correlated with body movements and identifying the associated component neurons are critical steps in understanding CPGs. Previous methods that classify neural dynamics obtained by dimension reduction algorithms often require manual optimization which could be laborious and preparation-specific. Here, we present a simpler and more flexible method that is based on the pre-trained convolutional neural network model VGG-16 and unsupervised learning, and successfully classifies the fictive motor patterns in Drosophila larvae under various imaging conditions. We also used voxel-wise correlation mapping to identify neurons associated with motor patterns. By applying these methods to neurons targeted by 5-HT2A-GAL4, which we generated by the CRISPR/Cas9-system, we identified two classes of interneurons, termed Seta and Leta, which are specifically active during backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Optogenetic activation of Seta and Leta neurons increased backward locomotion. Conversely, thermogenetic inhibition of 5-HT2A-GAL4 neurons or application of a 5-HT2 antagonist decreased backward locomotion induced by noxious light stimuli. This study establishes an accelerated pipeline for activity profiling and cell identification in larval Drosophila and implicates the serotonergic system in the modulation of backward locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a promising treatment for psychiatric and neurologic conditions, but outcomes are variable across treated individuals. This variability may be due in part to uncertainty in the selection of the stimulation site - a challenge complicated further by the variable organization of individual human brains. In principle, precise targeting of individual-specific brain areas serving outsized roles in cognition could improve the efficacy of NIBS. Network theory predicts that the importance of a node in network can be inferred from its connections; as such, we hypothesized that targeting individual-specific \\\"hub\\\" brain areas with NIBS would impact cognition more than non-hub brain areas. We first demonstrate that the spatial positioning of hubs is variable across individuals, but highly-reproducible when mapped with sufficient per-individual rsfMRI data. We then tested our hypothesis in healthy individuals using a prospective, within-subject, double-blind design. We found that inhibiting a hub with NIBS disrupted information processing during working-memory to a greater extent than inhibiting a non-hub area of the same gyrus. Furthermore, inhibition of hubs linking specific control networks and sensorimotor systems was retrospectively found to be most impactful. Based on these findings, we propose that precise mapping of individual-specific brain network features could inform future interventions in patients.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe network organization of every persons brain is different, but non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) interventions do not take this variation into account. Here we demonstrate that the spatial positions of brain areas theoretically serving important roles in cognition, called hubs, differs across individual humans, but are stable within an individual upon repeated neuroimaging. We found that administering NIBS to these individual-specific hub brain areas impacted cognition more than stimulation of non-hub areas. This finding indicates that future NIBS interventions can target individual-specific, but cognitively-relevant features of human brains.",

    "abstract": "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosomal RNA genes are encoded in a highly repetitive tandem array referred to as the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus. The yeast rDNA is the site of a diverse set of DNA-dependent processes, including transcription of ribosomal RNAs by RNA Polymerases I and III, transcription of non-coding RNAs by RNA Polymerase II, DNA replication initiation, replication fork blocking, and recombination-mediated regulation of rDNA repeat copy number. All of this takes place in the context of chromatin, but relatively little is known about the roles played by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors at the yeast rDNA. In this work, we report that the Isw2 and Ino80 chromatin remodeling factors are targeted to this highly repetitive locus. We characterize for the first time their function in modifying local chromatin structure, finding that loss of these factors affects the occupancy of nucleosomes in the 35S ribosomal RNA gene and the positioning of nucleosomes flanking the ribosomal origin of replication. In addition, we report that Isw2 and Ino80 promote efficient firing of the ribosomal origin of replication and facilitate the regulated increase of rDNA repeat copy number. This work significantly expands our understanding of the importance of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling for rDNA biology.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo satisfy high cellular demand for ribosomes, genomes contain many copies of the genes encoding the RNA components of ribosomes. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these ribosomal RNA genes are located in the \\\"ribosomal DNA locus\\\", a highly repetitive array that contains approximately 150 copies of the same unit, in contrast to the single copies that suffice for most genes. This repetitive quality creates unique regulatory needs. Chromatin structure, the packaging and organization of DNA, is a critical determinant of DNA-dependent processes throughout the genome. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors are important regulators of chromatin structure, and yet relatively little is known about how members of this class of protein affect DNA organization or behavior at the rDNA. In this work, we show that the Isw2 and Ino80 chromatin remodeling factors regulate two features of chromatin structure at the rDNA, the occupancy and the positioning of nucleosomes. In addition, we find that these factors regulate two critical processes that function uniquely at this locus: DNA replication originating from within the rDNA array, and the regulated increase of rDNA repeat copy number.",

    "abstract": "Cells adapt their metabolic fluxes in response to changes in the environment. We present a frame-work for the systematic construction of flux-based graphs derived from organism-wide metabolic networks. Our graphs encode the directionality of metabolic fluxes via edges that represent the flow of metabolites from source to target reactions. The methodology can be applied in the absence of a specific biological context by modelling fluxes probabilistically, or can be tailored to different environ-mental conditions by incorporating flux distributions computed through constraint-based approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis. We illustrate our approach on the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli and on a metabolic model of human hepatocytes. The flux-dependent graphs under various environmental conditions and genetic perturbations exhibit systemic changes in their topo-logical and community structure, which capture the re-routing of metabolic fluxes and the varying importance of specific reactions and pathways. By integrating constraint-based models and tools from network science, our framework allows the study of context-specific metabolic responses at a system level beyond standard pathway descriptions.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature. This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference, stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space.\\n\\nBy doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks - including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression - and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Motors that move DNA, or that move along DNA, play essential roles in DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation. The mechanisms by which these DNA translocases operate remain largely unknown. Some double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses use an ATP-dependent motor to drive DNA into preformed capsids. These include several human pathogens, as well as dsDNA bacteriophages - viruses that infect bacteria. We previously proposed that DNA is not a passive substrate of bacteriophage packaging motors but is, instead, an active component of the machinery. Computational studies on dsDNA in the channel of viral portal proteins reported here reveal DNA conformational changes consistent with that hypothesis. dsDNA becomes longer (\\\"stretched\\\") in regions of high negative electrostatic potential, and shorter (\\\"scrunched\\\") in regions of high positive potential. These results suggest a mechanism that couples the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation: The chemical cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis and product release drives a cycle of protein conformational changes. This produces changes in the electrostatic potential in the channel through the portal, and these drive cyclic changes in the length of dsDNA. The DNA motions are captured by a coordinated protein-DNA grip-and-release cycle to produce DNA translocation. In short, the ATPase, portal and dsDNA work synergistically to promote genome packaging.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are important vectors for the introduction of novel pathogens which can, in turn, become drivers of rapid ecological and evolutionary change, compromising the persistence of native species. Conservation strategies rely on accurate information regarding presence and distribution of AIS and their associated pathogens to prevent or mitigate negative impacts, such as predation, displacement or competition with native species for food, space or breeding sites. Environmental DNA is increasingly used as a conservation tool for early detection and monitoring of AIS. We used a novel eDNA high-resolution melt curve (HRM) approach to simultaneously detect the UK endangered native crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), the highly invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and their dominant pathogen, Aphanomyces astaci, (causative agent of crayfish plague). We validated the approach with laboratory and field samples in areas with known presence or absence of both crayfish species as well as the pathogen, prior to the monitoring of areas where their presence was unknown. We identified the presence of infected signal crayfish further upstream than previously detected in an area where previous intensive eradication attempts had taken place, and the coexistence of both species in plague free catchments. We also detected the endangered native crayfish in an area where trapping had failed. With this method, we could estimate the distribution of native and invasive crayfish and their infection status in a rapid, cost effective and highly sensitive way, providing essential information for the development of conservation strategies in catchments with populations of endangered native crayfish.",

    "abstract": "The infrastructure challenges and costs of next-generation sequencing have been largely overcome, for many sequencing applications, by Oxford Nanopore Technologies portable MinION sequencer. However the question remains open whether MinION-based bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is by itself sufficient for the accurate assessment of phylogenetic and epidemiological relationships between isolates and whether such tasks can be undertaken in resource-limited settings. To investigate this question, we sequenced the genome of an isolate of Rickettsia typhi, an important and neglected cause of fever across much of the tropics and subtropics, for which only three genomic sequences previously existed. We prepared and sequenced libraries on a MinION in Vientiane, Lao PDR using v9.5 chemistry and in parallel we sequenced the same isolate on the Illumina platform in a genomics laboratory in the UK. The MinION sequence reads yielded a single contiguous assembly, in which the addition of Illumina data revealed 226 base-substitution and 5,856 in/del errors. The combined assembly represents the first complete genome sequence of a human R. typhi isolate collected in the last 50 years and differed from the genomes of existing strains collected over a 90-year time period at very few sites, and with no re-arrangements. Filtering based on the known error profile of MinION data improved the accuracy of the Nanopore-only assembly. However, the frequency of false-positive errors remained greater than true sequence divergence from recorded sequences. While Nanopore-only sequencing cannot yet recover phylogenetic signal in R. typhi, such an approach may be applicable for more diverse organisms.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages shape microbial communities by predating on them and by accelerating their adaptation through horizontal gene transfer. The former is the basis of phage therapy, whereas the latter drives the evolution of numerous bacterial pathogens. We present a novel computational approach (eVIVALDI - eco-eVolutionary mIcrobial indiViduAL-baseD sImulations) to study phage-bacteria ecological interactions that integrates a large number of processes, including population dynamics, environmental structure, genome evolution, and phage-mediated horizontal transfer. We validate and illustrate the relevance of the model by focusing on three specific questions: the ecological interactions between bacteria and virulent phage during phage and antibiotic therapy, the role of prophages as competitive weapons, and how autotransduction facilitates bacterial acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes upon lysis of antibiotic resistant competitors. Our model recapitulates experimental and theoretical observations and provides novel insights. In particular, we find that environmental structure has a strong effect on community dynamics and evolutionary outcomes in all three case studies. Strong environmental structure, relative to well-mixed environments and especially if antibiotics are heterogeneously distributed, enhances the rate of acquisition of resistance to both phages and antibiotics, and leads to more accurate predictions of the dynamics of lysogen invasion in the gastrointestinal tract. We predicted the co-existence of invaders and resident lysogens in autotransduction under a range of parameters, and validated this key prediction experimentally. By linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics, our modelling approach sheds light on the factors that influence the dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions. It can also be expanded to put forward novel hypotheses, facilitating the design of phage therapy treatments and the assessment of the role of phages in the spread of antibiotic resistance.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn the face of a growing threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria, bacteriophages have re-emerged as a potential alternative to clinical treatments of infections, as they are efficient bacterial predators. However, bacteriophages can also promote, through a mechanism called transduction, the dissemination of adaptive traits between bacteria, including antibiotic resistance genes. Importantly, these two types of interactions (predation and transduction) can co-occur, which creates difficulties in predicting their outcome. We have developed eVIVALDI (eco-eVolutionary mIcrobial indiViduAL-baseD sImulations), a computational model that allows the simulation of microbial communities with a focus on the mechanisms involved in phage-bacteria interactions, across time and in different types of environments. eVIVALDI can be used to understand the conditions where phages are more likely to be successfully used to eliminate bacteria or, in the other hand, the conditions where they increase the probability of dissemination of adaptive traits. Our research highlights the importance of considering the diverse ways that phage and bacteria interact, and the relevant ecological conditions where these interactions take place, to understand how bacteriophages shape microbial communities and how they can be used as a clinical tool.",

Consequently, HDAC11-deficient mice exhibit dramatically enhanced thermogenic potential and, in response to high fat feeding, attenuated obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Ex vivo and cell-based assays revealed that HDAC11 catalytic activity suppresses the BAT transcriptional program, in both the basal state and in response to {beta}-adrenergic receptor signaling, through a mechanism that is dependent on physical association with BRD2, a bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) acetyl-histone binding protein. These findings define a novel epigenetic pathway for the regulation of energy homeostasis, and suggest potential for HDAC11-selective inhibitors for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The most reliable predictor of future fracture risk is a previous fracture of any kind. The etiology of this increased fracture risk is not fully known, but it is possible that fracture initiates systemic bone loss leading to greater fracture risk at all skeletal sites. In this study we investigated systemic bone loss and recovery following femoral fracture in young (3 month old) and middle-aged (12 month old) mice. Transverse femur fractures were created using a controlled impact, and whole-body bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microstructure, bone mechanical properties, bone formation and resorption rates, mouse voluntary movement, and systemic inflammation were quantified at multiple time points post-fracture. We found that fracture led to decreased whole-body BMD in both young and middle-aged mice 2 weeks post-fracture; this bone loss was recovered by 6 weeks in young, but not middle-aged mice. Similarly, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of the L5 vertebral body was significantly reduced in fractured mice relative to control mice 2 weeks post-fracture (-11% for young mice, -18% for middle-aged mice); this bone loss was fully recovered by 6 weeks post-fracture in young mice. At 3 days post-fracture we observed significant increases in serum levels of interleukin-6 and significant decreases in voluntary movement in fractured mice compared to control mice, with considerably greater changes in middle-aged mice than in young mice. At this time point we also observed increased osteoclast number on L5 vertebral body trabecular bone of fractured mice compared to control mice. These data show that systemic bone loss occurs after fracture in both young and middle-aged mice, and recovery from this bone loss may vary with age. This systemic response could contribute to increased future fracture risk following fracture, and these data may inform clinical treatment of fractures with respect to improving long-term skeletal health.",

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of genetic correlation requires large sample sizes and access to genetically informative data, which are not always available. Accordingly, phenotypic correlations are often assumed to reflect genotypic correlations in evolutionary biology. Cheveruds conjecture asserts that the use of phenotypic correlations as proxies for genetic correlations is appropriate. Empirical evidence of the conjecture has been found across plant and animal species, with results suggesting that there is indeed a robust relationship between the two. Here, we investigate the conjecture in human populations, an analysis made possible by recent developments in availability of human genomic data and computing resources. A sample of 108,035 British European individuals from the UK Biobank was split equally into discovery and replication datasets. 17 traits were selected based on sample size, distribution and heritability. Genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression applied to the genome-wide association summary statistics of pairs of traits, and compared within and across datasets. Strong and significant correlations were found for the between-dataset comparison, suggesting that the genetic correlations from one independent sample were able to predict the phenotypic correlations from another independent sample within the same population. Designating the selected traits as morphological or non-morphological indicated little difference in correlation. The results of this study support the existence of a relationship between genetic and phenotypic correlations in humans. This finding is of specific interest in anthropological studies, which use measured phenotypic correlations to make inferences about the genetics of ancient human populations.",

    "abstract": "Variability is a fundamental feature of human brain activity that is particularly pronounced during development. However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8-17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open up a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.",

    "abstract": "Most neuroscientific studies have focused on task-evoked activations (activity amplitudes at specific brain locations), providing limited insight into the functional relationships between separate brain locations. Task-state functional connectivity (FC) - statistical association between brain activity time series during task performance moves beyond task-evoked activations by quantifying functional interactions during tasks. However, many task-state FC studies do not remove the first-order effect of taskevoked activations prior to estimating task-state FC. It has been argued that this results in the ambiguous inference \\\"likely active or interacting during the task\\\", rather than the intended inference \\\"likely interacting during the task\\\". Utilizing a neural mass computational model, we verified that task-evoked activations substantially and inappropriately inflate task-state FC estimates, especially in functional MRI (fMRI) data. Various methods attempting to address this problem have been developed, yet the efficacies of these approaches have not been systematically assessed. We found that most standard approaches for fitting and removing mean task-evoked activations were unable to correct these inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly fit mean task-evoked response shapes effectively corrected the inflated correlations without reducing effects of interest. Results with empirical fMRI data confirmed the models predictions, revealing activation-induced task-state FC inflation for both Pearson correlation and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) approaches. These results demonstrate that removal of mean task-evoked activations using an approach that flexibly models task-evoked response shape is an important preprocessing step for valid estimation of task-state FC.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIComputational model shows task inflation of functional connectivity estimates\\nC_LIO_LIHemodynamic responses cause task activations to further inflate estimates\\nC_LIO_LIStandard approaches to remove task activations leave many false positives\\nC_LIO_LIMethods that flexibly fit hemodynamic response shape effectively correct inflation\\nC_LIO_LICorrection of functional connectivity inflation verified with empirical fMRI data\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests the hippocampus being involved in, and modified with, chronic neuropathic pain. However, it is still not clear whether hippocampal activity has direct control over neuropathic behaviors. Here we show that activation of the dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus, by glutamate microinjection or by chemogenetically increasing excitability (PSAM/PSEM), completely or partially reversed neuropathic behaviors: tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the models of spared nerve injury and lumbar spinal nerve ligation. Using a new methodology (chemo-fMRI), where we combine awake resting state brain imaging with viral vector mediated chemogenetic activation (PSAM/PSEM), we could demonstrate that increased excitability of dorsal hippocampus neurons altered resting state functional connectivity within circuitry specifically related to the extent of diminution of neuropathic behavior (tactile allodynia). The identified circuitry most reliably (survived a validation procedure) identified dorsal hippocampal connections to the somatosensory cortex and the thalamus. Moreover, anterograde tracing indicated non-overlapping projections from dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Thus, the present study exhibits a novel causal role for the dorsal hippocampus, and mediating circuitry, controlling neuropathic pain-related behaviors. Altogether, these results imply downregulation of dorsal hippocampus circuitry in chronic neuropathic pain; the activation of which reverses pain behaviors either through disruption of accumulated memories and/or by enhancing extinction circuitry.",

However, so far, the physiological role of GPRIN1 in brain health has not been reported. We generated a viable GPRIN1 whole-body knockout mouse to assess its physiological role in synaptic function both ex vivo and in vivo. In adult neurons, GPRIN1 is highly localized to the plasma membrane and synapses where it regulates neuronal signal transduction and Ca2+ homeostasis. Our results reveal that GPRIN1 might be a novel protein involved in agonist-stimulated cytoskeletal reorganization, which is crucial for early neuronal network development and in functionally mature neurons. Finally, we show that loss of GPRIN1 leads to a learning deficit in vivo and sensitizes neurons to stress, suggesting a modulatory role in brain health and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSexual life cycles in eukaryotes involve a cyclic alternation between haploid and diploid phases. While most animals possess a diploid life cycle, plants and algae alternate between multicellular haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations. In many algae, gametophytes and sporophytes are independent and free living, and may present dramatic phenotypic differences. The same shared genome can therefore be subject to different, even conflicting, selection pressures in each of the life cycle generations. Here, we have analysed the nature and extent of genome-wide generation-biased gene expression in four species of brown algae with contrasting levels of dimorphism between life cycle generations, in order to assess the potential role of generation-specific selection in shaping patterns of gene expression and divergence.\\n\\nResultsWe show that the proportion of the transcriptome that is generation-biased is associated with the level of phenotypic dimorphism between the life cycle stages. Importantly, our data reveals a remarkably high turnover rate for life-cycle-related gene sets across the brown algae and highlights the importance not only of co-option of regulatory programs from one generation to the other but also a key role for newly emerged, lineage-specific genes in the evolution of the gametophyte and sporophyte developmental programs in this major eukaryotic group. Moreover, we show that generation-biased genes display distinct evolutionary modes, with gametophyte-biased genes evolving rapidly at the coding sequence level whereas sporophyte-biased genes exhibit changes in their patterns of expression.\\n\\nConclusionOur analysis uncovers the characteristics, expression patterns and evolution of generation-biased genes and underline the selective forces that shape this previously underappreciated source of phenotypic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Originality-significance statementIncreased incidence of food-borne disease outbreaks caused by fresh produce contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. has prompted researchers to examine the interaction between these bacteria and various plant species under different environmental conditions. Although studies show that human enteropathogenic bacteria survive both on the surface of and inside plants, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying plant invasion and colonization. Here, we examined the interaction between the human pathogenic bacterium Shigella and the model plant Arabidopsis. We found that four Shigella spp. strains proliferated successfully in Arabidopsis, causing symptom-like lesions in tissues. Using mutants lacking T3S effectors (i.e., noninvasive human strains), we demonstrated that effectors regulating pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in bacteria-plant interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine Shigella-mediated virulence and host immune suppression in a plant host at a molecular level.\\n\\nSummaryAlthough there is debate about whether human intestinal pathogenic bacteria are also plant pathogens, it is clear that these bacteria use plants as an alternative host. Shigella, which infects primates, is reportedly transmitted by fresh vegetables; however, its molecular interactions with plants have not been extensively studied. Here, we show that four Shigella strains, S. boydii (S. b), S. sonnei (S. s), S. flexneri 2a (S. f 2a), and S. flexneri 5a (S. f 5a), proliferated at different levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microscopic studies revealed that these bacteria were present inside leaves and damaged plant cells. GFP-labeled S. b, S. f 2a, and S. f 5a entered plants via guard cells, and S. f 2a infiltrated root tissues and colonized roots. Using mutants lacking type III secretion systems (T3SS), we found that T3SS of Shigella that regulate the pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in attachment and multiplication in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive activity of two T3S effectors, OspF and OspG, were needed for the proliferation of Shigella in Arabidopsis. These findings demonstrate that Shigella-mediated virulence determinants are expressed, and pathogenic symptoms are observed, in model plants.",

    "abstract": "Stroke often results in hemiparesis, leaving one side of the body  affected relative to the other side. Prior research has shown that the affected arm has higher variability - however, the extent to which this variability can be modulated is unclear. Here we used a shared bimanual task to examine the degree to which participants could modulate the variability in the affected arm after stroke. Participants with chronic stroke (n = 11), and age-matched controls (n = 11) performed unimanual and bimanual reaching movements to move a cursor on a screen to different targets. In the unimanual condition, the cursor was controlled only by the movement of a single arm whereas in the bimanual condition, the cursor position was \\\"shared\\\" between the two arms by using a weighted average of the two hand positions. Unknown to the participants, we altered the weightings of the affected and unaffected arms to cursor motion and examined how the movement variability on each arm changed depending on its contribution to the task. Results showed that stroke survivors had higher movement variability on the affected arm - however, like age-matched controls, they were able to modulate the variability in both the affected and unaffected arms according to the weighting condition. Specifically, as the weighting on a particular arm increased (i.e. it became more important to the task), the movement variability decreased. These results show that stroke survivors are capable of modulating variability depending on the task context, and this feature may potentially be exploited for rehabilitation paradigms",

We also demonstrate how to combine calibrated res-ev scores with calibrated XCorr scores to produce a \\\"combined p-value\\\" score function. We provide a benchmark consisting of four mass spectrometry data sets, which we use to compare the combined p-value to the score functions used by several existing search engines. Our results suggest that the combined p-value achieves state-of-the-art performance, generally outperforming MS Amanda and Morpheus and performing comparably to MS-GF+.

    "abstract": "Sequencing thousands of human genomes has enabled breakthroughs in many areas, among them precision medicine, the study of rare diseases, and forensics. However, mass collection of such sensitive data entails enormous risks if not protected to the highest standards. In this article, we follow the position and argue that post-alignment privacy is not enough and that data should be automatically protected as early as possible in the genomics workflow, ideally immediately after the data is produced. We show that a previous approach for filtering short reads cannot extend to long reads and present a novel filtering approach that classifies raw genomic data (i.e., whose location and content is not yet determined) into privacy-sensitive (i.e., more affected by a successful privacy attack) and non-privacy-sensitive information. Such a classification allows the fine-grained and automated adjustment of protective measures to mitigate the possible consequences of exposure, in particular when relying on public clouds. We present the first filter that can be indistinctly applied to reads of any length, i.e., making it usable with any recent or future sequencing technologies. The filter is accurate, in the sense that it detects all known sensitive nucleotides except those located in highly variable regions (less than 10 nucleotides remain undetected per genome instead of 100,000 in previous works). It has far less false positives than previously known methods (10% instead of 60%) and can detect sensitive nucleotides despite sequencing errors (86% detected instead of 56% with 2% of mutations). Finally, practical experiments demonstrate high performance, both in terms of throughput and memory consumption.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) machines made DNA sequencing cheaper, but also put pressure on the genomic life-cycle, which includes aligning millions of short DNA sequences, called reads, to a reference genome. On the performance side, efficient algorithms have been developed, and parallelized on public clouds. On the privacy side, since genomic data are utterly sensitive, several cryptographic mechanisms have been proposed to align reads securely, with a lower performance than the former, which in turn are not secure. This manuscript proposes a novel contribution to improving the privacy performance product in current genomic studies. Building on recent works that argue that genomics data needs to be x treated according to a threat-risk analysis, we introduce a multi-level sensitivity classification of genomic variations. Our classification prevents the amplification of possible privacy attacks, thanks to promoting and partitioning mechanisms among sensitivity levels. Thanks to this classification, reads can be aligned, stored, and later accessed, using different security levels. We then extend a recent filter, which detects the reads that carry sensitive information, to classify reads into sensitivity levels. Finally, based on a review of the existing alignment methods, we show that adapting alignment algorithms to reads sensitivity allows high performance gains, whilst enforcing high privacy levels. Our results indicate that using sensitivity levels is feasible to optimize the performance of privacy preserving alignment, if one combines the advantages of private and public clouds.",

    "abstract": "Tumor immune cell infiltration is a well known factor related to survival of cancer patients. This has led to deconvolution approaches that can quantify immune cell proportions for each individual. What is missing, is an approach for modeling joint patterns of different immune cell types. We adapt a deep learning approach, deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), for modeling immune cell gene expression patterns in lung adenocarcinoma. Specifically, a partially partitioned training approach for dealing with a relatively large number of genes. We also propose a sampling-based approach that smooths the original data according to a trained DBM and can be used for visualization and clustering. The identified clusters can subsequently be judged with respect to association with clinical characteristics, such as tumor stage, providing an external criterion for selecting DBM network architecture and tuning parameters for training. We show that the hidden nodes of the trained networks cannot only be linked to clinical characteristics but also to specific genes, which are the visible nodes of the network. We find that hidden nodes that are linked to tumor stage and survival represent expression of T-cell and mast cell genes among others, probably reflecting specific immune cell infiltration patterns. Thus, DBMs, trained and selected by the proposed approach, might provide a useful tool for extracting immune cell gene expression patterns. In the case of lung adenocarcinomas, these patterns are linked to survival as well as other patient characteristics, which could be useful for uncovering the underlying biology.",

There are also tantalizing hints of molecular machines conserving energy while operating out of equilibrium5,6. However, the principles governing the efficient out-of-equilibrium operation of molecular machines remain a mystery. A theoretical framework has been recently formulated in which a generalized friction coefficient quantifies the energetic efficiency in non-equilibrium processes7,8. Moreover, it posits that to minimize energy dissipation, external control should drive the system along the reaction coordinate with a speed inversely proportional to the square root of that friction coefficient. Here, we test and validate the predictions of this theory by probing the non-equilibrium energetic efficiency of a single DNA hairpin subjected to unfolding and refolding protocols using a dual-trap optical tweezers.",

    "abstract": "Palytoxin (PlTX), a large polyhydroxylated compound, is among the most potent non-peptide toxin in marine organisms known so far. The literature emphasizes the sodium/potassium pump (NaK) as the privileged target for PlTX when exerting its toxic effects. In this study, we focused on an undescribed species (Palythoa sp. Pc001), a coral species belonging to the genus Palythoa routinely cultivated in aquariums. We demonstrated that this species contains one of the highest yields of pure PlTX production ever found, 2.22 {+/-} 0.41 mg PlTX per gram of wet Palythoa. Using molecular data combined with external morphology, we identified Palythoa sp. Pc001 as the sister species to Palythoa aff. clavata. Further, the clade of a symbiotic Symbiodinium sp. was characterised by DNA barcoding and pigment content. Molecular data showed that Palythoa sp. Pc001 contains  generalist Symbiodinium belonging to clade C. This paper also describes for the first time the localisation of PlTX and Symbiodinium cells in tissues of a highly toxic Palythoa species. PlTX toxicity was assayed on 72 h-cultured murine and human cancer cells versus the normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF; PC C12300) cell line. Using MTT colorimetric assay and quantitative videomicroscopy, our results showed much higher in vitro cytotoxic activity on cancer cells (IC50 0.54 {+/-} 0.05 x 10-12 M) than on non-cancerous ones (IC50 > 1 x 10-6 M). Such a strong differential effect has never been reported with respect to the most potent NaK ligands (cardiac glycosides) described so far. Moreover, PlTX displayed similar in vitro growth inhibitory activity in rodent and human cancer cells, although the NaK in rodents displays a double mutation in the 1-subunit that usually decreases the sensitivity to others cardiac glycosides like ouabain, when compared to human cells. This work demonstrates, first, that picomolar concentrations of PlTX have significant higher cytotoxic effects on cancer cells than on non-cancerous ones, and secondly, that this in vitro antitumor effect would not be entirely relied onto its canonical targeting to the NaK -subunit. Thus, PlTX ranks amongst highly potent anti-cancer drugs as it targets cancers while potentially minimizing the drugs side effects on healthy cells.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPThe coincidence of long distance dispersal and biome shift is assumed to be the result of a multifaceted interplay between geographical distance and ecological suitability of source and sink areas. Here, we test the influence of these factors on the dispersal history of the flowering plant genus Erica (Ericaceae) across the Afrotemperate. We quantify similarity of Erica climate niches per biogeographic area using direct observations of species, and test various colonisation scenarios while estimating ancestral areas for the Erica clade using parametric biogeographic model testing. We infer that the overall dispersal history of Erica across the Afrotemperate is the result of infrequent colonisation limited by geographic proximity and niche similarity. However, the Drakensberg Mountains represent a colonisation sink, rather than acting as a \\\"stepping stone\\\" between more distant and ecologically dissimilar Cape and Tropical African regions. Strikingly, the most dramatic examples of species radiations in Erica were the result of single unique dispersals over longer distances between ecologically dissimilar areas, contradicting the rule of phylogenetic biome conservatism. These results highlight the importance of rare biome shifts, in which a unique dispersal event fuels evolutionary radiation.\\n\\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by: Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology (DOI: 10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100065)",

    "abstract": "Individuals with different phenotypes can have widely-varying responses to natural selection, yet many classical approaches to evolutionary dynamics emphasize how a populations average phenotype increases in fitness over time. However, recent experimental results have produced examples of populations that have multiple fitness peaks, or that experience frequency-dependence that affects the direction and strength of selection on certain individuals. Here, we extend classical fitness gradient formulations of natural selection in order to describe the dynamics of a phenotype distribution in terms of its moments--such as the mean, variance, skewness, etc. The number of governing equations in our model can be adjusted in order to capture different degrees of detail about the population. We compare our simplified model to direct Wright-Fisher simulations of evolution in several canonical fitness landscapes, we find that our model provides a low-dimensional description of complex dynamics not typically explained by classical theory, such as cryptic selection forces due to selection on trait ranges, time-variation of the heritability, and nonlinear responses to stabilizing or disruptive selection due to asymmetric trait distributions. In addition to providing a framework for extending general understanding of common qualitative concepts in phenotypic evolution--such as fitness gradients, selection pressures, and heritability--our approach has practical importance for studying evolution in contexts in which genetic analysis is infeasible.",

    "abstract": "Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is a conifer species of substanital economic and ecological importance. In common with most conifers, the P. abies genome is very large ([~]20 Gbp) and contains a high fraction of repetitive DNA. The current P. abies genome assembly (v1.0) covers approximately 60% of the total genome size but is highly fragmented, consisting of >10 million scaffolds. The genome annotation contains 66,632 gene models that are at least partially validated (www.congenie.org), however, the fragmented nature of the assembly means that there is currently little information available on how these genes are physically distributed over the 12 P. abies chromosomes. By creating an ultra-dense genetic linkage map, we anchored and ordered scaffolds into linkage groups, which complements the fine-scale information available in assembly contigs. Our ultra-dense haploid consensus genetic map consists of 21,056 markers derived from 14,336 scaffolds that contain 17,079 gene models (25.6% of the validated gene models) that we have anchored to the 12 linkage groups. We used data from three independent component maps, as well as comparisons with previously published Picea maps to evaluate the accuracy and marker ordering of the linkage groups. We demonstrate that approximately 3.8% of the anchored scaffolds and 1.6% of the gene models covered by the consensus map have likely assembly errors as they contain genetic markers that map to different regions within or between linkage groups. We further evaluate the utility of the genetic map for the conifer research community by using an independent data set of unrelated individuals to assess genome-wide variation in genetic diversity using the genomic regions anchored to linkage groups. The results show that our map is sufficiently dense to enable detailed evolutionary analyses across the P. abies genome.",

    "abstract": "The way in which the central nervous system (CNS) governs animal movement is complex and difficult to solve solely by the analyses of muscle movement patterns. We tackle this problem by observing the activity of a large population of neurons in the CNS of larval Drosophila. We focused on two major behaviors of the larvae, forward and backward locomotion, and analyzed the neuronal activity related to these behaviors during fictive locomotion that spontaneously occurs in the isolated CNS. We expressed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP, and a nuclear marker in all neurons and used digital scanned light-sheet microscopy to record neural activities in the entire ventral nerve cord at a fast frame rate. We developed image processing tools that automatically detect the cell position based on the nuclear staining and allocate the activity signals to each detected cell. We also applied a machine learning-based method that we developed recently to assign motor status in each time frame. Based on these methods, we find cells whose activity is biased to forward versus backward locomotion and vice versa. In particular, we identified a group of neurons near the boundary of subesophageal zone (SEZ) and thoracic neuromeres, which are strongly active during an early phase of backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Our experimental procedure and computational pipeline enable systematic identification of neurons to show characteristic motor activities in larval Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of motor function declines with aging. Motor adaptation, which occurs when participants learn to reach accurately to a target despite a perturbation, does not deviate from this rule. There are currently three major hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this age-related decline in adaptation: deterioration of internal model recalibration due to age-related cerebellar degeneration, impairment of the cognitive component of motor adaptation, and deficit in the retention of the learned movement. In the present study, we systematically investigated these three hypotheses in a large sample of older women and men. We demonstrate that age-related deficits in motor adaptation are not due to impaired internal model recalibration or impaired retention of motor memory. Rather, we found that the cognitive component was reduced in older people. Therefore, our study suggests the interesting possibility that cerebellar-based mechanisms do not deteriorate with age despite cerebellar degeneration. In contrast, internal model recalibration appears to compensate for deficits in the cognitive component of this type of learning.",

    "abstract": "Non-parametric and semi-parametric resampling procedures are widely used to perform support estimation in computational biology and bioinformatics. Among the most widely used methods in this class is the standard bootstrap method, which consists of random sampling with replacement. While not requiring assumptions about any particular parametric model for resampling purposes, the bootstrap and related techniques assume that sites are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors.\\n\\nTo relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes \\\"Heads-or-Tails\\\" mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences. We refer to our new method as the SERES (or \\\"SEquential RESampling\\\") method.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the flexibility of the new technique, we apply SERES to two different applications - one involving aligned inputs and the other involving unaligned inputs. Using simulated and empirical data, we show that SERES-based support estimation yields comparable or typically better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for both applications.",

Harmonics of these circadian rhythms having periods of 8 hours and 12 hours (ultradian) have been documented in several species. In mouse liver, harmonics of the 24-hour period of gene transcription hallmarked genes oscillating with a frequency two or three times faster than the circadian circuitry. Many of these harmonic transcripts enriched pathways regulating responses to environmental stress and coinciding preferentially with subjective dawn and dusk. We hypothesized that these stress anticipatory genes would be more evolutionarily conserved than background circadian and non-circadian genes. To investigate this issue, we performed broad computational analyses of genes/proteins oscillating at different frequency ranges across several species and showed that ultradian genes/proteins, especially those oscillating with a 12-hour periodicity, are more likely to be of ancient origin and essential in mice. In summary, our results show that genes with ultradian transcriptional patterns are more likely to be phylogenetically conserved and associated with the primeval and inevitable dawn/dusk transitions.",

    "abstract": "The Pacific cupped oyster is genetically subdivided into two sister taxa, Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata, which are in contact in the north-western Pacific. The nature and origin of their genetic and taxonomic differentiation remains controversial due the lack of known reproductive barriers and morphologic similarity. In particular, whether ecological and/or intrinsic isolating mechanisms participate to species divergence remains unknown. The recent co-introduction of both taxa into Europe offers a unique opportunity to test how genetic differentiation maintains under new environmental and demographic conditions. We generated a pseudo-chromosome assembly of the Pacific oyster genome using a combination of BAC-end sequencing and scaffold anchoring to a new high-density linkage map. We characterized genome-wide differentiation between C. angulata and C. gigas in both their native and introduced ranges, and showed that gene flow between species has been facilitated by their recent co-introductions in Europe. Nevertheless, patterns of genomic divergence between species remain highly similar in Asia and Europe, suggesting that the environmental transition caused by the co-introduction of the two species did not affect the genomic architecture of their partial reproductive isolation. Increased genetic differentiation was preferentially found in regions of low recombination. Using historical demographic inference, we show that the heterogeneity of differentiation across the genome is well explained by a scenario whereby recent gene flow has eroded past differentiation at different rates across the genome after a period of geographical isolation. Our results thus support the view that low-recombining regions help in maintaining intrinsic genetic differences between the two species.",

However, in mycobacteria, L,D-transpeptidase (LDT)-mediated crosslinks are highly abundant. To elucidate the role of these unusual crosslinks, we characterized mycobacterial cells lacking all LDTs. We find that LDT-mediated crosslinks are required for rod shape maintenance specifically at sites of aging cell wall, a byproduct of polar elongation. Asymmetric polar growth leads to a non-uniform distribution of these two types of crosslinks in a single cell. Consequently, in the absence of LDT-mediated crosslinks, PBP-catalyzed crosslinks become more important. Because of this, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is more rapidly killed using a combination of drugs capable of PBP- and LDT-inhibition. Thus, knowledge about the single-cell distribution of drug targets can be exploited to more effectively treat this pathogen.",

The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA.

    "abstract": "Proteins are usually deciphered by translation of the coding genome; however, their amino acid residues are seldom determined directly across the proteome. Herein, we describe a systematic workflow for identifying all possible protein residues that differ from the coding genome, termed noncoded amino acids (ncAAs).

Most ncAAs are novel with unresolved side-chains and discriminative between healthy individuals and patients with oligoasthenospermia. For validation, 40 out of 98 ncAAs that matched with amino acid substitutions were confirmed by exon sequencing.

    "abstract": "Targeting specificity has been an essential issue for applying genome editing systems in functional genomics, precise medicine and plant breeding. Understanding the scope of off-target mutations in Cas9 or Cpf1-edited crops is critical for research and regulation. In plants, only limited studies had used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to test off-target effects of Cas9. However, the cause of numerous discovered mutations is still controversial. Furthermore, WGS based off-target analysis of Cpf1 has not been reported in any higher organism to date. Here, we conducted a WGS analysis of 34 plants edited by Cas9 and 15 plants edited by Cpf1 in T0 and T1 generations along with 20 diverse control plants in rice, a major food crop with a genome size of ~380 Mb. The sequencing depth ranged from 45X to 105X with reads mapping rate above 96%. Our results clearly show that most mutations in edited plants were created by tissue culture process, which caused ~102 to 148 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and ~32 to 83 insertions/deletions (indels) per plant. Among 12 Cas9 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and 3 Cpf1 CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) assessed by WGS, only one Cas9 sgRNA resulted in off-target mutations in T0 lines at sites predicted by computer programs. Moreover, we cannot find evidence for bona fide off-target mutations due to continued expression of Cas9 or Cpf1 with guide RNAs in T1 generation. Taken together, our comprehensive and rigorous analysis of WGS big data across multiple sample types suggests both Cas9 and Cpf1 nucleases are very specific in generating targeted DNA modifications and off-targeting can be avoided by designing guide RNAs with high specificity.",

    "abstract": "The specific recognition of splice signals at or near exon-intron junctions is not explained by their weak conservation and instead is postulated to require a multitude of features embedded in the pre-mRNA strand. We explored the possibility of three-dimensional structural scaffold of AdML - a model pre-mRNA substrate - guiding early spliceosomal components to the splice signal sequences. We find that mutations in the non-cognate splice signal sequences impede recruitment of early spliceosomal components due to disruption of the global structure of the pre-mRNA. We further find that the pre-mRNA segments potentially interacting with the early spliceosomal component U1 snRNP are distributed across the intron, that there is a spatial proximity of 5' and 3' splice sites within the pre-mRNA scaffold, and that an interplay exists between the structural scaffold and splicing regulatory elements in recruiting early spliceosomal components. These results suggest that early spliceosomal components can recognize a three-dimensional structural scaffold beyond the short splice signal sequences, and that in our model pre-mRNA, this scaffold is formed across the intron involving the major splice signals. This provides a conceptual basis to analyze the contribution of recognizable three-dimensional structural scaffolds to the splicing code across the mammalian transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of highly degenerate mammalian splice sites by the core spliceosomal machinery is regulated by several protein factors that predominantly bind exonic splicing motifs. These are postulated to be single-stranded in order to be functional, yet knowledge of secondary structural features that regulate the exposure of exonic splicing motifs across the transcriptome is not currently available. Using transcriptome-wide RNA structural information we show that retained introns in mouse are commonly flanked by a short ([lsim]70 nucleotide), highly base-paired segment upstream and a predominantly single-stranded exonic segment downstream. Splicing assays with select pre-mRNA substrates demonstrate that loops immediately upstream of the introns contain pre-mRNA-specific splicing enhancers, the substitution or hybridization of which impedes splicing. Additionally, the exonic segments flanking the retained introns appeared to be more enriched in a previously identified set of hexameric exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequences compared to their spliced counterparts, suggesting that base-pairing in the exonic segments upstream of retained introns could be a means for occlusion of ESEs. The upstream exonic loops of the test substrate promoted recruitment of splicing factors and consequent pre-mRNA structural remodeling, leading up to assembly of the early spliceosome. These results suggest that disruption of exonic stem-loop structures immediately upstream (but not downstream) of the introns regulate alternative splicing events, likely through modulating accessibility of splicing factors.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional regulation is crucial to shape gene expression. During the Maternal-to-Zygotic Transition (MZT), thousands of maternal transcripts are regulated upon fertilization and genome activation. Transcript stability can be influenced by cis-elements and trans-factors, but how these inputs are integrated to determine the overall mRNA stability is unclear. Here, we show that most transcripts are under combinatorial regulation by multiple decay pathways during zebrafish MZT. To identify cis-regulatory elements, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay for stability-influencing sequences, which revealed that 3-UTR poly-U motifs are associated with mRNA stability. In contrast, miR-430 target sequences, UAUUUAUU AU-rich elements (ARE), CCUC and CUGC elements emerged as the main destabilizing motifs in the embryo, with miR-430 and AREs causing mRNA deadenylation in a genome activation-dependent manner. To identify the trans-factors interacting with these cis-elements, we comprehensively profiled RNA-protein interactions and their associated regulatory activities across the transcriptome during the MZT. We find that poly-U binding proteins are preferentially associated with 3-UTR sequences and stabilizing motifs, and that antagonistic sequence contexts for poly-C and poly-U binding proteins shape the binding landscape and magnitude of regulation across the transcriptome. Finally, we integrate these regulatory motifs into a machine learning model that accurately predicts the stability of mRNA reporters in vivo. Our findings reveal how mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation are coordinated to direct changes in mRNA stability within the early zebrafish embryo.",

    "abstract": "Chemical probing experiments interrogate RNA structures by creating covalent adducts on RNA molecules in structure-dependent patterns. Adduct positions are then detected through conversion of the modified RNAs into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription (RT) as either stops (RT-stops) or mutations (RT-mutations). Statistical analysis of the frequencies of RT-stops and RT-mutations can then be used to estimate a measure of chemical probing reactivity at each nucleotide of an RNA, which reveals properties of the underlying RNA structure. Inspired by recent work that showed that different reverse transcriptase enzymes show distinct biases for detecting adducts as either RT-stops or RT-mutations, here we use a statistical modeling framework to derive an equation for chemical probing reactivity using experimental signatures from both RT-stops and RT-mutations within a single experiment. The resulting formula intuitively matches the expected result from considering reactivity to be defined as the fraction of adduct observed at each position in an RNA at the end of a chemical probing experiment. We discuss assumptions and implementation of the model, as well as ways in which the model may be experimentally validated.",

    "abstract": "The gp41 transmembrane domain (TMD) of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) modulates the conformation of the viral envelope spike, the only druggable target on the surface of the virion. Understanding of TMD dynamics is needed to better probe and target Env with small molecule and antibody therapies. However, little is known about TMD dynamics due to difficulties in describing native membrane properties. Here, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a trimeric, prefusion TMD in a model, asymmetric viral membrane that mimics the native viral envelope. We found that water and chloride ions permeated the membrane and interacted with the highly conserved arginine bundle, (R696)3, at the center of the membrane and influenced TMD stability by creating a network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. We propose that this (R696)3 - water - anion network plays an important role in viral fusion with the host cell by modulating protein conformational changes within the membrane. Additionally, R683 and R707 at the exofacial and cytofacial membrane-water interfaces, respectively, are anchored in the lipid headgroup region and serve as a junction point for stabilization of the termini. The membrane thins as a result of the tilting of the TMD trimer, with nearby lipids increasing in volume, leading to an entropic driving force for TMD conformational change. These results provide additional detail and perspective on the influence of certain lipid types on TMD dynamics and rationale for targeting key residues of the TMD for therapeutic design. These insights into the molecular details of TMD membrane anchoring will build towards a greater understanding of dynamics that lead to viral fusion with the host cell.",

We show this can be utilized for the tuning of force-generating myosin motors. In this model, we unify the calcium nonlinear dynamics involved in the control of the myosin adaptation motors with mechanical displacements of hair- bundles. The model shows that the characteristic time scales fit reasonably well with the available experimental data for spontaneous oscillations in the inner ear. This model offers promises to fill a gap in our understanding of the role of calcium ion nonlinear dynamics in the regulation of processes in the auditory cells of the inner ear.",

    "abstract": "Chemotaxis, a biased migration of cells under a chemical gradient, plays a significant role in diverse biological phenomena including cancer metastasis. Stromal cells release signaling proteins to induce chemotaxis, which further causes organ-specific metastasis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an example of the chemical attractants, and its gradient stimulates metastasis of breast cancer cells. Hence, the interactions between EGF and breast cancer cells have long been a subject of interest for oncologists and clinicians. However, most current approaches do not systematically separate the effects of gradient and absolute concentration of EGF on chemotaxis of breast cancer cells. In this work, we develop a theoretical model based on signal-to-noise ratio to represent stochastic properties and report our microfluidic experiments to verify the analytical predictions from the model. The results demonstrate that even under the same EGF concentration gradients, breast cancer cells can reveal distinct chemotaxis patterns at different absolute concentrations. Moreover, we found that addition of EGF receptor antibody can promote chemotaxis at a low EGF level. This apparently counterintuitive finding suggests that EGF receptor-targeted therapy may stimulate metastasis of breast cancer at a particular condition, which should be considered in anticancer drug design.",

    "abstract": "Semen-derived amyloid fibrils, composing SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of viral infection) fibrils and SEM1 fibrils, could remarkably enhance HIV-1 sexual transmission and thus, are potential targets for the development of an effective microbicide. Previously, we found that ADS-J1, apart from being an HIV-1 entry inhibitor, could also potently inhibit seminal amyloid fibrillization and block fibril-mediated enhancement of viral infection. However, the remodeling effects of ADS-J1 on mature seminal fibrils were unexplored. Herein, we investigated the capacity of ADS-J1 to disassemble seminal fibrils and the potential mode of action by applying several biophysical and biochemical measurements, combined with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. We found that ADS-J1 effectively remodeled SEVI, SEM186-107 fibrils and endogenous seminal fibrils. Unlike epi-gallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a universal amyloid fibril breaker, ADS-J1 disaggregated SEVI fibrils into monomeric peptides, which was independent of oxidation reaction. MD simulations revealed that ADS-J1 displayed strong binding potency to the full-length PAP248-286 via electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. ADS-J1 might initially bind to the fibrillar surface and then occupy the amyloid core, which eventually lead to fibril disassembly. Furthermore, the binding of ADS-J1 with PAP248-286 might induce conformational changes of PAP248-286. Disassembled PAP248-286 might not be favor to re-aggregate into fibrils. ADS-J1 also exerts abilities to remodel a panel of amyloid fibrils, including A{beta}1-42, hIAPP1-37 and EP2 fibrils. ADS-J1 displays promising potential to be a combination microbicide and an effective lead-product to treat amyloidogenic diseases.",

Primary cilia are cellular organelles, present on most vertebrate cells, hypothesized to function as a fluid flow sensor. The mechanical properties of a cilium remain incompletely characterized. We measured the fluctuating position of an optically trapped cilium tip under untreated, Taxol-treated, and HIF-stabilized conditions. We applied analytical modeling to derive the mean-squared displacement of the trapped tip of a cilium and compared the results with experimental measurements. We provide, for the first time, evidence that the effective flexural rigidity of a ciliary axoneme is length-dependent, and longer cilia are stiffer than shorter cilia. We then provide a rational explanation for both effects. We demonstrate that the apparent length-dependent flexural rigidity can be understood by a combination of modeling axonemal microtubules orthotropic elastic shells and including (actin-driven) active stochastic basal body motion. It is hoped that our improved characterization of cilia will result in deeper understanding of the biological function of cellular flow sensing by this organelle. Our model could be profitably applied to motile cilia and our results also demonstrate the possibility of using easily observable ciliary dynamics to probe interior cytoskeletal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Relating ion-channel (iCh) structural dynamics to physiological function remains a challenge. Current experimental and computational techniques have limited ability to explore this relationship in atomistic detail over physiological timescales. A framework associating iCh structure to function is necessary for elucidating normal and disease mechanisms. We formulated a modeling schema that overcomes the limitations of current methods through applications of Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (ML). Using this approach, we studied molecular processes that underlie human IKs voltage mediated gating. IKs malfunction underlies many debilitating and life-threatening diseases. Molecular components of IKs that underlie its electrophysiological function include KCNQ1 (pore forming tetramer) and KCNE1 (auxiliary subunit). Simulations, using the IKs structure-function model, reproduced experimentally recorded saturation of gating charge displacement at positive membrane voltages, two-step voltage sensor (VS) movement shown by fluorescence, iCh gating statistics, and current-voltage (I-V) relationship. New mechanistic insights include - (1) pore energy profile determines iCh subconductance (SC), (2) entire protein structure, not limited to the pore, contributes to pore energy and channel SC, (3) interactions with KCNE1 result in two distinct VS movements, causing gating charge saturation at positive membrane voltages and current activation delay, and (4) flexible coupling between VS and pore permits pore opening at lower VS positions, resulting in sequential gating. The new modeling approach is applicable to atomistic scale studies of other proteins on timescales of physiological function.",

    "abstract": "The Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) has been successful in predicting alpha diversity patterns such as species-area relationships and species-abundance distributions. Although beta diversity (i.e. the dissimilarity of community composition) has long been recognized as an important element of the TIB and is crucial for understanding community assembly processes, it has never been formally incorporated into the theory. Here we derive theoretical predictions for the expected pairwise beta diversity values under a species-level neutral scenario where all species have equal colonization and extinction rates. We test these predictions for the avian community composition of 42 islands (and 93 species) in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We find that alpha diversity patterns alone do not distinguish a species-level neutral model from a non-neutral model. In contrast, beta diversity patterns clearly reject a species-level neutral model. We suggest that the presented theoretical integration beta diversity offers a powerful path for testing the presence of neutral processes in ecology and biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Attention can be involuntarily captured by physically salient stimuli, a phenomenon known as bottom-up attention. Typically, these salient stimuli occur unpredictably in time and space. Therefore, in a series of three behavioral experiments, we investigated the extent to which such bottom-up attentional capture is a function of ones prior expectations. In the context of an exogenous cueing task, we systematically manipulated participants spatial (Experiment 1) or temporal (Experiment 2 and 3) expectations about an uninformative cue, and examined the extent of attentional capture by the cue. We anticipated larger attentional capture for unexpected compared to expected cues. However, while we observed robust attentional capture in all experiments, we did not find any evidence for a modulation of attentional capture by prior expectation. This underscores the automatic and reflexive nature of bottom-up attention.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is a valued method to evaluate the metabolomics content of a biological sample. The recent advent of rapid ionization technologies such as Laser Diode Thermal Desorption (LDTD) and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) has rendered high-throughput mass spectrometry possible. It is used for large-scale comparative analysis of populations of samples. In practice, many factors resulting from the environment, the protocol, and even the instrument itself, can lead to minor discrepancies between spectra, rendering automated comparative analysis difficult. In this work, a sequence/pipeline of algorithms to correct variations between spectra is proposed. The algorithms correct multiple spectra by identifying peaks that are common to all and, from those, computes a spectrum-specific correction. We show that these algorithms increase comparability within large datasets of spectra, facilitating comparative analysis, such as machine learning.",

    "abstract": "We present a new approach to determining the conformational changes associated with biological function, and demonstrate its capabilities in the context of experimental single-particle cryo-EM snapshots of ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a Ca2+-channel involved in skeletal muscle excitation/contraction coupling. These results include the detailed conformational motions associated with functional paths including transitions between energy landscapes. The functional motions differ substantially from those inferred from discrete structures, shedding new light on the gating mechanism in RyR1. The differences include the conformationally active structural domains, the nature, sequence, and extent of conformational motions involved in function, and the way allosteric signals are transduced within and between domains. The approach is general, and applicable to a wide range of systems and processes.",

    "abstract": "Repeated testing leads to improved long-term memory retention compared to repeated study, but the mechanism underlying this improvement remains controversial. In this work, we test the hypothesis that retrieval practice benefits subsequent recall by reducing competition from related memories. This hypothesis implies that the degree of reduction in competition between retrieval practice attempts should predict subsequent memory for practiced items. To test this prediction, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data across two sessions. In the first session, participants practiced selectively retrieving exemplars from superordinate semantic categories (high competition), as well as retrieving the names of the superordinate categories from exemplars (low competition). In the second session, participants repeatedly studied and were tested on Swahili-English vocabulary. One week after session two, participants were again tested on the vocabulary. We trained a within-subject classifier on the data from session one to distinguish high and low competition states.We then used this classifier to measure competition across multiple retrieval practice attempts in the second session. The degree to which competition decreased for a given vocabulary word predicted whether that item was subsequently remembered in the third session. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that repeated testing improves retention by reducing competition.",
