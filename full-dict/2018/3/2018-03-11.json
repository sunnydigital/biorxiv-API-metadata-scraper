    "abstract": "Given the limited effectiveness of strategies based solely on vector control to reduce dengue virus (DENV) transmission, it is expected that an effective vaccine could play a pivotal role in reducing the global disease burden of dengue. Of several dengue vaccines under development, Dengvaxia(R) from Sanofi Pasteur recently became the first to become licensed in select countries and to achieve WHO recommendation for use in certain settings, despite the fact that a number of uncertainties about its profile complicate projections of its public health impact. We used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission to perform simulations of the public health impact of dengue vaccines in light of two key uncertainties: (1) \\\"statistical uncertainty\\\" about the numerical value of the vaccines efficacy against disease, and (2) \\\"biological uncertainty\\\" about the extent to which its efficacy against disease derives from the amelioration of symptoms, blocking of DENV infection, or some combination thereof. Simulations of a generic dengue vaccine showed that the proportion of disease episodes averted following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year olds at 80% coverage was sensitive to both the numerical value of vaccine efficacy and to the extent to which efficacy derives from blocking of DENV infection. Simulations of a vaccine resembling Dengvaxia(R) took into account that vaccine trial results substantially reduced statistical uncertainty but did not address biological uncertainty, resulting in the proportion of disease episodes averted being more sensitive to biological uncertainty than to statistical uncertainty. Taken together, our results indicate limitations associated with the use of symptomatic disease as the primary endpoint of dengue vaccine trials and highlight the importance of considering multiple forms of uncertainty in projections of a vaccines public health impact.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWe set out to develop an algorithm that can mine differential gene expression data to identify candidate cell type-specific DNA regulatory sequences. Differential expression is usually quantified as a continuous score--fold-change, test-statistic, p-value--comparing biological classes. Unlike existing approaches, our de novo strategy, termed SArKS, applies nonparametric kernel smoothing to uncover promoter motifs that correlate with elevated differential expression scores. SArKS detects motifs by smoothing sequence scores over sequence similarity. A second round of smoothing over spatial proximity reveals multi-motif domains (MMDs). Discovered motifs can then be merged or extended based on adjacency within MMDs. False positive rates are estimated and controlled by permutation testing.\\n\\nResultsWe applied SArKS to published gene expression data representing distinct neocortical neuron classes in M. musculus and interneuron developmental states in H. sapiens.

    "abstract": "Recently we demonstrated that closed chromatin composed of Polycomb proteins and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation impedes CRISPR-mediated genome editing by blocking the accessibility of chromosomal DNA to spCas9/sgRNA. Editing efficiencies were higher in cells where the same reporter locus had not been repressed, thus we presume that silenced chromatin can be modified to generate a Cas9-accessible state. To test this idea, we exposed the locus to antagonists of Polycomb silencing: Gal4-p65, a targeted transcriptional activator, and UNC1999, a chemical inhibitor of the histone H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2. For both we observed loss of histone trimethylation. Only Gal4-p65 treatment increased target gene expression. Initial Gal4-p65 overexpression impedes Cas9 activity, while a 9-day recovery period leads to enhanced Cas9 efficiency up to 1000 bp from the Gal4 binding site. No enhancement was observed with UNC1999. These results demonstrate the strong influence of transcription-driven chromatin remodeling on CRISPR editing at closed chromatin.",

    "abstract": "MotivationOne of the main benefits of using modern RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is the more accurate gene expression estimations compared with previous generations of expression data, such as the microarray. However, numerous issues can result in the possibility that an RNA-Seq read can be mapped to multiple locations on the reference genome with the same alignment scores, which occurs in plant, animal, and metagenome samples. Such a read is so-called a multiple-mapping read (MMR). The impact of these MMRs is reflected in gene expression estimation and all downstream analyses, including differential gene expression, functional enrichment, etc. Current analysis pipelines lack the tools to effectively test the reliability of gene expression estimations, thus are incapable of ensuring the validity of all downstream analyses.\\n\\nResultsOur investigation into 95 RNA-Seq datasets from seven species (totaling 1,951GB) indicates an average of roughly 22% of all reads are MMRs for plant and animal species. Here we present a tool called GeneQC (Gene expression Quality Control), which can accurately estimate the reliability of each genes expression level. The underlying algorithm is designed based on extracted genomic and transcriptomic features, which are then combined using elastic-net regularization and mixture model fitting to provide a clearer picture of mapping uncertainty for each gene. GeneQC allows researchers to determine reliable expression estimations and conduct further analysis on the gene expression that is of sufficient quality. This tool also enables researchers to investigate continued re-alignment methods to determine more accurate gene expression estimates for those with low reliability.\\n\\nAvailabilityGeneQC is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/GeneQC/home.html.\\n\\nContactqin.ma@sdstate.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Gamma-band oscillations are implicated in modulation of attention and integration of sensory information. The finding that cross-regional coherence varies with task and performance suggests a role for gamma oscillations in flexible communication among anatomically connected brain areas. How networks become entrained is incompletely understood. Specifically, it is unclear how the spectral and temporal characteristics of network oscillations can be altered on rapid timescales needed for efficient communication. We use closed-loop optogenetic modulation of principal cell excitability to interrogate the dynamical properties of hippocampal oscillations. Gamma frequency and amplitude can be modulated bi-directionally, and dissociated, by phase-advancing or delaying optogenetic feedback to pyramidal cells. Closed-loop modulation alters the synchrony rather than average frequency of action potentials, in principle avoiding disruption of population rate-coding of information. Modulation of phasic excitatory currents in principal neurons is sufficient to manipulate oscillations, suggesting that feed-forward excitation of pyramidal cells has an important role in determining oscillatory dynamics and the ability of networks to couple with one another.",

    "abstract": "How novelty evolves is still largely unknown. Environmental changes are often assumed to precede novelty; however, behavioral shifts may also play a role. Here, we examine whether a shift in aggression explains the origin of a novel scale-eating pupfish species (Cyprinodon desquamator) within an adaptive radiation on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We compared aggression using behavioral and gene expression data across three sympatric species in the San Salvador radiation (generalist, snail-eating specialist, and scale-eating specialist), and additionally measured behavioral aggression in an outgroup generalist from North Carolina. Surprisingly, we found increased behavioral aggression and differential expression of aggression-related genes in both the scale-eating and snail-eating species. Furthermore, male scale-eaters and female snail-eaters showed the highest levels of aggression compared to other groups. Differential gene expression in each specialist during larval development also suggested sex-mediated differences in male-male aggression and maternal care. Ultimately, our data indicate that aggression is not unique to scale-eating specialists. Instead, selection may increase aggression in other contexts such as niche specialization, mate competition, or selection on other ecologically relevant traits, including jaw size. Indeed, some adaptive variants associated with oral jaw size in the San Salvador radiation occur in genetic pathways with pleiotropic effects on aggression.",

    "abstract": "Sport fishes at the apex of aquatic food webs are indicators of mercury in the environment. However bioaccumulation of mercury in fish is a complex process that varies in space and time. Both large-scale climatic and environmental, as well as biological factors are drivers of these space-time variations. In this study, we avail a long-running monitoring program from Ontario, Canada to better understand spatiotemporal variations in fish mercury bioaccumulation. Focussing on two common large-bodied fishes (Walleye and Northern Pike), the data were first stratified by latitudinal zone (north, mid, and south) and eight temporal periods (between 1975 & 2015). A series of linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) with latitudinal zone, time period, and their interactions as random effects were used to capture the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal variations in mercury bioaccumulation. The random slopes from the best-fitting LMEM were used to define bioaccumulation index and capture trends in space and time. Given the generally warming climate trend over the past 45 years, the role of growth dilution in modulating the bioaccumulation trends was also evaluated. The full model comprising of space, time and space-time interactions was the best-fit with interaction effects explaining most of the variation. Spatiotemporal trends showed overall similar patterns for both species. Growth dilution in conjunction with estimated rates of warming for different latitudinal zones failed to explain the spatiotemporal trends. Temporal trends showed contrasting bioaccumulation patterns-increasing in Northern Pike and decreasing in Walleye, suggesting temperature-driven growth dilution is more likely in latter. However, a space-for-time substitution revealed only a weak presence of growth dilution in Walleye, and it was not attributable to temperature differences. Overall, our study summarizes broad-scale variations in fish mercury and explores the role of growth dilution in shaping the observed patterns.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease whose aggressive biology that is driven by mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Mitochondria normally form a network of fused organelles, but we find that patient-derived and genetically engineered murine pancreatic cancer cells exhibit highly fragmented mitochondria with robust oxygen consumption rates (OCR). When mitochondrial fusion was activated by the genetic or pharmacological inhibition Drp1, the morphology and metabolism of human and murine pancreatic cancer cells more closely resembled that of normal pancreatic epithelial cells. This reduced metabolism was correlated with slower tumor growth, fewer metastases, and enhanced survival in a syngeneic orthotopic model. Similarly, directly activating mitochondrial fusion by overexpression of Mfn2 also reduced tumor growth and metastases. Mitochondrial fusion in pancreatic cancer cells was associated with reduced mitochondrial mass and Complex I expression and function. Thus, these data suggest that enhancing mitochondrial fusion through Drp1 inhibition or enhanced Mfn2 expression or function has strong tumor suppressive activity against pancreatic cancer and may thus represent a highly novel and efficacious therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of monocytes entails their relocation from blood to the tissue, hence accompanied by an altered physicochemical micro-environment. While the mechanism by which the biochemical make-up of the micro-environment induces differentiation is known, the fluid-like to gel-like transition in the physical micro-environment is not well understood. Monocytes maintain non-adherent state to prevent differentiation. We establish that irrespective of the chemical makeup, a 3D gel-like micro-environment induces a positive-feedback loop of adhesion-MAPK-NF-{kappa}{beta} activation to facilitate differentiation. In 2D fluid-like micro-environment, adhesion alone is capable of inducing differentiation via the same positive-feedback signalling. Chemical inducer treatment in fluid-like micro-environment, increases the propensity of monocyte adhesion via a brief pulse of p-MAPK. The adhesion subsequently elicit differentiation, establishing that adhesion is both necessary and sufficient to induce differentiation in 2D/3D micro-environment. Our findings challenge the notion that adhesion is a result of monocyte differentiation. Rather its the adhesion which triggers the differentiation of monocytes. MAPK, and NF-{kappa}{beta} being key molecules of multiple signaling pathways, we hypothesize that biochemically inert 3D gel-like micro-environment would also influence other cellular functions.\\n\\nSummary statementThis article brings out a new insight into the novel mechanisms of monocyte differentiation solely driven by physical micro-environment and adhesion.",

Two areas in particular have been repeatedly implicated: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). However, it is still unclear what the function of each of these areas is and how they differ from each other. To establish the specific roles of DLPFC and aPFC in metacognition, we employed online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to causally interfere with their functioning during confidence generation. Human subjects from both sexes performed a perceptual decision-making task and provided confidence ratings. We found a clear dissociation between the two areas: DLPFC TMS lowered confidence ratings, whereas aPFC TMS increased metacognitive ability but only for the second half of the experimental blocks. These results support a functional architecture where DLPFC reads out the strength of the sensory evidence and relays it to aPFC, which makes the confidence judgement by potentially incorporating additional, non-perceptual information. Indeed, simulations from a model that incorporates these putative DLPFC and aPFC functions reproduced our behavioral results. These findings establish DLPFC and aPFC as distinct nodes in a metacognitive network and suggest specific contributions from each of these regions to confidence generation.\\n\\nSignificance\\n\\nThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be critical for metacognition. Two of its sub-regions - dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and anterior PFC (aPFC) - have specifically been implicated in confidence generation. However, it is unclear if these regions have distinct functions related to the underlying metacognitive computation. Using a causal intervention with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we demonstrate that DLPFC and aPFC have dissociable contributions: targeting DLPFC decreased average confidence ratings, while targeting aPFC specifically affected metacognitive scores. Based on these results, we postulated specific functions for DLPFC and aPFC in metacognitive computation and corroborated them using a computational model that reproduced our results. Our causal results reveal the existence of a specialized modular organization in PFC for confidence generation.",

Disruption of key events in this process may interfere with the correct formation or repair of muscle tissue.

In the present study, we examined the effect of polyamine depletion on the muscle regeneration model of C2C12 myoblasts. Our results reveal a requirement for polyamines at the very beginning of the muscle differentiation process. Myogenesis is accompanied by polyamine synthesis, even though the myoblasts contain high levels of polyamines at the moment of induction. Polyamine depletion at the time of induction, or inability to synthesize more polyamines during the first 24 hours of the process, inhibited myogenesis. Polyamine depletion inhibited the expression of all tested myogenic markers (Pax7, MyoD, Myogenin, Myf5 and Myosin heavy chain), as well as the cells migration and fusion abilities.

    "abstract": "Commensal bacteria are the representative of the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes present in a community. Merely a few community-based studies on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal bacteria have been conducted so far in Southeast Asia and other parts of India. Northeastern India is still untapped regarding the surveillance of antibiotic-resistant genes and prevalence in commensal bacteria. In the present work, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal Escherichia coli was investigated along with the associated demographic factors in pre-school and school going children in rural areas of Sikkim. A total of 550 fecal E. coli isolates were obtained from children of the age 1-14 years living in different villages at various altitudes of Sikkim from July 2015 to June 2017. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing of these isolates was performed. A structured questionnaire was designed to study the factors associated with carriage of antibiotic resistance in commensal E. coli isolates among children. Descriptive statistics analysis and a logistic regression model were used to identify the effect of external factors on antibiotic resistance pattern. High prevalence of resistance was found against commonly used antibiotics ampicillin (92%), ceftazidime (90%), cefoxitin (88%), streptomycin (40%) and tetracycline (36%) among the samples examined in our present study. No resistance to chloramphenicol was recorded. Fifty-two percent of the isolates were resistant to the combination of penicillin and quinolone group of antibiotics. Children living in nuclear families showed higher incidence of resistance to ampicillin (63.15%, OR 0.18,95% CI:0.11 - 0.28, p<0.01) while children of mothers having education up to school level displayed higher incidence of ceftazidime (59.27% OR 0.75, 95% CI:0.55 - 1.02, p<0.02). Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant commensal E. coli against the commonly used antibiotics among children in the study area. A close association between different demographic factors and the pattern of carriage of antibiotic-resistant isolates was observed suggesting a concern over misuse of antibiotics and warrants a future threat of emerging multidrug resistant isolates.",

The initial configuration in these studies was based on the available crystal structure data and therefore, the effect of the C-terminal Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR) of FtsZ could not be observed in these previous studies. Recent investigations have revealed that the C-terminal IDR is crucial for FtsZ assembly in vitro and Z ring formation in vivo. Therefore, in this study, we simulate FtsZ with the IDR.\\n\\nSimulations of the FtsZ monomer in different nucleotide bound forms (without nucleotide, GTP, GDP) were performed. In the conformations of FtsZ monomer with GTP, GTP binds variably with the protein. Such variable interaction with the monomer has not been observed in any previous simulation studies of FtsZ and not observed in crystal structures. The central helix bends towards the C-terminal domain in the GTP bound form, thus making way for polymerization. Nucleotide dependent small shift/rotation of the C-terminal domain was observed in average structures.",

In our simulations, we had used the E.coli FtsZ homology model including the FtsZ Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR). Our simulations revealed that FtsZ dynamics involves a key stage in which GTP binds to monomeric FtsZ and opens its nucleotide binding site which in turn favours polymerization. During dimerization, the C-terminal of the top monomer rotates considerably towards the bottom monomer. Such a rotation of the C-terminal domain leads to capture of the nucleotide by its N-terminal domain. In this study we simulate the FtsZ G105S mutant to see if it may have ATPase activity which was reported in a previous study.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, the maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes must align along their entire length and recombine to achieve faithful segregation in the gametes. Meiotic recombination is accomplished through the formation of DNA double-strand breaks, a subset of which can mature into crossovers to link the parental homologous chromosomes and promote their segregation. Breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility protein BRCA1 and its heterodimeric partner BARD1 play a pivotal role in DNA repair in mitotic cells; however, their functions in gametogenesis are less well understood. Here we show that localization of BRC-1 and BRD-1 (Caenorhabditis elegans orthologues of BRCA1 and BARD1) is dynamic during meiotic prophase I; they ultimately becoming concentrated at regions surrounding the presumptive crossover sites, co-localizing with the pro-crossover factors COSA-1, MSH-5 and ZHP-3. The synaptonemal complex is essential for BRC-1 loading onto chromosomes but recombination is not. BRC-1 forms an in vivo complex with the synaptonemal complex component SYP-3 and the crossover-promoting factor MSH-5. Furthermore, BRC-1 is essential for efficient stage-specific recruitment of the RAD-51 recombinase to DNA damage sites when synapsis is impaired and upon induction of exogenous DNA double-strand breaks. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the localization and meiotic function of the BRC-1-BRD-1 complex and highlight their essential role in DNA double-strand break repair during gametogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor summarySexually reproducing species rely on meiosis to transmit their genetic information across generations. Parental chromosomes (homologues) undergo many distinctive processes in their complex journey from attachment to segregation. The physiological induction of DNA double strand breaks is crucial for promoting correct chromosome segregation: they are needed to activate the DNA repair machinery responsible for creating physical connections, or crossovers (COs), between the homologues. In turn, crossovers promote the accurate segregation of the chromosomes in daughter cells. The BRCA1-BARD1 complex has a pivotal role during DNA repair in somatic cells and is exclusively located on unaligned chromosomal regions during mammalian meiosis. We show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, BRCA1 and BARD1 localize to chromosomes at all stages of meiotic prophase I and are enriched at presumptive crossover sites. We found that BRCA1 promotes DNA loading of the repair factor RAD-51 in specific mutant backgrounds and upon exogenous damage induction. Our data provide evidence for a direct physical association between BRCA1 and pro-crossover factors (including the synaptonemal complex) and identify an important role for BRCA1 in stimulating meiotic DNA repair. Further studies are necessary to identify the substrates acted upon by BRCA1-BARD1 complex to maintain genome stability in the gametes.",

Here, an extensive series of correlation analyses of human and mouse transcriptomics data was performed to identify genes strongly and reproducibly associated with cells undergoing S/G2-M phases of the cell cycle. In so doing, a list of 701 cell cycle-associated genes was defined and shown that whilst many are only expressed during these phases, the expression of others is also driven by alternative promoters. Of this list, 496 genes have known cell cycle functions, whereas 205 were assigned as putative cell cycle genes, 53 of which are functionally uncharacterised. Among these, 27 were screened for subcellular localisation revealing many to be nuclear localised and at least four to be novel centrosomal proteins. Furthermore, 10 others inhibited cell proliferation upon siRNA knockdown. This study presents the first comprehensive list of human cell cycle proteins, identifying many new candidate proteins.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at the level of coarse-grained taxa such as genera as well as at the level of strains within species. This variability can be driven by both extrinsic factors like temperature, pH, etc., as well as by intrinsic ones, such as demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community structure remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty of identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimeter scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates whose differences in composition are expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genuslevel resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation, however, did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, i.e. the equivalent of enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the most abundant organism: strains of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity--i.e. the reactor--excluded each other within community replicates. Single-granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall species composition of the community, indicating high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most likely observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not higher orders of genetic resolution.",

    "abstract": "Anticipating rewards has been shown to enhance memory formation. While substantial evidence implicates dopamine in this behavioral effect, the precise mechanisms remain ambiguous. Because dopamine nuclei show two distinct physiological signatures of reward prediction, we hypothesized two dissociable effects on memory formation. These two signatures are a phasic dopamine response immediately following a reward cue that encodes its expected value, and a sustained, ramping dopamine response that is greater during high reward uncertainty (Fiorillo, Tobler, & Schultz, 2003). Here, we show in humans that the impact of reward anticipation on memory for an event depends on its timing relative to these physiological signatures. By manipulating reward probability (100%, 50%, or 0%) and the timing of the event to be encoded (just after the reward cue versus just before expected reward outcome), we demonstrated the predicted double dissociation: early during reward anticipation, memory formation was improved by increased expected reward value, whereas late during reward anticipation, memory formation was enhanced by reward uncertainty. Moreover, while the memory benefits of high expected reward in the early interval were consolidation-dependent, the memory benefits of high uncertainty in the later interval were not. These findings support the view that expected reward benefits memory consolidation via phasic dopamine release. The novel finding of a dissociable memory enhancement, temporally consistent with sustained anticipatory dopamine release, points toward new mechanisms of memory modulation by reward now ripe for further investigation.",

P. lisachisme is described from 12 specimens from Cape Mpimbwe and Lyamembe, and distinguished primarily by having a high number of dorsal spines. P. paucispinis is described from 4 specimens from Halembe, and distinguished primarily by having a low number of dorsal spines. A revised key to Petrochromis is included.

Despite their recent rapid decline, the demographic histories of the two species have been different during the past one to two million years, likely having an impact on their genomic diversity. Here, we analyze the inferred functional consequences of genetic variation across 69 individuals, making use of the most complete dataset of genomic variation in the Pan clade to date. We test to which extent the demographic history influences the efficacy of purifying selection in these species. We find that small historical effective population sizes (Ne) correlate not only with small genetic diversity, but also with more homozygous deleterious alleles, and an increased proportion of deleterious changes at low frequencies. Furthermore, we exploit the catalog of deleterious protein-coding changes on each lineage to investigate the putative genetic basis for phenotypic differences between chimpanzees and bonobos. We show that bonobo-specific non-synonymous changes are enriched in genes related to age at menarche in humans, suggesting that the prominent physiological differences in the female reproductive system between chimpanzees and bonobos might be explained, in part, by putatively adaptive changes on the bonobo lineage.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that non-synaptic mechanisms can generate electrographic seizures after blockade of synaptic function. We investigated the interaction of intact synaptic activity with non-synaptic mechanisms in the isolated CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices using the \\\"elevated-K+\\\" model of epilepsy. Elevated K+ ictal bursts share waveform features with other models of electrographic seizures, including non-synaptic models where chemical synaptic transmission is suppressed, such as the low-Ca2+model. These features include a prolonged (several seconds) negative field shift associated with neuronal depolarization and superimposed population spikes. When population spikes are disrupted for up to several seconds, intracellular recording demonstrated that the prolonged suppression of population spikes during ictal activity was due to depolarization block of neurons. Elevated-K+ ictal bursts were often preceded by a build-up of \\\"pre-ictal\\\" epileptiform discharges that were characterized as either \\\"slow-transition\\\" (localized and with a gradual increase in population spike amplitude, reminiscent non-synaptic neuronal aggregate formation, presumed mediated by extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+])o accumulation), or \\\"fast-transition\\\" (with a sudden increase in population spike amplitude, presumed mediated by field effects). When ictal activity had a fast-transition it was preceded by fast-transition pre-ictal activity; otherwise population spikes developed gradually at ictal event onset. Addition of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, suppressed population spike generation during ictal activity, reduced pre-ictal activity, and increased the frequency of ictal discharges. Nipecotic acid and NNC-711, both of which block GABA re-uptake, increased population spike amplitude during ictal bursts and promoted the generation of preictal activity. By contrast, addition of ionotropic glutamate-receptor antagonists (NBQX, D-APV) had no consistent effect on ictal burst waveform or frequency and did not fully suppress pre-ictal activity. Similarly, CGP 55848, a GABAB receptor antagonist, has no significant effect on pre-ictal activity or burst frequency (although it did increase burst duration slightly). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that non-synaptic mechanisms underpin the generation of ictal bursts in CA1 and that GABAA synaptic mechanisms can shape event development by delaying event initiation and counteracting depolarization block.",

First, at low frequencies (1-4 Hz, brain delta phase to speech delta phase), predictive effects start in left fronto-motor regions and progress to right temporal regions. Second, at higher frequencies (14-18 Hz, brain beta power to speech delta phase), predictive patterns show a transition from left inferior frontal gyrus via left precentral gyrus to left primary auditory areas.
