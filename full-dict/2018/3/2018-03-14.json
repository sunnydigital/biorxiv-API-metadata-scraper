We studied the composition of microbial communities present in blood across 192 individuals, including healthy controls and patients with three disorders affecting the brain: schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and bipolar disorder. By using high quality unmapped RNA sequencing reads as candidate microbial reads, we performed profiling of microbial transcripts detected in whole blood. We were able to detect a wide range of bacterial and archaeal phyla in blood. Interestingly, we observed an increased microbial diversity in schizophrenia patients compared to the three other groups. We replicated this finding in an independent schizophrenia case-control cohort. This increased diversity is inversely correlated with estimated cell abundance of a subpopulation of CD8+ memory T cells in healthy controls, supporting a link between microbial products found in blood, immunity and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Identification of genomic regions that are identical by descent (IBD) has proven useful for human genetic studies where analyses have led to the discovery of familial relatedness and fine-mapping of disease critical regions. Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized inanalysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as havingmany highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many low-penetrance loci in schizophrenia. However, its pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, which in turn hampers the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Pathway and gene set analyses carry the potential to generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms and have provided biological context to genome-wide data of schizophrenia. We aimed to examine which biological processes are likely candidates to underlie schizophrenia by integrating novel and powerful pathway analysis tools using data from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS (N = 79 845) and the most recent 2018 schizophrenia GWAS (N = 105 318). By applying a primary unbiased analysis (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation; MAGMA) to weigh the role of biological processes from the MSigDB database, we identified enrichment of common variants in synaptic plasticity and neuron differentiation gene sets. We supported these findings using MAGMA, Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA) and Interval Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) on detailed synaptic signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and found enrichment in mainly the dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses. Moreover, shared genes involved in these neurotransmitter systems had a large contribution to the observed enrichment, protein products of top genes in these pathways showed more direct and indirect interactions than expected by chance, and expression profiles of these genes were largely similar among brain tissues. In conclusion, we provide strong and consistent genetics and protein-interaction informed evidence for the role of postsynaptic signaling processes in schizophrenia, opening avenues for future translational and psychopharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of stage-structured populations facing variability in resource availability and/or demographic factors like unequal sex-ratios, remains poorly understood. We addressed these issues using a stage-structured individual-based model that incorporates life-history parameters common to many holometabolous insects. The model was calibrated using time series data from a 49-generation experiment on laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster, subjected to four different combinations of larval and adult nutritional levels. The model was able to capture multiple qualitative and quantitative aspects of the empirical time series across three independent studies. We then simulated the model to explore the interaction of various life-history parameters and nutritional levels in determining population stability. In all nutritional regimes, stability of the populations was reduced upon increasing egg-hatchability, critical mass and proportion of body resource allocated to female fecundity. However, the stability-effects of increasing sensitivity of female-fecundity to adult density varied across nutrition regimes. The effects of unequal sex-ratio and sex-specific culling were greatly influenced by fecundity but not by levels of juvenile nutrition. Finally, we investigated the implications of some of these insights on the efficiency of the widely-used pest control method, Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We show that increasing the amount of juvenile food had no effects on SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is low, but reduces SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is high.",

    "abstract": "DNA is subject to constant chemical modification and damage, which eventually results in variable mutation rates throughout the genome. Although detailed molecular mechanisms of DNA damage and repair are well-understood, damage impact and execution of repair across a genome remains poorly defined. To bridge the gap between our understanding of DNA repair and mutation distributions we developed a novel method, AP-seq, capable of mapping apurinic sitesand 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine bases at [~]300bp resolution on a genome-wide scale. We directly demonstrate that the accumulation rate of oxidative damage varies widely across the genome, with hot spots acquiring many times more damage than cold spots. Unlike SNVs in cancers, damage burden correlates with marks for open chromatin notably H3K9ac and H3K4me2. Oxidative damage is also highly enriched in transposable elements and other repetitive sequences. In contrast, we observe decreased damage at promoters, exons and termination sites, but not introns, in a seemingly transcription-independent manner. Leveraging cancer genomic data, we also find locally reduced SNV rates in promoters, genes and other functional elements. Taken together, our study reveals that oxidative DNA damage accumulation and repair differ strongly across the genome, but culminate in a previously unappreciated mechanism that safe-guards the regulatory sequences and the coding regions of genes from mutations.",

Here we present Mixed effects modeling of Associations of Single Cells (MASC), a novel reverse single cell association strategy for testing whether case-control status influences the membership of single cells in any of multiple cellular subsets while accounting for technical confounds and biological variation. Applying MASC to mass cytometry analyses of CD4+ T cells from blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls revealed a significantly expanded population of CD4+ T cells, identified as CD27- HLA-DR+ effector memory cells, in RA patients (OR = 1.7; p = 1.1 x 10-3). The frequency of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells was similarly elevated in blood samples from a second RA patient cohort, and CD27- HLA-DR+ cell frequency decreased in RA patients who respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples from RA patients contained [~]5-fold higher frequencies of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells, which comprised [~]10% of synovial CD4+ T cells. We find that CD27- HLA-DR+ cells are abundant producers of IFN-{gamma} and also express perforin and granzyme A at elevated levels. Thus MASC identified the expansion of a unique Th1 skewed effector T cell population with cytotoxic capacity in RA. We propose that MASC is a broadly applicable method to identify disease-associated cell populations in high-dimensional single cell data.\\n\\nOO_SCPLOWNEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWENTENCEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWMixed-effects regression of single cells identifies a cytotoxic Th1-like CD4+ T cell subset while accounting for inter-individual and technical variation.",

By allowing the user to define the molecular composition and size of synapses expected to contain the antigen, the method detects and characterizes puncta and synapses, and outputs automatically computed characteristics such as synapse density and target specificity ratio, which reflect the sensitivity and specificity of immunolabeling with a given antibody. These measurements provide an objective way to characterize and compare the performance of different antibodies against the same target, and can be used to objectively select the antibodies best suited for AT and potentially for other immunolabeling applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe challenge the oft-repeated claim that the beetles (Coleoptera) are the most species-rich order of animals. Instead, we assert that another order of insects, the Hymenoptera, are more speciose, due in large part to the massively diverse but relatively poorly known parasitoid wasps. The idea that the beetles have more species than other orders is primarily based on their respective collection histories and the relative availability of taxonomic resources, which both disfavor parasitoid wasps. Though it is unreasonable to directly compare numbers of described species in each order, the ecology of parasitic wasps - specifically, their intimate interactions with their hosts - allows for estimation of relative richness. We present a simple logical model that shows how the specialization of many parasitic wasps on their hosts suggests few scenarios in which there would be more beetle species than parasitic wasp species. We couple this model with an accounting of what we call the \\\"genus-specific parasitoid-host ratio\\\" from four well-studied genera of insect hosts, a metric by which to generate extremely conservative estimates of the average number of parasitic wasp species attacking a given beetle or other insect host species. Synthesis of our model with data from real host systems suggests that the Hymenoptera may have 2.5 - 3.2x more species than the Coleoptera. While there are more described species of beetles than all other animals, the Hymenoptera are almost certainly the larger order.",

    "abstract": "Nodal-related protein (ndr2) is a member of the transforming growth factor type {beta} superfamily of factors and is required for ventral midline patterning of the embryonic central nervous system in zebrafish. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding nodal cause holoprosencephaly and heterotaxy. Mutations in the ndr2 gene in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) lead to similar phenotypes, including loss of the medial floor plate, severe deficits in ventral forebrain development, and cyclopia. Alleles of the ndr2 gene have been useful in studying patterning of ventral structures of the central nervous system. Fifteen different ndr2 alleles have been reported in zebrafish, of which eight were generated using chemical mutagenesis, four were radiation-induced, and the remaining alleles were obtained via random insertion, gene targeting (TALEN), or unknown methods. Therefore, most mutation sites were random and could not be predicted a priori. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes, we targeted distinct regions in all three exons of zebrafish ndr2 and observed cyclopia in the injected (G0) embryos. We show that the use of sgRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes can cause penetrant cyclopic phenotypes in injected (G0) embryos. Targeted PCR amplicon analysis using Sanger sequencing showed that most of the alleles had small indels resulting in frameshifts. The sequence information correlates with the loss of ndr2 activity. In this study, we validate multiple CRISPR targets using an in vitro nuclease assay and in vivo analysis using embryos. We describe one specific mutant allele resulting in loss of conserved terminal cysteine-coding sequences. This study is another demonstration of the utility of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in generating domain- specific mutations and provides further insights into the structure-function of the ndr2 gene.",

    "abstract": "The predominant structural protein in vertebrates is collagen, which plays a key role in extracellular matrix and connective tissue mechanics. Despite its prevalence and physical importance in biology, the mechanical properties of molecular collagen are far from established. The flexibility of its triple helix is unresolved, with descriptions from different experimental techniques ranging from flexible to semirigid. Furthermore, it is unknown how collagen type (homo-vs. heterotrimeric) and source (tissue-derived vs. recombinant) influence flexibility. Using SmarTrace, a chain tracing algorithm we devised, we performed statistical analysis of collagen conformations collected with atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the proteins mechanical properties. Our results show that types I, II and III collagens - the key fibrillar varieties - exhibit molecular flexibilities that are very similar. However, collagen conformations are strongly modulated by salt, transitioning from compact to extended as KCl concentration increases, in both neutral and acidic pH. While analysis with a standard worm-like chain model suggests that the persistence length of collagen can attain almost any value within the literature range, closer inspection reveals that this modulation of collagens conformational behaviour is not due to changes in flexibility, but rather arises from the induction of curvature (either intrinsic or induced by interactions with the mica surface). By modifying standard polymer theory to include innate curvature, we show that collagen behaves as an equilibrated curved worm-like chain (cWLC) in two dimensions. Analysis within the cWLC model shows that collagens curvature depends strongly on pH and salt, while its persistence length does not. Thus, we find that triple-helical collagen is well described as semiflexible, irrespective of source, type, pH and salt environment. These results demonstrate that collagen is more flexible than its conventional description as a rigid rod, which may have implications for its cellular processing and secretion.",

    "abstract": "Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic environments contain diverse microbial communities whose complex interactions mediate the cycling of major and trace nutrients such as vitamins. B-vitamins are essential coenzymes that many organisms cannot synthesize. Thus their exchange among de-novo synthesizers and auxotrophs is expected to play an important role in the microbial consortia and explain some of the temporal and spatial changes observed in diversity. In this study, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of a natural coastal microbial community, diel sampled-quarterly over one year to try to identify the potential major B-vitamin synthesizers and consumers. Our transcriptomic data show that the best-represented taxa dominated the expression of synthesis genes for some B-vitamins but lacked transcripts for others. For instance, Rhodobacterales dominated the expression of vitamin-B12 synthesis, but not of vitamin-B7, whose synthesis transcripts were mainly represented by Flavobacteria.In contrast, bacterial groups that constituted less than 4% of the community (e.g., Verrucomicrobia) accounted for most of the vitamin-B1 synthesis transcripts. Furthermore, ambient vitamin-B1 concentrations were higher in samples collected during the day, and were positively correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the mosaic of metabolic interdependencies through B-vitamin synthesis and exchange are key processes that contribute to shaping microbial communities in nature.",

    "abstract": "L-arginine is involved in a number of biological processes in our bodies. Metabolism of L-arginine by the enzyme arginase has been found to be associated with cancer cell proliferation. Arginase inhibition has been proposed as a potential therapeutic means to inhibit this process. N-hydroxy-nor-L-Arg (nor-NOHA) and N (omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) has shown promise in inhibiting cancer progression through arginase inhibition. In this study, nor-NOHA and NOHA-associated genes and proteins were analyzed with several Bioinformatics and Systems Biology tools to identify the associated pathways and the key players involved so that a more comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms including the regulatory mechanisms can be achieved and more potential targets for treatment of cancer can be discovered. Based on the analyses carried out, 3 significant modules have been identified from the PPI network. Five pathways/processes have been found to be significantly associated with nor-NOHA and NOHA associated genes. Out of the 1996 proteins in the PPI network, 4 have been identified as hub proteins-SOD, SOD1, AMD1, and NOS2. These 4 proteins have been implicated in cancer by other studies. Thus, this study provided further validation into the claim of these 4 proteins being potential targets for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDCryopreservation of leukocytes isolated from the cervicovaginal and colorectal mucosa is useful for the study of cellular immunity (see Hughes SM et al. PLOS ONE 2016). However, some questions about mucosal biology and sexually transmitted infections are better addressed with intact mucosal tissue, for which there is no standard cryopreservation protocol.\\n\\nMETHODS AND FINDINGSTo find an optimal preservation protocol for mucosal tissues, we tested slow cooling (1%C/min) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (designated \\\"cryopreservation\\\") and fast cooling (plunge in liquid nitrogen) with 20% dimethylsulfoxide and 20% ethylene glycol (\\\"vitrification\\\"). We compared fresh and preserved human cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues in a range of assays, including metabolic activity, human immunodeficiency virus infection, cell phenotype, tissue structure by hematoxylin-and-eosin staining, cell number and viability, production of cytokines, and microbicide drug concentrations. Metabolic activity, HIV infectability, and tissue structure were similar in cryopreserved and vitrified vaginal tissues. However, vitrification led to poor cell recovery from the colorectal mucosa, with 90% fewer cells recovered after isolation from vitrified colorectal tissues than from cryopreserved. HIV infection rates were similar for fresh and cryopreserved ectocervical tissues, whereas cryopreserved colorectal tissues were less easily infected than fresh tissues (hazard ratio 0.7 [95% confidence interval 0.4, 1.2]). Finally, we compared isolation of cells before and after cryopreservation. Cell recoveries were higher when cells were isolated after freezing and thawing (71% [59-84%]) than before (50% [38-62%]). Cellular function was similar to fresh tissue in both cases. Microbicide drug concentrations were lower in cryopreserved explants compared to fresh ones.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSCryopreservation of intact cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues with dimethylsulfoxide works well in a range of assays, while the utility of vitrification is more limited. Cell yields are higher from cryopreserved intact tissue pieces than from thawed cryopreserved single cell suspensions isolated before freezing, but T cell functions are similar.",

    "abstract": "Recent exploration into the interactions and relationship between hosts and their microbiota has revealed a connection between many aspects of the hosts biology, health and associated microorganisms. Whereas amplicon sequencing has traditionally been used to characterise the microbiome, the increasing number of published population genomics datasets offer an underexploited opportunity to study microbial profiles from the host shotgun sequencing data. Here, we use sequence data originally generated from killer whale Orcinus orca skin biopsies for population genomics, to characterise the skin microbiome and investigate how host social and geographic factors influence the microbial community composition. Having identified 845 microbial taxa from 2.4 million reads that did not map to the killer whale reference genome, we found that both ecotypic and geographic factors influence community composition of killer whale skin microbiomes. Furthermore, we uncovered key taxa that drive the microbiome community composition and showed that they are embedded in unique networks, one of which is tentatively linked to diatom presence and poor skin condition. Community composition differed between Antarctic killer whales with and without diatom coverage, suggesting that the previously reported episodic migrations of Antarctic killer whales to warmer waters associated with skin turnover may control the effects of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome studies from host shotgun sequencing data and highlights the importance of metagenomics in understanding the relationship between host and microbial ecology.",

Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of risk-associated variants across the genome, and growing evidence of NETRIN1 pathway involvement. Stratifying disease risk by genetic variation within the NETRIN1 pathway may provide an important route for identification of disease mechanisms by focusing on a specific process excluding heterogeneous risk-associated variation in other pathways.

    "abstract": "Complex structural variants (cxSVs) are genomic rearrangements comprising multiple structural variants, typically involving three or more breakpoint junctions. They contribute to human genomic variation and can cause Mendelian disease, however they are not typically considered during genetic testing. Here, we investigate the role of cxSVs in Mendelian disease using short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 1,324 individuals with neurodevelopmental or retinal disorders from the NIHR BioResource project. We present four cases of individuals with a cxSV affecting Mendelian disease-associated genes. Three of the cxSVs are pathogenic: a de novo duplication-inversion-inversion-deletion affecting ARID1B in an individual with Coffin-Siris syndrome, a deletion-inversion-duplication affecting HNRNPU in an individual with intellectual disability and seizures, and a homozygous deletion-inversion-deletion affecting CEP78 in an individual with cone-rod dystrophy. Additionally, we identified a de novo duplication-inversion-duplication overlapping CDKL5 in an individual with neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Long-read sequencing technology used to resolve the breakpoints demonstrated the presence of both a disrupted and an intact copy of CDKL5 on the same allele; therefore, it was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Analysis of sequence flanking all breakpoint junctions in all the cxSVs revealed both microhomology and longer repetitive sequences, suggesting both replication and homology based processes. Accurate resolution of cxSVs is essential for clinical interpretation, and here we demonstrate that long-read WGS is a powerful technology by which to achieve this. Our results show cxSVs are an important although rare cause of Mendelian disease, and we therefore recommend their consideration during research and clinical investigations.",

    "abstract": "The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) remains the second most widely cultured shrimp species globally. However, issues with disease and domestication have seen production levels stagnate over the past two decades. To help identify innovative solutions needed to resolve bottlenecks hampering the culture of this species, it is important to generate genetic and genomic resources. Towards this aim, we have produced the most complete publicly available P. monodon transcriptome database to date. The assembly was carried out in multiple assemblers using 2x125 bp HiSeq data from PolyA selected, ribo-depleted RNA extracted from nine adult tissues and eight early life-history stages. In total, approximately 700 million high-quality sequence reads were obtained and assembled into 236,388 clusters. These were then further segregated into 99,203 adult tissue specific clusters, and 58,678 early life-history stage specific clusters. The final transcriptome had a high TransRate score of 0.37, with 88% of all reads successfully mapping back to the transcriptome. BUSCO statistics showed the assembly to be highly complete with low fragmentation, few genes missing, but higher redundancy or transcript duplication (Complete: 98.2% (Duplicated: 51.3%), Fragmented: 0.8%, Missing: 1.0%), and to greatly exceed the completeness of existing P. monodon transcriptomes. While annotation rates were low (approximately 30%), as is typical for a non-model organisms, annotated transcript clusters were successfully mapped to several hundred functional KEGG pathways. To help address the lack of annotation, transcripts were clustered into groups within tissues and early life-history stages, providing initial evidence for their roles in specific tissue functions, or developmental transitions. Additionally, transcripts of shrimp viruses previously not known to occur in Australia were also discovered. We expect the transcriptome to provide an essential resource to investigate the molecular basis of commercially relevant-significant traits in P. monodon and other shrimp species.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological investigations have validated the positive relationships between arsenic in drinking water and several cancers, including skin, liver and lung cancers. Besides genotoxicity, arsenic exposure-related pathogenesis of disease is widely considered through epigenetic mechanisms; however, the underlying mechanistic insight remains elusive. Herein we explore the initial epigenetic changes via acute low-dose arsenite exposures of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and Dot1L knockout MEF (Dot1L-/- for abbreviation) cells. Our RNA-seq and Western blot data demonstrated that, in both cell lines, acute low-dose arsenite exposure abolished histone acetyltransferase p300 at the RNA level and subsequent protein level. Consequently, p300-specific main target histone H3K27ac, a marker separating active from poised enhancers, decreased dramatically as validated by both Western blot and ChIP-seq analyses. Concomitantly, H3K4me1 as another well-known marker for enhancers also showed significant decreases, suggesting an underappreciated crosstalk between H3K4me1 and H3K27ac involved in arsenite exposure. Significantly, arsenite exposure-reduced H3K27ac and H3K4me1 inhibit the expression of genes including EP300 itself and Kruppel Like Factor 4(Klf4), a tumor suppressor gene. Collectively, our investigations identify p300 as an internal bridging factor within cells to sense external environmental arsenite exposure to alter chromatin, thereby changing gene transcription for disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBlackleg and sclerotinia stem rot caused by Leptosphaeria maculans and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum respectively are two major diseases in rapeseed worldwide, which cause serious yield losses. Chitinases are pathogenesis-related proteins and play important roles in host resistance to various pathogens and abiotic stress responses. However, a systematic investigation of the chitinase gene family and its expression profile against L. maculans and S. sclerotiorum infection in rapeseed remains elusive. The recent release of assembled genome sequence of rapeseed allowed us to perform a genome-wide identification of the chitinase gene family. In this study, 68 chitinase genes were identified in Brassica napus genome. These genes were divided into five different classes and distributed among 15 chromosomes. Evolutionary analysis indicated that the expansion of the chitinase gene family was mainly attributed to segmental and tandem duplication. Moreover, the expression profiling of the chitinase gene family was investigated using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and the results revealed that some chitinase genes were both induced while the other members exhibit distinct expression in response to L. maculans and S. sclerotiorum infection. This study presents a comprehensive survey of the chitinase gene family in B. napus and provides valuable information for further understanding the functions of the chitinase gene family.",

    "abstract": "Plumage colouration in birds is important for a plethora of reasons, ranging from camouflage, sexual signaling, and species recognition. The genes underlying colour variation have been vital in understanding how genes can affect a phenotype. Multiple genes have been identified that affect plumage variation, but research has principally focused on major-effect genes (such as those causing albinism, barring, and the like), rather than the smaller effect modifier loci that more subtly influence colour. By utilizing a domestic x wild advanced intercross with a combination of classical QTL mapping of red colouration as a quantitative trait and a targeted genetical genomics approach, we have identified five separate candidate genes (CREBBP, WDR24, ARL8A, PHLDA3, LAD1) that putatively influence quantitative variation in red colouration in chickens. Such small effect loci are potentially far more prevalent in wild populations, and can therefore potentially be highly relevant to colour evolution.",

Building on our previous work which described the sexually dimorphic expression of a neuroendocrine ligand, DAF-7, and its role in behavioral decision-making in C. elegans (Hilbert and Kim, 2017), we show here that sex-specific expression of daf-7 is regulated by another neuroendocrine ligand, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF-1), which has previously been implicated in regulating male-specific behavior (Barrios et al., 2012). Our analysis revealed that PDF-1 acts sex- and cell-specifically in the ASJ neurons to regulate the expression of daf-7 and we show that differences in the expression of the PDFR-1 receptor account for the sex-specific effects of this pathway. Our data suggest that modulation of the sex-shared nervous system by neuroendocrine signaling pathways can play a role in shaping sexually dimorphic behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Ecological traps occur when environmental cues become unreliable, causing an evolutionary mismatch between features of the environment and expected outcome that leads to suboptimal behavioural responses and, ultimately, reduced fitness. Ecological traps arise due to anthropogenic disturbance in the environment introducing novel elements that mimic those environmental cues. Therefore, ecological traps represent a strong selective pressure in areas where anthropogenic changes are frequent, such as cities. However, given the exposure to these traps over generations, localised adaptations to ecological traps might be expected in urban populations. Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are one of the many taxa vulnerable to ecological traps: odonates use horizontally polarised light as a cue of suitable water bodies, although some artificial surfaces also reflect horizontally polarised light strongly, thus misleading odonates to oviposit preferentially on these unsuitable surfaces rather than in water. Here, we compare the behavioural response to horizontally polarised light between urban and rural populations of the odonate Ischnura elegans to test the potential for localised adaptations to ecological traps. Laboratory choice experiments were performed using field-caught adults from urban and rural areas, and individuals reared in controlled conditions to account for environmental variation and exposure to polarised light. We also studied the association between ontogeny and polarotaxis that has been suggested - but not empirically tested - by other studies. The results showed that field-caught rural individuals had a significantly stronger preference for horizontally polarised light compared to urban individuals, suggesting there is strong selection against polarotaxis in urban areas. However, individuals reared in controlled conditions showed no difference between urban and rural populations, suggesting that there has not yet been adaptation in urban odonates. Instead, adults developed a strong preference for horizontally polarised light with increasing age, showing that mature adults are more prone to ecological traps. Possible mechanisms driving this response are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is a poorly characterised, heterogeneous disease. Patients are diagnosed with aggressive, high-grade tumours and often relapse with chemotherapy resistance. Detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of this disease is essential to the development of personalised therapeutic strategies. Inhibitor of Differentiation 4 (ID4) is a helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator required for mammary gland development. ID4 is overexpressed in a subset of BLBC patients, associating with a stem-like poor prognosis phenotype, and is necessary for the growth of cell line models of BLBC, through unknown mechanisms. Here, we have defined a molecular mechanism of action for ID4 in BLBC and the related disease highgrade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOV), by combining RIME proteomic analysis and ChIP-Seq mapping of genomic binding sites. Remarkably, these studies have revealed novel interactions with DNA damage response proteins, in particular, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1). Through MDC1, ID4 interacts with other DNA repair proteins ({gamma}H2AX and BRCA1) at fragile chromatin sites. ID4 does not affect transcription at these sites, instead binding to chromatin following DNA damage and regulating DNA damage signalling. Clinical analysis demonstrates that ID4 is amplified and overexpressed at a higher frequency in BRCA1-mutant BLBC compared with sporadic BLBC, providing genetic evidence for an interaction between ID4 and DNA damage repair pathways. These data link the interactions of ID4 with MDC1 to DNA damage repair in the aetiology of BLBC and HGSOV.",

Immunohistochemistry analysis shows loss of neurons in prefrontal cortex and basal ganglion in aged mice, and increased apoptosis in these regions, recapitulating a hallmark of neurodegeneration. Quantitative proteomic analysis shows accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins in KO mouse. Furthermore, we show that a defect in autophagy results in impaired ER turnover and ER stress. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is elevated through IRE1 and possibly other kinase signaling pathways, and eventually leads to neuronal apoptosis. Suppression of ER stress, or activation of autophagy through inhibition of mTOR pathway rescues neuronal death. Thus, our study not only provides mechanistic insights for BPAN, but also suggests that a defect in macroautophagy machinery leads to impairment in selective organelle autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Adherens junctions are tensile structures that couple epithelial cells together. Junctional tension can arise from cell-intrinsic application of contractility or from the cell-extrinsic forces of tissue movement. In all these circumstances, it is essential that epithelial integrity be preserved despite the application of tensile stress. In this study, we identify junctional RhoA as a mechanosensitive signaling pathway that responds to epithelial stress. The junctional specificity of this response is mediated by the heterotrimeric protein G12, which is recruited by E-cadherin and, in turn, recruits p114 RhoGEF to activate RhoA. Further, we identify Myosin VI as a key mechanosensor, based on its intrinsic capacity to anchor E-cadherin to F-actin when exposed to tensile load. Tension-activated RhoA signaling was necessary to preserve epithelial integrity, which otherwise undergoes fracture when monolayer stress is acutely increased by calyculin. Paradoxically, this homeostatic RhoA signaling pathway increases junctional actomyosin, a contractile response that might be expected to itself promote fracture. Simulations of a vertex-based model revealed that the protective effect of RhoA signaling can be explained through increased yield limit at multicellular vertices, where experiments showed p114 RhoGEF was necessary to increase E-cadherin and promote actin assembly and organization.",

    "abstract": "Predicting population collapse in the face of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures is a key challenge in conservation. Abundance-based early warning signals have been suggested as a possible solution to this problem; however, they are known to be susceptible to the spatial and temporal subsampling ubiquitous to abundance estimates of wild population. Recent work has shown that composite early warning methods that take into account changes in fitness-related phenotypic traits - such as body size - alongside traditional abundance-based signals are better able to predict collapse, as trait dynamic estimates are less susceptible to sampling protocols. However, these previously developed composite early warning methods weighted the relative contribution of abundance and trait dynamics evenly. Here we present an extension to this work where the relative importance of different data types can be weighted in line with the quality of available data. Using data from a small-scale experimental system we demonstrate that weighted indicators can improve the accuracy of composite early warning signals by >60%. Our work shows that non-uniform weighting can increase the likelihood of correctly detecting a true positive early warning signal in wild populations, with direct relevance for conservation management.",

Both Dicyemida and Orthonectida have just two cell layers and appear to lack any defined tissues. They were initially thought to be evolutionary intermediates between protozoans and metazoans but more recent analyses indicate that they are protostomian metazoans that have undergone secondary simplification from a complex ancestor.

    "abstract": "The human genome contains hundreds of thousands of missense mutations. However, only a handful of these variants are known to be adaptive, which implies that adaptation through protein sequence change is an extremely rare phenomenon in human evolution. Alternatively, existing methods may lack the power to pinpoint adaptive variation. We have developed and applied an Evolutionary Probability Approach (EPA) to discover candidate adaptive polymorphisms (CAPs) through the discordance between allelic evolutionary probabilities and their observed frequencies in human populations. EPA reveals thousands of missense CAPs, which suggest that a large number of previously optimal alleles had experienced a reversal of fortune in the human lineage. We explored non-adaptive mechanisms to explain CAPs, including the effects of demography, mutation rate variability, and negative and positive selective pressures in modern humans. Our analyses suggest that a large proportion of CAP alleles have increased in frequency due to beneficial selection. This conclusion is supported by the facts that a vast majority of adaptive missense variants discovered previously in humans are CAPs, and that hundreds of CAP alleles are protective in genotype-phenotype association data. Our integrated phylogenomic and population genetic EPA approach predicts the existence of thousands of signatures of non-neutral evolution in the human proteome. We expect this collection to be enriched in beneficial variation. EPA approach can be applied to discover candidate adaptive variation in any protein, population, or species for which allele frequency data and reliable multispecies alignments are available.",

    "abstract": "Winchester syndrome (WS, MIM #277950) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by progressive joint destruction and osteolysis. To date, only one missense mutation in MMP14, encoding the membrane-bound matrix metalloprotease 14, has been reported in WS patients. Here, we report a novel hypomorphic MMP14 p.Arg111His (R111H) allele, associated with a mitigated form of WS. Functional analysis demonstrated that this mutation, in contrast to previously reported human and murine MMP14 mutations, does not affect MMP14s transport to the cell membrane. Instead, it partially impairs MMP14s proteolytic activity. This residual activity likely accounts for the mitigated phenotype observed in our patients. Based on our observations as well as previously published data, we hypothesize that MMP14s catalytic activity is the prime determinant of disease severity. Given the limitations of our in vitro assays in addressing the consequences of MMP14 dysfunction, we generated a novel mmp14a/b knockout zebrafish model. The fish accurately reflected key aspects of the WS phenotype including craniofacial malformations, kyphosis, short-stature and reduced bone density due to defective collagen remodeling. Notably, the zebrafish model will be a valuable tool for developing novel therapeutic approaches to a devastating bone disorder.",

    "abstract": "Recent human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and animal electrophysiology studies suggest that grid cells in entorhinal cortex are an efficient neural mechanism for encoding knowledge about the world, not only for spatial location but also for more abstract cognitive information. The world, be it physical or abstract, is often high-dimensional, but grid cells have been mainly studied on a simple two-dimensional (2D) plane. Recent theoretical studies have proposed how grid cells encode three-dimensional (3D) physical space, but it is unknown whether grid codes can be examined non-invasively in humans. Here, we investigated whether it was feasible to test different 3D grid models using fMRI based on the direction-modulated property of grid signals. In doing so, we developed interactive software to help researchers visualize 3D grid fields and predict grid activity in 3D as a function of movement directions. We found that a direction-modulated grid analysis was sensitive to one type of 3D grid model - a face-centred cubic (FCC) lattice model. As a proof of concept, we searched for 3D grid-like signals in human entorhinal cortex using a novel 3D virtual reality paradigm and a new fMRI analysis method. We found that signals in the left entorhinal cortex were explained by the FCC model. This is preliminary evidence for 3D grid codes in the human brain, notwithstanding the inherent methodological limitations of fMRI. We believe that our findings and software serve as a useful initial stepping-stone for studying grid cells in realistic 3D worlds and also, potentially, for interrogating abstract high-dimensional cognitive processes.\\n\\nHighlightsWe present software and an analysis method to probe 3D grid codes using human fMRI Based on an alignment score between 3D movement direction and grid orientation We then tested this using a 3D virtual environment and fMRI\\n\\nSignals in entorhinal cortex were explained by a face-centred cubic lattice model",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are important for action selection. They are also implicated in perceptual and cognitive functions that seem far removed from motor control. Here, we tested whether the role of the basal ganglia in selection extends to non-motor aspects of behavior by recording neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus while animals performed a covert spatial attention task. We found that caudate neurons strongly select the spatial location of the relevant stimulus throughout the task even in the absence of any overt action. This spatially selective activity was dependent on task and visual conditions, and could be dissociated from goal-directed actions. Caudate activity was also sufficient to correctly identify every epoch in the covert attention task. These results provide a novel perspective on mechanisms of attention by demonstrating that the basal ganglia are involved in spatial selection and tracking of behavioral states even in the absence of overt orienting movements.",

    "abstract": "Visual perceptual learning (VPL) can lead to long-lasting perceptual improvements. While the efficacy of VPL is well established, there is still a considerable debate about what mechanisms underlie the effects of VPL. Much of this debate concentrates on where along the visual processing hierarchy behaviorally relevant plasticity takes place. Here, we aimed to tackle this question in context of motion processing, a domain where links between behavior and processing hierarchy are well established. Specifically, we took advantage of an established transition from component-dependent representations at the earliest level to pattern-dependent representations at the middle-level of cortical motion processing. We trained two groups of participants on the same motion direction identification task using either grating or plaid stimuli. A set of pre- and post-training tests was used to determine the degree of learning specificity and generalizability. This approach allowed us to disentangle contributions from both low- and mid-level motion processing, as well as high-level cognitive changes. We observed a complete bi-directional transfer of learning between component and pattern stimuli as long as they shared the same apparent motion direction. This result indicates learning-induced plasticity at intermediate levels of motion processing. Moreover, we found that motion VPL is specific to the trained stimulus direction, speed, size, and contrast, highlighting the pivotal role of basic visual features in VPL, and diminishing the possibility of non-sensory decision-level enhancements. Taken together, our study psychophysically examined a variety of factors mediating motion VPL, and demonstrated that motion VPL most likely alters visual computation in the middle stage of motion processing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAnalysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.\\n\\nAuthor summarySub-cellular localisation of proteins provides insights into sub-cellular biological processes. For a protein to carry out its intended function it must be localised to the correct sub-cellular environment, whether that be organelles, vesicles or any sub-cellular niche. Correct sub-cellular localisation ensures the biochemical conditions for the protein to carry out its molecular function are met, as well as being near its intended interaction partners. Therefore, mis-localisation of proteins alters cell biochemistry and can disrupt, for example, signalling pathways or inhibit the trafficking of material around the cell. The sub-cellular distribution of proteins is complicated by proteins that can reside in multiple micro-environments, or those that move dynamically within the cell. Methods that predict protein sub-cellular localisation often fail to quantify the uncertainty that arises from the complex and dynamic nature of the sub-cellular environment. Here we present a Bayesian methodology to analyse protein sub-cellular localisation. We explicitly model our data and use Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty in our predictions. We find our method is competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning methods and additionally provides uncertainty quantification. We show that, with this additional information, we can make deeper insights into the fundamental biochemistry of the cell.",

    "abstract": "A sizeable literature has shown that perception of prosodic elements bolsters speech comprehension across developmental stages; recent work also suggests that variance in musical aptitude predicts individual differences in prosody perception in adults. The current study investigates brain and behavioral methods of assessing prosody perception and tests the relationship with musical rhythm perception in 35 school-aged children (age range: 5;5 to 8;0 years, M = 6;7 years, SD = 10 months; 18 females). We applied stimulus reconstruction, a technique for analyzing EEG data by fitting a temporal response function that maps the neural response back to the sensory stimulus. In doing so, we obtain a measure of neural encoding of the speech envelope in passive listening to continuous narratives. We also present a behavioral prosody assessment that requires holistic judgments of filtered speech. The results from these typically developing children revealed that individual differences in stimulus reconstruction in the delta band, indexing neural synchrony to the speech envelope, are significantly related to individual differences in behavioral measurement of prosody perception. In addition, both of these measures are moderately to strongly correlated with musical rhythm perception skills. Results support a domain-general mechanism for cognitive processing of speech and music.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/281998v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (68K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7a4ca2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d41c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a9652borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130eb6a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Excitation in neural circuits must be carefully controlled by inhibition to regulate information processing and network excitability. During development, cortical inhibitory and excitatory inputs are initially mismatched but become co-tuned or  balanced with experience. However, little is known about how excitatory-inhibitory balance is defined at most synapses, or the mechanisms for establishing or maintaining this balance at specific set-points. Here we show how coordinated long-term plasticity calibrates populations of excitatory/inhibitory inputs onto mouse auditory cortical pyramidal neurons. Pairing pre- and postsynaptic activity induced plasticity at paired inputs and different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity at the strongest unpaired synapses, which required minutes of activity and dendritic Ca2+ signaling to be computed. Theoretical analyses demonstrated how the relative rate of heterosynaptic plasticity could normalize and stabilize synaptic strengths to achieve any possible excitatory-inhibitory correlation. Thus excitatory-inhibitory balance is dynamic and cell-specific, determined by distinct plasticity rules across multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses.",

    "abstract": "Recordings of extracellular electrical, and later also magnetic, brain signals have been the dominant technique for measuring brain activity for decades. The interpretation of such signals is however nontrivial, as the measured signals result from both local and distant neuronal activity. In volume-conductor theory the extracellular potentials can be calculated from a distance-weighted sum of contributions from transmembrane currents of neurons. Given the same transmembrane currents, the contributions to the magnetic field recorded both inside and outside the brain can also be computed. This allows for the development of computational tools implementing forward models grounded in the biophysics underlying electrical and magnetic measurement modalities.\\n\\nLFPy (LFPy.readthedocs.io) incorporated a well-established scheme for predicting extracellular potentials of individual neurons with arbitrary levels of biological detail. It relies on NEURON (neuron.yale.edu) to compute transmembrane currents of multicompartment neurons which is then used in combination with an electrostatic forward model. Its functionality is now extended to allow for modeling of networks of multicompartment neurons with concurrent calculations of extracellular potentials and current dipole moments. The current dipole moments are then, in combination with suitable volume-conductor head models, used to compute non-invasive measures of neuronal activity, like scalp potentials (electroencephalographic recordings; EEG) and magnetic fields outside the head (magnetoencephalographic recordings; MEG). One such built-in head model is the four-sphere head model incorporating the different electric conductivities of brain, cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp.\\n\\nWe demonstrate the new functionality of the software by constructing a network of biophysically detailed multicompartment neuron models from the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration (NMC) Portal (bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal) with corresponding statistics of connections and synapses, and compute in vivo-like extracellular potentials (local field potentials, LFP; electrocorticographical signals, ECoG) and corresponding current dipole moments. From the current dipole moments we estimate corresponding EEG and MEG signals using the four-sphere head model. We also show strong scaling performance of LFPy with different numbers of message-passing interface (MPI) processes, and for different network sizes with different density of connections.\\n\\nThe open-source software LFPy is equally suitable for execution on laptops and in parallel on high-performance computing (HPC) facilities and is publicly available on GitHub.com.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora cinnamomi is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a P. cinnamomi infected heathland of Erica umbellata used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing P. cinnamomi foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.",

    "abstract": "A major obstacle to the mapping of genotype-phenotype relationships is pleiotropy, the tendency of mutations to affect seemingly unrelated traits. Pleiotropy has major implications for evolution, development, ageing, and disease. Except for disease data, pleiotropy is almost exclusively estimated from full gene knockouts. However, most deleterious alleles segregating in natural populations do not fully abolish gene function, and the degree to which a polymorphism reduces protein function may influence the number of traits it affects. Utilizing genome-scale metabolic models for Escherichia coli and the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that most fitness-reducing full gene knockouts of metabolic genes have pleiotropic effects, i.e., they compromise the production of multiple biomass components. Alleles of the same gene with increasingly reduced enzyme function typically affect an increasing number of biomass components. This increasing pleiotropy is often mediated through effects on the generation of currency metabolites such as ATP or NADPH. We conclude that the physiological effects observed in full gene knockouts will in most cases not be representative for alleles with only partially reduced enzyme capacity or expression level.",

    "abstract": "While new genomes are sequenced at ever increasing rates, their phenotypic analysis remains a major bottleneck of biomedical research. The generation of genome-scale metabolic models capable of accurate phenotypic predictions is a labor-intensive endeavor; accordingly, such models are available for only a small percentage of sequenced species. The standard metabolic reconstruction process starts from a (semi-)automatically generated draft model, which is then refined through extensive manual curation. Here, we present a novel strategy suitable for full automation, which exploits high-throughput gene knockout or nutritional growth data. We test this strategy by reconstructing accurate genome-scale metabolic models for three strains of Streptococcus, a major human pathogen. The resulting models contain a lower proportion of reactions unsupported by genomic evidence than the most widely used E. coli model, but reach the same accuracy in terms of knockout prediction. We confirm the models predictive power by analyzing experimental data for auxotrophy, additional nutritional environments, and double gene knockouts, and we generate a list of potential drug targets. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing high-quality genome-scale metabolic models from high-throughput data, a strategy that promises to massively accelerate the exploration of metabolic phenotypes.\\n\\nSignificance statementReading bacterial genomes has become a cheap, standard laboratory procedure. A genome by itself, however, is of little information value - we need a way to translate its abstract letter sequence into a model that describes the capabilities of its carrier. Until now, this endeavor required months of manual work by experts. Here, we show how this process can be automated by utilizing high-throughput experimental data.

Currently, most of existing methods test the association between multiple traits and a single common variant. However, the variant-by-variant methods for common variant association studies may not be optimal for rare variant association studies due to the allelic heterogeneity as well as the extreme rarity of individual variants. In this article, we developed a statistical method by testing an optimally weighted combination of variants with multiple traits (TOWmuT) to test the association between multiple traits and a weighted combination of variants (rare and/or common) in a genomic region. TOWmuT is robust to the directions of effects of causal variants and is applicable to different types of traits. Using extensive simulation studies, we compared the performance of TOWmuT with the following five existing methods: gene association with multiple traits (GAMuT), multiple sequence kernel association test (MSKAT), adaptive weighting reverse regression (AWRR), single-TOW, and MANOVA. Our results showed that, in all of the simulation scenarios, TOWmuT has correct type I error rates and is consistently more powerful than the other five tests. We also illustrated the usefulness of TOWmuT by analyzing a whole-genome genotyping data from a lung function study.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has long been classified into a number of molecular subtypes that predict prognosis and therefore influence clinical treatment decisions. Cellular heterogeneity is also evident in breast cancers and plays a key role in the development, evolution and metastatic progression of many cancers. How clinical heterogeneity relates to cellular heterogeneity is poorly understood, so we approached this question using single cell gene expression analysis of well established in vitro and in vivo models of disease.\\n\\nTo explore the cellular heterogeneity in breast cancer we first examined a panel of genes that define the PAM50 classifier of molecular subtype. Five breast cancer cell line models (MCF7, BT474, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) were selected as representatives of the intrinsic molecular subtypes (luminal A and B, basal-like, and Her2-enriched). Single cell multiplex RT-PCR was used to isolate and quantify the gene expression of single cells from each of these models, and the PAM50 classifier applied. Using this approach, we identified heterogeneity of intrinsic subtypes at single-cell level, indicating that cells with different subtypes exist within a cell line. Using the Chromium 10X system, this study was extended into thousands of cells from the MCF7 cell-line and an ER+ patient derived xenograft (PDX) model and again identified significant intra-tumour heterogeneity of molecular subtype.\\n\\nEstrogen Receptor (ER) is an important driver and therapeutic target in many breast cancers. It is heterogeneously expressed in a proportion of clinical cases but the significance of this to ER activity is unknown. Significant heterogeneity in the transcriptional activation of ER regulated genes was observed within tumours. This differential activation of the ER cistrome aligned with expression of two known transcriptional co-regulatory factors of ER (FOXA1 and PGR).\\n\\nTo examine the degree of heterogeneity for other important phenotypic traits, we used an unsupervised clustering approach to identify cellular sub-populations with diverse cancer associated transcriptional properties, such as: proliferation; hypoxia; and treatment resistance. In particular, we show that we can identify two distinct sub-populations of cells that may have denovo resistance to endocrine therapies in a treatment naive PDX model of ER+ breast cancer. One of these consists of cells with a non-proliferative transcriptional phenotype that is enriched for transcriptional properties of ERBB2 tumours. The other is heavily enriched for components of the primary cilia. Gene regulatory networks were used to identify transcription factor regulons that are active in each cell, leading us to identify potential transcriptional drivers (such as E2F7, MYB and RFX3) of the cilia associated endocrine resistant cells. This rare subpopulation of cells also has a highly heterogenous mix of intrinsic subtypes highlighting a potential role of intra-tumour subtype heterogeneity in endocrine resistance and metastatic potential.\\n\\nOverall, These results suggest a high degree of cellular heterogeneity within breast cancer models, even cell lines, that can be functionally dissected into sub-populations of cells with transcriptional phenotypes of potential clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia is widely accepted, but it is unclear how mechanistic differences converge to produce the observed phenotype. Establishing a pathophysiological model that accounts for both heterogeneity and phenotypic similarity is essential to inform stratified treatment approaches. In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study, we recruited 77 healthy controls (HC), and 71 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCZ), and reconstructed the structural connectivity of 90 brain regions covering entire cerebral cortex. We first confirmed the heterogeneity in structural connectivity by showing a reduced inter-individual similarity in SCZ compared with HC. Moreover, we found it was not possible to cluster patients into subgroups with shared patterns of dysconnectivity, indicating a high degree of mechanistic divergence in schizophrenia. Instead of the strength of connectivity between any particular brain regions, we investigated the diversity (or statistically, the variance) of the topographic distribution of the strength was reduced. HC had higher topographic diversity in whole brain structural connectivity compared to the patient group\\n\\n(P = 2 x 10-6, T = 4.96, Cohen'S d = 0.87). In 62 of the 90 brain regions, the topographic diversity was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls after FDR correction (<0.05). When topographic diversity was used as a discriminant feature for classification between patients and controls, we significantly (P = 4.29 x 10-24) improved the classification accuracy to 79.6% (sensitivity 78.3%, specificity 81.3%). This finding suggests highly individualized pattern of structural dysconnectivity underlying the heterogeneity of schizophrenia converges to a convergent common pathway as reduced topographic diversity for the clinical construct of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins are required for synaptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms for coordinated synthesis of these proteins are not understood. Using forward genetic screens, we identified the conserved THO nuclear export Complex (THOC) as master regulator of presynapse development in C.elegans dopaminergic neurons. In THOC mutants, synaptic messenger RNAs are trapped in the nucleus, resulting in dramatic decrease of synaptic protein expression, near complete loss of synapses and compromised dopamine function. cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) interacts with THOC to mark activity-dependent transcripts for efficient nuclear export. Deletion of the THOC subunit Thoc5 in mouse dopaminergic neurons causes severe defects in synapse maintenance and subsequent neuronal death in the Substantia Nigra compacta (SNc). These cellular defects lead to abrogated dopamine release, ataxia and animal death. Together, our results argue that nuclear export mechanisms can select specific mRNAs and be a rate-limiting step for synapse development and neuronal survival.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDopaminergic presynapses are severely impaired in thoc mutant worms and mice\\nC_LIO_LITHOC specifically controls the nuclear export of synaptic transcripts\\nC_LIO_LICREB recruits THOC onto activity-dependent synaptic transcripts for efficient export\\nC_LIO_LIDopamine neurons in the SNc degenerate upon conditional knock-out of thoc5\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Several signaling molecules involved in cellular reprogramming have been shown to regulate mammalian axon regeneration. We hypothesized that reprogramming factors are key regulators of axon regeneration. Here we investigated the role of Lin28, an important reprogramming factor, in the regulation of axon regeneration. We found that Lin28a and Lin28b and their regulatory partners, let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs), were both necessary and sufficient in regulating mature sensory axon regeneration in vivo. More importantly, overexpression of either Lin28a or Lin28b in mature retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promoted robust and sustained optic nerve regeneration. Additionally, combined overexpression of Lin28a and downregulation of PTEN in RGCs acted additively to promote optic nerve regeneration by reducing the backward turning of regenerating RGC axons. Our findings not only identified a novel molecule promoting optic nerve regeneration but also suggested that reprogramming factors may play vital roles in regulating axon regeneration in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Secretory proteins translocate across the mammalian ER membrane co-translationally via the ribosome-sec61 translocation channel complex. Signal sequences within the polypeptide, which guide this event, are diverse in their hydrophobicity, charge, length, and amino acid composition. Despite the known sequence diversity in the ER-targeting signals, it is generally assumed that they have a dominant role in determining co-translational targeting and translocation initiation process. We have analyzed co-translational events experienced by secretory proteins carrying efficient, versus inefficient (poorly hydrophobic) signal sequences, using an assay based on Xbp1 peptide-mediated translational arrest. With this method we were able to measure the functional efficiency of ER signal sequences. We show that an efficient signal sequence experiences a two-phases event in which the nascent chain is pulled from the ribosome during its translocation, thus resuming translation and yielding full-length products. Conversely, the inefficient signal sequence experiences a single weaker pulling event, suggesting inadequate engagement by the translocation machinery of these marginally hydrophobic signal sequences.",

Here, we report a detailed gene expression map of human spermatogenesis using single-cell RNA-Seq. Surprisingly, we found that spermatogenesis-expressed genes contain significantly fewer germline mutations than unexpressed genes, with the lowest mutation rates on the transcribed DNA strands. These results suggest a model of  transcriptional scanning to reduce germline mutations by correcting DNA damage. This model also explains the rapid evolution in sensory- and immune-defense related genes, as well as in male reproduction genes. Collectively, our results indicate that widespread expression in the testes achieves a dual mechanism for maintaining the DNA integrity of most genes, while selectively promoting variation of other genes.",

Codon optimization of Cas9 to Arabidopsis achieved over 70% genome editing efficiency at two loci tested. Systematic assessment revealed that guide sequences of 17 nt or shorter dramatically decreased this efficiency.

    "abstract": "Biological development is often described as a dynamic, emergent process. This is evident across a variety of phenomena, from the temporal organization of cell types in the embryo to compounding trends that affect large-scale differentiation. To better understand this, we propose combining quantitative investigations of biological development with theory-building techniques. This provides an alternative to the gene-centric view of development: namely, the view that developmental genes and their expression determine the complexity of the developmental phenotype. Using the model system Caenorhabditis elegans, we examine time-dependent properties of the embryonic phenotype and utilize the unique life-history properties to demonstrate how these emergent properties can be linked together by data analysis and theory-building. We also focus on embryogenetic differentiation processes, and how terminally-differentiated cells contribute to structure and function of the adult phenotype. Examining embryogenetic dynamics from 200 to 400 minutes post-fertilization provides basic quantitative information on developmental tempo and process. To summarize, theory construction techniques are summarized and proposed as a way to rigorously interpret our data. Our proposed approach to a formal data representation that can provide critical links across life-history, anatomy and function.",

In the present paper, we report that Wnt-induced lipid droplet biogenesis does not depend on the canonical TCF/LEF transcription factors.

We demonstrate, for the first time, oppositional effects of imprinted genes on brain and behavior. Specifically, here we show that mice lacking paternal Grb10 make fewer impulsive choices, with no dissociable effects on a separate measure of impulsive action. Taken together with previous work showing that mice lacking maternal Nesp55 make more impulsive choices this suggests that impulsive choice behavior is a substrate for the action of genomic imprinting. Moreover, the contrasting effect of these two genes suggests impulsive choices are subject to intra-genomic conflict and that maternal and paternal interests pull this behavior in opposite directions. Finally, these data may also indicate that an imbalance in expression of imprinted genes contributes to pathological conditions such as gambling and drug addiction, where impulsive behavior becomes maladaptive.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBoth statins and PCSK9 inhibitors lower blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to reduce risk of cardiovascular events. To assess potential differences between metabolic effects of these two lipid-lowering therapies, we performed detailed lipid and metabolite profiling of a large randomized statin trial, and compared the results with the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9, acting as a naturally occurring trial.\\n\\nMethods228 circulating metabolic measures were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including lipoprotein subclass concentrations and their lipid composition, fatty acids, and amino acids, for 5,359 individuals (2,659 on treatment) in the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial at 6-months post-randomization. The corresponding metabolic measures were analyzed in eight population cohorts (N=72,185) using PCSK9 rs11591147 as an unconfounded proxy to mimic the therapeutic effects of PCSK9 inhibitors.\\n\\nResultsScaled to an equivalent lowering of LDL-C, the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9 on 228 metabolic markers were generally consistent with those of statin therapy (R2=0.88). Alterations in lipoprotein lipid composition and fatty acid balance were similar. However, discrepancies were observed for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipid measures. For instance, genetic inhibition of PCSK9 showed weaker effects on lowering of VLDL-cholesterol compared with statin therapy (54% vs. 77% reduction, relative to the lowering effect on LDL-C; P=2 x 10-7 for heterogeneity). Genetic inhibition of PCSK9 showed no robust effects on amino acids, ketones, and a marker of inflammation (GlycA); in contrast, statin treatment lowered GlycA levels.\\n\\nConclusionsGenetic inhibition of PCSK9 results in similar metabolic effects as statin therapy across a detailed lipid and metabolite profile. However, for the same lowering of LDL-C, PCSK9 inhibitors are predicted to be less efficacious than statins at lowering VLDL lipids, which could potentially translate into subtle differences in cardiovascular risk reduction.",

We used adjusted generalized estimating equations (GEE) models and partial least squares (PLS) regression for the analysis.\\n\\nResultsIn adjusted GEE models, four TGFA (14:0, 16:0, 14:1n-7, 16:1n-7 as mol%) had strong negative associations with IS while others (e.g. 18:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 20:2n-6, 20:5n-3) had strong positive associations. Few associations were seen for beta-cell function, except for 16:0, 18:1n-7, and 20:2n-6. PLS analysis indicated four TGFA (14:0, 16:0, 14:1n-7, 16:1n-7) that clustered together and strongly related with lower IS. These four TGFA also correlated highly (r>0.4) with clinically measured TG.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found that higher proportions of a cluster of four TGFA strongly related with lower IS as well as hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting only a few fatty acids within the TGFA composition may primarily explain lipids role in glucose dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "Amber codon suppression is a powerful tool to site-specifically modify proteins to generate novel biophysical probes. Yet, its application on large and complex multidomain proteins is challenging, leading to difficulties during structural and conformational characterization using spectroscopic methods. The animal fatty acid synthase type I is a 540 kDa homodimer displaying large conformational variability. As the key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis, it attracts interest in the fields of obesity, diabetes and cancer treatment. Substrates and intermediates remain covalently bound to the enzyme during biosynthesis and are shuttled to all catalytic domains by the acyl carrier protein domain. Thus, conformational variability of animal FAS is an essential aspect for fatty acid biosynthesis. We investigate this multidomain protein as a model system for probing amber codon suppression by genetic encoding of non-canonical amino acids. The systematic approach relies on a microplate-based reporter assay of low complexity, that was used for quick screening of suppression conditions. Furthermore, the applicability of the reporter assay is demonstrated by successful upscaling to both full-length constructs and increased expression scale. The obtained fluorescent probes of murine FAS type I could be subjected readily to a conformational analysis using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.",

We first show that fast and precise in vitro quantification of NIR fluorophores lifetime and stoichiometry can be done using phasor analysis, a computationally efficient and user-friendly representation of complex fluorescence intensity decays obtained with pulsed laser excitation. We apply this approach to the study of binding equilibria by Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET), using two different model systems: primary/secondary antibody binding in vitro and ligand/receptor binding in cell cultures. We then extend our demonstration to dynamic imaging of the pharmacokinetics of transferrin binding to the transferrin receptor in live mice, elucidating the kinetic of differential transferrin accumulation in specific organs, straightforwardly differentiating specific from non-specific binding. Our method, implemented in a freely-available software package, has all the advantages of time-resolved NIR imaging, including better tissue penetration and background-free imaging, but simplifies and considerably speeds up data processing and interpretation, while remaining quantitative. These advances make this method attractive and of broad applicability for in vitro and in vivo molecular imaging, and could be extended to applications as diverse as image guided-surgery or optical tomography.",

Compared to smCounter, smCounter2 features lower detection limit at 0.5%, better overall accuracy (particularly in non-coding regions), a consistent threshold that can be applied to both deep and shallow sequencing runs, and easier use via a Docker image and code for read pre-processing. We benchmarked smCounter2 against several state-of-the-art UMI-based variant calling methods using multiple datasets and demonstrated smCounter2s superior performance in detecting somatic variants. At the core of smCounter2 is a statistical test to determine whether the allele frequency of the putative variant is significantly above the background error rate, which was carefully modeled using an independent dataset. The improved accuracy in non-coding regions was mainly achieved using novel repetitive region filters that were specifically designed for UMI data.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe entire pipeline is available at https://github.com/qiaseq/qiaseq-dna under MIT license.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/introPioneer factors have the exquisite ability to engage their target sites at nucleosomal DNA, which leads to a local remodeling of chromatin and the establishment of a transcriptional competence. However, the direct impact of enhancer priming by pioneer factors on the temporal control of gene expression and on mitotic memory remains elusive. In Drosophila embryos, the maternally deposited activator Zelda (Zld) exhibits key pioneer factor properties and indeed regulates the awakening of the zygotic genome. The analysis of thousands of endogenous Zld bound regions in various genetic contexts, as well as the study of isolated synthetic enhancers with static approaches, led to the proposal that Zld could act as a quantitative developmental timer. Here we employ quantitative live imaging methods and mathematical modeling to directly test the effect of Zld on temporal coordination in gene activation and on mitotic memory. Using an automatic tracking software, we quantified the timing of activation in hundreds of nuclei and their progeny in Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that increasing the number of Zld binding sites accelerates the kinetics of transcriptional activation regardless of their past transcriptional state. In spite of its known pioneering activities, we show that Zld is not a mitotic bookmarker and is neither necessary nor sufficient to foster mitotic memory. Fluorescent recovery after photo-bleaching and fluorescent correlation spectroscopy experiments reveal that, Zld is highly dynamic and exhibits transient binding to chromatin. We propose that Zld low binding rates could be compensated for by local accumulation of Zld in nuclear microenvironments in vivo, thus allowing rapid and coordinated gene activation.",

    "abstract": "DNA repeats are common elements in eukaryotic genomes, and their multi-copy nature provides the opportunity for genetic exchange. This exchange can produce altered evolutionary patterns, including concerted evolution where within genome repeat copies are more similar to each other than to orthologous repeats in related species. Here we investigated the genetic architecture of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) gene family, KRTAP1. This family encodes proteins that are important components of hair and wool in mammals, and the genes are present in tandem copies. Comparison of KRTAP1 gene repeats from species across the mammalian phylogeny shows strongly contrasting evolutionary patterns between the coding regions, which have a concerted evolution pattern, and the flanking regions, which have a normal, radiating pattern of evolution. This dichotomy in evolutionary pattern transitions abruptly at the start and stop codons, and we show it is not the result of purifying selection acting to maintain species-specific protein sequences, nor of codon adaptation or reverse transcription of KRTAP1-n mRNA. Instead, the results are consistent with short-tract gene conversion events coupled with selection for these events in the coding region driving the contrasting evolutionary patterns found in the KRTAP1 repeats. Our work shows the power that repeat recombination has to complement selection and finely tune the sequences of repetitive genes. Interplay between selection and recombination may be a more common mechanism than currently appreciated for achieving specific adaptive outcomes in the many eukaryotic multi-gene families, and our work argues for greater emphasis on exploring the sequence structures of these families.",

However, distinguishing genes related to their ecological specialism from other sources of selection and more random changes is a challenge. Here we describe the genome of Drosophila montana, the most extremely cold-adapted Drosophila species. We describe the genome, which is similar in size and gene content to most Drosophila species. We look for evidence of accelerated divergence from a previously sequenced relative, and do not find strong evidence for divergent selection on coding sequence variation. We use branch tests to identify genes showing accelerated divergence in contrasts between cold- and warm adapted species and identify about 250 genes that show differences, possibly driven by a lower synonymous substitution rate in cold-adapted species. Divergent genes are involved in a variety of functions, including cuticular and olfactory processes. We also re-sequenced three populations of D. montana representing its ecological and geographic range. Outlier loci were more likely to be found on the X chromosome and there was a greater than expected overlap between population outliers and those genes implicated in cold adaptation between Drosophila species, implying some continuity of selective process at these different evolutionary scales.",

Such ecological mating cues are now considered more common than previously thought, but we still know little about the genetic changes underlying their evolution, or more generally about the genetic basis for assortative mating behaviors. The warning patterns of Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno are under disruptive selection due to increased predation of non-mimetic hybrids, and are used during mate recognition. We carried out a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of preference behaviors between these species and showed that divergent male preference has a simple genetic basis. Three QTLs each explain a large proportion of the differences in preference behavior observed between the parental species. Two of these QTLs are on chromosomes with major color pattern genes, including one that is tightly associated with the gene optix. Different loci influence different aspects of attraction, suggesting that behavioral isolation in Heliconius involves the evolution of independently segregating modules, similar to those for the corresponding wing pattern cues. Hybridization and subsequent sharing of wing pattern loci has played an important role during adaptation and speciation in Heliconius butterflies. The existence of large effect preference loci could similarly assist the evolution of novel behavioral phenotypes through recombination and introgression, and should facilitate rapid speciation.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are obligate genetic parasites that propagate in host genomes by replicating in germline nuclei, thereby ensuring transmission to offspring. This selfish replication not only produces deleterious mutations---in extreme cases, TE mobilization induces genotoxic stress that prohibits the production of viable gametes. Host genomes could reduce these fitness effects in two ways: resistance and tolerance. Resistance to TE propagation is enacted by germline specific small-RNA-mediated silencing pathways, such as the piRNA pathway, and is studied extensively. However, it remains entirely unknown whether host genomes may also evolve tolerance, by desensitizing gametogenesis to the harmful effects of TEs. In part, the absence of research on tolerance reflects a lack of opportunity, as small-RNA-mediated silencing evolves rapidly after a new TE invades, thereby masking existing variation in tolerance.\\n\\nWe have exploited the recent the historical invasion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome by P-element DNA transposons in order to study tolerance of TE activity. In the absence of piRNA-mediated silencing, the genotoxic stress imposed by P-elements disrupts oogenesis, and in extreme cases leads to atrophied ovaries that completely lack germline cells. By performing QTL-mapping on a panel of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that lack piRNA-mediated silencing of P- elements, we uncovered multiple QTL that are associated with differences in tolerance of oogenesis to P-element transposition. We localized the most significant QTL to a small 230 Kb euchromatic region, with the LOD peak occurring in the Bruno locus, which codes for a critical and well-studied developmental regulator of oogenesis. We further demonstrate that multiple bruno loss-of-function alleles are strong dominant suppressors of ovarian atrophy, allowing for the development of mature egg-chambers in the face of P-element activity. Genetic and cytological analyses suggest that bruno tolerance is explained by enhanced retention of germline stem cells in dysgenic ovaries, which are typically lost due to DNA damage. Our observations reveal segregating variation in TE tolerance for the first time, and implicate gametogenic regulators as a source of tolerant variants in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "The current-voltage (I-V) conversion characterizes the physiology of cellular microdomains and reflects cellular communication, excitability, and electrical transduction. Yet deriving such I-V laws remains a major challenge in most cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohms law, showing that the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties. For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction. Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude, electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in neuronal microdomains.",

    "abstract": "Evaporative cooling is a prerequisite for avian occupancy of hot, arid environments, and is the only avenue of heat dissipation when air temperatures (Ta) exceed body temperature (Tb). Whereas diurnal birds can potentially rehydrate throughout the day, nocturnal species typically forgo drinking between sunrise and sunset. We hypothesized that nocturnal birds have evolved reduced rates of evaporative water loss (EWL) and more economical evaporative cooling mechanisms than those of diurnal species that permit them to tolerate extended periods of intense heat without becoming lethally dehydrated. We used phylogenetically-informed regressions to compare EWL and evaporative cooling efficiency (ratio of evaporative heat loss [EHL] and metabolic heat production [MHP]; EHL/MHP) among nocturnal and diurnal birds at high Ta. We analyzed variation in three response variables: 1) slope of EWL at Ta between 40 and 46{degrees}C, 2) EWL at Ta = 46{degrees}C, and 3) EHL/MHP at Ta = 46{degrees}C. Nocturnality emerged as a weak, negative predictor, with nocturnal species having slightly shallower slopes and reduced EWL compared to diurnal species of similar mass. In contrast, nocturnal activity was positively correlated with EHL/MHP, indicating a greater capacity for evaporative cooling in nocturnal birds. However, our analysis also revealed conspicuous differences among nocturnal taxa. Caprimulgids and Australian-owlet nightjars had shallower slopes and reduced EWL compared to similarly-sized diurnal species, whereas owls had EWL rates comparable to diurnal species. Consequently, our results did not unequivocally demonstrate more economical cooling among nocturnal birds. Owls predominately select refugia with cooler microclimates, but the more frequent and intense heat waves forecast for the 21st century may increase microclimate temperatures and the necessity for active heat dissipation, potentially increasing owls vulnerability to dehydration and hyperthermia.",
