    "abstract": "Generation and usage of high-quality molecular signalling network maps can be augmented by standardising notations, establishing curation workflows and application of computational biology methods to exploit the knowledge contained in the maps. In this manuscript, we summarize the major aims and challenges of assembling information in the form of comprehensive maps of molecular interactions. Mainly, we share our experience gained while creating the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network. In the step-by-step procedure, we describe the map construction process and suggest solutions for map complexity management by introducing a hierarchical modular map structure. In addition, we describe the NaviCell platform, a computational technology using Google Maps API to explore comprehensive molecular maps similar to geographical maps, and explain the advantages of semantic zooming principles for map navigation. We also provide the outline to prepare signalling network maps for navigation using the NaviCell platform. Finally, several examples of cancer high-throughput data analysis and visualization in the context of comprehensive signalling maps are presented.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that frequently transfer within and between bacterial species play a critical role in bacterial evolution, and often carry key accessory genes that associate with a bacterias ability to cause disease. MGEs carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and/or virulence determinants are common in opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are a leading cause of highly drug-resistant infections in hospitals. Well-characterised virulence determinants in K. pneumoniae include the polyketide synthesis loci ybt and clb (also known as pks), encoding the iron-scavenging siderophore yersiniabactin and genotoxin colibactin respectively. These loci are located within an MGE called ICEKp, which is the most common virulence-associated MGE of K. pneumoniae, providing a mechanism for these virulence factors to spread within the population.\\n\\nHere we apply population genomics to investigate the prevalence, evolution and mobility of ybt and clb in K. pneumoniae populations through comparative analysis of 2,498 whole genome sequences. The ybt locus was detected in 40% of K. pneumoniae genomes, particularly amongst those associated with invasive infections. We identified 17 distinct ybt lineages and 3 clb lineages, each associated with one of 14 different structural variants of ICEKp. Comparison with the wider Enterobacteriaceae population showed occasional ICEKp acquisition by other members. The clb locus was present in 14% of all K. pneumoniae and 38.4% of ybt+ genomes. Hundreds of independent ICEKp integration events were detected affecting hundreds of phylogenetically distinct K. pneumoniae lineages, including [&ge;]19 in the globally-disseminated carbapenem-resistant clone CG258. A novel plasmid-encoded form of ybt was also identified, representing a new mechanism for ybt dispersal in K. pneumoniae populations. These data show that MGEs carrying ybt and clb circulate freely in the K. pneumoniae population, including among multidrug-resistant strains, and should be considered a target for genomic surveillance along with AMR determinants.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYKlebsiella pneumoniae infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat with antibiotics. Some K. pneumoniae strains also carry extra genes that allow them to synthesise yersiniabactin, an iron-scavenging molecule, which enhances their ability to cause disease. These genes are located on a genetic element that can easily transfer between strains. Here, we screened 2498 K. pneumoniae genome sequences and found substantial diversity in the yersiniabactin genes and the associated genetic elements, including a novel mechanism of transfer, and detected hundreds of distinct yersiniabactin acquisition events between K. pneumoniae strains. We show that these yersiniabactin mobile genetic elements are specifically adapted to the K. pneumoniae population but also occasionally acquired by other bacterial members belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family such as E. coli. These insights into the movement and genetics of yersiniabactin genes allow tracking of the evolution and spread of yersiniabactin in global K. pneumoniae populations and monitoring for acquisition of yersiniabactin in antibiotic-resistant strains.",

    "abstract": "Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as \\\"replays\\\". It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are \\\"transferred\\\" from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the emergence of patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, replay emerges most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of this model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivation of the medial septum we find no such increase. Our model is the first to show how theta-modulation can speed up learning by facilitating the emergence of environment-specific network-wide patterns of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal circuits.",

    "abstract": "The role that vitamin D plays in pulmonary function remains uncertain. Epidemiological studies reported mixed findings for the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and pulmonary function. We conducted the largest cross-sectional meta-analysis of the 25(OH)D- pulmonary function association to date, based on nine European ancestry (EA) cohorts (n=22,838) and five African ancestry (AA) cohorts (n=4,290) in the CHARGE Consortium. Data were analyzed using linear models by cohort and ancestry. Effect modification by smoking status (current/former/never) was tested. Results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D was 68 (29) nmol/L for EAs and 49 (21) nmol/L for AAs. For each 1 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was higher by 1.1 mL in EAs (95% CI: 0.9,1.3; P=2.5x10-21) and 1.8 mL (95% CI: 1.1,2.5; P=1.6x10-7) in Aas (Prace difference=0.06), and forced vital capacity (FVC) was higher by 1.3 mL in EAs (95% CI: 1.0,1.6; P=1.1x10-20) and 1.5 mL (95% CI: 0.8,2.3; P=1.2x10-4) in AAs (Prace difference=0.56). Among EAs, the 25(OH)D-FVC association was stronger in smokers: per 1nmol/L higher 25(OH)D, FVC was higher by 1.7 mL (95% CI: 1.1,2.3) for current smokers and 1.7 mL (95% CI: 1.2,2.1) for former smokers, compared to 0.8 mL (95% CI: 0.4,1.2) for never smokers. In summary, the 25(OH)D associations with FEV1 and FVC were positive in both ancestries. In EAs, a stronger association was observed for smokers compared to never smokers, which supports the importance of vitamin D in vulnerable populations.\\n\\nCohort FundingThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant number R21 HL125574 funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) (co-Principal Investigators [co-PIs]: DBH and PAC).

    "abstract": "Phenotypic evolution and speciation depend on recombination in many ways. Within populations, recombination can promote adaptation by bringing together favorable mutations and decoupling beneficial and deleterious alleles. As populations diverge, cross-over can give rise to maladapted recombinants and impede or reverse diversification. Suppressed recombination due to genomic rearrangements, modifier alleles, and intrinsic chromosomal properties may offer a shield against maladaptive gene flow eroding co-adapted gene complexes. Both theoretical and empirical results support this relationship. However, little is known about this relationship in the context of behavioral isolation, where co-evolving signals and preferences are the major hybridization barrier. Here we examine the genomic architecture of recently diverged, sexually isolated Hawaiian swordtail crickets (Laupala). We assemble a de novo genome and generate three dense linkage maps from interspecies crosses. In line with expectations based on the species recent divergence and successful interbreeding in the lab, the linkage maps are highly collinear and show no evidence for large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. The maps were then used to anchor the assembly to pseudomolecules and estimate recombination rates across the genome. We tested the hypothesis that loci involved in behavioral isolation (song and preference divergence) are in regions of low interspecific recombination. Contrary to our expectations, a genomic region where a male song QTL co-localizes with a female preference QTL was not associated with particularly low recombination rates. This study provides important novel genomic resources for an emerging evolutionary genetics model system and suggests that trait-preference co-evolution is not necessarily facilitated by locally suppressed recombination.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe majority of cancer patients receive treatments that are minimally informed by omics data. We propose a precision medicine computational framework (PANOPLY: Precision cancer genomic report: single sample inventory) to identify and prioritize drug targets and cancer therapy regimens.\\n\\nMethodsThe PANOPLY approach integrates clinical data with germline and somatic features obtained from multi-omics platforms, and apply machine learning, and network analysis approaches in the context of the individual patient and matched controls. The PANOPLY workflow employs four steps (i) selection of matched controls to the case of interest (ii) identification of case-specific genomic events (iii) identification of suitable drugs using the driver-gene network and random forest analyses and (iv) provide an integrated multi-omics case report of the patient with prioritization of anti-cancer drugs.\\n\\nResultsThe PANOPLY workflow can be executed on a stand-alone virtual machine and is also available for download as an R package. We applied the method to an institutional breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy study which collected clinical and genomic data as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to investigate the prioritization offered by PANOPLY. In a chemotherapy-resistant PDX model, we found that that the prioritized drug, olaparib, was more effective than placebo in treating the tumor (P < 0.05). We also applied PANOPLY to in-house and publicly accessible multi-omics tumor datasets with therapeutic response or survival data available.\\n\\nConclusionPANOPLY shows promise as a means to prioritize drugs based on clinical and multi-omics data for an individual cancer patient. Additional studies are needed to confirm this approach.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication creates a second copy of a gene either in tandem to the ancestral locus or dispersed to another chromosomal location. When the ancestral copy of a dispersed duplicate is lost from the genome, it creates the appearance that the gene was \\\"relocated\\\" from the ancestral locus to the derived location. Gene relocations may be as common as canonical dispersed duplications in which both the ancestral and derived copies are retained. Relocated genes appear to be under more selective constraints than the derived copies of canonical duplications, and they are possibly as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes. To test this hypothesis, we combined comparative genomics, population genetics, gene expression, and functional analyses to assess the selection pressures acting on relocated, duplicated, and non-relocated single-copy genes in Drosophila genomes. We find that relocated genes evolve faster than single-copy non-relocated genes, and there is no evidence that this faster evolution is driven by positive selection. In addition, relocated genes are less essential for viability and male fertility than single-copy non-relocated genes, suggesting that relocated genes evolve fast because of relaxed selective constraints. However, relocated genes evolve slower than the derived copies of canonical dispersed duplicated genes. We therefore conclude that relocated genes are under more selective constraints than canonical duplicates, but are not as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes.",

Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we attributed RNA alterations to germline and somatic DNA alterations, revealing likely genetic mechanisms. We identified 444 associations of gene expression with somatic non-coding single-nucleotide variants. We found 1,872 splicing alterations associated with somatic mutation in intronic regions, including novel exonization events associated with Alu elements. Somatic copy number alterations were the major driver of total gene and allele-specific expression (ASE) variation. Additionally, 82% of gene fusions had structural variant support, including 75 of a novel class called \\\"bridged\\\" fusions, in which a third genomic location bridged two different genes. Globally, we observe transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer types and have associations with DNA mutational signatures. Given this unique dataset of RNA alterations, we also identified 1,012 genes significantly altered through both DNA and RNA mechanisms. Our study represents an extensive catalog of RNA alterations and reveals new insights into the heterogeneous molecular mechanisms of cancer gene alterations.",

This study investigates how non-declarative memory could support both the transient, short-term and the persistent, long-term structural priming effects commonly seen in the literature. We propose that these characteristics are supported by different subcomponents of non-declarative memory: Perceptual and conceptual non-declarative memory respectively. Previous studies have suggested that these subcomponents age differently, with only conceptual memory showing age-related decline. By investigating how different components of structural priming vary across the lifespan, we aim to elucidate how non-declarative memory supports two seemingly different components of structural priming. In 167 participants ranging between 20 and 85 years old, we find no change in short-term priming magnitude and performance on perceptual tasks, whereas both long-term priming and conceptual memory vary with age. We suggest therefore that the two seemingly different components of structural priming are supported by different components of non-declarative memory. These findings have important implications for theoretical accounts of structural priming.",

    "abstract": "In a conventional view of the prokaryotic genome organization promoters precede operons and RBS sites with Shine-Dalgarno consensus precede genes. However, recent experimental research suggesting a more diverse view motivated us to develop an algorithm with improved gene-finding accuracy. We describe GeneMarkS-2, an ab initio algorithm that uses a model derived by self-training for finding species-specific (native) genes, along with an array of pre-computed heuristic models designed to identify harder-to-detect genes (likely horizontally transferred). Importantly, we designed GeneMarkS-2 to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) involved in gene expression control, among them the patterns characteristic for leaderless transcription as well as non-canonical RBS patterns. To assess the accuracy of GeneMarkS-2 we used genes validated by COG annotation, proteomics experiments, and N-terminal protein sequencing. We observed that GeneMarkS-2 performed better on average in all accuracy measures when compared with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools. Furthermore, the screening of [~]5,000 representative prokaryotic genomes made by GeneMarkS-2 predicted frequent leaderless transcription in both archaea and bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in some species with leadered transcription did not necessarily exhibit the Shine-Dalgarno consensus. The modeling of different types of sequence motifs regulating gene expression prompted a division of prokaryotic genomes into five categories with distinct sequence patterns around the gene starts.\\n\\n[Supplemental material is available for this article].",

    "abstract": "The integration of multiple sensory modalities is one of the key aspects of brain function, allowing animals to take advantage of concurrent sources of information to make more accurate perceptual judgments. For many years, it was thought that multisensory integration in the cerebral cortex only occurs in high-level \\\"polysensory\\\" association areas, but recent studies have demonstrated cross-modal influences in regions that were traditionally designated as unimodal. In particular, several human neuroimaging studies have reported that extrastriate areas involved in visual motion perception are also activated by auditory motion, and may integrate audio-visual motion cues. However, the exact nature and extent of the effects of auditory motion on the visual cortex have not been studied at the single neuron level. We recorded the spiking activity of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anesthetized marmoset monkeys upon presentation of unimodal stimuli (moving auditory or visual patterns), as well as bimodal stimuli (concurrent audio-visual motion). Despite robust, direction selective responses to visual motion, none of the sampled neurons responded to auditory motion stimuli. Moreover, concurrent moving auditory stimuli had no significant effect on the ability of single MT and MST neurons, or populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli (moving random dot patterns with varying levels of motion noise). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that direct interactions between MT, MST and areas low in the hierarchy of auditory areas underlie audiovisual motion integration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany studies have demonstrated that brain regions originally thought to be unisensory may play a role in multisensory processing. For example, some neuroimaging studies have found activity in regions involved in the processing of visual motion can be modified by auditory motion. We tested whether the spiking activity of neurons in two visual motion processing areas of the primate brain, areas MT and MST, can be modulated by moving auditory stimuli. Our results revealed that neurons in these areas neither respond to auditory motion, nor change their responses to visual motion according to auditory motion along the frontoparallel plane. These findings call into question the idea that audio-visual integration occurs at early stages of processing in the extrastriate cortex.",

    "abstract": "How to partition a data set into a set of distinct clusters is a ubiquitous and challenging problem. The fact that data sets vary widely in features such as cluster shape, cluster number, density distribution, background noise, outliers and degree of overlap, makes it difficult to find a single algorithm that can be broadly applied. One recent method, based on search of density peaks, can be applied successfully to cluster many kinds of data, but it is not fully automatic, and fails on some simple data distributions. We propose an alternative approach, which estimates density dips between points, and allows robust determination of cluster number and distribution across a wide array of data, without any manual parameter adjustment. We show that this method is able to solve a range of synthetic and experimental data sets, where the underlying structure is known, and identifies consistent and meaningful clusters in new behavioural data.\\n\\nSignificanceIt is common that natural phenomena produce groupings, or clusters, in data, that can reveal the underlying processes. However, the form of these clusters can vary arbitrarily, making it challenging to find a single algorithm that identifies their structure correctly, without prior knowledge of the number of groupings or their distribution. We describe a simple clustering algorithm that is fully automatic and is able to correctly identify the number and shape of groupings in data of many types. We expect this algorithm to be useful in finding unknown natural phenomena present in data from a wide range of scientific fields.",

How this neural selectivity is achieved even at negative signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) remains unclear. We show that, under such conditions, a late cortical representation (i.e., neural tracking) of the ignored acoustic signal is key to successful separation of attended and distracting talkers (i.e., neural selectivity). We recorded and modelled the electroencephalographic response of 18 participants who attended to one of two simultaneously presented stories, while the SNR between the two talkers varied dynamically. The neural tracking showed an increasing early-to-late attention-biased selectivity. Importantly, acoustically dominant ignored talkers were tracked neurally by late involvement of fronto-parietal regions, which contributed to enhanced neural selectivity. This neural selectivity by way of representing the ignored talker poses a mechanistic neural account of attention under real-life acoustic conditions.",

In 2016 the US government updated the results reporting requirements to ClinicalTrials.gov for trials covered under the FDA Amendments Act 2007. We set out to develop and deliver an online tool which publicly monitors compliance with these reporting requirements, facilitates open public audit, and promotes accountability.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a review of the relevant legislation to extract the requirements on reporting results. Specific areas of the statutes were operationalized in code based on the results of our policy review, publicly available data from ClinicalTrials.gov, and communications with ClinicalTrials.gov staff. We developed methods to identify trials required to report results, using publicly available registry data; to incorporate additional relevant information such as key dates and trial sponsors; and to determine when each trial became due. This data was then used to construct a live tracking website.\n\nResultsThere were a number of administrative and technical hurdles to successful operationalization of our tracker. Decisions and assumptions related to overcoming these issues are detailed along with clarifications directly from ClinicalTrials.gov. The FDAAA TrialsTracker was successfully launched in February 2018 and provides users with an overview of results reporting compliance.\n\nDiscussionClinical trials continue to go unreported despite numerous guidelines, commitments, and legal frameworks intended to address this issue. In the absence of formal sanctions from the FDA and others, we argue tools such as ours - providing live data on trial reporting - can improve accountability and performance. In addition, our service helps sponsors identify their own individual trials that have not yet reported results: we therefore offer positive practical support for sponsors who wish to ensure that all their completed trials have reported.",

An outer layer of the kinetochore known as the fibrous corona transiently expands in early mitosis and disassembles upon microtubule capture. Neither the functional importance nor the mechanistic basis for this are known. Here we show that the dynein adaptor Spindly and the RZZ kinetochore complex drive fibrous corona formation in a dynein-independent manner. C-terminal farnesylation and MPS1 kinase activity cause conformational changes of Spindly that promote oligomerization of RZZ:Spindly complexes into a corona-like meshwork in cells and in vitro. Concurrent with corona expansion, Spindly potentiates corona shedding by recruiting dynein via three conserved short linear motifs. Expanded, non-sheddable fibrous coronas engage in extensive, long-lived lateral microtubule interactions that persist to metaphase and result in fused sister kinetochores, formation of merotelic attachments and chromosome segregation errors in anaphase. Thus, dynamic kinetochore size regulation in mitosis is coordinated by a single, Spindly-based mechanism that promotes initial microtubule capture and subsequent correct maturation of attachments.",

    "abstract": "Sport fishes at the apex of aquatic food webs are indicators of mercury in the environment. However bioaccumulation of mercury in fish is a complex process that varies in space and time. Both large-scale climatic and environmental, as well as biological factors are drivers of these space-time variations. In this study, we avail a long-running monitoring program from Ontario, Canada to better understand spatiotemporal variations in fish mercury bioaccumulation. Focussing on two common large-bodied fishes (Walleye and Northern Pike), the data were first stratified by latitudinal zone (north, mid, and south) and eight temporal periods (between 1975 & 2015). A series of linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) with latitudinal zone, time period, and their interactions as random effects were used to capture the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal variations in mercury bioaccumulation. The random slopes from the best-fitting LMEM were used to define bioaccumulation index and capture trends in space and time. Given the generally warming climate trend over the past 45 years, the role of growth dilution in modulating the bioaccumulation trends was also evaluated. The full model comprising of space, time and space-time interactions was the best-fit with interaction effects explaining most of the variation. Spatiotemporal trends showed overall similar patterns for both species. Growth dilution in conjunction with estimated rates of warming for different latitudinal zones failed to explain the spatiotemporal trends. Temporal trends showed contrasting bioaccumulation patterns-increasing in Northern Pike and decreasing in Walleye, suggesting temperature-driven growth dilution is more likely in latter. However, a space-for-time substitution revealed only a weak presence of growth dilution in Walleye, and it was not attributable to temperature differences. Overall, our study summarizes broad-scale variations in fish mercury and explores the role of growth dilution in shaping the observed patterns.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are often highly diverse in their composition, both at the level of coarse-grained taxa such as genera as well as at the level of strains within species. This variability can be driven by both extrinsic factors like temperature, pH, etc., as well as by intrinsic ones, such as demographic fluctuations or ecological interactions. The relative contributions of these factors and the taxonomic level at which they influence community structure remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulty of identifying true community replicates assembled under the same environmental parameters. Here, we address this problem using an activated granular sludge reactor in which millimeter scale biofilm granules represent true community replicates whose differences in composition are expected to be driven primarily by biotic factors. Using 142 shotgun metagenomes of single biofilm granules we found that, at the commonly used genuslevel resolution, community replicates varied much more in their composition than would be expected from neutral assembly processes. This variation, however, did not translate into any clear partitioning into discrete community types, i.e. the equivalent of enterotypes in the human gut. However, a strong partition into community types did emerge at the strain level for the most abundant organism: strains of Candidatus Accumulibacter that coexisted in the metacommunity--i.e. the reactor--excluded each other within community replicates. Single-granule communities maintained a significant lineage structure, whereby the strain phylogeny of Accumulibacter correlated with the overall species composition of the community, indicating high potential for co-diversification among species and communities. Our results suggest that due to the high functional redundancy and competition between close relatives, alternative community types are most likely observed at the level of recently differentiated genotypes but not higher orders of genetic resolution.",

All recognized taxa are herein described, one subspecies is given species status and five new species, viz. P. calliris, P. daidali, P. heffalumpus, P. lisachisme and P. paucispinis, are presented. P. calliris is described from 6 specimens from Cape Mpimbwe, and distinguished primarily by having a high number of both gill rakers on the lower limb of the first gill arch and vertebrae. P. daidali is described from 18 specimens from Cape Mpimbwe, Kansombo and Nkwazi point, and distinguished primarily by males having a labyrinth-like pattern on the head. P. heffalumpus is described from 7 specimens from Cape Mpimbwe, and distinguished primarily by its great size. P. lisachisme is described from 12 specimens from Cape Mpimbwe and Lyamembe, and distinguished primarily by having a high number of dorsal spines. P. paucispinis is described from 4 specimens from Halembe, and distinguished primarily by having a low number of dorsal spines. A revised key to Petrochromis is included. A phylogenetic tree hypothesis of the genus, based on molecular (mitochondrial cytochrome b and d-loop) and morphological results show that jaw position and number of vertebrae are important diagnostic characters.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMSLuminal dysbiosis is ubiquitous in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but how the microbes trigger pro-inflammatory cascades in the epithelial and phagocytic cells remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of the microbial sensor ELMO1 (Engulfment and Cell Motility Protein-1) in sensing and responding to IBD-associated microbes in the gut epithelium and in macrophages.\\n\\nMETHODSA stem cell-based technique is used to grow enteroids from WT and ELMO1-/-mice and from colonic biopsies of patients with IBD and subsequently differentiate them into enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) that mimic the gut epithelium/Gut in a dish. EDMs infected with IBD-associated invasive E. coli-LF82 were analyzed for bacterial internalization, cytokine production and monocyte-recruitment when co-cultured with monocytes.\\n\\nRESULTSExpression of ELMO1 is elevated in the colonic epithelium and in the inflammatory infiltrates within the lamina propria in IBD, higher expression correlated with elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MCP-1 and TNF-. ELMO1-/-murine EDMs displayed a significant reduction of bacterial internalization through epithelial tight junctions and in MCP-1 production compared to WT mice. MCP-1 that is released from the epithelium recruited monocytes. Once recruited, macrophages required ELMO1 to engulf the bacteria and propagate a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine storm (TNF-).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSELMO1 couples microbial-sensing to inflammation in both phagocytic and non-phagocytic host cells; it is required for the production of MCP-1 in the epithelium and TNF- in macrophages. Findings raise the possibility that upregulation of epithelial ELMO1 and the epithelial ELMO1[-&gt;]MCP-1 axis may serve as an early biomarker and therapeutic target, respectively, in IBD and other disorders of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project provides an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively characterize a vast set of uniformly annotated coding and non-coding mutations present in thousands of cancer genomes. Classical models of cancer progression posit that only a small number of these mutations strongly drive tumor progression and that the remaining ones (termed \\\"putative passengers\\\") are inconsequential for tumorigenesis. In this study, we leveraged the comprehensive variant data from PCAWG to ascertain the molecular functional impact of each variant. The impact distribution of PCAWG mutations shows that, in addition to high- and low-impact mutations, there is a group of medium-impact putative passengers predicted to influence gene activity. Moreover, the predicted impact relates to the underlying mutational signature: different signatures confer divergent impact, differentially affecting distinct regulatory subsystems and gene categories. We also find that impact varies based on subclonal architecture (i.e., early vs. late mutations) and can be related to patient survival. Finally, we note that insufficient power due to limited cohort sizes precludes identification of weak drivers using standard recurrence-based approaches. To address this, we adapted an additive effects model derived from complex trait studies to show that aggregating the impact of putative passenger variants (i.e. including yet undetected weak drivers) provides significant predictability for cancer phenotypes beyond the PCAWG identified driver mutations (12.5% additive variance). Furthermore, this framework allowed us to estimate the frequency of potential weak driver mutations in the subset of PCAWG samples lacking well-characterized driver alterations.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of genetic mechanisms driving early embryonic development is primarily based on experiments conducted on mice, however translation of findings can be limited by physiological differences between mice and humans. To address this, we investigated whether the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) is a closer model of early human embryonic development due to their more human-like endocrine profile. We therefore characterised the initiation of gene transcription in the spiny mouse embryo and compared the pattern of gene expression during the embryonic genome activation (EGA) with common mouse and human embryos. Naturally-mated spiny mouse embryos were obtained at the 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-cell stages of development (n=4 biological replicates per stage). RNA-Seq of these samples produced 709.1M paired-end reads in total. De novo assembly of reads was conducted using Trinity. Embryo-specific transcripts were extracted from the de novo assembly and added to the reference spiny mouse transcriptome. Transcription was first detected between the 2-cell and 4-cell stages for the majority of genes (n=3,428), with fewer genes first transcribed between the 4-cell and 8-cell stages (n=1,150). The pattern of gene expression in spiny mouse embryos during this period of development is more human-like than common mouse embryos. This is the first evidence the spiny mouse may provide a more suitable model of human embryonic development. The improved reference Acomys cahirinus transcriptome is publically accessible, further increasing the value of this tool for ongoing research. Further investigation into early development in the spiny mouse is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Treatment failure and recurrent infections can occur even when patients are treated with antibiotics to which bacteria are susceptible. These treatment failures could be due to a sub-population of bacteria persisting through the treatment. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that such bacterial persisters manifest in clinical samples as small colony variants (SCVs). We worked with the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, where SCVs are frequently observed in clinics. The small size of SCV-colonies is often considered to be the result of mutations that reduce the bacterial growth rate. Alternatively, it is possible that the small colony size could result from a long lag time of bacteria in plated samples. We used automated plate imaging and single-cell microscopy to precisely quantify growth kinetics of bacteria sampled from patient and mice abscesses, and from low-pH in vitro cultures mimicking the host. Under these conditions, the small colony size was the consequence of a long lag time and was associated with tolerance towards antibiotics. We found that bacteria with a long lag time emerged de novo during the growth phase in the murine abscess as well as in the low-pH in vitro cultures, and that their proportion increased during stationary phase. Antibiotic exposure further increased the proportion of bacteria with a long lag time. Thus, the persisters found in low-pH host compartments could be a cause of treatment failure, and antibiotic treatment potentially aggravates the problem. These insights call for antibiotic treatment strategies that explicitly address the problem of persister formation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBacterial pathogens often contain subpopulations that are multidrug tolerant and metabolically inactive. These subpopulations are known as persisters and are hypothesised to be linked to treatment failure and recurrent infections even in bacteria that are not genetically resistant to antibiotics. Identifying persisters in clinical samples remains a challenge due to their metabolicaly active state. Here, we used time-lapse plate imaging and single cell microscopy to link the presence of persisters to the nonstable small colony variant (SCV) phenotype that is observed in some Staphylococcus aureus infections. These findings may help to identify treatment regimens that prevent or address the emergence of persistence and thus to reduce relapses.",

    "abstract": "Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies in marine food-webs. Inorganic mercury (Hg) methylation is generally considered to be conducted by bacteria associated with sediment or detritus, but endogenous methylation by the gut microbiome of animals in the lower food webs is another possible source. We examined the occurrence of the bacterial gene (hgcA), required for Hg methylation, in the guts of dominant Baltic zooplankters. A qPCR assay targeting the hgcA sequence in three main clades (Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Archaea) was used in the field-collected specimens of copepods (Acartia bifilosa, Eurytemora affinis, Pseudocalanus acuspes and Limnocalanus macrurus) and cladocerans (Bosmina coregoni maritima and Cercopagis pengoi). All copepods were found to carry hgcA genes in their gut microbiome, whereas no positive amplification was recorded in the cladocerans. In the copepods, hgcA genes belonging to only Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were detected. These findings suggest that endogenous Hg methylation can occur in zooplankton and may contribute to seasonal, spatial and vertical MeHg variability in water column and food webs. Additional molecular and metagenomics studies are needed to identify bacteria carrying hgcA genes and improve their quantification in microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is exacerbated by maladaptive cognition such as pain catastrophizing (PC). Biomarkers of PC mechanisms may aid precision medicine for chronic pain. Here, we investigate EEG biomarkers using mass univariate and multivariate (machine learning) approaches. We test theoretical notions that PC results from a combination of augmented aversive-value encoding (\\\"magnification\\\") and persistent expectations of pain (\\\"rumination\\\"). Healthy individuals with high or low levels of PC underwent an experimental pain model involving nociceptive laser stimuli preceded by cues predicting forthcoming pain intensity. Analysis of EEG acquired during the cue and laser stimulation provided event-related potentials (ERPs) identifying spatially and temporally-extended neural representations associated with pain catastrophizing. Specifically, differential neural responses to cues predicting high vs. low intensity pain (i.e. aversive value encoding) were larger in the high PC group, largely originating from mid-cingulate and superior parietal cortex. Multivariate spatiotemporal EEG patterns evoked from cues with high aversive value selectively and significantly differentiated the high PC from low PC group (64.6% classification accuracy). Regression analyses revealed that neural patterns classifying groups could be partially predicted (R2 = 28%) from those neural patterns classifying the aversive value of cues. In contrast, behavioural and EEG analyses did not provide evidence that PC modifies more persistent effects of prior expectation on pain perception and nociceptive responses. These findings support the hypothesis of magnification of aversive value encoding but not persistent expression of expectation in pain catastrophizers. Multivariate patterns of aversive value encoding provide promising biomarkers of maladaptive cognitive responses to chronic pain that have future potential for psychological treatment development and clinical stratification.",

This system employs a visible laser beam, which does not kill cells directly, but induces local heat production through the trans-cis-trans photo-isomerization of azobenzene moieties in only the irradiated area of a light-responsive thin layer. Using this system in each passage for sectioning, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were maintained their pluripotency and self-renewal during long-term culture. Furthermore, combined with deep machine-learning analysis on fluorescent and phase contrast images, a label-free and automatic cell processing system was developed by eliminating unwanted spontaneously differentiated cells in undifferentiated hiPSC culture conditions.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, a plethora of tools have been developed for neuroscientists to interface with the brain. Implementing these tools requires precise removal of sections of the skull to access the brain. These delicate cranial microsurgical procedures need to be performed on sub-millimeter thick bone without damaging the underlying tissue and therefore, require significant training. Automating some of these procedures would not only enable more precise microsurgical operations, but also democratize use of advanced neurotechnologies. Here, we describe the  Craniobot, a cranial microsurgery platform that combines automated skull surface profiling with a computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling machine to perform a variety of cranial microsurgical procedures in mice. The Craniobot utilizes a low force contact sensor to profile the skull surface and uses this information to perform micrometer-scale precise milling operations within minutes. We have used the Craniobot to drill pilot holes to anchor cranial implants, perform skull thinning, and open small to large craniotomies. The Craniobot is built using off-the-shelf components for under $1000 and is controlled using open-source CNC programming software.",

We have built the first knowledge-base dedicated to this field and used it to generate hypotheses on the molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility.\\n\\nMethodsWe gathered data on the common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered by breast cancer risk GWAS. Information on SNP functional effect (including data on linkage disequilibrium, expression quantitative trait locus, and SNP relationship with regulatory motifs or promoter/enhancer histone marks) was utilized to select putative breast cancer predisposition genes (BCPGs). Ultimately, BCPGs were subject to pathway (gene set enrichment) analysis and network (protein-protein interaction) analysis.\\n\\nResultsData from 38 studies (28 original case-control GWAS enrolling 383,260 patients with breast cancer; and 10 GWAS meta-analyses) were retrieved. Overall, 281 SNPs were associated with the risk of breast cancer with a P-value <10E-06 and a minor allele frequency >1%. Based on functional information, we identified 296 putative BCPGs. Primary analysis showed that germline perturbation of classical cancer-related pathways (e.g., apoptosis, cell cycle, signal transduction including estrogen receptor signaling) play a significant role in breast carcinogenesis. Other less established pathways (such as ribosome and peroxisome machineries) were also highlighted. In the main subgroup analysis, we considered the BCPGs encoding transcription factors (n=36), which in turn target 252 genes. Interestingly, pathway and network analysis of these genes yielded results resembling those of primary analyses, suggesting that most of the effect of genetic variation on disease risk hinges upon transcriptional regulons.\\n\\nConclusionsThis knowledge-base, which is freely available and will be annually updated, can inform future studies dedicated to breast cancer molecular epidemiology as well as genetic susceptibility and development.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The development and application of concepts is a critical component of cognition. Although concepts can be formed on the basis of simple perceptual or semantic features, conceptual representations can also capitalize on similarities across feature relationships. By representing these types of higher-order relationships, concepts can simplify the learning problem and facilitate decisions. Despite this, little is known about the neural mechanisms that support the construction and deployment of these kinds of higher-order concepts during learning. To address this question, we combined a carefully designed associative learning task with computational model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were scanned as they learned and made decisions about sixteen pairs of cues and associated outcomes. Associations were structured such that individual cues shared feature relationships, operationalized as shared patterns of cue pair-outcome associations. In order to capture the large number of possible conceptual representational structures that participants might employ and to evaluate how conceptual representations are used during learning, we leveraged a well-specified Bayesian computational model of category learning [1]. Behavioral and model-based results revealed that participants who displayed a tendency to link experiences in memory benefitted from faster learning rates, suggesting that the use of the conceptual structure in the task facilitated decisions about cue pair-outcome associations. Model-based fMRI analyses revealed that trial-by-trial integration of cue information into higher-order conceptual representations was supported by an anterior temporal (AT) network of regions previously implicated in representing complex conjunctions of features and meaning-based information.",

    "abstract": "The wheat sodium transporters TmHKT1;5-A and TaHKT1;5-D are encoded by genes underlying major shoot Na+ exclusion loci Nax2 and Kna1 from Triticum monococcum (Tm) and Triticum aestivum (Ta), respectively. In contrast to HKT2 transporters that have been shown to exhibit high affinity K+-dependent Na+ transport, HKT1 proteins have, with one exception, only been shown to catalyse low affinity Na+ transport and no K+ transport. Here, using heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes we show that both TmHKT1;5-A and TaHKT1;5-D encode dual (high and low) affinity Na+-transporters with the high-affinity component being abolished when external K+ is in excess of external Na+. Based on 3-D structural modelling we propose that tighter binding of K+, compared to that of Na+ in the selectivity filter region by means of additional van der Waals forces, explains the K+ block at the molecular level. The low-affinity component for Na+ transport of TmHKT1;5-A had a lower Km than that of TaHKT1;5-D and was less sensitive to external K+. We propose that these properties underpin the improvements in shoot Na+-exclusion and crop plant salt tolerance following the introgression of TmHKT1;5-A into diverse wheat backgrounds.",

Of recent intense interest is the GlycA biomarker, a complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy signal reflective of acute and chronic inflammation, which predicts long term risk of diverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. To systematically explore the specificity of the disease burden indicated by GlycA we analysed the risk for 468 common incident hospitalization and mortality outcomes occurring during an 8-year follow-up of 11,861 adults from Finland. Our analyses of GlycA replicated known associations, identified associations with specific cardiovascular disease outcomes, and uncovered new associations with risk of alcoholic liver disease (meta-analysed hazard ratio 2.94 per 1-SD, P=5x10-6), chronic renal failure (HR=2.47, P=3x10-6), glomerular diseases (HR=1.95, P=1x10-6), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR=1.58, P=3x10-5), inflammatory polyarthropathies (HR=1.46, P=4x10-8), and hypertension (HR=1.21, P=5x10-5). We further evaluated GlycA as a biomarker in secondary prevention of 12-year cardiovascular mortality in 900 angiography patients with suspected coronary artery disease. We observed hazard ratios of 4.87 and 5.00 for 12-year mortality in angiography patients in the fourth and fifth quintiles by GlycA levels demonstrating the prognostic potential of GlycA for identification of high mortality-risk individuals. Both GlycA and C-reactive protein had shared as well as independent contributions to mortality hazard, emphasising the importance of chronic inflammation in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities that degrade lignocellulosic biomass are typified by high levels of species- and strain-level complexity as well as synergistic interactions between both cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic microorganisms. Coprothermobacter proteolyticus frequently dominates thermophilic, lignocellulose-degrading communities with wide geographical distribution, which is in contrast to reports that it ferments proteinaceous substrates and is incapable of polysaccharide hydrolysis. Here we deconvolute a highly efficient cellulose-degrading consortium (SEM1b) that is co-dominated by Clostridium (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum- and multiple heterogenic strains affiliated to C. proteolyticus. Metagenomic analysis of SEM1b recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for each constituent population, whilst in parallel two novel strains of C. proteolyticus were successfully isolated and sequenced. Annotation of all C. proteolyticus genotypes (two strains and one MAG) revealed their genetic acquisition of various carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), presumably derived from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events involving C. thermocellum- or Thermotogae-affiliated populations that are historically co-located. HGT material included whole saccharolytic operons and dockerin-encoding enzymatic subunits that are synonymous with cellulosomes. Finally, temporal genome-resolved metatranscriptomic analysis of SEM1b revealed expression of C. proteolyticus CAZymes at different SEM1b life-stages as well as co-expression of CAZymes from multiple SEM1b populations, inferring deeper microbial interactions that are dedicated towards co-degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. We show that C. proteolyticus, a ubiquitous keystone population, consists of closely related strains that have adapted via HGT to degrade both oligo- and longer polysaccharides present in decaying plants and microbial cell walls, thus explaining its dominance in thermophilic anaerobic digesters on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Novel stimuli attract our attention, promote exploratory behavior, and facilitate learning. Atypical habituation and aberrant novelty exploration have been related with the severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) but the underlying neuronal circuits are unknown. Here, we report that dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) promote the behavioral responses to novel social stimuli, support preference for social novelty, and mediate the reinforcing properties of novel social interaction. Social novelty exploration is associated with the insertion of calcium-permeable GluA2-lacking AMPA-type glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons. These novelty-dependent synaptic adaptations only persist upon repeated exposure to social stimuli and sustain social interaction. Global or DA neuron-specific inactivation of the ASD risk gene Neuroligin3 alters both social novelty exploration and the reinforcing properties of social stimuli. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by an aberrant expression of non-canonical GluA2-lacking AMPA-receptors at excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons and an occlusion of novelty-induced synaptic plasticity. Altogether, these findings causally link impaired novelty exploration in an ASD mouse model to VTA DA circuit dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.",

With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells.\\n\\nIt is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness.

RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperimentprovides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers.\\n\\nThe package clusterExperimentis publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function.",

    "abstract": "In T cells, T cell receptor (TCR) signalling initiates downstream transcriptional mechanisms for T cell activation and differentiation. Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Treg) require TCR signals for their suppressive function and maintenance in the periphery. It is, however, unclear how TCR signalling controls the transcriptional programme of Treg. Since most of studies identified the transcriptional features of Treg in comparison to naive T cells, the relationship between Treg and non-naive T cells including memory-phenotype T cells (Tmem) and effector T cells (Teff) is not well understood. Here we dissect the transcriptomes of various T cell subsets from independent datasets using the multidimensional analysis method Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). We show that resting Treg share gene modules for activation with Tmem and Teff. Importantly, Tmem activate the distinct transcriptional modules for T cell activation, which are uniquely repressed in Treg. The activation signature of Treg is dependent on TCR signals, and is more actively operating in activated Treg. Furthermore, by analysing single cell RNA-seq data from tumour-infiltrating T cells, we revealed that FOXP3 expression occurs predominantly in activated T cells. Moreover, we identified FOXP3-driven and T follicular helper (Tfh)-like differentiation pathways in tumour microenvironments, and their bifurcation point, which is enriched with recently activated T cells. Collectively, our study reveals the activation mechanisms downstream of TCR signals for the bifurcation of Treg and Teff differentiation and their maturation processes.",

B-vitamins are essential coenzymes that many organisms cannot synthesize. Thus their exchange among de-novo synthesizers and auxotrophs is expected to play an important role in the microbial consortia and explain some of the temporal and spatial changes observed in diversity. In this study, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of a natural coastal microbial community, diel sampled-quarterly over one year to try to identify the potential major B-vitamin synthesizers and consumers. Our transcriptomic data show that the best-represented taxa dominated the expression of synthesis genes for some B-vitamins but lacked transcripts for others. For instance, Rhodobacterales dominated the expression of vitamin-B12 synthesis, but not of vitamin-B7, whose synthesis transcripts were mainly represented by Flavobacteria.In contrast, bacterial groups that constituted less than 4% of the community (e.g., Verrucomicrobia) accounted for most of the vitamin-B1 synthesis transcripts. Furthermore, ambient vitamin-B1 concentrations were higher in samples collected during the day, and were positively correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the mosaic of metabolic interdependencies through B-vitamin synthesis and exchange are key processes that contribute to shaping microbial communities in nature.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, spinal cord injury (SCI) causes permanent disability. The poor regenerative capacity of descending neurons is one of the main causes of the lack of recovery after SCI. In addition, the prevention of retrograde degeneration leading to the atrophy or death of descending neurons is an obvious prerequisite for the activation of axonal regeneration. Lampreys show an amazing regenerative capacity after SCI. Recent histological work in lampreys suggested that GABA, which is massively released after a SCI, could promote the survival of descending neurons. Here, we aimed to study if GABA, acting through GABAB receptors, promotes the survival and axonal regeneration of descending neurons of larval sea lampreys after a complete SCI. First, we used in situ hybridization to confirm that identifiable descending neurons of late stage larvae express the gabab1 subunit of the sea lamprey GABAB receptor. We also observed an acute increase in the expression of this subunit in descending neurons after a complete SCI, which further supported the possible role of GABA and GABAB receptors in promoting the survival and regeneration of these neurons. So, we performed gain and loss of function experiments to confirm this hypothesis. Treatments with GABA and baclofen (GABAB agonist) significantly reduced caspase activation in descending neurons 2 weeks after a complete SCI. Long-term treatments with GABOB (a GABA analogue) and baclofen significantly promoted axonal regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. These data indicate that GABAergic signalling through GABAB receptors promotes the survival and regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. Finally, we used morpholinos against the gabab1 subunit to specifically knockdown the expression of the GABAB receptor in descending neurons. Long-term morpholino treatments caused a significant inhibition of axonal regeneration, which shows that endogenous GABA promotes axonal regeneration after a complete SCI in lampreys by activating GABAB receptors expressed in descending neurons. These data implicate GABAB receptors in spinal cord regeneration in lampreys and further provide a new target of interest for SCI.",

    "abstract": "In the post-genomics era, exploration of phenotypic adaptation is limited by our ability to experimentally control selection conditions, including multi-variable and dynamic pressure regimes. While automated cell culture systems offer real-time monitoring and fine control over liquid cultures, they are difficult to scale to high-throughput, or require cumbersome redesign to meet diverse experimental requirements. Here we describe eVOLVER, a multipurpose, scalable DIY framework that can be easily configured to conduct a wide variety of growth fitness experiments at scale and cost. We demonstrate eVOLVERs versatility by configuring it for diverse growth and selection experiments that would be otherwise challenging for other systems. We conduct high-throughput evolution of yeast across different population density niches. We perform growth selection on a yeast knockout library under temporally varying temperature regimes. Finally, inspired by large-scale integration in electronics and microfluidics, we develop novel millifluidic multiplexing modules that enable complex fluidic routines including multiplexed media routing, cleaning, vial-to-vial transfers, and automated yeast mating. We propose eVOLVER to be a versatile design framework in which to study, characterize, and evolve biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1(BRCA1) and binding partner BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) form an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase important for DNA damage repair and homologous recombination. In Caenorhabditis elegans BRCA1/BRC-1 and BARD1/BRD-1 orthologs are not essential, but function in DNA damage repair and homologous recombination, as well as in meiosis. In proliferating germ cells and in early meiotic prophase, BRC-1 and BRD-1 are nucleoplasmic, with enrichment at foci that partially overlap with the recombinase RAD-51. In mid-pachytene, BRC-1 and BRD-1 are observed on tracks, before concentrating to the short arms of bivalents, co-localizing with a central region component of the synaptonemal complex. We found that BRD-1 is essential for BRC-1 to associate with chromatin and the synaptonemal complex, but BRC-1 is not required for BRD-1 localization; the complex fails to properly localize in the absence of either meiotic recombination or chromosome synapsis. Inactivation of BRC-1/BRD-1 enhances the embryonic lethality of mutants that perturb chromosome synapsis and crossover recombination, suggesting that BRC-1/BRD-1 plays an important role in monitoring recombination in the context of the synaptonemal complex. We discovered that BRC-1/BRD-1 stabilizes the RAD51 filament when the formation of a crossover-intermediate is disrupted. Further, in the absence of BRC-1/BRD-1 crossover distribution is altered, and under meiotic dysfunction, crossover numbers are perturbed. Together, our studies indicate that BRC-1/BRD-1 localizes to the synaptonemal complex where it serves a checkpoint function to monitor and modulate meiotic recombination.\\n\\nProject SummaryOur genomes are passed down from one generation to the next through the specialized cell division program of meiosis. Meiosis is highly regulated to coordinate both the large scale chromosomal and fine scale DNA events to ensure fidelity. We analyzed the role of the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BARD1 complex in meiosis in the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that BRCA1/BARD1 localizes dynamically to the proteinaeous structure that aligns maternal and paternal chromosomes, where it regulates crossover recombination. Although BRCA1/BARD1 mutants have only subtle meiotic defects, we show that this complex plays a critical role in meiotic recombination when meiosis is perturbed. These results highlight the complexity of ensuring accurate transmission of the genome and uncover the requirement for this conserved complex in meiosis. As women carrying BRCA1 mutations with no indication of cancer have fertility defects, our results provide insight into why BRCA1 mutations impact reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental interest to both biological and social sciences. Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation. The most widely used methods for collecting variant information at the DNA-level include whole genome sequencing, which continues to remain costly, and the more economical solution of array-based techniques, as these are capable of simultaneously genotyping a pre-selected set of variable DNA sites in the human genome. The largest publicly accessible set of human genomic sequence data available today originates from exome sequencing that comprises around 1.2% of the whole genome (approximately 30 million base pairs). In this study, we compared the application of the exome dataset to the array-based dataset and to the gold standard whole genome dataset using the same population genetic analysis methods. Our results draw attention to some of the inherent problems that arise from using pre-selected SNP sets for population genetic analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate that exome sequencing provides a better alternative to the array-based methods for population genetic analysis. In this study, we propose a strategy for unbiased variant collection from exome data and offer a bioinformatics protocol for proper data processing.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition is the capacity to introspectively monitor and control ones own cognitive processes. Previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicated the important role of precuneus in metacognition processing, especially during mnemonic tasks. However, the issue of whether this medial parietal cortex is a domain-specific region that supports mnemonic metacognition remains controversial. Here, we focally disrupted this parietal area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy participants of both sexes, seeking to ascertain its functional necessity for metacognition for memory versus perceptual decisions. Perturbing the precuneal activity impaired the metacognitive efficiency selectively in the memory judgment of temporal-order, but not in perceptual discrimination. Moreover, the correlation in individuals metacognitive efficiency between the domains disappeared when the precuneus was perturbed. Together with the previous finding that lesion to the anterior prefrontal cortex impairs perceptual but not mnemonic metacognition, we double dissociated the macro-anatomical underpinnings for the two kinds of metacognitive capacity in an interconnected network of brain regions.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTheories on the neural basis of metacognition have thus far largely centered on the role of prefrontal cortex. Here we refined the theoretical framework through characterizing a unique precuneal involvement in mnemonic metacognition with a noninvasive but inferentially powerful method: transcranial magnetic stimulation. By quantifying meta-cognitive efficiency across two distinct domains (memory vs. perception) that are matched for stimulus characteristics, we reveal an instrumental - and highly selective - role of the precuneus in mnemonic metacognition. These causal evidence corroborate ample clinical reports that parietal lobe lesions often produce inaccurate self-reports of confidence in memory recollection and establish that the precuneus as a nexus for the introspective ability to evaluate the success of memory judgment in humans.",

The aim of this study was to measure CBF-CBV coupling in different vascular compartments during neural activation. Three haemodynamic parameters were measured during a visual stimulus. Look-Locker Flow-sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery (LL-FAIR) was used to measure changes in CBF and arterial CBV (CBVa) using sequence parameters optimised for each contrast. Changes in total CBV (CBVtot) were measured using a Gadolinium based contrast agent technique. Haemodynamic changes were extracted from a region of interest based on voxels that were activated in the CBF experiments. The CBF-CBVtot coupling constant tot was measured as 0.16{+/-}0.14 and the CBF-CBVa coupling constant a was measured as 0.65{+/-}0.24. Using a two compartment model of the vasculature (arterial and venous), the change in venous CBV (CBVv) was predicted for an assumed value of baseline arterial and venous blood volume.

    "abstract": "Wheat represents a major crop, yet the current rate of yield improvement is insufficient to meet its projected global food demand. Breeding root systems more efficient for water and nitrogen capture represents a promising avenue for accelerating yield gains. Root crown phenotyping, or shovelomics, relies on excavation of the upper portions of root systems in the field and measuring root properties such as numbers, angles, densities and lengths. We report a new shovelomics method that images the whole wheat root crown, then partitions it into the main shoot and tillers for more intensive phenotyping. Root crowns were phenotyped using the new method from the Rialto x Savannah population consisting of both parents and 94 doubled-haploid lines. For the whole root crown, the main shoot, and tillers, root phenes including nodal root number, growth angle, length, and diameter were measured. Substantial variation and heritability were observed for all phenes. Principal component analysis revealed latent constructs that imply pleiotropic genetic control of several related root phenes. Correlational analysis revealed that nodal root number and growth angle correlate among the whole crown, main shoot, and tillers, indicating shared genetic control among those organs. We conclude that this phenomics approach will be useful for breeding ideotype root systems in tillering species.",

To determine if antioxidants can be used to reduce ROS production and coral bleaching, we tested the effects of thermal stress in Aiptasia pallida a model system for coral bleaching studies, and the scleractinian coral, Porites astreoides. We analyzed host ROS levels, symbiont dark-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II, and symbiont loss in the presence or absence of antioxidants. We found that a single dose of the antioxidant catechin, significantly reduced ROS levels in the hosts, mitigated the degradation of the symbionts quantum yield and reduced the loss of symbionts from thermally stressed P. astreoides but not from A. pallida. Taken together, these results support a key role of ROS and that antioxidants can prevent symbiont degradation and loss during thermally-induced bleaching in P. astreoides.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSome mobile genetic elements target the lagging strand template during DNA replication. Bacterial examples are insertion sequences IS608 and ISDra2 (IS200/IS605 family members). They use obligatory single-stranded circular DNA intermediates for excision and insertion and encode a transposase, TnpAIS200, which recognizes subterminal secondary structures at the insertion sequence ends. Similar secondary structures, Repeated Extragenic Palindromes (REP), are present in many bacterial genomes. TnpAIS200-related proteins, TnpAREP, have been identified and could be responsible for REP sequence proliferation. These proteins share a conserved HuH/Tyrosine core domain responsible for catalysis and are involved in processes of ssDNA cleavage and ligation. Our goal is to characterize the diversity of these proteins collectively referred as the TnpAY1 family.\\n\\nResultsA genome-wide analysis of sequences similar to TnpAIS200 and TnpAREP in prokaryotes revealed a large number of family members with a wide taxonomic distribution. These can be arranged into three distinct classes and 12 subclasses based on sequence similarity. One subclass includes sequences similar to TnpAIS200. Proteins from other subclasses are not associated with typical insertion sequence features. These are characterized by specific additional domains possibly involved in protein/DNA or protein/protein interactions. Their genes are found in more than 25% of species analyzed. They exhibit a patchy taxonomic distribution consistent with dissemination by horizontal gene transfers followed by loss. The tnpAREP genes of five subclasses are flanked by typical REP sequences in a REPtron-like arrangement. Four distinct REP types were characterized with a subclass specific distribution. Other subclasses are not associated with REP sequences but have a large conserved domain located in C-terminal end of their sequence. This unexpected diversity suggests that, while most likely involved in processing single-strand DNA, proteins from different subfamilies may play a number of different roles.\\n\\nConclusionsWe established a detailed classification of TnpAY1 proteins, consolidated by the analysis of the conserved core domains and the characterization of additional domains. The data obtained illustrate the unexpected diversity of the TnpAY1 family and provide a strong framework for future evolutionary and functional studies. By their potential function in ssDNA edition, they may confer adaptive responses to host cell physiology and metabolism.",

Here we examine the transcriptional profiles and chromatin accessibility of neural crest cells in the basal sea lamprey, in order to gain insight into the ancestral state of the neural crest gene regulatory network (GRN) at the dawn of vertebrates. Transcriptome analyses reveal clusters of co-regulated genes during neural crest specification and migration that show high conservation across vertebrates for dynamic programmes like Wnt modulation during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, but also reveal novel transcription factors and cell-adhesion molecules not previously implicated in neural crest migration. ATAC-seq analysis refines the location of known cis-regulatory elements at the Hox-2 locus and uncovers novel cis-regulatory elements for Tfap2B and SoxE1. Moreover, cross-species deployment of lamprey elements in zebrafish reveals that the lamprey SoxE1 enhancer activity is deeply conserved, mediating homologous expression in jawed vertebrates. Together, our data provide new insight into the core elements of the GRN that are conserved to the base of the vertebrates, as well as expose elements that are unique to lampreys.",

    "abstract": "Positive natural selection can lead to a decrease in genomic diversity at the selected site and at linked sites, producing a characteristic signature of elevated expected haplotype homozygosity. These selective sweeps can be hard or soft. In the case of a hard selective sweep, a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, whereas multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously in a soft sweep, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the selected site. Measures of expected haplotype homozygosity have previously been used to detect sweeps in multiple study systems. However, these methods are formulated for phased haplotype data, typically unavailable for nonmodel organisms, and may have reduced power to detect soft sweeps due to their increased genetic diversity relative to hard sweeps. To address these limitations, we applied the H12 and H2/H1 statistics of Garud et al. [2015] to unphased multilocus genotypes, denoting them as G12 and G2/G1. G12 (and the more direct expected homozygosity analogue to H12, denoted G123) has comparable power to H12 for detecting both hard and soft sweeps. G2/G1 can be used to classify hard and soft sweeps analogously to H2/H1, conditional on a genomic region having high G12 or G123 values. The reason for this power is that under random mating, the most frequent haplotypes will yield the most frequent multilocus genotypes. Simulations based on parameters compatible with our recent understanding of human demographic history suggest that expected homozygosity methods are best suited for detecting recent sweeps, and increase in power under recent population expansions. Finally, we find candidates for selective sweeps within the 1000 Genomes CEU, YRI, GIH, and CHB populations, which corroborate and complement existing studies.",

    "abstract": "A phylogenetic tree at the species level is still far off for highly diverse insect orders, including the Coleoptera, but the taxonomic breadth of public sequence databases is growing. In addition, new types of data may contribute to increasing taxon coverage, such as metagenomic shotgun sequencing for assembly of mitogenomes from bulk specimen samples. The current study explores the application of these techniques for large-scale efforts to build the tree of Coleoptera. We used shotgun data from 17 different ecological and taxonomic datasets (5 unpublished) to assemble a total of 1942 mitogenome contigs of >3000 bp. These sequences were combined into a single dataset together with all mitochondrial data available at GenBank, in addition to nuclear markers widely used in molecular phylogenetics. The resulting matrix of nearly 16000 species with two or more loci produced trees (RAxML) showing overall congruence with the Linnaean taxonomy at hierarchical levels from suborders to genera. We tested the role of full-length mitogenomes in stabilizing the tree from GenBank data, as mitogenomes might link terminals with non-overlapping gene representation. However, the mitogenome data were only partly useful in this respect, presumably because of the purely automated approach to assembly and gene delimitation, but improvements in future may be possible by using multiple assemblers and manual curation. In conclusion, the combination of data mining and metagenomic sequencing of bulk samples provided the largest phylogenetic tree of Coleoptera to date, which represents a summary of existing phylogenetic knowledge and a defensible tree of great utility, in particular for studies at the intra-familial level, despite some shortcomings for resolving basal nodes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic differences within or between human populations (population structure) has been studied using a variety of approaches over many years. Recently there has been an increasing focus on studying genetic differentiation at fine geographic scales, such as within countries. Identifying such structure allows the study of recent population history, and identifies the potential for confounding in association studies, particularly when testing rare, often recently arisen variants. The Iberian Peninsula is linguistically diverse, has a complex demographic history, and is unique among European regions in having a centuries-long period of Muslim rule. Previous genetic studies of Spain have examined either a small fraction of the genome or only a few Spanish regions. Thus, the overall pattern of fine-scale population structure within Spain remains uncharacterised. Here we analyse genome-wide genotyping array data for 1,413 Spanish individuals sampled from all regions of Spain. We identify extensive fine-scale structure, down to unprecedented scales, smaller than 10 Km in some places. We observe a major axis of genetic differentiation that runs from east to west of the peninsula. In contrast, we observe remarkable genetic similarity in the north-south direction, and evidence of historical north-south population movement. Finally, without making particular prior assumptions about source populations, we show that modern Spanish people have regionally varying fractions of ancestry from a group most similar to modern north Moroccans. The north African ancestry results from an admixture event, which we date to 860 - 1120 CE, corresponding to the early half of Muslim rule. Our results indicate that it is possible to discern clear genetic impacts of the Muslim conquest and population movements associated with the subsequent Reconquista.",
