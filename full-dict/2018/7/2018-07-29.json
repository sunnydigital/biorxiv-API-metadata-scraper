    "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological RelevanceGastrointestinal anthrax, a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, remains an important but relatively neglected endemic disease of animals and humans in remote areas of the Indian subcontinent and some parts of Africa. Its initial symptoms include diarrhea and stomachache. In the current study, several common plants indicated for diarrhea, dysentery, stomachache or as stomachic as per traditional knowledge in the Indian subcontinent, i.e., Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa (Bael), Allium cepa L. (Onion), Allium sativum L. (Garlic), Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem), Berberis asiatica Roxb. ex DC. (Daruharidra), Coriandrum sativum L. (Coriander), Curcuma longa L. (Turmeric), Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (Bermuda grass), Mangifera indica L. (Mango), Morus indica L. (Black mulberry), Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (Ocimum sanctum L., Holy Basil), Ocimum gratissimum L. (Ram Tulsi), Psidium guajava L. (Guava), Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Ginger), were evaluated for their anti-Bacillus anthracis property. The usage of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. and Curcuma longa L. by Santals (India), and Allium sp. by biblical people to alleviate anthrax-like symptoms is well documented, but the usage of other plants is traditionally only indicated for different gastrointestinal disturbances/conditions.\n\nAim of the StudyEvaluate the above listed commonly available edible plants from the Indian subcontinent that are used in the traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases including those also indicated for anthrax-like symptoms for the presence of potent anti-B. anthracis activity in a form amenable to use by the general population in the endemic areas.\n\nMaterials and MethodsAqueous extracts made from fourteen plants indicated above were screened for their anti-B. anthracis activity using agar-well diffusion assay (AWDA) and broth microdilution methods. The Aqueous Garlic Extract (AGE) that displayed most potent anti-B. anthracis activity was assessed for its thermostability, stability under pH extremes encountered in the gastrointestinal tract, and potential antagonistic interaction with bile salts as well as the FDA-approved antibiotics used for anthrax control. The bioactive fractions from the AGE were isolated by TLC coupled bioautography followed by their characterization using GC-MS.\n\nResultsGarlic (Allium sativum L.) extract was identified as the most promising candidate with bactericidal activity against B. anthracis. It consistently inhibited the growth of B. anthracis in AWDA and decreased the viable colony-forming unit counts in liquid-broth cultures by 6-logs within 6-12 h. The AGE displayed acceptable thermostability (>80% anti-B. anthracis activity retained on incubation at 50{degrees}C for 12 h) and stability in gastric pH range (2-8). It did not antagonize the activity of FDA-approved antibiotics used for anthrax control. GC-MS analysis of the TLC separated bioactive fractions of AGE indicated the presence of previously unreported constituents such as phthalic acid derivatives, acid esters, phenyl group-containing compounds, steroids etc.\n\nConclusionThe Aqueous Garlic Extract (AGE) displayed potent anti-B. anthracis activity. It was better than that displayed by Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem) and Mangifera indica L. while Curcuma longa L. (Turmeric) did not show any activity under the assay conditions used. Further work should be undertaken to explore the possible application of AGE in preventing anthrax incidences in endemic areas.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/162214v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@682faaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114d64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efe980org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1caea0f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this study, we identified genetic mutations in the CNTNAP3 gene from Chinese Han ASD cohorts and Simons Simplex Collections. We found that CNTNAP3 interacted with synaptic adhesion proteins Neuroligin1 and Neuroligin2, as well as scaffolding proteins PSD95 and Gephyrin. Significantly, we found that CNTNAP3 played an opposite role in controlling the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in vitro and in vivo, in which ASD mutants exhibited loss-of-function effects. In this study, we showed that Cntnap3-null mice exhibited deficits in social interaction, spatial learning and prominent repetitive behaviors. These evidences elucidate the pivotal role of CNTNAP3 in synapse development and social behaviors, providing the mechanistic insights for ASD.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic activity associated to neuron cell-death instead of cell-division is reported in neurodegenerative diseases. However, why mitotic activity can take place in supposedly postmitotic neurons and how it is associated to cell-death remains largely unexplained. To address these questions, we have studied the response of primary neurons to oncogenic deregulation using a fusion protein based on truncated Cyclin E and Cdk2. Oncogenic Cyclin E/Cdk2 elicits mitotic checkpoint signaling, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and cell-death. However, as in mitotic cells, checkpoint suppression enables oncogenic cell-cycle progression and neuronal division. Further, neurons actively adapt to the cell-cycle by losing and reforming the axon initial segment, which integrates synaptic inputs to sustain action potentials. We conclude that neurons are mitotic cells in a reversible quiescent-like state, which is falsely portrayed as irreversible by mitotic checkpoints. In extension, neuronal death in lieu of cell-division reflects oncosuppressive checkpoint signaling.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract. Because of the high frequency of antibiotic resistance among Enterococcus clinical isolates, interest in using phage to treat enterococcal infections and to decolonize high-risk patients for antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus is rising. Bacteria can evolve phage resistance, but there is little published information on these mechanisms in E. faecalis. In this report, we identified genetic determinants of E. faecalis resistance to {phi}NPV1. We found that loss-of-function mutations in epaR confer {phi}NPV1 resistance by blocking phage adsorption. We attribute the inability of the phage to adsorb to the modification or loss of an extracellular polymer in strains with inactivated epaR. Phage-resistant epaR mutants exhibited increased daptomycin and osmotic stress susceptibilities. Our results demonstrate that in vitro spontaneous resistance to {phi}NPV1 comes at a cost in E. faecalis OG1RF.",

    "abstract": "Genome reduction is pervasive among maternally-inherited bacterial endosymbionts. This genome reduction can eventually lead to serious deterioration of essential metabolic pathways, thus rendering an obligate endosymbiont unable to provide essential nutrients to its host. This loss of essential pathways can lead to either symbiont complementation (sharing of the nutrient production with a novel co-obligate symbiont) or symbiont replacement (complete takeover of nutrient production by the novel symbiont). However, the process by which these two evolutionary events happen remains somewhat enigmatic by the lack of examples of intermediate stages of this process. Cinara aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) typically harbour two obligate bacterial symbionts: Buchnera and Serratia symbiotica. However, the latter has been replaced by different bacterial taxa in specific lineages, and thus species within this aphid lineage could provide important clues into the process of symbiont replacement. In the present study, using 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we determined that the aphid Cinara strobi harbours not two, but three fixed bacterial symbionts: Buchnera aphidicola, a Sodalis sp., and S. symbiotica. Through genome assembly and genome-based metabolic inference, we have found that only the first two symbionts (Buchnera and Sodalis) actually contribute to the hosts supply of essential nutrients while S. symbiotica has become unable to contribute towards this task. We found that S. symbiotica has a rather large and highly eroded genome which codes only for a few proteins and displays extensive pseudogenisation. Thus, we propose an ongoing symbiont replacement within C. strobi, in which a once   competent\\\" S. symbiotica does no longer contribute towards the beneficial association. These results suggest that in dual symbiotic systems, when a substitute co-symbiont is available, genome deterioration can precede genome reduction and a symbiont can be maintained despite the apparent lack of benefit to its host.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the movement patterns of animals across different spatio-temporal scales, conditions, habitats and contexts is becoming increasingly important for addressing a series of questions in animal behaviour studies, such as mapping migration routes, evaluating resource use, modelling epidemic spreading in a population, developing strategies for animal conservation as well as understanding several emerging patterns related to feeding, growth and reproduction. In recent times, information theory has been successfully applied in several fields of science, in particular for understanding the dynamics of complex systems and characterizing adaptive social systems, such as dynamics of entities as individuals and as part of groups.\n\nIn this paper, we describe a series of non-parametric information-theoretic measures that can be used to derive new insights about animal behaviour with a specific focus on movement patterns, namely Shannon entropy, Mutual information, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, we believe that the metrics presented in this paper can be used to formulate new hypotheses that can be verified potentially through a set of different observations and be complementary to existing techniques. We show how these measures can be used to characterize the movement patterns of several animals across different habitats and scales. Specifically, we show the effectiveness in using Shannon entropy to characterize the movement of sheep with Batten disease, mutual information to measure association in pigeons, Kullback-Leibler divergence to study the flights of Turkey vulture, and Kolmogorov complexity to find similarities in the movement patterns of animals across different scales and habitats. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and we outline the challenges in this research area.",

    "abstract": "Voltage sensing domains (VSDs) couple changes in transmembrane electrical potential to conformational changes that regulate ion conductance through a central channel. Positively charged amino acids inside each sensor cooperatively respond to changes in voltage. Our previous structure of a TPC1 channel captured the first example of a resting-state VSD in an intact ion channel. To generate an activated state VSD in the same channel we removed the luminal inhibitory Ca2+-binding site (Cai2+), that shifts voltage-dependent opening to more negative voltage and activation at 0 mV. Cryo-EM reveals two coexisting structures of the VSD, an intermediate state 1 that partially closes access to the cytoplasmic side, but remains occluded on the luminal side and an intermediate activated state 2 in which the cytoplasmic solvent access to the gating charges closes, while luminal access partially opens. Activation can be thought of as moving a hydrophobic insulating region of the VSD from the external side, to an alternate grouping on the internal side. This effectively moves the gating charges from the inside potential to that of the outside. Activation also requires binding of Ca2+ to a cytoplasmic site (Caa2+). An X-ray structure with Caa2+ removed and a near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure with Cai2+ removed define how dramatic conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains may communicate with the VSD during activation. Together four structures provide a basis for understanding the voltage dependent transition from resting to activated state, the tuning of VSD by thermodynamic stability, and this channels requirement of cytoplasmic Ca2+-ions for activation.",

    "abstract": "Apoptotic cell death of Dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for immune homeostasis. Although intrinsic mechanisms controlling DC death have not been fully characterized up to now, experimentally enforced inhibition of DC-death causes various autoimmune diseases in model systems. We have generated mice deficient for Protein Phosphatase with EF-Hands 2 (Ppef2), which is selectively expressed in CD8+ DCs, but not in other related DC subtypes such as tissue CD103+ DCs. Ppef2 is down-regulated rapidly upon maturation of DCs by toll-like receptor stimuli, but not upon triggering of CD40. Ppef2-deficient CD8+ DCs accumulate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim) and show increased apoptosis and reduced competitve repopulation capacities. Furthermore, Ppef2-/-CD8+ DCs have strongly diminished antigen presentation capacities in vivo, as CD8+ T cells primed by Ppef2-/- CD8+ DCs undergo reduced expansion. In conclusion, our data suggests that Ppef2 is crucial to support survival of immature CD8+ DCs, while Ppef2 down-regulation during DC-maturation limits T cell responses.",

However, we have only a limited understanding of the assembly mechanisms involved. A game-theoretical concept from economics, screening, potentially explains how a host selectively recruits mutualistic microbes from the environment by fomenting and biasing competition among potential symbionts in such a way that the more likely winners are antibiotic producers. The cuticular microbiomes of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants inspired one of the first applications of screening theory, and here we simulate this system in vitro to test screening. On agar infused with antibacterial metabolites from Acromyrmexs vertically transmitted Pseudonocardia bacteria, we show that antibiotic-producing Streptomyces bacteria exhibit higher growth rates than do non-antibiotic-producer strains and are more likely to win in direct competition. Our results demonstrate how game-theoretical concepts can provide powerful insight into host-microbiome coevolution.",

    "abstract": "Much of what is known about the timing of visual processing in the brain is inferred from intracranial studies in monkeys, with human data limited to mainly non-invasive methods with lower spatial resolution. Here, we estimated visual onset latencies from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in a patient who was implanted with 112 sub-dural electrodes, distributed across the posterior cortex of the right hemisphere, for pre-surgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. Functional MRI prior to surgery was used to determine boundaries of visual areas. The patient was presented with images of objects from several categories. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) were calculated across all categories excluding targets, and statistically reliable onset latencies were determined using a bootstrapping procedure over the single trial baseline activity in individual electrodes. The distribution of onset latencies broadly reflected the known hierarchy of visual areas, with the earliest cortical responses in primary visual cortex, and higher areas showing later responses. A clear exception to this pattern was robust, statistically reliable and spatially localized, very early responses on the bank of the posterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS). The response in the IPS started nearly simultaneously with responses detected in peristriate visual areas, around 60 milliseconds post-stimulus onset. Our results support the notion of early visual processing in the posterior parietal lobe, not respecting traditional hierarchies, and give direct evidence for the upper limit of onset times of visual responses across the human cortex.",

The extant literature diverges in its characterisation of functional network development, with little agreement between haemodynamic- and electrophysiology-based measures. In children aged from 4 to 12 years, as well as adults, age appropriate magnetoencephalography was used to estimate unbiased network topology, using minimum spanning tree (MST) constructed from phase synchrony between beamformer-reconstructed time-series. During childhood, network topology becomes increasingly segregated, while cortical regions decrease in centrality. We propose a heuristic MST model, in which a clear developmental trajectory for the emergence of complex brain networks is delineated. Our results resolve topological reorganisation of functional networks across temporal and special scales in youth and fill a gap in the literature regarding neurophysiological mechanisms of functional brain maturation during the preschool years.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive cancers often have activating mutations in growth-controlling oncogenes and inactivating mutations in tumor-suppressor genes. In neuroblastoma, amplification of the MYCN oncogene and inactivation of the ATRX tumor-suppressor gene correlate with high-risk disease and poor prognosis. Here we show that ATRX mutations and MYCN amplification are mutually exclusive across all ages and stages in neuroblastoma. Using human cell lines and mouse models, we found that elevated MYCN expression and ATRX mutations are incompatible. Elevated MYCN levels promote metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive-oxygen species generation, and DNA-replicative stress. The combination of replicative stress caused by defects in the ATRX-histone chaperone complex and that induced by MYCN-mediated metabolic reprogramming leads to synthetic lethality. Therefore, ATRX and MYCN represent an unusual example, where inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene and activation of an oncogene are incompatible. This synthetic lethality may eventually be exploited to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "The nuclei of rod photoreceptors in mice and other nocturnal species have an unusual inverted chromatin structure: the heterochromatin is centrally located to help focus light and improve photosensitivity. To better understand this unique nuclear organization, we performed ultra-deep Hi-C analysis on murine retina at 3 stages of development and on purified rod photoreceptors. Predicted looping interactions from the Hi-C data were validated with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We discovered that a subset of retinal genes that are important for retinal development, cancer, and stress response are localized to the facultative heterochromatin domain. We also used machine learning to develop an algorithm based on our chromatin Hidden Markov Modeling (chromHMM) of retinal development to predict heterochromatin domains and study their dynamics during retinogenesis. FISH data for 264 genomic loci were used to train and validate the algorithm. The integrated data were then used to identify a developmental stage- and cell type-specific core regulatory circuit super-enhancer (CRC-SE) upstream of the Vsx2 gene, which is required for bipolar neuron expression. Deletion of the Vsx2 CRC-SE in mice led to the loss of bipolar neurons in the retina.",

The unsupervised nature of these methods makes it difficult to evaluate their performance. We present MOVIE, Multi-Omics Visualization of Estimated contributions, as a framework for evaluating the degree of overfitting and the stability of unsupervised multi-omics methods. MOVIE plots the contributions of one data type against another to produce contribution plots, where contributions are calculated for each subject and each data type from the results of each multi-omics method. The usefulness of MOVIE is demonstrated by applying existing multi-omics methods to permuted null data and breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Contribution plots indicated that principal components-based Canonical Correlation Analysis overfit null data, while Sparse multiple Canonical Correlation Analysis and Multi-Omics Factor Analysis provided stable results with high specificity for both the real and permuted null datasets.\\n\\nAvailabilityMOVIE is available as an R package at https://github.com/mccabes292/movie\\n\\nContactmilove@email.unc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Mutations that alter signaling of RAS/MAPK-family proteins give rise to a group of Mendelian diseases known as RASopathies, but the matrix of genotype-phenotype relationships is still incomplete, in part because there are many RAS-related proteins, and in part because the phenotypic consequences may be variable and/or pleiotropic. Here, we describe a cohort of ten cases, drawn from six clinical sites and over 16,000 sequenced probands, with de novo protein-altering variation in RALA, a RAS-like small GTPase. All probands present with speech and motor delays, and most have intellectual disability, low weight, short stature, and facial dysmorphism. The observed rate of de novo RALA variants in affected probands is significantly higher (p=4.93 x 10-11) than expected from the estimated mutation rate. Further, all de novo variants described here affect conserved residues within the GTP/GDP-binding region of RALA; in fact, six alleles arose at only two codons, Val25 and Lys128. We directly assayed GTP hydrolysis and RALA effector-protein binding, and all but one tested variant significantly reduced both activities. The one exception, S157A, reduced GTP hydrolysis but significantly increased RALA-effector binding, an observation similar to that seen for oncogenic RAS variants. These results show the power of data sharing for the interpretation and analysis of rare variation, expand the spectrum of molecular causes of developmental disability to include RALA, and provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of human disease caused by mutations in small GTPases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhile many causes of developmental disabilities have been identified, a large number of affected children cannot be diagnosed despite extensive medical testing. Previously unknown genetic factors are likely to be the culprits in many of these cases. Using DNA sequencing, and by sharing information among many doctors and researchers, we have identified a set of individuals with developmental problems who all have changes to the same gene, RALA. The affected individuals all have similar symptoms, including intellectual disability, speech delay (or no speech), and problems with motor skills like walking. In nearly all of these cases (10 of 11), the genetic change found in the child was not inherited from either parent. The locations and biological properties of these changes suggest that they are likely to disrupt the normal functions of RALA and cause significant health problems. We also performed experiments to show that the genetic changes found in these individuals alter two key functions of RALA. Together, we have provided evidence that genetic changes in RALA can cause DD/ID. These results will allow doctors and researchers to identify additional children with the same condition, providing a clinical diagnosis to these families and leading to new research opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Perylenequinones are a family of structurally related polyketide fungal toxins with nearly universal toxicity. These photosensitizing compounds absorb light energy which enables them to generate reactive oxygen species that damage host cells. This potent mechanism serves as an effective weapon for plant pathogens in disease establishment. The sugar beet pathogen Cercospora beticola secretes the perylenequinone cercosporin during infection. We have shown recently that the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis (CTB) gene cluster is present in several other phytopathogenic fungi, prompting the search for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of structurally similar perylenequinones in other fungi. Here, we report the identification of the elsinochrome and phleichrome BGCs of Elsino[e] fawcettii and Cladosporium phlei, respectively, based on gene cluster conservation with the CTB and hypocrellin BGCs. Furthermore, we show that previously reported BGCs for elsinochrome and phleichrome are involved in melanin production. Phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding melanin polyketide synthases (PKSs) and alignment of melanin BGCs revealed high conservation between the established and newly identified C. beticola, E. fawcettii, and C. phlei melanin BGCs. Mutagenesis of the identified perylenequinone and melanin PKSs in C. beticola and E. fawcettii coupled with mass spectrometric metabolite analyses confirmed their roles in toxin and melanin production.\\n\\nOriginality and significance statementGenes involved in secondary metabolite (SM) production are often clustered together to form biosynthetic pathways. These pathways frequently have highly conserved keystone enzymes which can complicate allocation of a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) to the cognate SM. In our study, we utilized a combination of comparative genomics, phylogenetic analyses and biochemical approaches to reliably identify BGCs for perylenequinone toxins and DHN-melanin in multiple plant pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, we show that earlier studies that aimed to identify these perylenequinone pathways were misdirected and actually reported DHN-melanin biosynthetic pathways. Our study outlines a reliable approach to successfully identify fungal SM pathways.",

    "abstract": "Arabinose-containing poly-or oligosaccharides are suitable carbohydrate sources for Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, though their degradation pathways are poorly understood. In this study, we found that the gene expression levels of bllj 1852 and bllj 1853 from B. longum subsp. longum JCM 1217 were enhanced in the presence of arabinan. Both genes encode previously uncharacterized glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 43 enzymes. Subsequently, we cloned those genes and characterized the recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli. Both enzymes exhibited -L-arabinofuranosidase activity toward synthetic p-nitrophenyl glycoside, but the specificities for L-arabinofuranosyl linkages were different. BLLJ_1852 catalyzed the hydrolysis of 1,2- and 1,3-L-arabinofuranosyl linkages found in the side chains of arabinan and arabinoxylan. BLLJ_1852 released L-arabinose 100 times faster from arabinan than from arabinoxylan but did not act on arabinogalactan. BLLJ_1853 catalyzed the hydrolysis of 1,5-L-arabinofuranosyl linkages found on the arabinan backbone. BLLJ_1853 released L-arabinose from arabinan but not from arabinoxylan or arabinogalactan. Both enzyme activities were largely suppressed with EDTA treatment, suggesting that they require divalent metal ions. BLLJ_1852 was moderately activated in the presence of all divalent cations tested, whereas BLLJ_1853 activity was inhibited by Cu2+. The GH43 domains of BLLJ_1852 and BLLJ_1853 are classified into GH43 subfamilies 27 and 22, respectively, but hardly share similarity with other biochemically characterized members in the corresponding subfamilies.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWe identified two novel -L-arabinofuranosidases from B. longum subsp. longum JCM 1217 that act on different linkages in arabinan. These enzymes may be required for efficient degradation and assimilation of arabinan in the probiotic bifidobacteria. The genes encoding these enzymes are located side-by-side in a gene cluster involved in metabolic pathways for plant-derived polysaccharides, which may confer adaptability in adult intestines.",

    "abstract": "While lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) represent a valuable resource for population genetic studies, they are usually regarded as difficult for CRISPR-mediated genomic editing. It would be valuable to be able to take the results of their functional variant studies and test them in the same LCLs. We describe a protocol using a single-stranded donor oligonucleotide (ssODN) strategy for  scarless editing in LCLs. The protocol involves optimized transfection, flow cytometric sorting of transfected cells to single cells in multi-well plates and growth in conditioned, serum-rich medium, followed by characterization of the clones. Amplicon sequencing reveals the relative proportions of alleles with different editing events, with sequencing of DNA from clones showing the frequencies of events in individual cells. We find 12/60 (20%) of clones selected in this manner to have the desired ssODN-mediated recombination event. Long-range PCR of DNA at the edited locus and of RT-PCR products for the gene traversing the edited locus reveals 3/6 characterized clones (50%) to have large structural mutations of the region that are missed by sequencing just the edited site. The protocol does not require the use of lentiviruses or stable transfection, and makes LCLs a realistic cell type for consideration for CRISPR-mediated genomic targeting.",

One branch that is highly underrepresented is the candidate phylum TM6, also known as the Dependentiae. Their biology is known only from reduced genomes recovered from metagenomes around the world and two isolates infecting amoebae, all suggest that they live highly host-associated lifestyles as parasites or symbionts. Chromulinavorax destructans is an isolate from the TM6/Dependentiae that infects and lyses the abundant heterotrophic flagellate, Spumella elongata. Chromulinavorax destructans is characterized by a high degree of reduction and specialization for infection, so much so it was discovered in a screen for giant viruses. Its 1.2 Mb genome shows no metabolic potential and C. destructans instead relies on extensive transporter system to import nutrients, and even energy in the form of ATP from the host. Accordingly, it replicates in a viral-like fashion, while extensively reorganizing and expanding the host mitochondrion. 44% of proteins contain signal sequences for secretion, which includes many proteins of unknown function as well as 98 copies of ankyrin-repeat domain proteins, known effectors of host modulation, suggesting the presence of an extensive host-manipulation apparatus.",

Supplementation of a popular NHS-ester cross-linker, DSS, with 2 reagents shorter or longer by CH2-CH2, increased the number of non-reductant cross-links by ~50%. Molecular dynamics simulations of these cross-linkers revealed 3 individual, partially overlapping ranges of motion, consistent with partially overlapping sets of cross-links formed by each reagent.

    "abstract": "Impulse control, an emergent function modulated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), helps to dampen risky behaviors during adolescence. Influences on PFC maturation during this period may contribute to variations in impulse control. Availability of omega-3 fatty acids, an essential dietary nutrient integral to neuronal structure and function, may be one such influence. This study examined whether intake of energy-adjusted long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) was related to variation in impulse control and PFC activity during performance of an inhibitory task in adolescents (n= 87; 51.7% female, mean age 13.3+1.1 years) enrolled in a longitudinal neuroimaging study. Intake of DHA+EPA was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and adjusted for total energy intake. Inhibitory control was assessed using caregiver rating scale (BRIEF Inhibit subscale) and task performance (false alarm rate) on a Go/No-Go task performed during functional MRI. Reported intake of long-chain omega-3 was positively associated with caregiver ratings of adolescent ability to control impulses (p=0.017) and there was a trend for an association between intake and task-based impulse control (p=0.072). Furthermore, a regression of BOLD response within PFC during successful impulse control (Correct No-Go versus Incorrect NoGo) with energy-adjusted DHA+EPA intake revealed that adolescents reporting lower intakes display greater activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate, potentially suggestive of a possible lag in cortical development. The present results suggest that dietary omega-3 fatty acids are related to development of both impulse control and function of the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus in normative adolescent development. Insufficiency of dietary omega-3 fatty acids during this developmental period may be a factor which hinders development of behavioral control.",

Global analysis of our data reveals that pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated transcripts are upregulated after compatible pollination. From our analysis, we predicted the activation of the Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 3 on the female side after compatible pollination, which we confirmed through expression and mutant analysis. Our work defines the molecular signatures of compatible and incompatible pollination, highlights the active status of incompatible stigmas, and unravels a new MPK3-dependent cell wall feature associated with stigma-pollen interaction.",

Comparisons across species show that, in spite of changes in the underlying regulatory DNA sequence, developmental programs can be maintained across millions of years of evolution. Reciprocally, changes in gene expression can be used to generate morphological novelty. Distinguishing between changes in regulatory DNA that lead to changes in gene expression and those that do not is therefore a central goal of evolutionary developmental biology. Quantitative, spatially-resolved measurements of developmental gene expression patterns play a crucial role in this goal, enabling the detection of subtle phenotypic differences between species and the development of computations models that link the sequence of regulatory DNA to expression patterns. Here we report the generation of two atlases of cellular resolution gene expression measurements for the primary anterior-posterior patterning genes in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila virilis. By combining these data sets with existing atlases for three other Drosophila species, we detect subtle differences in the gene expression patterns and dynamics driving the highly conserved axis patterning system and delineate inter-species differences in the embryonic morphology.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPathway figures are commonly found in the biomedical literature providing intuitive models of complex processes in a visually concise format. The contents of a pathway figure often reflect the key findings and relevant context of an article. Unfortunately, the vast majority of pathway figures are drawn as one-off static images despite freely available pathway tools and resources, thus rendering their contents inaccessible to search, data mining and downstream analysis.\\n\\nAPPROACHLeveraging advances in optical character recognition and domain expertise in pathway modeling, we devised an approach to identify genes in published pathway figures. The approach was optimized against a set of figure images obtained from PubMed Central and tested against a set of 400 curated pathways with known content from WikiPathways (F-measure 95.2%).\\n\\nRESULTSApplied to 3982 published pathway figures spanning a four year period, our approach identified 29,189 gene symbols representing 4159 unique gene identifiers. The gene content unlocked from just this small sample of published figures includes novel and diverse pathway associations unmatched by any pathway database. Our approach over doubled the number of genes associated with the articles containing these figures as compared to combined annotations available from PubMed and PubTator. Encouraged by these initial results, we plan to scale the approach to make the molecular contents of the continuing stream of published pathway figures more accessible.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of prospective cancer treatments is routinely estimated by in vitro cell-line proliferation screens. However, it is unclear whether tumor aggressiveness and patient survival are influenced more by the proliferative or the migratory properties of cancer cells. To address this question, we experimentally measured proliferation and migration phenotypes across more than 40 breast cancer cell-lines. Based on the latter, we built and validated individual predictors of breast cancer proliferation and migration levels from the cells transcriptomics. We then apply these predictors to estimate the proliferation and migration levels of more than 1000 TCGA breast cancer tumors. Reassuringly, both estimates increase with tumors aggressiveness, as qualified by its stage, grade, and subtype. However, predicted tumor migration levels are significantly more strongly associated with patient survival than the proliferation levels. We confirm these finding by conducting siRNA knock-down experiments on the highly migratory MDA-MB-231 cell lines and deriving gene knock-down based proliferation and migration signatures. We show that cytoskeletal drugs might be more beneficial in patients with high predicted migration levels. Taken together, these results testify to the importance of migration levels in determining patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Early work in germ-free rodents highlighted the gut microbiotas importance in metabolic disease, including Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin secreted by enteroendocrine L-cells lining the gastrointestinal epithelium. GLP-1 has important functions including promoting insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and {beta}-cell mass, while inhibiting gastric emptying and appetite. We set out to elucidate how the microbiota can modulate GLP-1 secretion, with the goal to identify microbial strains with GLP-1 stimulatory activity as a metabolic disease therapeutic. Over 1500 human-derived strains were isolated from fecal, breast milk, and colon and intestinal biopsy samples from healthy individuals. In vitro screening for GLP-1 modulation was performed by incubating bacterial cell-free supernatants with NCI H716 human L-cells. Approximately 45 strains capable of increasing GLP-1 levels, measured by ELISA, were discovered. Interestingly, all positive strains were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis by 16S rRNA sequencing. Non-GLP-1 stimulatory S. epidermidis strains were also identified. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a 3 kDa peptide, termed GLP-1 stimulating peptide (GspA), present in GLP-1 positive but absent in GLP-1 neutral S. epidermidis. Studies in human L-cells and intestinal enteroids demonstrated that GspA alone is sufficient to enhance GLP-1 secretion. When administered in high-fat-fed mice, GspA-producing S. epidermidis significantly reduced markers associated with obesity and T2DM, including adiposity and hyperinsulinemia. Further characterization of GspA suggests a GLP-1 stimulatory action via calcium signaling. The presented results identify a novel host-microbe interaction which may ultimately lead to the development of a microbial peptide-based therapeutic for obesity and T2DM.\\n\\nImportanceThe human gastrointestinal microbiota has been shown to modulate metabolic disease, including Type II Diabetes Mellitus and obesity, through mechanisms involving gut hormone secretion. We initiated this study to identify bacterial strains that can stimulate one of these hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1. We first identified that some strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis have such stimulatory activity. We then found that these strains could be used in a mouse model of high-fat feeding to reduce markers associated with metabolic disease, including adiposity and elevated insulin levels. We also identified the peptide from S. epidermidis that stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 and propose a mode of action through calcium signaling. This newly identified microbial-derived peptide and host-microbe interaction provide a promising therapeutic approach against Type II Diabetes Mellitus and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, and joint injury increases the risk of OA by 10-fold. Although the injury event itself damages joint tissues, a substantial amount of secondary damage is mediated by the cellular responses to the injury. Cellular responses include the production and activation of proteases (MMPs, ADAMTSs, Cathepsins), the production of inflammatory cytokines, and we hypothesize, changes to the joint metabolome. The trajectory of cellular responses is driven by the transcriptional activation of early response genes, which requires Cdk9-dependent RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation. Flavopiridol is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cdk9 kinase activity, which prevents the transcriptional activation of early response genes. To model post-traumatic osteoarthritis, we subjected mice to non-invasive ACL-rupture joint injury. Following injury, mice were treated with flavopiridol to inhibit Cdk9-dependent transcriptional activation, or vehicle control. Global joint metabolomics were analyzed 1 hour after injury. We found that injury induced metabolomic changes, including increases in Vitamin D3 metabolism and others. Importantly, we found that inhibition of primary response gene activation at the time of injury largely prevented the global changes in the metabolomics profiles. Cluster analysis of joint metabolomes identified groups of injury-induced and drug-responsive metabolites, which may offer novel targets for cell-mediated secondary joint damage. Metabolomic profiling provides an instantaneous snapshot of biochemical activity representing cellular responses, and these data demonstrate the potential for inhibition of early response genes to alter the trajectory of cell-mediated degenerative changes following joint injury.\\n\\nSignificance StatementJoint injury is an excellent predictor of future osteoarthritis. It is increasingly apparent that the acute cellular responses to injury contribute to the initiation and pathogenesis of OA. Although changes to the joint transcriptome have been extensively studied in the context of joint injury, little is known about changes to small-molecule metabolites. Here we use a non-invasive ACL rupture model of joint injury in mice to identify injury-induced changes to the global metabolomic profiles. In one experimental group we prevented the activation of primary response gene transcription using the Cdk9 inhibitor flavopiridol. Through this comparison, we identified two sets of metabolites that change acutely after joint injury: those that require transcription of primary response genes, and those that do not.",

While some transgenic events showed simple insertions, others showed extreme genome damage in the form of chromosome truncations, large deletions, partial trisomy, and evidence of chromothripsis and breakage-fusion bridge cycling. Several transgenic events contained megabase-scale arrays of introduced DNA mixed with genomic fragments assembled by non-homologous or microhomology-mediated joining. Damaged regions of the genome, assayed by the presence of small fragments displaced elsewhere, were often repaired without a trace, presumably by homology-dependent repair (HDR). The results suggest a model whereby successful biolistic transformation relies on a combination of end joining to insert foreign DNA and HDR to repair collateral damage caused by the microprojectiles. The differing levels of genome damage observed among transgenic events may reflect the stage of the cell cycle and the availability of templates for HDR.",

Practically, given a seed structural alignment, we identify structural motifs with a hierarchical structure, characterized by three unique properties. First, the hierarchical structure sheds light on the trade-off between size and flexibility. Second, motifs can be combined to perform an overall comparison of the input structures in terms of combined RMSD - an improvement over the classical least RMSD. Third, motifs can be used to seed iterative aligners, and to design hybrid sequence-structure profile HMM characterizing protein families.\\n\\nFrom the methods standpoint, our framework is reminiscent from the bootstrap and combines concepts from rigidity analysis (distance difference matrices), graph theory, computational geometry (space filling diagrams), and topology (topological persistence).\\n\\nOn challenging cases (class II fusion proteins, flexible molecules) we illustrate the ability of our tools to localize conformational changes, shedding light of commonalities of structures which would otherwise appear as radically different.\\n\\nOur tools are available within the Structural Bioinformatics Library (http://sbl.inria.fr).

Demographic stochasticity makes community and population compositions inherently unstable under these models, with overall levels of diversity being maintained by random processes. This is in contrast with niche and adaptive theories which emphasize differences between species or genotypes as the key to their coexistence3. Here we show that non-heritable variation in individual fitness within species or genotypes can stabilize coexistence without evoking niche differentiation. We construct two classes of mathematical models based on experimental evidence: (1) bacterial growth with variation in cell longevity4,5; and (2) microbial transmission in a host population with variation in host susceptibility6-11. We find stable coexistence of 2 bacterial species in the first model under a single oscillating resource, and 3 or more in the second with independent distributions of host susceptibility to the various microbial species. We discuss the implications of these findings for the interpretation of common measures of relative fitness and for the maintenance of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of ancestral scenarios is widely used to study the evolution of characters along a phylogenetic tree. In the likelihood framework one commonly uses the marginal posterior probabilities of the character states, and the joint reconstruction of the most likely scenario. Both approaches are somewhat unsatisfactory. Marginal reconstructions provide users with state probabilities, but these are difficult to interpret and visualize, while joint reconstructions select a unique state for every tree node and thus do not reflect the uncertainty of inferences.\\n\\nWe propose a simple and fast approach, which is in between these two extremes. We use decision-theory concepts and the Brier criterion to associate each node in the tree to a set of likely states. A unique state is predicted in the tree regions with low uncertainty, while several states are predicted in the uncertain regions, typically around the tree root. To visualize the results, we cluster the neighboring nodes associated to the same states and use graph visualization tools. The method is implemented in the PastML program and web server.\\n\\nThe results on simulated data consistently show the accuracy and robustness of the approach. The method is applied to large tree comprising 3,619 sequences from HIV-1M subtype C sampled worldwide, which is processed in a few minutes. Results are very convincing: we retrieve and visualize the main transmission routes of HIV-1C; we demonstrate that drug resistance mutations mostly emerge independently under treatment pressure, but some resistance clusters are found, corresponding to transmissions among untreated patients.",

    "abstract": "We study how a block of genome with a large number of weakly selected loci introgresses under directional selection into a genetically homogeneous population. We derive exact expressions for the expected rate of growth of any fragment of the introduced block during the initial phase of introgression, and show that the growth rate of a single-locus variant is largely insensitive to its own additive effect, but depends instead on the combined effect of all loci within a characteristic linkage scale. The expected growth rate of a fragment is highly correlated with its long-term introgression probability in populations of moderate size, and can hence identify variants that are likely to introgress across replicate populations. We clarify how the introgression probability of an individual variant is determined by the interplay between hitchhiking with relatively large fragments during the early phase of introgression, and selection on fine scale variation within these, which at longer times results in differential introgression probabilities for beneficial and deleterious loci within successful fragments. By simulating individuals, we also investigate how introgression probabilities at individual loci depend on the variance of fitness effects, the net fitness of the introduced block, and the size of the recipient population, and how this shapes the net advance under selection. Our work suggests that even highly replicable substitutions may be associated with a range of selective effects, which makes it challenging to fine map the causal loci that underlie polygenic adaptation.",

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing is a popular next-generation sequencing technique for assaying genome-wide gene expression profiles. Nonetheless, it is susceptible to biases that are introduced by sample handling prior gene expression measurements. Two of the most common methods for preserving samples in both field-based and laboratory conditions are submersion in RNAlater and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen can be impractical, particularly for field collections. RNAlater is a solution for stabilizing tissue for longer-term storage as it rapidly permeates tissue to protect cellular RNA. In this study, we assessed genome-wide expression patterns in 30 day old fry collected from the same brood at the same time point that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80{degrees}C or submerged and stored in RNAlater at room temperature, simulating conditions of fieldwork. We show that sample storage is a significant factor influencing observed differential gene expression. In particular, genes with elevated GC content exhibit higher observed expression levels in liquid nitrogen flash-freezing relative to RNAlater-storage. Further, genes with higher expression in RNAlater relative to liquid nitrogen experience disproportionate enrichment for functional categories, many of which are involved in RNA processing. This suggests that RNAlater may elicit a physiological response that has the potential to bias biological interpretations of expression studies. The biases introduced to observed gene expression arising from mimicking many field-based studies are substantial and should not be ignored.",

NDI is associated with loss of expression of the molecular water channel, aquaporin-2, in the renal collecting duct (CD). Here, we use the methods of systems biology in a well-established rat model of lithium-induced NDI to identify signaling pathways activated at the onset of polyuria. Using single-tubule RNA-Seq, full transcriptomes were determined in microdissected cortical CDs of rats 72 hrs after initiation of lithium chloride (LiCl) administration (vs. time-controls without LiCl). Transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA abundances were mapped to gene sets associated with curated canonical signaling pathways, showing evidence for activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling with induction of genes coding for multiple chemokines as well as most components of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I antigen-presenting complex. Administration of antiinflammatory doses of dexamethasone to LiCl-treated rats countered the loss of aquaporin-2 protein. RNA-Seq also confirmed prior evidence of a shift from quiescence into the cell cycle with arrest. Time course studies demonstrated an early (12 hrs) increase in multiple immediate early genes including several transcription factors. Protein mass spectrometry in microdissected cortical CDs provided corroborative evidence but also identified decreased abundance of several anti-oxidant proteins. Integration of new data with prior data about lithium effects at a molecular level leads to a signaling model in which lithium increases ERK activation leading to induction of NF-{kappa}B signaling and an inflammatory-like response that represses Aqp2 gene transcription.",

Gene regulatory feedback can affect the frequency with which these bursts occur or their size. Whereas frequency regulation has traditionally received more attention, we focus specifically on the regulation of burst size. It turns out that there are (at least) two alternative formulations of feedback in burst size. In the first, newly produced molecules immediately partake in feedback, even within the same burst. In the second, there is no within-burst regulation due to what we call infinitesimal delay. We describe both alternatives using a minimalistic Markovian drift-jump framework combining discrete and continuous dynamics. We derive detailed analytic results and efficient simulation algorithms for positive noncooperative autoregulation (whether infinitesimally delayed or not). We show that at steady state both alternatives lead to a gamma distribution of protein level. The steady-state distribution becomes available only after a transcritical bifurcation point is passed. Interestingly, the onset of the bifurcation is postponed by the inclusion of infinitesimal delay.",

The combined RMSD can be used to compare (quaternary) structures based on motifs defined from the sequence (domains, SSE), or to compare structures based on structural motifs yielded by local structural alignment methods.\\n\\nWe illustrate the benefits of combined RMSD over the usual RMSD on three problems, namely (i) the analysis of conformational changes based on combined RMSD of rigid structural motifs (case study: a class II fusion protein), (ii) the calculation of structural phylogenies (case study: class II fusion proteins), and (iii) the assignment of quaternary structures for hemoglobin. Using these, we argue that the combined RMSD is a tool a choice to perform positive and negative discrimination of degree of freedom, with applications to the design of move sets and collective coordinates.\\n\\nCombined RMSD are available within the Structural Bioinformatics Library (http://sbl.inria.fr).",

    "abstract": "proteomics is able to reveal plentiful information related to different physiological and pathological states of biology. Further, the determination of accurately proteomic pattern is the essential platform for deeply proteomic research. While this has been somewhat ignored so far. In this article the quantitative standard Pg=61%, a biological similarity constant for discriminating accurately intrinsic proteomic patterns was established depending on biological common heredity and variation information equation in symmetric variation state. On the other hand, a novel theoretical method was proposed for linearly dividing nonlinear data sequence into linear segments. The proteomes of three kind soybeans were precisely distinguished from one another by analyzing their infrared fingerprint spectra relying on this theoretically systemic approach. Additionally, methods employed in this paper enable us to quickly, accurately and quantitatively determine the proteomic patterns without using any prior knowledge and learning samples, and without using electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques, which are high cost, time-consuming. This approach provide us with an excellent one for quickly accurate determining biological species, physiological states and diagnosing pathological states based on proteomes.",
