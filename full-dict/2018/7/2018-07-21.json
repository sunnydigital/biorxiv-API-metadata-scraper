    "abstract": "Emerging Linked-Read technologies (aka Read-Cloud or barcoded short-reads) have revived interest in standard short-read technology as a viable way to understand large-scale structure in genomes and metagenomes. Linked-Read technologies, such as the 10X Chromium system, use a microfluidic system and a set of specially designed 3 barcodes (aka UIDs) to tag short DNA reads which were originally sourced from the same long fragment of DNA; subsequently, these specially barcoded reads are sequenced on standard short read platforms. This approach results in interesting compromises. Each long fragment of DNA is covered only sparsely by short reads, no information about the relative ordering of reads from the same fragment is preserved, and typically each 3 barcode matches reads from 2-20 long fragments of DNA. However, compared to long read platforms like those produced by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore the cost per base to sequence is far lower, far less input DNA is required, and the per base error rate is that of Illumina short-reads.\\n\\nThe use of Linked-Reads presents a new set of algorithmic challenges. In this paper, we formally describe one particular issue common to all applications of Linked-Read technology: the deconvolution of reads with a single 3 barcode into clusters that correspond to a single long fragment of DNA. We introduce Minerva, A graph-based algorithm that approximately solves the barcode deconvolution problem for metagenomic data (where reference genomes may be incomplete or unavailable). Additionally, we develop two demonstrations where the deconvolution of barcoded reads improves downstream results: improving the specificity of taxonomic assignments, and by improving clustering of related sequences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of barcode deconvolution in metagenomics.",

    "abstract": "The ability to track animals accurately is critical for behavioral experiments. For video-based assays, this is often accomplished by manipulating environmental conditions to increase contrast between the animal and the background, in order to achieve proper foreground/background detection (segmentation). However, as behavioral paradigms become more sophisticated with ethologically relevant environments, the approach of modifying environmental conditions offers diminishing returns, particularly for scalable experiments. Currently, there is a need for methods to monitor behaviors over long periods of time, under dynamic environmental conditions, and in animals that are genetically and behaviorally heterogeneous. To address this need, we developed a state-of-the-art neural network-based tracker for mice, using modern machine vision techniques. We test three different neural network architectures to determine their performance on genetically diverse mice under varying environmental conditions. We find that an encoder-decoder segmentation neural network achieves high accuracy and speed with minimal training data. Furthermore, we provide a labeling interface, labeled training data, tuned hyperparameters, and a pre-trained network for the mouse behavior and neuroscience communities. This general-purpose neural network tracker can be easily extended to other experimental paradigms and even to other animals, through transfer learning, thus providing a robust, generalizable solution for biobehavioral research.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is a complex task and requires adaptive mechanisms that facilitate efficient behaviour. Here, we consider a neural circuit that guides the behaviour of an animal in ongoing binary choice tasks. We adopt an inhibition motif from neural network theory and propose a dynamical system characterized by nonlinear feedback, which links mechanism (the implementation of the neural circuit) and function (increasing reproductive value). A central inhibitory unit influences evidence-integrating excitatory units, which in our terms correspond to motivations competing for selection. We determine the parameter regime where the animal exhibits improved decision-making behaviour, and explain different behavioural outcomes by making the link between bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear neural circuit model and decision-making performance. We find that the animal performs best if it tunes internal parameters of the neural circuit in accordance with the underlying bifurcation structure. In particular, variation of inhibition strength and excitation-over-inhibition ratio have a crucial effect on the decision outcome, by allowing the animal to break decision deadlock and to enter an oscillatory phase that describes its internal motivational state. Our findings indicate that this oscillatory phase may improve the overall performance of the animal in an ongoing foraging task. Our results underpin the importance of an integrated functional and mechanistic study of animal activity selection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOrganisms frequently select activities, which relate to economic, social and perceptual decision-making problems. The choices made may have substantial impact on their lives. In foraging decisions, for example, animals aim at reaching a target intake of nutrients; it is generally believed that a balanced diet improves reproductive success, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms that integrate nutritional needs within the brain. In our study, we address this coupling between physiological states and a decision-making circuit in the context of foraging decisions. We consider a model animal that has the drive to eat or drink. The motivation to select and perform one of these activities (i.e. eating or drinking), is processed in artificial neuronal units that have access to information on how hungry and thirsty the animal is at the point it makes the decision. We show that inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in the neural circuit shape ongoing binary decisions, and we reveal under which conditions oscillating motivations may improve the overall performance of the animal. Our results indicate that inefficient or pathological decision-making may originate from suboptimal modulation of excitation and inhibition in the neurobiological network.",

    "abstract": "Lipid transport is an essential process with manifest importance to human health and disease. Phospholipid flippases (P4-ATPases) transport lipids across the membrane bilayer, and are involved in signal transduction, cell division, and vesicular transport. Mutations in flippase genes cause or contribute to a host of diseases such as cholestasis, neurological deficits, immunological dysfunction, and metabolic disease. Genome-wide association studies have shown that ATP10A and ATP10D variants are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis; and ATP10D SNPs are associated with elevated levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in plasma from diverse European populations. Although sphingolipids are strong contributors to metabolic disease, little is known about how GlcCer is transported across cell membranes. We have identified an evolutionarily conserved clade of P4-ATPases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Dnf1, Dnf2), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Dnf2), and Homo sapiens (ATP10A, ATP10D) that transport GlcCer. Further, we establish the structural determinants necessary for the specific recognition of this sphingolipid substrate. Our molecular observations clarify the relationship between these flippases and human disease, and have fundamental implications for membrane organization and sphingolipid homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The global downregulation of miRNAs (miRs) is emerging as a common hallmark of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well known. We identified that the oncogenic miR-146b-5p attenuates miRNA biosynthesis by targeting DICER1 and reducing its expression. DICER1 overexpression inhibited all the miR-146b-induced aggressive phenotypes in thyroid cells. Systemic injection of an antimiR-146b in mice with orthotopic thyroid tumors suppressed tumor growth and recovered DICER1 levels. Notably, DICER1 downregulation promoted proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through miR downregulation. Our analysis of TCGA revealed a general decrease in DICER1 expression in thyroid cancer that was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Administration of the small molecule enoxacin to promote DICER1 complex activity reduced tumor aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data establish DICER1 as a tumor suppressor and that the oncogenic miR-146b contributes to its downregulation. Moreover, this study highlights a potential therapeutic application of RNA-based therapies including miR-inhibitors and restoration of the biogenesis machinery, which may provide treatments in for thyroid and other cancers.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-neutrophil interactions are important for innate immunity, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we report that, under flow, von Willebrand factor/glycoprotein Ib-dependent platelet  priming induces integrin IIb{beta}3 activation that, in turn, mediates neutrophil and T-cell binding. Binding of platelet IIb{beta}3 to SLC44A2 on neutrophils leads to mechanosensitive-dependent production of highly prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps. A polymorphism in SLC44A2 (rs2288904-A) present in 22% of the population causes an R154Q substitution in an extracellular loop of SLC44A2 that is protective against venous thrombosis results in severely impaired binding to both activated IIb{beta}3 and VWF-primed platelets. This was confirmed using neutrophils homozygous for the SLC44A2 R154Q polymorphism. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unreported mode of platelet-neutrophil cross-talk, mechanosensitive NET production, and provide mechanistic insight into the protective effect of the SLC44A2 rs2288904-A polymorphism in venous thrombosis.\\n\\nSummaryPlatelets that are primed following interaction with von Willebrand factor under flow mediated direct interactions with neutrophils via activated platelet integrin, IIb{beta}3, and SLC44A2 on neutrophils.

    "abstract": "It is largely unclear how MDSCs contribute to the development of primary Sjogrens syndrome (pSS). In experimental SS (ESS) mice, MDSCs were significantly increased but exhibited gradually diminished suppressive capacity during the disease progression. The ligand for glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related protein (GITRL) was increased with the development of pSS, and the increased GITRL was found to down-regulate the function of MDSCs while blocking GITR signal in MDSCs significantly restored their function and ameliorated ESS progression in mice. In pSS patients, expanded MDSCs expressed lower level of arginase were observed in patients with higher SSDAI. Moreover, the increased GITRL in serum was also found to closely correlate with the aberrant function of MDSCs. Together, our studies have demonstrated a critical role of GITRL in modulating the suppressive capacity of MDSCs in pSS, which may facilitate the validation of GITRL as a therapeutic target for the treatment of pSS.",

    "abstract": "In recent years optical microscopy techniques have emerged that allow optical imaging at unprecented resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Up to date, photostabilizing buffers are the method of choice to realize either photoswitching and/or to enhance the signal brightness and stability of the employed fluorescent probes. This strategy has, however, restricted applicability and is not suitable for live cell imaging. In this paper, we tested the performance of self-healing organic fluorophores with intramolecular photostabilization in super-resolution microscopy with targeted (STED) and stochastic readout (STORM). The overall goal of the study was to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of both techniques without the need for mixtures of photostabilizing agents in the imaging buffer. Due to its past superior performance we identified ATTO647N-photostabilizer conjugates as suitable candidates for STED microscopy. We characterize the photostability and resulting performance of NPA-ATTO647N oligonucleotide conjugates in STED microscopy. We find that the superior photophysical performance results in optimal STED imaging and demonstrate the possibility to obtain single-molecule fluorescent transients of individual fluorophores while illuminating with both the excitation- and STED-laser. Secondly, we show an analysis of photoswitching kinetics of self-healing Cy5 dyes (comprising TX, COT and NPA stabilizers) in the presence of TCEP- and cysteamine, which are typically used in STORM microscopy. In line with previous work, we find that intramolecular photostabilization strongly influences photoswitching kinetics and requires careful attention when designing STORM-experiments. In summary, this contribution explores the possibilities and limitations of self-healing dyes in super-resolution microscopy of differing modalities.",

    "abstract": "Voltage sensing domains (VSDs) couple changes in transmembrane electrical potential to conformational changes that regulate ion conductance through a central channel. Positively charged amino acids inside each sensor cooperatively respond to changes in voltage. Our previous structure of a TPC1 channel captured the first example of a resting-state VSD in an intact ion channel. To generate an activated state VSD in the same channel we removed the luminal inhibitory Ca2+-binding site (Cai2+), that shifts voltage-dependent opening to more negative voltage and activation at 0 mV. Cryo-EM reveals two coexisting structures of the VSD, an intermediate state 1 that partially closes access to the cytoplasmic side, but remains occluded on the luminal side and an intermediate activated state 2 in which the cytoplasmic solvent access to the gating charges closes, while luminal access partially opens. Activation can be thought of as moving a hydrophobic insulating region of the VSD from the external side, to an alternate grouping on the internal side. This effectively moves the gating charges from the inside potential to that of the outside. Activation also requires binding of Ca2+ to a cytoplasmic site (Caa2+). An X-ray structure with Caa2+ removed and a near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure with Cai2+ removed define how dramatic conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains may communicate with the VSD during activation. Together four structures provide a basis for understanding the voltage dependent transition from resting to activated state, the tuning of VSD by thermodynamic stability, and this channels requirement of cytoplasmic Ca2+-ions for activation.",

    "abstract": "Oncogene induced senescence (OIS) is a cell cycle arrest program triggered by oncogenic signalling. An important characteristic of OIS is activation of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP)1 which can reinforce cell cycle arrest, lead to paracrine senescence but also promote tumour progression2-4. Concomitant with cell cycle arrest and the SASP activation, OIS cells undergo a striking nuclear chromatin reorganization, with loss of heterochromatin from the nuclear periphery and the appearance of internal senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF)5. The mechanisms by which SAHF are formed, and their role in cell cycle arrest and expression of the SASP, remain poorly understood. Here we show that nuclear pore density increases during OIS and is responsible for SAHF formation. In particular, we show that the nucleoporin TPR is required for both SAHF formation and maintenance. The TPR-induced loss of SAHF does not affect cell cycle arrest but completely abrogates the SASP. Our results uncover a previously unknown role of nuclear pores in heterochromatin reorganization in mammalian nuclei and in senescence, which uncouples the cell cycle arrest from the SASP.",

    "abstract": "Cells sense and respond to their environment by activating distinct intracellular signaling pathways, however an individual cells ability to faithfully transmit and discriminate environmental signals is thought to be limited. To assess the fidelity of signal transmission in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, we first developed an optimized genetically encoded sensor that had an increased dynamic range and reduced variation under basal conditions. We then used this reporter to track responses to varying doses of IGF-I in live cells and found that signaling responses from individual cells overlapped across a wide range of IGF-I doses, suggesting limited transmission accuracy. However, further analysis of individual cell traces revealed that responses were constant over time without stochastic fluctuations. We devised a new information theoretic approach to calculate the channel capacity using variance of the single cell time course data--rather than population-level variance as has been previously used--and predicted that cells were capable of discriminating multiple growth factor doses. We validated these predictions by tracking individual cell responses to multiple IGF-I doses and found that cells can accurately distinguish at least four different IGF-I concentrations, as demonstrated by their distinct responses. Furthermore, we found a similar discriminatory ability to pathway inhibition, as assessed by responses to the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib. Our studies indicate that cells can faithfully transmit an IGF-I input into a down-stream signaling response and that heterogeneous responses result from variation in the input-output relation across the population. These observations reveal the importance of viewing each cell as having its own communication channel and underscore the importance of understanding responses at the single cell level.",
