    "abstract": "Grid cell spatial period is thought to be dictated by a mapping between the speed-direction modulated excitatory inputs, and consequent modulation of the firing rate, yet, the exact underlying mechanisms are not known. Here, through experiments on the medial entorhinal cortex stellate cells, subjected to in-vivo like stochastic synaptic activity through the dynamic clamp, we show that such mapping can emerge from a theta-frequency resonance in the signal gain, which is HCN sensitive, robust to noise, and is potent enough to modulate the synaptic responses in the theta frequency. This modulation also extends to the corresponding theta-gamma modulation of the firing rate, the slope of whose excitation mediated increase is steeper in the presence of HCN channels. We also show that in the cells devoid of HCN channels, inhibition can emulate their role. Considering the dorso-ventral gradients of HCN and inhibition, which are present aligned to the grid spacing gradient in the medial entorhinal cortex, these findings should be noteworthy.",

    "abstract": "Tau protein accumulation is the most common pathology among degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimers disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and over twenty others1. Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation is the closest correlate with cognitive decline and cell loss, yet the mechanisms mediating tau toxicity are poorly understood. NFT-containing neurons do not die, which suggests secondary mechanisms are driving toxicity2. We evaluated gene expression patterns of NFT-containing neurons microdissected from AD patient brains3 and found they develop an expression profile consistent with cellular senescence described in dividing cells. This complex stress response induces a near permanent cell cycle arrest, adaptations to maintain survival, cellular remodeling, and metabolic dysfunction4. Moreover, senescent cells induce chronic degeneration of surrounding tissue through the secretion of pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic molecules termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)5. Using transgenic mouse models of tau-associated pathogenesis we found that NFTs induced a senescence-like phenotype including DNA damage, karyomegaly, mitochondrial dysfunction and SASP. Cdkn2a transcript level, a hallmark measure of senescence, directly correlated with brain atrophy and NFT load. This relationship extended to postmortem brain tissue from humans with PSP to indicate a phenomenon common to tau toxicity. Tau transgenic mice with late stage pathology were treated with senolytics to remove senescent cells. Despite the advanced age and disease progression, senolytic treatment reduced total NFT burden, neuron loss and ventricular enlargement; and normalized cerebral blood flow to that of non-transgenic control mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that NFTs induce cellular senescence in the brain, which contributes to neurodegeneration and brain dysfunction. Moreover, given the prevalence of tau protein deposition among neurodegenerative diseases, these findings have broad implications for understanding, and potentially treating, dozens of brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVisual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture.\\n\\nMethodology / Principal FindingsWe introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. This framework is applied to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. Cross-validation analysis is employed to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that these models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. How observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels is investigated by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, revealing a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. Our results suggest that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing the method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries.\\n\\nConclusions / SignificanceThis study demonstrates how machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering how and why animals explore their environment is fundamental for understanding population dynamics, the spread of invasive species, species interactions etc. In social animals, individuals within a group can vary in their exploratory behavior and the behavioral composition of the group can determine its collective success. Workers of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) exhibit individual variation in exploratory behavior, which affects the colonys collective nest selection behavior. Here we examine the mechanisms underlying this behavioral variation in exploratory behavior and determine its implications for the ecology of this species. We first establish that individual variation in exploratory behavior is repeatable and consistent across situations. We then show a relationship between exploratory behavior and the expression of genes that have been previously linked with other behaviors in social insects. Specifically, we find a negative relationship between exploratory behavior and the expression of the FOR gene. Finally, we determine how colonies allocate exploratory individuals in natural conditions. We find that ants from inside the nest are the least exploratory individuals, while workers on newly formed foraging trails are the most exploratory individuals. Furthermore, workers in the spring, when new resources emerge, are more exploratory than workers in the winter, potentially allowing the colony to find and exploit new resources. These findings reveal the importance of individual variation in behavior for the ecology of social animals and provide mechanistic and functional explanations for how such behavioral variation can emerge.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating mental illness with multigenic etiology and high heritability. Despite extensive genetic studies the molecular etiology stays enigmatic. A systems biology study had suggested a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for SZ with 504 novel PPIs amongst which several genes happen to be drug targets of existing FDA approved drugs. Although the PPI network presented all possible pairs of interactions (known and novel), it lacks a spatio-temporal information. The onset of psychiatric disorders is predominantly in adolescent and young adult stages, often accompanied by subtle structural abnormalities in multiple regions of the brain. Hence, there is a need to redefine the generic PPI network as a function of time (developmental stages) and space (brain regions). The availability of BrainSpan atlas data allowed us to redefine the SZ interactome as a function of space and time. The absence of non-synonymous variants in centenarians and non-psychiatric ExAC database allowed us to identify the variants of criticality. The expression of candidate genes in different brain regions and during developmental stages, responsible for cognitive processes as well as the onset of disease were studied. A subset of novel interactors detected in the network was further validated using gene-expression data of psychiatric postmortem brains. From the long list of drug targets proposed from the interactome study and based on the microarray gene-expression results, we have shortlisted a probable subset of 10 drug targets (targeted by 34 FDA approved drugs) coalescing into 81 biological pathways, that could be potentially repurposed for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Analyses in breast cancer suggests that mutant ESR1 exhibits estrogen independent activity. In endometrial cancer, ESR1 mutations are associated with worse outcomes and less obesity, however experimental investigation of these mutations has not been performed. Using a unique CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, we introduced the D538G mutation, a common endometrial cancer mutation that alters the ligand binding domain of ESR1, while epitope tagging the endogenous locus. We discovered estrogen-independent mutant ESR1 genomic binding that is significantly altered from wildtype ESR1. The D538G mutation impacted expression, including a large set of non-estrogen regulated genes, and chromatin accessibility, with most affected loci bound by mutant ESR1. Mutant ESR1 is unique from constitutive ESR1 activity as mutant-specific changes are not recapitulated with prolonged estrogen exposure. Overall, D538G mutant ESR1 confers estrogen-independent activity while causing additional regulatory changes in endometrial cancer cells that are distinct from breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "O_LISpecies-specific diversification rates, or \\\"tip rates\\\", can be computed quickly from phylogenies and are widely used to study diversification rate variation in relation to geography, ecology, and phenotypes. These tip rates provide a number of theoretical and practical advantages, such as the relaxation of assumptions of rate homogeneity in trait-dependent diversification studies. However, there is substantial confusion in the literature regarding whether these metrics estimate speciation or net diversification rates. Additionally, no study has yet compared the relative performance and accuracy of tip rate metrics across simulated diversification scenarios.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared the statistical performance of three model-free rate metrics (inverse terminal branch lengths; node density metric; DR statistic) and a model-based approach (BAMM). We applied each method to a large set of simulated phylogenies that had been generated under different diversification processes; scenarios included multi-regime time-constant and diversity-dependent trees, as well as trees where the rate of speciation evolves under a diffusion process. We summarized performance in relation to the type of rate variation, the magnitude of rate heterogeneity and rate regime size. We also compared the ability of the metrics to estimate both speciation and net diversification rates.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show decisively that model-free tip rate metrics provide a better estimate of the rate of speciation than of net diversification. Error in net diversification rate estimates increases as a function of the relative extinction rate. In contrast, error in speciation rate estimates is low and relatively insensitive to extinction. Overall, and in particular when relative extinction was high, BAMM inferred the most accurate tip rates and exhibited lower error than non-model-based approaches. DR was highly correlated with true speciation rates but exhibited high error variance, and was the best metric for very small rate regimes.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that, of the metrics tested, DR and BAMM are the most useful metrics for studying speciation rate dynamics and trait-dependent diversification. Although BAMM was more accurate than DR overall, the two approaches have complementary strengths. Because tip rate metrics are more reliable estimators of speciation rate, we recommend that empirical studies using these metrics exercise caution when drawing biological interpretations in any situation where the distinction between speciation and net diversification is important.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the absence of external feedback, a decision maker must rely on a subjective estimate of their decision accuracy in order to appropriately guide behavior. Normative models of perceptual decision making relate subjective estimates of internal signal quality (e.g. confidence) directly to the internal signal quality itself, thereby making it unknowable whether the subjective estimate or the underlying signal is what drives behavior. We constructed stimuli that dissociated human observers performance on a visual estimation task from their subjective estimates of confidence in their performance, thus violating normative principles. To understand whether confidence influences future decision making, we examined serial dependence in observers responses, a phenomenon whereby the estimate of a stimulus on the current trial can be biased towards the stimulus from the previous trial. We found that when decisions were made with high confidence, they conferred stronger biases upon the following trial, suggesting that confidence may enhance serial dependence. Critically, this finding was true also when confidence was experimentally dissociated from task performance, indicating that subjective confidence, independent of signal quality, can amplify serial dependence. These findings demonstrate an effect of confidence on future behavior, independent of task performance, and suggest that perceptual decisions incorporate recent history in an uncertainty-weighted manner, but where the uncertainty carried forward is a subjectively estimated and possibly suboptimal readout of objective sensory uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Since Denis Gabors pioneering paper on the discrete Gabor Expansion (Gabor, 1946), time-frequency signal analysis has proven to be an important tool for many fields. In neurophysiology, time-frequency analysis has often been used to characterize and describe transient bursts in local field potential data. However, these transient bursts have a wide range of variable durations, suggesting that a time-frequency-scale dictionary composed of elementary signal \"atoms\" may prove useful to more accurately match recorded bursts. While overcomplete multiscale dictionaries are useful, generating a sparse code over such dictionaries is a difficult computational problem. Existing adaptive algorithms for discovering a sparse description are slow and computationally intensive. Here we describe the Multiscale Adaptive Gabor Expansion (MAGE), which uses an implicit dictionary of parametric time-frequency-scale Gabor atoms to perform fast parameter reassignment to accelerate discovery of a sparse decomposition. Using analytic expressions together with numerical computation, MAGE is a greedy pursuit algorithm similar to Matching Pursuit, restricted to a dictionary of multiscale Gaussian-envelope Gabor atoms. MAGE parameter reassignment is robust in the presence of moderate noise. By expressing a unknown signal as a weighted sum of Gabor atoms, MAGE permits a more accurate estimate of the amplitude and phase of transient bursts than existing methods.",

Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (VGLUT) accumulate glutamate into synaptic vesicles (SV) and thereby regulate quantal size. Further, the number of release sites and the release probability of SVs maybe regulated by the organization of active zone proteins and SV clusters. In the present work, we uncover a mechanism mediating an increased SV clustering through a tripartite interaction of VGLUT1, endophilinA1 and intersectin1. This strengthening of SV clusters results in a combined reduction of axonal SV super-pool size and miniature excitatory events frequency. Our findings support a model in which clustered vesicles are held together through multiple weak interactions between SH3 domains and proline rich sequences of synaptic proteins. In mammals, VGLUT1 gained a poly-proline sequence that recruits endophilinA1 and turns the transporter into a dual regulator of quantal release parameters at excitatory synapses.",

    "abstract": "The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic of significant proportions, imposing enormous fiscal and societal costs. While prescription opioid analgesics are essential for treating pain, the cessation of these drugs can induce a withdrawal syndrome, and thus opioid use often persists to alleviate or avoid these symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to understand the neurobiology underlying this critical window of withdrawal from opioid analgesics to prevent continued usage. To model this, we administered a low dose of morphine, and precipitated withdrawal with naloxone to investigate the behavioral and cellular responses in C57BL/6J male and female mice. Following 3 days of administration, both male and female mice sensitized to the repeated bouts of withdrawal, as evidenced by their composite global withdrawal score. Female mice exhibited increased withdrawal symptoms on some individual measures, but did not show characteristic weight loss observed in male mice. Because of its role in mediating withdrawal-associated behaviors, we examined neuronal excitability and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) 24 hours following the final precipitated withdrawal. In male mice, morphine withdrawal increased spontaneous GABAergic signaling compared to controls. In contrast, morphine withdrawal decreased spontaneous GABAergic signaling, and increased BNST projection neuron excitability in female mice. Intriguingly, these opposing GABAergic effects were dependent on within slice excitability. Our findings suggest that male and female mice manifest divergent cellular responses in the BNST following morphine withdrawal, and alterations in BNST inhibitory signaling may be a significant factor contributing to the expression of behaviors following opioid withdrawal.",

Surprisingly, CMG undergoes rapid diffusion on dsDNA and can transition back onto ssDNA for continued fork progression. The accessory protein Mcm10 is required for robust ssDNA gating.

    "abstract": "The transfer distance (TD) was introduced in the classification framework and studied in the context of phylogenetic tree matching. Recently, Lemoine et al. (2018) showed that TD can be a powerful tool to assess the branch support of phylogenies with large data sets, thus providing a relevant alternative to Felsensteins bootstrap. This distance allows a reference branch {beta} in a reference tree [T] to be compared to a branch b from another tree T, both on the same set of n taxa. The TD between these branches is the number of taxa that must be transferred from one side of b to the other in order to obtain {beta}. By taking the minimum TD from {beta} to all branches in T we define the transfer index, denoted by{phi} ({beta}, T), measuring the degree of agreement of {beta} with T. Let us consider a reference branch {beta} having p tips on its light side and define the transfer support (TS) as 1 -{phi} ({beta}, T)/(p - 1). The aim of this article is to provide evidence that p 1 is a meaningful normalization constant in the definition of TS, and measure the statistical significance of TS, assuming that {beta} is compared to a tree T drawn according to a null model. We obtain several results that shed light on these questions in a number of settings. In particular, we study the asymptotic behavior of TS when n tends to {infty}, and fully characterize the distribution of{phi} when T is a caterpillar tree.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly evaluated for a myriad of clinical indications and performance enhancement mainly related to cognitive and motor applications. As a result tDCS has been tested with diverse inclusion criteria and subject populations. tDCS is customized for applications by many factors, including stimulation dose (montage, current, time), associated training and subject inclusion/exclusion criteria. The rapid proliferation of applications, technological advancements and emerging scientific discoveries presents challenges to the organization and consolidation of tDCS data - which can lead to scientific, clinical and public confusions. In this paper, we develop a system to summarize and consolidate methodological aspects of tDCS, concentrating on study design and the physical parameters of the stimulation. We introduce a community-driven, open access database, where these parameters, including stimulation intensities, duration, electrode sizes, montages, and subject information, are noted for relevant tDCS publications. The transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Studies Open Database (tDCS-OD) (http://tdcsdatabase.com) will support constructive dialogue on research and clinical tDCS applications, critical evaluation of past work, and identification of promising protocols, while reducing ambiguity about stimulation methodology. The database design allows ongoing updates and editing, with transparent version control. At the moment, the database includes information about 56,613 tDCS sessions.",

    "abstract": "The corticospinal tract (CST) is one of the most well-studied tracts in human neuroanatomy. Its clinical significance can be demonstrated in many notable traumatic conditions and diseases such as stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With the advent of diffusion MRI and tractography the computational representation of the human CST in a 3D model became available. However, the representation of the entire CST and, specifically, the hand motor area has remained elusive. In this paper we proposed a novel method, using manually-drawn ROIs based on robustly identifiable neuroanatomic structures to delineate the entire CST and isolate its hand motor representation as well as to estimate their variability and generate a database of their volume, length and biophysical parameters. Using 37 healthy human subjects we performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the CST and the hand-related motor fiber tracts (HMFTs). Finally, we have created variability heatmaps from 37 subjects for both the aforementioned tracts, which could be utilized as reference for clinicians to explore neuropathology in both trauma and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the complement system is implicated in neurodegeneration, including human and animal glaucoma. Optic nerve and retinal damage in glaucoma is preceded by local complement upregulation and activation, but whether targeting this early innate immune response could have therapeutic benefit remains undefined. Because complement signals through three pathways that intersect at complement C3 activation, here we targeted this step to restore complement balance in the glaucomatous retina, and to determine its contribution to degeneration onset and/or progression. To achieve this, we combined adeno-associated viral retinal gene therapy with the targeted C3 inhibitor CR2-Crry. We show that intravitreal injection of AAV2.CR2-Crry produced sustained Crry overexpression in the retina, and reduced deposition of the activation product complement C3d on retinal ganglion cells and the inner retina of DBA/2J mice. This resulted in neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cell axons and somata despite continued intraocular pressure elevation, suggesting a direct restriction of neurodegeneration onset and progression, and significant delay to terminal disease stages. Our study uncovers a damaging effect of complement C3 or downstream complement activation in glaucoma and establishes AAV2.CR2-Crry as a viable therapeutic strategy to target pathogenic C3-mediated complement activation in the glaucomatous retina.",

    "abstract": "The awakening of the zygote genome, signaling the transition from maternal transcriptional control to zygotic control, is a watershed in embryonic development, but the factors and mechanisms controlling this transition are still poorly understood. By combining CRISPR-Cas9-mediated live imaging of the first transcribed genes (miR-430), chromatin and transcription analysis during zebrafish embryogenesis, we observed that genome activation is gradual and stochastic, and the active state is inherited in daughter cells. We discovered that genome activation is regulated through both translation of maternal mRNAs and the effects of these factors on the chromatin. We show that chemical inhibition of H3K27Ac writer (P300) and reader (Brd4) block genome activation, while induction of a histone acetylation prematurely activates transcription, and restore genome activation in embryos where translation of maternal mRNAs is impaired, demonstrating that they are limiting factors for the activation of the genome. In contrast to current models, we do not observe triggering of genome activation by a reduction of the nuclear-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio or slower cell division. We conclude that genome activation is controlled by a time-dependent mechanism involving the translation of maternal mRNAs and the regulation of histone acetylation through P300 and Brd4. This mechanism is critical to initiating zygotic development and developmental reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to sequence genomes has vastly surpassed our ability to interpret the genetic variation we discover. This presents a major challenge in the clinical setting, where the recent application of whole exome and whole genome sequencing has uncovered thousands of genetic variants of uncertain significance. Here, we present a strategy for targeted human gene replacement and phenomic characterization based on CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in the genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans that will facilitate assessment of the functional conservation of human genes and structure-function analysis of disease-associated variants with unprecedented precision. We validate our strategy by demonstrating that direct single-copy replacement of the C. elegans ortholog (daf-18) with the critical human disease-associated gene Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) is sufficient to rescue multiple phenotypic abnormalities caused by complete deletion of daf-18, including complex chemosensory and mechanosenory impairments. In addition, we used our strategy to generate animals harboring a single copy of the known pathogenic lipid phosphatase inactive PTEN variant (PTEN-G129E) and showed that our automated in vivo phenotypic assays could accurately and efficiently classify this missense variant as loss-of-function. The integrated nature of the human transgenes allows for analysis of both homozygous and heterozygous variants and greatly facilitates high-throughput precision medicine drug screens. By combining genome engineering with rapid and automated phenotypic characterization, our strategy streamlines identification of novel conserved gene functions in complex sensory and learning phenotypes that can be used as in vivo functional assays to decipher variants of uncertain significance.",

To this aim, we recorded EEG from 34 participants. Participants were navigating a simple virtual reality plus-maze where at the beginning of each trial they were randomly teleported to either the North or the South alley. Results show that the teleportation event caused a quick reorientation effect over occipito-parietal areas as early as 100 msec; meaning that despite the known stochastic nature of the teleportation, participants built up expectations for their place of arrival. This result has important consequences for the optimal design of Virtual reality locomotion.",

At this age, dementia incidence is high and cognitive functioning is variable and influenced by sensory impairments. Appropriate cognitive testing requires normative data generated specifically for this group. Currently, these are lacking. We set out to generate norms for neuropsychological tests in cognitively healthy centenarians while taking sensory impairments into account.\\n\\nMethodsWe included 235 centenarians (71.5% female) from the 100-plus Study, who self-reported to be cognitively healthy, which was confirmed by an informant and a trained researcher. Normative data were generated for 15 tests that evaluate global cognition, pre-morbid intelligence, attention, language, memory, executive and visuo-spatial functions by multiple linear regressions and/or percentiles. Centenarians with vision and/or hearing impairments were excluded for tests that required these faculties.\\n\\nResultsSubjects scored on average 25.6{+/-}3.1 (range 17-30, interquartile-range 24-28) points on the MMSE. Vision problems and fatigue often complicated the ability to complete tests, and these problems explained 41% and 22% of the missing test scores respectively, whereas hearing problems (4%) and task incomprehension (6%) only rarely did. Sex and age showed a limited association with test performance, whereas educational level was associated with performance on the majority of the tests.\\n\\nConclusionsNormative data for the centenarian population is provided, while taking age-related sensory impairments into consideration. Results indicate that, next to vision impairments, fatigue and education level should be taken into account when assessing cognitive functioning in centenarians.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly and appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment of patients suspected of having sepsis is associated with reduced mortality. The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance risks eroding the benefits of such empiric therapy. This problem is particularly severe for children in developing country settings. We hypothesized that by applying machine learning approaches to readily collected patient data, it would be possible to obtain actionable and patient-specific predictions for antibiotic-susceptibility. If sufficient discriminatory power can be achieved, such predictions could lead to substantial improvements in the chances of choosing an appropriate antibiotic for empiric therapy, while minimizing the risk of increased selection for resistance due to use of antibiotics usually held in reserve.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe analyzed blood culture data collected from a 100-bed childrens hospital in North-West Cambodia between February 2013 and January 2016. Clinical, demographic and living condition information for each child was captured with 35 independent variables. Using these variables, we used a suite of machine learning algorithms to predict Gram stains and whether bacterial pathogens could be treated with standard empiric antibiotic therapies: i) ampicillin and gentamicin; ii) ceftriaxone; iii) at least one of the above.\\n\\n243 cases of bloodstream infection were available for analysis. We used 195 (80%) to train the algorithms, and 48 (20%) for evaluation. We found that the random forest method had the best predictive performance overall as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), though support vector machine with radial kernel had similar performance for predicting Gram stain and ceftriaxone susceptibility. Predictive performance of logistic regression, simple and boosted decision trees and k-nearest neighbors were poor in comparison. The random forest method gave an AUC of 0.91 (95%CI 0.81-1.00) for predicting susceptibility to ceftriaxone, 0.75 (0.60-0.90) for susceptibility to ampicillin and gentamicin, 0.76 (0.59-0.93) for susceptibility to neither, and 0.69 (0.53-0.85) for Gram stain result. The most important variables for predicting susceptibility were time from admission to blood culture, patient age, hospital versus community-acquired infection, and age-adjusted weight score.\\n\\nConclusionsApplying machine learning algorithms to patient data that are readily available even in resource-limited hospital settings can provide highly informative predictions on susceptibilities of pathogens to guide appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy. Used as a decision support tool, such approaches have the potential to lead to better targeting of empiric therapy, improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of antimicrobial resistance.\\n\\nAuthor summaryO_LSTWhy was this study done?C_LSTO_LIEarly and appropriate antibiotic treatment of patients with life-threatening bacterial infections is thought to reduce the risk of mortality.\\nC_LIO_LIIn hospitals that have a microbiology laboratory, it takes 3-4 days to get results which indicate which antibiotics are likely to be effective; before this information is available antibiotics have to be prescribed empirically i.e. without knowledge of the causative organism.\\nC_LIO_LIIncreasing resistance to antibiotics amongst bacteria makes finding an appropriate antibiotic to use empirically difficult; this problem is particularly severe for children in developing country settings.\\nC_LIO_LIIf we could predict which antibiotics were likely to be effective at the time of starting antibiotic therapy, we might be able to improve patient outcomes and reduce resistance.\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_LSTWhat Did the Researchers Do and Find?C_LSTO_LIWe evaluated the ability of a number of different algorithms (i.e. sets of step-by-step instructions) to predict susceptibility to commonly-used antibiotics using routinely available patient data from a childrens hospital in Cambodia.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that an algorithm called random forests enabled surprisingly accurate predictions, particularly for predicting whether the infection was likely to be treatable with ceftriaxone, the most commonly used empiric antibiotic at the study hospital.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing this approach it would be possible to correctly predict when a different antibiotic would be needed for empiric treatment over 80% of the time, while recommending a different antibiotic when ceftriaxone would suffice less than 20% of the time.\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_LSTWhat Do These Findings Mean?C_LSTO_LIUsing readily available patient information, sophisticated algorithms can enable good predictions of whether antibiotics are likely to be effective several days before laboratory tests are available.\\nC_LIO_LIAlgorithms would need to be trained with local hospital data, but our study shows that even with relatively limited data from a small hospital, good predictions can be obtained.\\nC_LIO_LIUsed as part of a decision support system such algorithms could help choose appropriate antibiotics for empiric therapy; this would be expected to translate into better patient outcomes and may help to reduce resistance.\\nC_LIO_LISuch as a decision support system would have very low costs and be easy to implement in low- and middle-income countries.\\nC_LI",
