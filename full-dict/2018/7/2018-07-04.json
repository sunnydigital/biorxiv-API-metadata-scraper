    "abstract": "Pulsed actomyosin contractility underlies diverse modes of tissue morphogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we combine quantitative imaging with genetic perturbations to identify a core mechanism for pulsed contractility in early C. elegans embryos. We show that pulsed accumulation of actomyosin is governed by local control of assembly and disassembly downstream of RhoA. Pulsed activation and inactivation of RhoA precede, respectively, accumulation and disappearance of actomyosin, and persist in the nearly complete absence of Myosin II. We find that fast positive feedback on RhoA activation drives pulse initiation, while F-actin dependent accumulation of the RhoA GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) RGA-3/4 provides delayed negative feedback to terminate each pulse. An experimentally constrained mathematical model confirms that in principle these feedbacks are sufficient to generate locally excitable RhoA dynamics. We propose that excitable RhoA dynamics are a common driver for pulsed contractility that can be differently tuned or coupled to actomyosin dynamics to produce a diversity of morphogenetic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which visual inference is shaped by attentional goals is unclear. Voluntary attention may simply modulate the priority with which information is accessed by higher cognitive functions involved in perceptual decision making. Alternatively, voluntary attention may influence fundamental visual processes, such as those involved in segmenting an incoming retinal signal into a structured scene of coherent objects, thereby determining perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether the segmentation and integration of visual form can be determined by an observers goals by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We generated predictions about the influence of attention with a machine classifier, and tested these predictions with a psychophysical response classification technique. Despite seeing the same image on each trial, observers perception of illusory spatial structure depended on their attentional goals. These attention-contingent illusory contours directly conflicted with equally plausible visual form implied by the geometry of the stimulus, revealing that attentional selection can determine the perceived layout of a fragmented scene. Attentional goals, therefore, not only select pre-computed features or regions of space for prioritised processing, but, under certain conditions, also greatly influence perceptual organisation and thus visual appearance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe extent to which higher cognitive functions can influence perceptual organisation is debated. The role of voluntary spatial attention, the ability to focus on only some parts of a scene, has been particularly controversial among neuroscientists and psychologists who aim to uncover the basic neural computations involved in grouping image features into coherent objects. To address this issue, we repeatedly presented the same novel ambiguous image to observers and changed their attentional goals by having them make fine spatial judgements about only some elements of the image. We found that observers attentional goals determine the perceived organisation of multiple illusory shapes. We thus reveal that voluntary spatial attention can control the fundamental processes that determine perceptual organisation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmplicon sequencing on Illumina sequencing platforms leverages their deep sequencing and multiplexing capacity, but is limited in genetic resolution due to short read lengths. While Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences platforms overcome this limitation, their application has been limited due to higher error rates or smaller data output.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on Intramolecular-ligated Nanopore Consensus Sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq includes vital improvements to the aforementioned protocol that reduces sample-processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering and within cluster consensus calling to obtain full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences.\\n\\nConclusionsNanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the diversity of tested mock communities with average sequence accuracy of 99.5% for 2D and 1D2 sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating that homopolymer aware basecalling or error correction may allow for sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.",

The optimal solution to this \\\"explore-exploit\\\" dilemma is often computationally challenging, but principled algorithmic approximations exist. These approximations utilize uncertainty about action values in different ways. Some random exploration algorithms scale the level of choice stochasticity with the level of uncertainty.

Random exploration algorithms are sensitive to total uncertainty across actions, whereas directed exploration algorithms are sensitive to relative uncertainty.

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform.\\nC_LIO_LIIterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modeling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts.\\nC_LIO_LIThe forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models. Constructing this forecasting system required a team with expertise ranging from field site experience to software development.\\nC_LIO_LIAutomated near-term iterative forecasting systems will allow the science of ecological forecasting to advance more rapidly and provide the most up-to-date forecasts possible for conservation and management. These forecasting systems will also accelerate basic science by allowing new models of natural systems to be quickly implemented and compared to existing models. Using existing technology, and teams with diverse skill sets, it is possible for ecologists to build automated forecasting systems and use them to advance our understanding of natural systems.\\nC_LI",

Here we show that hormone-induced transcription factor Blimp-1 participates in the temporal coordination of tubulogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster by regulating the expression of many genes involved in tube maturation. In particular, we demonstrate that Blimp-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in chitin deposition and F-actin organization. We show that Blimp-1 is involved in the temporal control of lumen maturation by regulating the beginning of chitin deposition. We also report that Blimp-1 represses a variety of genes involved in tracheal maturation. Finally, we reveal that the kinase Btk29A serves as a link between Blimp-1 transcriptional repression and apical extra-cellular matrix organization.",

CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

Using computational modeling and MRBLE-pep, we systematically probe binding of calcineurin (CN), a conserved protein phosphatase essential for the immune response and target of immunosuppressants, to the PxIxIT SLiM. We establish that flanking residues and post- translational modifications critically contribute to PxIxIT-CN affinity, and discover CN-inhibitory peptides with unprecedented affinity and therapeutic potential. The quantitative measurements provided by this approach will improve computational modeling efforts, elucidate a broad range of weak protein-SLiM interactions, and revolutionize our understanding of signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory signaling during natural killer (NK) cell education translates into increased responsiveness to activation; however the intracellular mechanism for functional tuning by inhibitory receptors remains unclear. We found that educated NK cells expressing self-MHC specific inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) show accumulation of granzyme B, localized in dense-core secretory lysosomes, converged close to the centrosome. This discrete morphological phenotype persists in self-KIR+ NK cells independently of transcriptional programs that regulate effector function, metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis. The granzymeB dense, large secretory lysosomes in self-KIR+ NK cells were efficiently released upon target cell recognition, contributing to their enhanced cytotoxic capacity. Secretory lysosomes are part of the acidic lysosomal compartment, which has been shown to channel calcium and mediate intracellular signalling in several cell types. Interference of signaling from acidic Ca2+ stores in primary NK cells reduced both target-specific Ca2+-flux, degranulation and cytokine production. Furthermore, inhibition of PI(3,5)P2 synthesis or genetic silencing of the PI(3,5)P2-regulated lysosomal Ca2+-channel TRPML1 led to increased levels of granzyme B and enhanced functional potential. These results indicate an intrinsic role for lysosomal homeostasis in NK cell education.",

Multivariate age prediction reduces the dimensionality to one biologically informative summary measure with potential for assessing deviations from normal lifespan trajectories. A number of studies documented remarkably accurate age prediction, but the differential age trajectories and the cognitive sensitivity of distinct brain tissue classes have to a lesser extent been characterized.\\n\\nExploring differential brain age models driven by tissue-specific classifiers provides a hitherto unexplored opportunity to disentangle independent sources of heterogeneity in brain biology. We trained machine-learning models to estimate brain age using various combinations of FreeSurfer based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging based indices of white matter microstructure in 612 healthy controls aged 18-87 years. To compare the tissue- specific brain ages and their cognitive sensitivity we applied each of the 11 models in an independent and cognitively well-characterized sample (n=265, 20-88 years). Correlations between true and estimated age in our test sample were highest for the most comprehensive brain morphometry (r=0.83, CI:0.78-0.86) and white matter microstructure (r=0.79, CI:0.74-0.83) models, confirming sensitivity and generalizability. The deviance from the chronological age were sensitive to performance on several cognitive tests for various models, including spatial Stroop and symbol coding, indicating poorer performance in individuals with an over-estimated age. Tissue-specific brain age models provide sensitive measures of brain integrity, with implications for the study of a range of brain disorders.",

These molecules also serve as important signals for hosts where binding to specific receptors reports on the presence of intracellular bacteria. Despite this critical role for muropeptides, it has long been thought that pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis do not recycle their PG. Herein we show for the first time that M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG are able to recycle components of their PG. We demonstrate that the core-mycobacterial gene lpqI, encodes an authentic NagZ {beta}-N-acetylglucosaminidase and that it is essential for PG-derived amino sugar recycling via an unusual pathway. By characterizing an M. bovis BCG strain lacking lpqI we are also able to show that stem-peptide recycling proceeds independent of amino sugar recovery and loss of lpqI leads to antimicrobial resistance in vitro. Together these data provide a critical first step in understanding how mycobacteria recycle their peptidoglycan.",

CK2 is a constitutively active, serine/threonine kinase in eukaryotes, having a wide array of known substrates and involved in many cellular processes. We investigated the localization and role of MoCK2 during growth and infection. BLAST search for MoCK2 components and targeted deletion of subunits was combined with protein-GFP fusions to investigate localization. We found one CKa and two CKb subunits of the CK2 holoenzyme. Deletion of the catalytic subunit CKa was not possible and might indicate that such deletions are lethal. The CKb subunits could be deleted but they were both necessary for normal growth and pathogenicity. Localization studies showed that the CK2 holoenzyme needed to be intact for normal localization at septal pores and at appressorium penetration pores. Nuclear localization of CKa was however not dependent on the intact CK2 holoenzyme. In appressoria, CK2 formed a large ring perpendicular to the penetration pore and the ring formation was dependent on the presence of all CK2 subunits. The effects on growth and pathogenicity of deletion of the b subunits combined with the localization indicate that CK2 can have important regulatory functions not only in the nucleus/nucleolus but also at fungal specific structures as septa and appressorial pores.",

    "abstract": "Cell wall glycopolymers on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria are fundamental to bacterial physiology and infection biology. These structures have also gained interest as vaccine antigens, in particular for the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcal cell wall glycopolymers are considered to be functional homologues of wall teichoic acids but surprisingly lack the biologically-relevant and characteristic anionic charge. Here we identify gacH, a gene of unknown function in the GAS Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) biosynthetic cluster, in two independent transposon library screens for its ability to confer resistance to zinc and susceptibility to the bactericidal enzyme human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2. To understand the underlying mechanism of these phenotypes, we determined the structure of the extracellular domain of GacH and discover that it represents a new family of glycerol phosphate (GroP) transferases. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of GroP in both the GAC and the homologous Serotype c Carbohydrate (SCC) from S. mutans, which is conferred by gacH and sccH products, respectively. NMR analysis of GAC released from cell wall by non-destructive methods reveals that approximately 30% of the GAC GlcNAc side-chains are modified by GroP at the C6 hydroxyl group. This previously unrecognized structural modification impacts host-pathogen interaction and has implications for vaccine design.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/337519v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d7598org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@435695org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9515corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc78b7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The effective isolate of Chaetomium sp actively against Magnaporthe sp causing rice blast were tested. Morphology and phylogenic identification was also confirmed Chaetomium.sp. Magnporthe sp proved to be virulent isolate to cause blast of rice. Bi-culture test proved that Chaetomium sp can be suppressed the growth of Magnaporthe sp. The fungal metabolites extracted from Chaetomium sp expressed antifungal Magnaporthe sp. Nano-particles derived from Chaetomium sp extracts exhibited significantly antifungal activity against Magnaporthe sp. Further investigation is to formulate the nanoparticles from active compounds of Chaetomium sp for plant immunity and to be applied in the rice fields.\\n\\nIMPORTANCERice blast is an economic important disease which caused by Magnaporthe. It causes yield loss and economic damage wherever rice is grown in Asia. It becomes the main disease due to wide distribution and most infection under favorable condition. The farmers have been applied several kinds of chemical fungicides that leading to the pathogen become resistant to those fungicides, and causes environmental pollution which the toxic chemicals residue in soil, water and surrounding environment. The significance of this research is to discover a new agricultural input as nanoparticles from Chaetomium to control the blast pathogen which will develop the nanoproduct to elicit immunity in rice, environmental protection and food safety.",

    "abstract": "Accurate population models are needed to build very large scale neural models, but their derivation is difficult for realistic networks of neurons, in particular when nonlinear properties are involved such as conductance-based interactions and spike-frequency adaptation. Here, we consider such models based on networks of Adaptive exponential Integrate and fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using a Master Equation formalism, we derive a mean-field model of such networks and compare it to the full network dynamics. The mean-field model is capable to correctly predict the average spontaneous activity levels in asynchronous irregular regimes similar to in vivo activity. It also captures the transient temporal response of the network to complex external inputs. Finally, the mean-field model is also able to quantitatively describe regimes where high and low activity states alternate (UP-DOWN state dynamics), leading to slow oscillations. We conclude that such mean-field models are \\\"biologically realistic\\\" in the sense that they can capture both spontaneous and evoked activity, and they naturally appear as candidates to build very large scale models involving multiple brain areas.",

We explore here whether a very high-risk MCI subgroup can be identified using cognitive assessments and structural neuroimaging. A multimodal signature of Alzheimers dementia was first extracted using machine learning tools in the ADNI1 sample, and was comprised of cognitive deficits across multiple domains as well as atrophy in temporal, parietal and occipital regions. We then validated the predictive value of this signature on two MCI cohorts. In ADNI1 (N=235), the presence of the signature predicted progression to dementia over three years with 80.4% positive predictive value, adjusted for a \\\"typical\\\" MCI baseline rate of 33% (95.6% specificity, 55.1% sensitivity). These results were replicated in ADNI2 (N=235), with 87.8% adjusted positive predictive value (96.7% specificity, 47.3% sensitivity). Our results demonstrate that, even for widely used markers, marked improvement in positive predictive value over the literature can be achieved by focusing on a subgroup of individuals with similar brain characteristics.

    "abstract": "The marbled crayfish is the only obligately parthenogenetic decapod crustacean and a novel research model and invasive animal on three continents. It is regarded either as a parthenogenetic form of slough crayfish Procambarus fallax or as a separate species named Procambarus virginalis. In order to investigate the species question of this unusual crayfish in detail we have identified the similarities and differences in morphology, life history, genetics, behaviour, ecology and biogeography between marbled crayfish and its most likely parent species P. fallax. We have investigated specimens from natural habitats, laboratory colonies and museum collections and performed a meta-analysis of our data and published data. Our COI based molecular tree with 27 Cambaridae confirms closest relationship of marbled crayfish with P. fallax. Marbled crayfish and P. fallax are similar with respect to morphological characters, coloration and body proportions, but differ considerably with respect to body size, fertility and longevity. The mitochondrial genes of both crayfish are similar, but ploidy level and haploid genome size are markedly different. Both crayfish are eurytopic and have two major annual recruitment periods, but marbled crayfish show different population structure and higher invasiveness. Marbled crayfish occur in tropical to cold temperate habitats of the old world, but P. fallax is confined to subtropical and warm-temperate habitats of the southeastern USA. Cross-breeding experiments with both crayfish revealed reproductive isolation. The application of the Evolutionary Genetic Species Concept for asexuals to all available data supports raising marbled crayfish from \\\"forma\\\" to species rank. A determination key is provided to discriminate Procambarus virginalis, the first asexual decapod species, from its parent species P. fallax.",

A frequent requirement of single cell expression analysis is the identification of markers which may explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. We propose a new marker selection strategy (SCMarker) to accurately delineate cell types in single cell RNA-sequencing data by identifying genes that have bi/multi-modally distributed expression levels and are co- or mutually-exclusively expressed with some other genes.

    "abstract": "Auxin is a key hormone performing a wealth of functions throughout the plant life cycle. It acts largely by regulating genes at the transcriptional level through a family of transcription factors (TF) called auxin response factors (ARF). Even if all ARF monomers analysed so far bind a similar DNA sequence, there is evidence that ARFs differ in their target genomic regions and regulated genes. Here we use position weight matrices (PWM) to model ARF DNA binding specificity based on published DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) data. We find that the genome binding of two ARFs (ARF2 and ARF5/Monopteros/MP) differ largely because these two factors have different preferred ARF binding site (ARFbs) arrangements (orientation and spacing). We illustrate why PWMs are more versatile to reliably identify ARFbs than the widely used consensus sequences and demonstrate their power with biochemical experiments on the regulatory regions of the IAA19 model gene. Finally, we combined gene regulation by auxin with ARF-bound regions and identified specific ARFbs configurations that are over-represented in auxin up-regulated genes, thus deciphering the ARFbs syntax functional for regulation. This provides a general method to exploit the potential of genome-wide DNA binding assays and decode gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of the protein dystrophin. In humans, DMD has early onset, causes developmental delays, muscle necrosis, loss of ambulation, and early death. Current animal models have been challenged by their inability to model the early onset and severity of the disease. Thus it remains unresolved if increased sarcoplasmic calcium observed in dystrophic muscles follows or leads the mechanical insults caused by the muscles disrupted contractile machinery. This knowledge has important applications for patients, as potential physiotherapeutic treatments may either help or exacerbate symptoms, depending on how dystrophic muscles differ from healthy ones. Recently we showed how burrowing dystrophic (dys-1) C. elegans recapitulate many salient phenotypes of DMD, including loss of mobility and muscle necrosis. Here we report dys-1 worms display early pathogenesis, including dysregulated sarcoplasmic calcium, and increased lethality. Sarcoplasmic calcium dysregulation in dys-1 worms precedes overt structural phenotypes (e.g. mitochondrial, and contractile machinery damage) and can be mitigated by silencing calmodulin expression. To learn how dystrophic musculature responds to altered physical activity, we cultivated dys-1 animals in environments requiring high amplitude, or high frequency of muscle exertion during locomotion. We find that several muscular parameters (such as size) improve with increased activity. However, longevity in dystrophic animals was negatively associated with muscular exertion, regardless of the duration of the effort. The high degree of phenotypic conservation between dystrophic worms and humans provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into the etiology of the disease, as well as the initial assessment of potential treatment strategies.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a degenerative disease affecting tens of thousands of people in the US alone. Much remains unknown about the disease, including the chain of events that links the loss of dystrophin to muscle death, or the extent to which exercise might be able to protect degenerating muscles. We used the nematode C. elegans to show that sarcoplasmic calcium dysregulation takes place in dystrophic muscles long before other overt signs of damage manifest. When placed in assays that altered muscular activity by increasing either contraction frequency or amplitude, we observed several metrics associated with muscular repair increase. However, no treatment positively affected the life expectancy of dystrophic animals.",

Although statistical evidence from individual studies has been mixed, it has been assumed that sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle activity could be used to distinguish between two neural circuits involved in movement triggering. We summarized meta-analytically the available evidence for this hypothesis, comparing the difference in premotor reaction time (RT) of actions where SCM activity was elicited (SCM+ trials) by loud acoustic stimuli against trials in which it was absent (SCM- trials). We found ten studies, all reporting comparisons between SCM+ and SCM- trials. Our mini meta-analysis showed that premotor RTs are faster in SCM+ than in SCM- trials. We also present experimental data showing the effects of foreperiod predictability can induce differences in RT that would be of similar size to those attributed to the activation of different neurophysiological pathways to trigger prepared actions. We discuss plausible physiological mechanisms that would explain differences in premotor RTs between SCM+ and SCM-trials.",

Here, we brought desert organisms together (rodents and vipers) from two deserts (Mojave and Negev). Both predators and prey in the Mojave have adaptations that give them competitive advantage compared to their middle-eastern counterparts. Heteromyid rodents, kangaroo rats and pocket mice, have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow the rodents to carry larger loads under predation risk compared to gerbilline rodents. Sidewinder rattlesnakes have heat-sensing pits, allowing them to hunt better on moonless nights when their Negev sidewinding counterpart, the Saharan horned vipers, are visually impaired. In behavioral-assays, we used giving-up density (GUD) to gage how each species of rodent perceived risk posed by known and novel snakes. We repeated this for the same set of rodents at first encounter and again two months later following intensive \\\"natural\\\" exposure to both snake species. Pre-exposure, all rodents identified their evolutionarily familiar snake as a greater risk than the novel one. However, post-exposure all identified the heat-sensing sidewinder rattlesnake as a greater risk. The heteromyids were more likely to avoid encounters with, and discern the behavioral difference among, snakes than their gerbilline counterparts.",

The drug was administered once a week, at an initial dose of 2 mg, then maintained at 0.5 mg once per week thereafter. The effects were evaluated by the histopathological synovitis score, in vivo imaging using indocyanine green liposomes, and analysis of the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines.\\n\\n[Results]Tissue analyses were carried out at 14, 17 and 20 weeks of age. The synovitis scores of treated groups were significantly lower compared with those of the control group at every age. The kappa coefficient was 0.77.

In vivo imaging using indocyanine green liposomes showed significant decreases in signal intensities of treated groups at week 14, but no significant differences were observed at week 18. Blood serum amyloid A levels in treated groups were significantly lower at 17 weeks of age. The gene expression levels of Tnf and Il17 were also significantly lower in MR16-1 treated groups.\\n\\n[Conclusions]Administration of the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody is effective for the treatment of synovitis and bone destruction of McH-lpr/lpr-RA1 mice.

    "abstract": "The allosteric enzyme, L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is activated by fructose 1,6-metaphosphate (FBP) to reduce pyruvate to lactate. The molecular details of the FBP-driven transition between the low affinity T-state to the high affinity R-state in LDH, a tetramer composed of identical subunits, are not known. The dynamics of theT[-&gt;]R allosteric transition, investigated using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) model, revealed that coordinated rotations of the subunits drive the T[-&gt;]R transition. We used the structural perturbation method (SPM), which requires only the static structure, to identify the allostery wiring diagram (AWD), a network of residues that transmits signals across the tetramer, as LDH undergoes the T[-&gt;]R transition. Interestingly, the residues that play a major role in the dynamics, which are predominantly localized at the interfaces, coincide with the AWD identified using the SPM. The conformational changes in the T[-&gt;]R transition start from the region near the active site, comprising of helix C, helix 1/2G, helix 3G and helix 2F, and proceed to other structural units, thus completing the global motion. Brownian dynamics simulations of the tetramer assembly, triggered by a temperature quench from the fully disrupted conformations, show that the bottleneck for assembly is the formation of the correct orientation between the subunits, requiring contacts between the interface residues. Surprisingly, these residues are part of the AWD, which was identified using the SPM. Taken together, our results show that LDH, and perhaps other multi-domain proteins, may have evolved to stabilize distinct states of allosteric enzymes using precisely the same AWD that also controls the functionally relevant allosteric transitions.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are conserved protein kinases that regulate a diverse array of cellular activities. Stress or mitogenic signals activate three primary branches of the greater MAPK cascade, each of which consists of a phosphorylation-dependent array of successively acting kinases. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) branch is regulated by growth factory signaling at the cell membrane, leading to phosphorylation of the dual-specificity kinase MEK1, which is dedicated to ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Previous studies have established a link between MAPK activation and endurance exercise, but whether a single MAPK is responsible for establishing muscle metabolic fate is unclear. Using mouse genetics we observed that muscle-specific expression of a constitutively active MEK1 promotes greater ERK1/2 signaling that mediates fiber-type switching in mouse skeletal muscle to a slow, oxidative phenotype with type I myosin heavy chain expression. Induced expression of the activated MEK1 mutant using either a MyoD-Cre or myosin light chain-Cre strategy equally increased the number of type I fibers in skeletal muscle with significantly reduced size compared to controls. Moreover, activation of MEK1 in mature myofibers of an adult mouse using a transgene containing a tamoxifen inducible MerCreMer cDNA under the control of a skeletal -actin promoter produced a similar phenotype of switching towards a slow-oxidative program. Physiologic assessment of mice with greater skeletal muscle slow-oxidative fibers showed enhanced metabolic activity and oxygen consumption with greater fatigue resistance of individual muscles. In summary, these results show that sustained MEK1-ERK1/2 activity in skeletal muscle produces a fast-to-slow fiber-type switch, suggesting that modulation of this signaling pathway may represent a therapeutic approach to enhance the long-term metabolic effectiveness of muscle in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a multifaceted region of cortex, contributing to several cognitive processes including sensorimotor integration and spatial navigation. Although recent years have seen a considerable rise in the use of rodents, particularly mice, to investigate PPC and related networks, a coherent anatomical definition of PPC in the mouse is still lacking. To address this, we delineated the mouse PPC using cyto- and chemoarchitectural markers from Nissl-, parvalbumin- and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2-staining. Additionally, we performed bilateral triple anterograde tracer injections in primary visual cortex (V1) and prepared flattened tangential sections from one hemisphere and coronal sections from the other, allowing us to co-register the cytoarchitectural features of PPC with V1 projections. In charting the location of extrastriate areas and the architectural features of PPC in the context of each other, we reconcile different, widely used conventions for demarcating PPC in the mouse. Furthermore, triple anterograde tracer injections in PPC showed strong projections to associative thalamic nuclei as well as higher visual areas, orbitofrontal, cingulate and secondary motor cortices. Retrograde circuit mapping with rabies virus further showed that all cortical connections were reciprocal. These combined approaches provide a coherent definition of mouse PPC that incorporates laminar architecture, extrastriate projections, thalamic, and cortico-cortical connections.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary responses to nutrition are key to understanding host shifts and the potential for reproductive isolation. Previously, experimental evolution was used to describe responses of the medfly (Ceratitis capitata) to divergent larval diets. Within 30 generations there was divergence in larval development time, egg to adult survival and adaptation in adult body size. In this study, the gene expression signatures associated with these changes were examined, using mRNA-seq on males following 60 generations of nutritional selection. Variation in gene expression was also validated using qRT-PCR. The results showed observed an over-representation of differential expression in metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and proteolysis genes. In addition, at generations 60 and 90, we tested whether these evolved patterns (differences in gene expression) were associated with mate choice. We found evidence for assortative mating by diet at generation 60, but not in mating tests within and between replicate lines at generation 90. Hence, there was no consistent evidence for assortative mating by diet, which emphasises the importance of replicate tests of evolutionary responses over time. Overall, the study provides the first genome-wide survey of the putative mechanisms underpinning evolved responses to nutritional adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The genetic mechanisms determining sex in teleost fishes are highly variable, ranging from a single gene to complex patterns of polygenic regulation. The master sex determining gene has only been identified in very few species and there is no information about the gene in the superorder Paracanthopterygii that includes the codfishes, toadfishes and anglerfishes. Here we characterize a male-specific region of 9 kb on linkage group 11 in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) harboring a single gene named zkY for zinc knuckle on the Y chromosome. A diagnostic PCR test of phenotypically sexed males and females of Atlantic cod confirmed the sex-specific nature of the Y-sequence. We searched for autosomal gene copies of zkY and identified twelve highly similar genes, of which eight (zk1-zk8) code for proteins containing the zinc knuckle motif. 3D structure modelling suggests that the amino acid changes observed in six of the eight copies might influence the putative RNA-binding specificity. Cod zkY and the autosomal proteins zk1 and zk2 possess an identical zinc knuckle structure, but only the Y-specific gene zkY was expressed at high levels in the developing larvae before the onset of sex differentiation. We propose that cod zkY functions as the master masculinization gene by coding for a suppressor of germ cell division in males. PCR amplification of Y-sequences in Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis) and Greenland cod (Gadus macrocephalus ogac) suggests that this novel sex determining mechanism emerged in codfishes more than 7.5 million years ago.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStudying the diverse sex determining genes in teleost fish may contribute to increase our understanding of sex chromosome evolution in vertebrates. To date, no sex determinant is known for the superorder Paracanthopterygii, comprising about 1340 species, including the commercially important Atlantic cod. In this study we characterize a Y-specific region of 9 kb on linkage group 11 containing a single gene named zkY for zinc knuckle on the Y chromosome. The gene is transcribed at high levels in larvae before commencement of sex differentiation and encodes a novel zinc knuckle protein that putatively binds RNA target sequences. We propose that cod zkY suppresses germ cell proliferation in the developing males by interacting with the germ-cell specific RNA regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Drought can severely limit plant growth and production. However, few studies have investigated gene expression profiles in maize during drought/re-watering. We compared drought-treated and water-sufficient maize plants by measuring their leaf relative water content, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities, proline content, and leaf gas exchange parameters (photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates). We conducted RNA sequencing analyses to elucidate gene expression profiles and identify miRNAs that might be related to drought resistance. A GO enrichment analysis showed that the common DEGs (differently expressed genes) between drought-treated and control plants were involved in response to stimulus, cellular process, metabolic process, cell part, and binding and catalytic activity. Analyses of gene expression profiles revealed that 26 of the DEGs under drought encoded 10 enzymes involved in proline synthesis, suggesting that increased proline synthesis was a key part of the drought response. We also investigated cell wall-related genes and transcription factors regulating abscisic acid-dependent and -independent pathways. The expression profiles of the miRNAs miR6214-3p, miR5072-3p, zma-miR529-5p, zma-miR167e-5p, zma-miR167f-5p, and zma-miR167j-5p and their relevant targets under drought conditions were analyzed.

In this study, we demonstrate that loss of Mt2 activity leads to an age dependent decline of immune function in the adult fly. A newly eclosed adult has mild immune defects that exacerbate in a fifteen-day old Mt2-/- fly. The age dependent effects appear to be systemic, including disturbances in lipid metabolism, changes in cell shape of hemocytes and significant fold changes in levels of transcripts related to host defense. Lipid imbalance, as measured by quantitative lipidomics, correlates with immune dysfunction with high levels of immunomodulatory lipids, sphingosine-1phosphate (S1P) and ceramides, along with low levels of storage lipids. Activity assays on fly lysates confirm the age dependent increase in S1P and concomitant reduction of S1P lyase activity. We hypothesize that Mt2 functions to regulate genetic loci such as S1P lyase and this regulation is essential for robust host defense as the animal ages. Our study uncovers novel links between age dependent Mt2 function, innate immune response and lipid homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is a potentially lethal gut pathogen that causes nosocomial and community acquired infections. Limited treatment options and reports of reduced susceptibility to current treatment emphasize the necessity for novel antimicrobials. The DNA-polymerase of gram-positive organisms is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials. ACX-362E (N2-(3<,4-Dichlorobenzyl)-7-(2-[1-morpholinyl]ethyl)guanine; MorE-DCBG) is a DNA polymerase inhibitor in pre-clinical development as a novel therapeutic against C. difficile infection. This synthetic purine shows preferential activity against C. difficile PolC over those of other organisms in vitro and is effective in an animal model of C. difficile infection. In this study we have determined its efficacy against a large collection of clinical isolates. At concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration, the presumed slowing (or stalling) of replication forks due to ACX-362E leads to a growth defect. We have determined the transcriptional response of C. difficile to replication inhibition and observed an overrepresentation of up-regulated genes near the origin of replication in the presence of PolC-inhibitors, but not when cells were subjected to sub-inhibitory concentrations of other antibiotics. This phenomenon can be explained by a gene dosage shift, as we observed a concomitant increase in the ratio between origin-proximal versus terminus-proximal gene copy number upon exposure to PolC-inhibitors. Moreover, we show that certain genes differentially regulated under PolC-inhibition are controlled by the origin-proximal general stress response regulator sigma factor B. Together, these data suggest that genome location both directly and indirectly determines the transcriptional response to replication inhibition in C. difficile.",

    "abstract": "In vitro and in vivo spiking activity clearly differ. Whereas networks in vitro develop strong bursts separated by periods of very little spiking activity, in vivo cortical networks show continuous activity. This is puzzling considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics and plasticity rules. We propose that the defining difference between in vitro and in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input. We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state. In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state generated by very low network input (< 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term stimulation, thereby opening new paths to establish an in vivo-like assay in vitro for basic as well as neurological studies.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cystopathy is a common urological complication of diabetes, and has been associated with changes in parasympathetic ganglionic transmission and some measures of neuronal excitability in male mice. To determine whether type II diabetes also impacts excitability of parasympathetic ganglionic neurons in females, we investigated neuronal excitability and firing properties, as well as underlying ion channel expression, in major pelvic ganglion (MPG) neurons in control, 10-week, and 21-week db/db mice. Type II diabetes in Leprdb/db animals caused a non-linear change in excitability and firing properties of MPG neurons. At 10 weeks, cells exhibited increased excitability as demonstrated by an increased likelihood of firing multiple spikes upon depolarization, decreased rebound spike latency, and overall narrower action potential half-widths as a result of increased depolarization and repolarization slopes. Conversely, at 21 weeks MPG neurons of db/db mice reversed these changes, with spiking patterns and action-potential properties largely returning to control levels. These changes are associated with numerous time-specific changes in calcium, sodium, and potassium channel subunit mRNA levels. However, Principal Components Analysis of channel expression patterns revealed that the rectification of excitability is not simply a return to control levels, but rather a distinct ion channel expression profile in 21-week db/db neurons. These data indicate that type II diabetes can impact the excitability of post-ganglionic, parasympathetic bladder-innervating neurons of female mice, and suggest that the non-linear progression of these properties with diabetes may be the result of compensatory changes in channel expression that act to rectify disrupted firing patterns of db/db MPG neurons.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or nonlinear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined EEG/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even \\\"traditional\\\", highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g. from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling (\\\"regression ERPs\\\"), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model (GAM) into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g. Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses.

    "abstract": "The root system is a major determinant of plant fitness. Its capacity to supply the plant with sufficient water and nutrients strongly depends on root system architecture, which arises from the repeated branching off of lateral roots. A critical first step in lateral root formation is priming, which prepatterns sites competent of forming a lateral root. Priming is characterized by temporal oscillations in auxin, auxin signalling and gene expression in the root meristem, which through growth become transformed into a spatially repetitive pattern of competent sites. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of auxin synthesis, transport and perception for the amplitude of these oscillations and their chances of producing an actual competent site. Additionally, repeated lateral root cap apoptosis was demonstrated to be strongly correlated with repetitive lateral root priming. Intriguingly, no single mutation has been identified that fully abolishes lateral root formation, and thusfar the mechanism underlying oscillations has remained unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of auxin reflux loop properties combined with root growth dynamics on priming, using a computational approach. To this end we developed a novel multi-scale root model incorporating a realistic root tip architecture and reflux loop properties as well as root growth dynamics. Excitingly, in this model, repetitive auxin elevations automatically emerge. First, we show that root tip architecture and reflux loop properties result in an auxin loading zone at the start of the elongation zone, with preferential auxin loading in narrow vasculature cells. Second, we demonstrate how meristematic root growth dynamics causes regular alternations in the sizes of cells arriving at the elongation zone, which subsequently become amplified during cell expansion. These cell size differences translate into differences in cellular auxin loading potential. Combined, these properties result in temporal and spatial fluctuations in auxin levels in vasculature and pericycle cells. Our model predicts that temporal priming frequency predominantly depends on cell cycle duration, while cell cycle duration together with meristem size control lateral root spacing.",

But the global benefit enzymes are rare, which can increase the yields of many chemical products for a cell factory such as E.coli. Two of these kinds of global benefit enzymes are the famous enzymes, D-fructose-6-phosphate D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase and D-Xylulose 5-phosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, of non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) published in Nature, which can improve the utilization ratio of carbon. We expect to find other global benefit enzymes. We use an integrated model, which integrated in silico model of E.coli and KEGG. By computation, we analyze the effect of adding each reaction from KEGG on the theoretical yields of several products with E.coli and find 83 enzymes that may be potentially global benefit enzymes. By comparison, we find about 30 of the 83 enzymes are better in improving the theoretical yields than the two enzymes of NOG.\\n\\nIn order to compare the global benefit enzymes with NOG, as an example, we select \\\"Glycerol:NADP+ oxidoreductase\\\" (GNO) which can increase the supply of NADPH in E.coli. But To increase the supply of reducing power, such as NADPH will probably increase the yield of chemicals in a cell factory. We use flux balance analysis method to testify our assumption.

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet-to-infrared fluorescence is a versatile and accessible assay modality, but is notoriously hard to multiplex due to overlap of wide emission spectra. We present an approach for fluorescence multiplexing using spectral imaging and combinatorics (MuSIC). MuSIC consists of creating new independent probes from covalently-linked combinations of individual fluorophores, leveraging the wide palette of currently available probes with the mathematical power of combinatorics. Probe levels in a mixture can be inferred from spectral emission scanning data. Theory and simulations suggest MuSIC can increase fluorescence multiplexing ~4-5 fold using currently available dyes and measurement tools. Experimental proof-of-principle demonstrates robust demultiplexing of nine solution-based probes using ~25% of the available excitation wavelength window (380-480 nm), consistent with theory. The increasing prevalence of white lasers, angle filter-based wavelength scanning, and large, sensitive multi-anode photo-multiplier tubes make acquisition of such MuSIC-compatible datasets increasingly attainable.",

The use of protein hydrogels as an ensemble approach to study the physics of domain unfolding is limited by the lack of scaling tools and by the complexity of the system. Here we propose a model to describe the biomechanical response of protein hydrogels based on the unfolding and extension of protein domains under force. Our model takes into account the contributions on the network dynamics of the molecules inside the gels, which have random cross-linking points and random topology. This model reproduces reported macroscopic visco-elastic effects and constitutes an important step toward using rheometry on protein hydrogels to scale down to the average mechanical response of protein molecules.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying virulence remains a central problem in human health, pest control, disease ecology, and evolutionary biology. Bacterial virulence is typically quantified by the LT50 (i.e. the time taken to kill 50% of infected hosts), however, such an indicator cannot account for the full complexity of the infection process, such as distinguishing between the pathogens ability to colonize vs. kill the hosts. Indeed, the pathogen needs to breach the primary defenses in order to colonize, find a suitable environment to replicate, and finally express the virulence factors that cause disease. Here, we show that two virulence attributes, namely pathogen lethality and invasiveness, can be disentangled from the survival curves of a laboratory population of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes exposed to three bacterial pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Salmonella enterica. We first show that the host population eventually experiences a constant mortality rate, which quantifies the lethality of the pathogen. We then show that the time necessary to reach this constant-mortality rate regime depends on the pathogen growth rate and colonization rate, and thus determines the pathogen invasiveness. Our framework reveals that Serratia marcescens is particularly good at the initial colonization of the host, whereas Salmonella enterica is a poor colonizer yet just as lethal once established. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on the other hand, is both a good colonizer and highly lethal after becoming established. The ability to quantitatively characterize the ability of different pathogens to perform each of these steps has implications for treatment and prevention of disease and for the evolution and ecology of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "How seed dispersal trajectory shifts with abiotic and biotic factors and what is the relationship between seed dispersal distance and dispersal trajectory are remain unclear. We used wind tunnel and video camera to track the seed dispersal trajectory of 7 Calligonum species with different appendages under the different wind speeds and the release heights. Dispersal trajectories and distances were determined by video analysis and spatial coordinate transformation. Based on perspective principle, 4 modes of trajectories were determined. Wind speed, seed mass and release height were the key factors determining seed dispersal trajectory modes. Release height and wind speed tended to have the strongest explanatory power on seeds with bristles and wings, respectively. Different trajectory modes lead to different dispersal distance, while the same dispersal distance can be the result of different trajectory modes. The proportion of species trajectory modes formed its trajectory spectrum. Wind speed tends to have strong influence on light and low-wind-loading seeds, release height tends to have that on heavy and high-wind-loading seeds. Species with high proportion of horizontal projectile and projectile have high dispersal capacity, vice versa. Therefore, trajectory spectrum of a species reveals its primary dispersal strategies and evolutionary consequences.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of target-enriched libraries is an efficient and cost-effective method for obtaining DNA sequence data from hundreds of nuclear loci for phylogeny reconstruction. Much of the cost associated with developing targeted sequencing approaches is preliminary data needed for identifying orthologous loci for probe design. In plants, identifying orthologous loci has proven difficult due to a large number of whole-genome duplication events, especially in the angiosperms (flowering plants). We used multiple sequence alignments from over 600 angiosperms for 353 putatively single-copy protein-coding genes to design a set of targeted sequencing probes for phylogenetic studies of any angiosperm lineage. To maximize the phylogenetic potential of the probes while minimizing the cost of production, we introduce a k-medoids clustering approach to identify the minimum number of sequences necessary to represent each coding sequence in the final probe set. Using this method, five to 15 representative sequences were selected per orthologous locus, representing the sequence diversity of angiosperms more efficiently than if probes were designed using available sequenced genomes alone. To test our approximately 80,000 probes, we hybridized libraries from 42 species spanning all higher-order lineages of angiosperms, with a focus on taxa not present in the sequence alignments used to design the probes. Out of a possible 353 coding sequences, we recovered an average of 283 per species and at least 100 in all species. Differences among taxa in sequence recovery could not be explained by relatedness to the representative taxa selected for probe design, suggesting that there is no phylogenetic bias in the probe set. Our probe set, which targeted 260 kbp of coding sequence, achieved a median recovery of 137 kbp per taxon in coding regions, a maximum recovery of 250 kbp, and an additional median of 212 kbp per taxon in flanking non-coding regions across all species. These results suggest that the Angiosperms353 probe set described here is effective for any group of flowering plants and would be useful for phylogenetic studies from the species level to higher-order lineages, including all angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "The most devastating nematodes to worldwide agriculture are the root-knot nematodes with Meloidogyne incognita being the most widely distributed and damaging species. This parasitic and ecological success seem surprising given its supposed obligatory clonal reproduction. Clonal reproduction has been suspected based on cytological observations but, so far, never confirmed by population genomics data. At the species level, M. incognita is highly polyphagous with thousands of host plants. However, the host range varies among different M. incognita isolates that may present distinct and more restricted host compatibilities. Historically, four  host races had been defined as a function of ranges of compatible and incompatible plants. We sequenced the genomes of 11 isolates across Brazil, covering these four distinct races to assess (i) how clonal reproduction is and (ii) how the level of genome variability associates with biological traits such as the host races, affected agronomic culture, and geographical distribution. By aligning the genomic reads of the isolates to the M. incognita reference genome assembly, we identified SNV and small-scale insertions/deletions. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium and 4-gametes test, showed no sign of recombination, confirming the clonal mode of reproduction of M. incognita. We showed that there are relatively few point variations between the different isolates, and these variations show no significant association with either the host races, the geographical origin of the samples or the host plant on which they have been collected. Due to the lack of phylogenetic signal underlying their existence, we recommend the discontinuation of the terminology  race. Overall, these results suggest that multiple gains and losses of parasitic abilities and adaptations to different environmental conditions account for the broad host spectrum and wide geographic distribution of M. incognita. Hence, this nematode constitutes a model species to study adaptability without sexual recombination and overall low genomic variations in animals.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal DNA encodes the structural RNAs of the ribosomes. Ribosomal DNA instability is a major contributor to aging in yeast, but its role in human aging and longevity is largely unknown. Human 45S rDNA encodes the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal RNAs; ranges in copy number from 60 to > 800 per cell, distributed as tandem repeats along the short arms of the five acrocentric chromosomes (p13, p14, p15, p21, and p22); and is prone to frequent homologous and non-homologous recombination. Here we present two multiplex quantitative PCR assays, one for 18S rDNA normalized to the single copy gene beta-globin (HBB), and the other for 5.8S rDNA normalized to the single copy gene albumin (ALB). Longitudinally-collected pairs of DNAs from bloods drawn approximately 16 years apart from 40 females and 39 males, aged < 1 to 77 years at first blood draw, from the Utah CEPH families were assayed. Ribosomal DNA copy number varied over a four-fold range between subjects and increased approximately 14% across the lifespan. Longitudinal within-individual gains in copy number up to +68% and losses down to -25% were observed, while repeated assays of single DNA samples varied approximately +/- 10%. While 18S and 5.8S rDNA tended to be gained and lost together, the 18S:5.8S ratio was also unstable longitudinally, with increases up to +19% and decreases down to -15% observed. The 18S:5.8S ratio at second draw, relative to that at first draw, increased significantly across the lifespan in males, but not in females. To our knowledge this is the first report of within-individual longitudinal changes in the human 18S and 5.8S rDNA copy numbers. These assays will facilitate investigations of the biology of ribosomal RNA genes and their roles in health and disease across the human lifespan.",

Diagnosing these diseases is necessary for optimal care, but it can involve the manual evaluation of hundreds of genetic variants per case, with many variants taking an hour to evaluate. Automatic gene-ranking approaches shorten this process by reporting which of the genes containing variants are most likely to be causing the patients symptoms. To use these tools, busy clinicians must manually encode patient phenotypes, which is a cumbersome and imprecise process. With 60 million patients expected to be sequenced in the next 7 years, a fast alternative to manual phenotype extraction from the clinical notes in patients medical records will become necessary.\\n\\nMethodsWe introduce ClinPhen: a fast, high-accuracy tool that automatically converts the clinical notes into a prioritized list of patient symptoms using HPO terms.\\n\\nResultsClinPhen shows superior accuracy to existing phenotype extractors, and when paired with a gene-ranking tool it significantly improve the latters performance.\\n\\nConclusionCompared to manual phenotype extraction, ClinPhen saves more than 5 hours per case in Mendelian diagnosis alone.

    "abstract": "As a ubiquitous bacterial secondary messenger, c-di-GMP plays key regulatory roles in processes such as bacterial motility and transcription regulation. CobB is the Sir2 family protein deacetylase that controls energy metabolism, chemotaxis and DNA supercoiling in many bacteria. Using an E.coli proteome microarray, we found that c-di-GMP strongly binds to CobB. Protein deacetylation assays showed that c-di-GMP inhibits CobB activity and thereby modulates the biogenesis of acetyl-CoA. Through mutagenesis studies, residues R8, R17 and E21 of CobB were shown to be required for c-di-GMP binding. Next, we found that CobB is an effective deacetylase of YdeH, a major diguanylate cyclase (DGC) of E.coli that is endogenously acetylated. Mass spectrometry analysis identified YdeH K4 as the major site of acetylation, and it could be deacetylated by CobB. Interestingly, deacetylation of YdeH enhances its stability and cyclase activity in c-di-GMP production. Thus, our work establishes a novel negative feedback loop linking c-di-GMP biogenesis and CobB-mediated protein deacetylation.",

A complementary theory of motor primitives has shown that natural movements can be described by the combination of relatively invariant sets of muscle synergies. Synergistic structures have been shown to be maintained and tuned during motor adaptations. Here we studied the influence of synergistic organization of movement at the muscular level on the way in which adaptations to a 45{degrees} clockwise visuomotor rotation are achieved and generalized. We confirm that adaptation is achieved by tuning a set of robust muscle synergies and we show that the same biomechanical adaptation can be achieved by differentially tuning the same synergies.

To leverage the wealth of information provided, algorithms are required that systematically translate the contained information into treatment recommendations based on existing genotype-phenotype associations.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed and tested algorithms for translation of pre-existing genotype data of over 44,000 participants of the Estonian biobank into pharmacogenetic recommendations. We compared the results obtained by whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing and genotyping using microarrays, and evaluated the impact of pharmacogenetic reporting based on drug prescription statistics in the Nordic countries and Estonia.\\n\\nResultsOur most striking result was that the performance of genotyping arrays is similar to that of whole genome sequencing, whereas exome sequencing is not suitable for pharmacogenetic predictions. Interestingly, 99.8% of all assessed individuals had a genotype associated with increased risks to at least one medication, and thereby the implementation of pharmacogenetic recommendations based on genotyping affects at least 50 daily drug doses per 1000 inhabitants.\\n\\nConclusionWe find that microarrays are a cost-effective solution for creating pre-emptive pharmacogenetic reports, and with slight modifications, existing databases can be applied for automated pharmacogenetic decision support for clinicians.",

    "abstract": "DNA assembly allows individual DNA constructs or designed mixtures to be assembled quickly and reliably. Most methods are either: (i) Modular, easily scalable and suitable for combinatorial assembly, but leave undesirable  scar sequences; or (ii) bespoke (non-modular), scarless but less suitable for construction of combinatorial libraries. Both have limitations for metabolic engineering. To overcome this trade-off we devised Start-Stop Assembly, a multi-part, modular DNA assembly method which is both functionally scarless and suitable for combinatorial assembly. Crucially, 3 bp overhangs corresponding to start and stop codons are used to assemble coding sequences into expression units, avoiding scars at sensitive coding sequence boundaries. Building on this concept, a complete DNA assembly framework was designed and implemented, allowing assembly of up to 15 genes from up to 60 parts (or mixtures); monocistronic, operon-based or hybrid configurations; and a new streamlined assembly hierarchy minimising the number of vectors. Only one destination vector is required per organism, reflecting our optimisation of the system for metabolic engineering in diverse organisms. Metabolic engineering using Start-Stop Assembly was demonstrated by combinatorial assembly of carotenoid pathways in E. coli resulting in a wide range of carotenoid production and colony size phenotypes indicating the intended exploration of design space.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/361626_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (45K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cdd32eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e394cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3ec8f5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb72e7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Compositional changes in the gut microbiota have been associated with a variety of medical conditions such as obesity, Crohns disease and diabetes. However, connecting microbial community composition to ecosystem function remains a challenge. Here, we introduce MICOM - a customizable metabolic model of the human gut microbiome. By using a heuristic optimization approach based on L2 regularization we were able to obtain a unique set of realistic growth rates that corresponded well with observed replication rates. We integrated adjustable dietary and taxon abundance constraints to generate personalized metabolic models for individual metagenomic samples. We applied MICOM to a balanced cohort of metagenomes from 186 people, including a metabolically healthy population and individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Model results showed that individual bacterial genera maintained conserved niche structures across humans, while the community-level production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was heterogeneous and highly individual-specific. Model output revealed complex cross-feeding interactions that would be difficult to measure in vivo. Metabolic interaction networks differed somewhat consistently between healthy and diabetic subjects. In particular MICOM predicted reduced butyrate and propionate production in a diabetic cohort, with restoration of SCFA production profiles found in healthy subjects following metformin treatment. Overall, we found that changes in diet or taxon abundances have highly personalized effects. We believe MICOM can serve as a useful tool for generating mechanistic hypotheses for how diet and microbiome composition influence community function. All methods are implemented in the open source Python package, which is available at https://github.com/micom-dev/micom.",

    "abstract": "One of the main outcome of quantitative genetics approaches to natural variation is to reveal the genetic architecture underlying the phenotypic space. Complex genetic architectures are described as including numerous loci (or alleles) with small-effect and/or low-frequency in the populations, interactions with the genetic background, environment or age... Linkage or association mapping strategies will be more or less sensitive to this complexity, so that we still have an unclear picture of its extent. By combining high-throughput phenotyping under two environmental conditions with classical QTL mapping approaches in multiple Arabidopsis thaliana segregating populations as well as advanced near isogenic lines construction and survey, we have attempted to push back the limits of our understanding of quantitative phenotypic variation. Integrative traits such as those related to vegetative growth used in this work (highlighting either cumulative growth, growth rate or morphology) all showed complex and dynamic genetic architecture with respect to the segregating population and condition. The more resolutive our mapping approach, the more complexity we uncover, with several instances of QTLs visible in near isogenic lines but not detected with the initial QTL mapping, indicating that our phenotyping resolution was less limiting than the mapping resolution with respect to the underlying genetic architecture. In an ultimate approach to resolve this complexity, we intensified our phenotyping effort to target specifically a 3Mb-region known to segregate for a major quantitative trait gene, using a series of selected lines recombined every 100kb. We discovered that at least 3 other independent QTLs had remained hidden in this region, some with trait- or condition-specific effects, or opposite allelic effects. If we were to extrapolate the figures obtained on this specific region in this particular cross to the genome- and species-scale, we would predict hundreds of causative loci of detectable phenotypic effect controlling these growth-related phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Some heritable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variants may slow the rate of aging. The European mitochondrial haplogroup K has previously been reported to be increased in frequency in centenarians and nonagenarians relative to its frequency in younger individuals, by standard case/control study designs. To select for mitochondrial genomes likely to carry beneficial genetic variants, we screened a large genealogical database (the Utah Population Database, UPDB) for mitochondrial lineages in which the frequency of survival past 90 years was significantly higher than in the general population, and also significantly higher than in close non-matrilineal relatives. We ranked 14,900 distinct matrilineages by the strength of their association with longevity. Full sequencing of the mtDNAs from a single individual from each of 53 matrilineages in the top longevity ranks and each of 374 control matrilineages from the general Utah population, followed by analyses of the mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, identified haplogroup K2 as the haplogroup most enriched in frequency by the longevity selection (Odds Ratio = 23.05). We then analyzed overall survival and cause-specific mortality in the several thousand individuals aged 40 years or older whose mtDNA genotypes could be imputed from the 374 fully sequenced control mtDNAs. In these control matrilineages Haplogroup K2 individuals (n=332) enjoyed a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk than the general population (HR=0.81), attributable in part to a significantly lower risk of dying from heart disease (HR=0.50), as well as lower (though not significantly lower) risks of dying from cancer (HR=0.72) and diabetes (HR=0.74). Furthermore, K2 was the only haplogroup in which mortality was reduced for all three of these common causes of death.",

    "abstract": "Most bacteria and archaea use similar proteins within their cell division machinery, which uses the tubulin homologue FtsZ as its central organiser. In Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria, FtsZ recruits cytosolic, transmembrane, periplasmic and outer membrane proteins, assembling the divisome that facilitates bacterial cell division. One such divisome component, FtsQ, a bitopic membrane protein with a globular domain in the periplasm, has been shown to interact with many other divisome proteins. Despite its otherwise unknown function, it has been shown to be a major divisome interaction hub. Here, we investigated the interactions of FtsQ with FtsB and FtsL, two small bitopic membrane proteins that act immediately downstream of FtsQ. In biochemical assays we show that the periplasmic domains of E. coli FtsB and FtsL interact with FtsQ, but not with each other. Our crystal structure of FtsB bound to the {beta} domain of FtsQ shows that only residues 64-87 of FtsB interact with FtsQ. A synthetic peptide comprising those 24 FtsB residues recapitulates the FtsQ:FtsB interactions. Protein deletions and structure-guided mutant analyses validate the structure. Furthermore, the same structure-guided mutants show cell division defects in vivo that are consistent with our structure of the FtsQ:FtsB complex that shows their interactions as they occur during cell division. Our work provides intricate details of the interactions within the divisome and also provides a tantalising view of a highly conserved protein interaction in the periplasm of bacteria that is an excellent target for cell division inhibitor searches.\\n\\nImportanceCells in most bacteria and archaea divide through a cell division process that is characterised through its filamentous organiser, FtsZ protein. FtsZ forms a ring structure at the division site and starts the recruitment of 10-20 downstream proteins that together form an elusive multi-protein complex termed divisome. The divisome is thought to facilitate many of the steps required to make two cells out of one. FtsQ and FtsB are part of the divisome, with FtsQ being a central hub, interacting with most of the other divisome components. Here we show for the first time how FtsQ interacts with its downstream partner FtsB and show that mutations that disturb the interface between the two proteins effectively inhibit cell division.",

Specific histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) have been shown to regulate exon splicing by either directly recruiting splice machinery or indirectly modulating transcriptional elongation. In this study, we hypothesized that hPTMs regulate expression of alternatively spliced genes for specific processes during differentiation. To address this notion, we applied an innovative machine learning approach to relate global hPTM enrichment to AS regulation during mammalian tissue development. We found that specific histone modifications, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1, play a dominant role in skipped exon selection among all the tissues and developmental time points examined. In addition, we used iterative random forest model to identify interactions of several hPTMs that associated with skipped exon selection during tissue development. Collectively, our data demonstrated a link between hPTMs and alternative splicing which will drive further experimental studies on the functional relevance of these modifications to alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "Poison frogs acquire chemical defenses from the environment for protection against potential predators. These defensive chemicals are lipophilic alkaloid toxins that are sequestered by poison frogs from dietary arthropods and stored in skin glands. Despite decades of research focusing on identifying poison frog toxins, we know relatively little about how environmental variation and subsequent arthropod availability impacts toxicity in poison frogs. We investigated how seasonal environmental variation influences poison frog toxin profiles through changes in the diet of the Climbing Mantella (Mantella laevigata). We collected M. laevigata females on the Nosy Mangabe island reserve in Madagascar during the wet and dry seasons and tested the hypothesis that seasonal differences in rainfall is associated with changes in the diet and skin toxin profiles of M. laevigata. The arthropod diet of each frog was characterized into five groups (i.e. ants, termites, mites, insect larvae, or  other) using visual identification and cytochrome oxidase 1 DNA barcoding. We found that frog diet differed between the wet and dry seasons, where frogs had a more diverse diet in the wet season and consumed a higher percentage of ants in the dry season. To determine if seasonality was associated with variation in frog defensive chemical composition, we used gas chromatography / mass spectrometry to quantify toxins from individual skin samples. Although the assortment of identified toxins was similar across seasons, we detected significant differences in the abundance of certain alkaloids, which we hypothesize reflects seasonal variation in the diet of M. laevigata. We suggest that these variations could originate from seasonal changes in either arthropod leaf litter composition or changes in frog behavioral patterns. Although additional studies are needed to understand the consequences of long-term environmental shifts, this work suggests that toxin profiles are relatively robust against short-term environmental perturbations.",

There has been considerable research on the pharmacological activities of ginsenosides contained in Panax spp.; however, very little is known about the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway. We reported the first de novo genome of 2.36 Gb of sequences from P. notoginseng with 35,451 protein-encoding genes. Compared to other plants, we found notable gene family contraction of disease-resistance genes in P. notoginseng, but notable expansion for several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subfamilies, such as the Gpdr subfamily, indicating that ABCs might be an additional mechanism for the plant to cope with biotic stress. Combining eight transcriptomes of roots and aerial parts, we identified several key genes, their transcription factor binding sites and all their family members involved in the synthesis pathway of ginsenosides in P. notoginseng, including dammarenediol synthase, CYP716 and UGT71. The complete genome analysis of P. notoginseng, the first in genus Panax, will serve as an important reference sequence for improving breeding and cultivation of this important nutraceutical and medicinal but vulnerable plant species.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) belongs to a group of enteroviruses that contain a single positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by an icosahedral capsid. Like common cold viruses, EV-D68 mainly causes respiratory infections and is acid labile. The molecular mechanism by which the acid sensitive EV-D68 virions uncoat and deliver their genome into a host cell is unknown. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we have determined the structures of the full native virion and an uncoating intermediate (the A(altered)-particle) of EV-D68 at 2.2 [A] and 2.7 [A] resolution. These structures showed that acid treatment of EV-D68 leads to particle expansion, externalization of the viral protein VP1 N-termini from the capsid interior, and formation of pores around the icosahedral two-fold axes through which the viral RNA can exit. Moreover, because of the low stability of EV-D68 at neutral pH, cryo-EM analyses of a mixed population of particles demonstrated the involvement of multiple structural intermediates during virus uncoating. Among these, a previously undescribed state, the expanded (\\\"E1\\\") particle, shows a majority of internal regions (e.g, the VP1 N-termini) to be ordered as in the full native virion. Thus, the E1 particle acts as an intermediate in the transition from full native virions to A-particles. Molecular determinants, including a histidine-histidine pair near the two-fold axes, were identified that facilitate this transition under acidic conditions. Thus, the present work delineates the pathway of EV-D68 uncoating and provides the molecular basis for the acid lability of EV-D68 and of the related common cold viruses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEnterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging pathogen that primarily causes childhood respiratory infections and is linked to neurological diseases. It was unclear how the virus uncoats and delivers its genome into a host cell to establish viral replication. Using high resolution cryo-electron microscopy, we showed that acid induces structural rearrangements of EV-D68 to initiate genome release from the virus. Structural analyses delineated a viral uncoating pathway that involves multiple distinct conformational states. Particularly, the structure of a previously unknown uncoating intermediate enabled the identification of molecular determinants that facilitate EV-D68 uncoating in an acidic environment. These results advance the knowledge of cell entry of EV-D68 and open up possibilities for developing antiviral therapeutics that impede structural rearrangements of the virus.",

For ten strains across five clades, we demonstrate that gp41 ectodomain (gp41ECTO) is the main source of envelope metastability by replacing wild-type gp41ECTO with BG505 gp41ECTO of the uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO) design. These gp41ECTO-swapped trimers can be produced in CHO cells with high yield and high purity. Crystal structure of a gp41ECTO-swapped trimer elucidates how a neutralization-resistant tier 3 virus evades antibody recognition of the V2 apex. UFO trimers of transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses and UFO trimers containing a consensus-based ancestral gp41ECTO suggest an evolutionary root of the metastability. Gp41ECTO-stabilized trimers can be readily displayed on 24- and 60-meric nanoparticles, with incorporation of additional T cell help illustrated for a hyperstable 60-mer.

Using novel technologies, we conducted an unprecedentedly detailed high-throughput analysis of sleep in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, coupled with a life-long chronic and specific sleep restriction. Our results show that some wild-type flies are virtually sleepless in baseline conditions and that complete, forced sleep restriction is not necessarily a lethal treatment in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. We also show that circadian drive, and not homeostatic regulation, is the main contributor to sleep pressure in flies. We propose a three-partite model framework of sleep function, according to which, total sleep accounts for three components: a vital component, a useful component, and an accessory component.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProtein  weaponry deployed in biological conflicts between selfish elements and their hosts are increasingly recognized as being re-purposed for diverse molecular adaptations in the evolution of several uniquely eukaryotic systems. The anti-restriction protein ArdC, transmitted along with the DNA during invasion, is one such factor deployed by plasmids and conjugative transposons against their bacterial hosts.\\n\\nResultsUsing sensitive computational methods we unify the N-terminal single-stranded DNA-binding domain of ArdC (ArdC-N) with the DNA-binding domains of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) XPC/Rad4 protein and Trypanosoma Tc-38 (p38) protein implicated in kinetoplast(k) DNA replication and dynamics. We show that the ArdC-N domain was independently acquired twice by eukaryotes from bacterial mobile elements. One gave rise to the  beta-hairpin domains of XPC/Rad4 and the other to the Tc-38-like proteins in the stem kinetoplastid. Eukaryotic ArdC-N domains underwent tandem duplications to form an extensive DNA-binding interface. In XPC/Rad4, the ArdC-N domain combined with the inactive transglutaminase domain of a peptide-N-glycanase originally derived from an active archaeal version, often incorporated in systems countering invasive DNA. We also show that parallel acquisitions from conjugative elements and bacteriophages gave rise to the Topoisomerase IA, DNA polymerases IB-Ds, and DNA ligases involved in kDNA dynamics.\\n\\nConclusionsWe resolve two outstanding questions in eukaryote-biology: 1) origin of the unique DNA lesion-recognition component of NER; 2) origin of the unusual, plasmid-like features of kDNA.

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans perceive the likability of high-dimensional \\\"objects\\\" such as faces is an important problem in both cognitive science and AI/ML. Existing models of human preferences generally assume these preferences to be fixed. However, human assessment of facial attractiveness have been found to be highly context-dependent. Specifically, the classical Beauty-in-Averageness (BiA) effect, whereby a face blended from two original faces is judged to be more attractive than the originals, is significantly diminished or reversed when the original faces are recognizable, or when the morph is mixed-race/mixed gender and the attractiveness judgment is preceded by a race/gender categorization. This effect, dubbed Ugliness-in-Averageness (UiA), has previously been attributed to a disfluency account, which is both qualitative and clumsy in explaining BiA. We hypothesize, instead, that these contextual influences on face processing result from the dependence of attractiveness perception on an element of statistical typicality, and from an attentional mechanism that restricts face representation to a task-relevant subset of features, thus redefining typicality within that subspace. Furthermore, we propose a principled explanation of why statistically atypical objects are less likable: they incur greater encoding or processing cost associated with a greater prediction error, when the brain uses predictive coding to compare the actual stimulus properties with those expected from its associated categorical prototype. We use simulations to show our model provides a parsimonious, statistically grounded, and quantitative account of contextual dependence of attractiveness. We also validate our model using experimental data from a gender categorization task. Finally, we make model predictions for a proposed experiment that can disambiguate the previous disfluency account and our statistical typicality theory.",

In this study, participants (N = 41) deployed a cognitive strategy based on reappraisal and imagination to regulate pain up or down on different trials while skin conductance responses (SCR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) activity were recorded. Using a machine learning approach, we first developed stimulus-locked SCR and ECG physiological markers predictive of pain ratings. The physiological markers demonstrated high sensitivity and moderate specificity in predicting pain across two datasets, including an independent test dataset (N = 84). When we tested the markers on the cognitive self-regulation data, we found that cognitive self-regulation had significant impacts on both pain ratings and pain-related physiology in accordance with regulatory goals. These findings suggest that self-regulation can impact autonomic nervous system responses to painful stimuli and provide pain-related autonomic profiles for future studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common, complex, and heterogeneous disease impacting aging populations. Determining the landscape of disease progression trajectories from midlife to senior age in a \\\"real-world\\\" context allows us to better understand the progression of CKD, the heterogeneity of progression patterns among the risk population, and the interactions with other clinical conditions. Genetics also plays an important role. In previous work, we and others have demonstrated that African Americans with high-risk APOL1 genotypes are more likely to develop CKD, tend to develop CKD earlier, and the disease progresses faster. Diabetes, which is more common in African Americans, also significantly increases risk for CKD.\\n\\nData and MethodElectronic medical records (EMRs) were used to outline the first CKD progression trajectory roadmap for an African American population with type 2 diabetes. By linking participants in 5 genome-wide association study (GWAS) to their clinical records at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (WFBMC), an EMR-GWAS cohort was established (n = 1,581). Patients health status was described by 18 Essential Clinical Indices across 84,009 clinical encounters. A novel graph learning algorithm, Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction Tree (DDRTree) was implemented, to establish the trajectories of declines in health. Moreover, a prediction model for new patients was proposed along the learned graph structure. We annotated these trajectories with clinical and genomic features including kidney function, other major risk indices of CKD, APOL1 genotypes, and age. The prediction power of the learned disease progression trajectories was further examined using the k-nearest neighbor model.\\n\\nResultsThe CKD progression trajectory roadmap revealed diverse kidney failure pathways associated with different clinical conditions. Specifically, we identified one high-risk trajectory and two low-risk trajectories. Switching pathways from low-risk trajectories to the high-risk one was associated with accelerated decline in kidney function. On this roadmap, patients with APOL1 high-risk genotypes were enriched in the high-risk trajectory, suggesting fundamentally different disease progression mechanisms from those without APOL1 risk genotypes. The k-nearest neighbor-based prediction showed effective prediction rate of 87%.\\n\\nConclusionThe CKD progression trajectory roadmap revealed novel diverse renal failure pathways in African Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus and highlights disease progression patterns that associate with APOL1 renal-risk genotypes.",

Chromosome structural variation may underpin intraspecific diversity and complex phenotypes2 by reducing recombination within supergenes containing linked, co-adapted alleles. Connecting ecologically-relevant phenotypes to genomic variation can enable more precise conservation of exploited marine species by protecting important genetic diversity3,4. Here, using genome-wide association analysis of a 12K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array we confirm that an ancient, derived chromosomal rearrangement consisting of two adjacent inversions is strongly associated with migratory phenotype and individual-level genetic structure in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) across the Northwest Atlantic. The presence of all identified migration-associated loci within this rearrangement indicates that pervasive variation in migration phenotype is in part controlled by a recombination-resistant supergene, facilitating fine-scale individual phenotypic variation within Northern cod. Furthermore, we reconstruct trends in effective population size over the last century, and find genomic signatures of population collapse, and different patterns of population expansion and decline among individuals based on supergene alleles. We demonstrate declines in effective population size consistent with the onset of industrialized harvest (post 1950) and substantially reduced effective size of individuals homozygous for the derived chromosomal rearrangement relative to heterozygous individuals or those homozygous for the ancestral version of this chromosomal region. These results illustrate how chromosomal structural diversity can mediate fine-scale genetic and phenotypic variation in a highly connected marine species, and suggest a loss of biocomplexity from a migration-associated supergene within Northern cod by overfishing.",

The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the construction of confidence and the information incorporated into these judgements are of increasing interest. Investigating these mechanisms requires principled and practically applicable measures of confidence and metacognition. Unfortunately, current measures of confidence are subject to distortions from decision biases and task performance. Motivated by a recent signal-detection theoretic behavioural measure of metacognitive sensitivity, known as meta-[d], here we present a quantitative behavioural measure of confidence that is invariant to decision bias and task performance. This measure, which we call m-distance, captures in a principled way the propensity to report decisions with high (or low) confidence. Computational simulations demonstrate the robustness of m-distance to decision bias and task performance, as well as its behaviour under conditions of high and low metacognitive sensitivity and under dual-channel and hierarchical models of metacognition. The introduction of the m-distance measure will enhance systematic quantitative studies of the behavioural expression and neurocognitive basis of subjective confidence.",

    "abstract": "The human ability to use different tools demonstrates our capability of forming and maintaining multiple, context specific motor memories. Experimentally, this ability has been investigated in dual adaptation, where participants adjust their reaching movements to opposing visuomotor transformations. Adaptation in these paradigms occurs by distinct processes, i.e. the development of explicit aiming strategies for each transformation and/or the implicit acquisition of distinct visuomotor mappings. The presence of distinct, transformation-dependent aftereffects has been interpreted as support for the latter. Alternatively, however, distinct aftereffects could reflect adaptation of a single visuomotor map, which is locally adjusted in different regions of the workspace. Indeed, recent studies suggest that explicit aiming strategies direct where in the workspace implicit adaptation occurs.\\n\\nDisentangling these possibilities is critical to understanding how humans acquire and maintain separate motor memories for different skills and tools. We therefore investigated generalization of explicit and implicit adaptation to different directions after participants practiced two opposing cursor rotations, which were associated with separate visual workspaces. Whereas participants learned to compensate opposing rotations by explicit strategies that were specific to the visual workspace cue, aftereffects were not sensitive to visual workspace cues. Instead, aftereffects displayed bimodal generalization patterns that appeared to reflect locally limited learning of both transformations. By varying target arrangements and instructions, we show that these generalization patterns are consistent with implicit adaptation that generalizes locally around (explicit) movement plans associated with opposing visuomotor transformations. Our findings show that strategies can shape implicit adaptation in a complex manner.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyVisuomotor dual adaptation experiments have identified contextual cues that enable learning of separate visuomotor mappings, but little is known about the underlying representations of learning. We report that visual workspace separation as a contextual cue enables participants to compensate opposing cursor rotations by a combination of explicit and implicit processes: Learners developed context-dependent explicit aiming strategies while an implicit visuomotor map represented dual adaptation independent from context by local adaptation around the explicit movement plan.",

While several studies have suggested a role for frontal brain areas in enhancing task-related representations in visual cortices, especially the lateral-occipital cortex, they remained silent about the type of information transferred to visual areas. However, the recently developed method of representational causality analysis, allowed us to track the movement of different types of information in the brain. Accordingly, we designed an EEG object detection experiment and evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of category- and target-related information across the brain using. Results showed that the prefrontal area initiated the processing of target-related information. This information was then transferred to posterior brain areas during stimulus presentation to facilitate object detection and to direct the decision-making procedure. We also observed that, as compared to category-related information, the target-related information could predict the behavioral detection performance more accurately, suggesting the dominant representation of internal compared to external information in brain signals. These results provided new evidence about the role of prefrontal cortices in the processing of task-related information the brain during object detection.",

We tested subspace invariance in mouse primary visual cortex by measuring the angle between the population response to a plaid and the plane spanned by the population responses to its individual components. We found robust violations of subspace invariance, represented by a median angular deviation of ~55 deg. The cause of this departure is a strong, negative correlation between the mean responses a neuron to the individual gratings and its response to the plaid. We suggest that an early nonlinearity may distort the power distribution of grating and plaid stimuli such that plaids have a prominent power component at {+/-}45 deg off the fundamental orientations. We conclude that subspace invariance does not hold in mouse V1. This finding rules out a large class of possible models of population coding, including vector averaging and gain control.",

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard method to correct for population stratification in ancestry-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and is used to cluster individuals by ancestry. Using the 1000 genomes project data, we examine how non-linear dimensionality reduction methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) or generative topographic mapping (GTM) can be used to provide improved ancestry maps by accounting for a higher percentage of explained variance in ancestry, and how they can help to estimate the number of principal components necessary to account for population stratification. GTM also generates posterior probabilities of class membership which can be used to assess the probability of an individual to belong to a given population - as opposed to t-SNE, GTM can be used for both clustering and classification. This paper is a first application of GTM for ancestry classification models. Our maps and software are available online.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWith this paper, we seek to encourage researchers working in genetics to use other methods than PCA to visualize ancestry and identify substructures in populations. We propose to use methods which do not only allow visualization of ancestry, but also the estimation of probabilities of belonging to different ancestry groups.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrently, the early pre-clinical detection of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is difficult as biomarkers are not specific for the cardiomyopathic process. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to heart failure remain elusive, highlighting the need for identification of cardiac-specific markers. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and its ligand ghrelin are present in cardiac tissue and are known to contribute to myocardial energetics. Here, we examined tissue ghrelin-GHSR levels as specific markers of cardiac dysfunction in patients who underwent cardiac transplantation.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsSamples of cardiac tissue were obtained from 10 cardiac transplant patients at the time of organ harvesting, and during serial post-transplant biopsies. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy using a novel fluorescent ghrelin analog was used to measure levels of GHSR, and immunofluorescence was used to measure levels of ghrelin, b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and tissue markers of cardiomyocyte contractility and growth. GHSR and ghrelin expression levels were highly variable in the explanted heart, less in the grafted heart biopsies. GHSR and ghrelin were strongly positively correlated, and both markers were negatively correlated with LV ejection fraction. Ghrelin had stronger positive correlations than BNP with the signaling markers for contractility and growth.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest that GHSR-ghrelin have potential use as an integrated marker of cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, tissue ghrelin appeared to be a more sensitive indicator than BNP to the biochemical processes that are characteristic of heart failure. This work allows for further use of ghrelin-GHSR to interrogate cardiac-specific biochemical mechanisms in pre-clinical stages of HF.\\n\\nPrecisThis study shows the relationships between GHSR, ghrelin, and signaling molecules with relation to heart function in human heart failure with tissue from diseased heart and healthy heart biopsies.",

Here, we use the generalist parasitic plant genus Euphrasia to investigate life history trait variation, in particular whether there is a trade-off between growth and reproduction, and how life history traits are affected by host quality.\\n\\nMethodsWe perform a common garden experiment to evaluate life history trait differences between eleven Euphrasia taxa grown on a common host, document phenotypic plasticity when a single Euphrasia species is grown on eight different hosts, and relate our observations to trait differences recorded in the wild.\\n\\nKey resultsEuphrasia exhibit a range of life history strategies that differ between species that transition rapidly to flower at the expense of early season growth, and those that invest in vegetative growth and delay flowering. Many life history traits show extensive phenotypic plasticity in response to host quality and demonstrate the costs of attaching to a low-quality host.\\n\\nConclusionsCommon garden experiments reveal trait differences between taxonomically complex Euphrasia species that are characterised by postglacial speciation and hybridisation. Our experiments suggest life history strategies in this generalist parasitic plant genus are the product of natural selection on traits related to growth and flowering.

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that introgressed Neandertal DNA was subjected to negative selection in modern humans due to deleterious alleles that had accumulated in the Neandertals after they split from the modern human lineage. A striking observation in support of this is an apparent monotonic decline in Neandertal ancestry observed in modern humans in Europe over the past 45 thousand years. Here we show that this apparent decline is an artifact caused by gene flow between West Eurasians and Africans, which is not taken into account by statistics previously used to estimate Neandertal ancestry. When applying a more robust statistic that takes advantage of two high-coverage Neandertal genomes, we find no evidence for a change in Neandertal ancestry in Western Europe over the past 45 thousand years. We use whole-genome simulations of selection and introgression to investigate a wide range of model parameters, and find that negative selection is not expected to cause a significant long-term decline in genome-wide Neandertal ancestry. Nevertheless, these models recapitulate previously observed signals of selection against Neandertal alleles, in particular a depletion of Neandertal ancestry in conserved genomic regions that are likely to be of functional importance. Thus, we find that negative selection against Neandertal ancestry has not played as strong a role in recent human evolution as had previously been assumed.",

    "abstract": "A gene drive biases the transmission of a particular allele of a gene such that it is inherited at a greater frequency than by random assortment. Recently, a highly efficient gene drive was developed in insects, which leverages the sequence-targeted DNA cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas9 and endogenous homology directed repair mechanisms to convert heterozygous genotypes to homozygosity. If implemented in laboratory rodents, this powerful system would enable the rapid assembly of genotypes that involve multiple genes (e.g., to model multigenic human diseases). Such complex genetic models are currently precluded by time, cost, and a requirement for a large number of animals to obtain a few individuals of the desired genotype. However, the efficiency of a CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive system in mammals has not yet been determined. Here, we utilize an active genetic \\\"CopyCat\\\" element embedded in the mouse Tyrosinase gene to detect genotype conversions after Cas9 activity in the embryo and in the germline. Although Cas9 efficiently induces double strand DNA breaks in the early embryo and is therefore highly mutagenic, these breaks are not resolved by homology directed repair. However, when Cas9 expression is limited to the developing female germline, resulting double strand breaks are resolved by homology directed repair that copies the CopyCat allele from the donor to the receiver chromosome and leads to its super-Mendelian inheritance. These results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive mechanism can be implemented to simplify complex genetic crosses in laboratory mice and also contribute valuable data to the ongoing debate about applications to combat invasive rodent populations in island communities.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid breeding programs are driven by the potential to explore the heterosis phenomenon in traits with non-additive inheritance. Traditionally, progress has been achieved by crossing lines from different heterotic groups and measuring phenotypic performance of hybrids in multiple environment trials. With the reduction in genotyping prices, genomic selection has become a reality for phenotype prediction and a promising tool to predict hybrid performances. However, its prediction ability is directly associated with models that represent the trait and breeding scheme under investigation. Herein, we assess modelling approaches where dominance effects and multi-environment statistical are considered for genomic selection in maize hybrid. To this end, we evaluated the predictive ability of grain yield and grain moisture collected over three production cycles in different locations. Hybrid genotypes were inferred in silico based on their parental inbred lines using single-nucleotide polymorphism markers obtained via a 500k SNP chip. We considered the importance to decomposes additive and dominance marker effects into components that are constant across environments and deviations that are group-specific. Prediction within and across environments were tested. The incorporation of dominance effect increased the predictive ability for grain production by up to 30% in some scenarios. Contrastingly, additive models yielded better results for grain moisture. For multi-environment modelling, the inclusion of interaction effects increased the predictive ability overall. More generally, we demonstrate that including dominance and genotype by environment interactions resulted in gains in accuracy and hence could be considered for genomic selection implementation in maize breeding programs.",

The major eukaryotic deadenylase complex CCR4-NOT contains two deadenylase components, CCR4 and CAF1 for which mammalian CCR4 is encoded by Cnot6 or Cnot6l paralogs. We show that Cnot6l apparently supplies the majority of CCR4 in the maternal CCR4-NOT complex in mouse, hamster, and bovine oocytes. Deletion of Cnot6l yielded viable mice but Cnot6l-/- females exhibited ~40% smaller litter size. The main onset of the phenotype was post-zygotic: fertilized Cnot6l-/- eggs developed slower and arrested more frequently than Cnot6l+/- eggs suggesting that maternal CNOT6L is necessary for accurate oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET). Transcriptome analysis revealed major transcriptome changes in Cnot6l-/- ovulated eggs and 1-cell zygotes. In contrast, minimal transcriptome changes in preovulatory Cnot6l-/- oocytes were consistent with reported Cnot6l mRNA dormancy. A minimal overlap between transcripts sensitive to decapping inhibition and Cnot6l loss suggests that decapping and CNOT6L-mediated deadenylation selectively target distinct subsets of mRNAs during OET in mouse.",

    "abstract": "Assessments of the mouse visual system based on spatial frequency analysis imply that its visual capacity is low, with few neurons responding to spatial frequencies greater than 0.5 cycles/degree. However, visually-mediated behaviors, such as prey capture, suggest that the mouse visual system is more precise. We introduce a new stimulus class--visual flow patterns--that is more like what the mouse would encounter in the natural world than are sine-wave gratings but is more tractable for analysis than are natural images. We used 128-site silicon microelectrodes to measure the simultaneous responses of single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of alert mice. While holding temporal-frequency content fixed, we explored a class of drifting patterns of black or white dots that have energy only at higher spatial frequencies. These flow stimuli evoke strong visually-mediated responses well beyond those predicted by spatial frequency analysis. Flow responses predominate in higher spatial-frequency ranges (0.15-1.6 cycles/degree); many are orientation- or direction-selective; and flow responses of many neurons depend strongly on sign of contrast. Many cells exhibit distributed responses across our stimulus ensemble. Together, these results challenge conventional linear approaches to visual processing and expand our understanding of the mouses visual capacity to behaviorally-relevant ranges.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe visual system of the mouse is now widely studied as a model for development and disease in humans. Studies of its primary visual cortex (V1) using conventional grating stimuli to construct linear-nonlinear receptive fields suggest that the mouse must have very poor vision. Using novel stimuli resembling the flow of images across the retina as the mouse moves through the grass, we find that most V1 neurons respond reliably to very much finer details of the visual scene than previously believed. Our findings suggest that the conventional notion of a unique receptive field does not capture the operation of the neural network in mouse V1.",

    "abstract": "Heterosis (hybrid vigor) and inbreeding depression, commonly considered as corollary phenomena, could nevertheless be decoupled under certain assumptions according to theoretical population genetics works. In order to explore this issue on real data, we analyzed the components of genetic variation in a population derived from a half-diallel cross between strains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. uvarum, two related yeast species involved in alcoholic fermentation. A large number of phenotypic traits, either molecular (coming from quantitative proteomics) or related to fermentation and life-history, were measured during alcoholic fermentation. Because the parental strains were included in the design, we were able to distinguish between inbreeding effects, which measures phenotypic differences between inbred and hybrids, and heterosis, which measures phenotypic differences between a specific hybrid and the other hybrids sharing a common parent. The sources of phenotypic variation differed depending on the temperature, indicating the predominance of genotype by environment interactions. Decomposing the total genetic variance into variances of additive (intra- and inter-specific) effects, of inbreeding effects and of heterosis (intra- and inter-specific) effects, we showed that the distribution of variance components defined clear-cut groups of proteins and traits. Moreover, it was possible to cluster fermentation and life-history traits into most proteomic groups. Within groups, we observed positive, negative or null correlations between the variances of heterosis and inbreeding effects. To our knowledge, such a decoupling had never been experimentally demonstrated. This result suggests that, despite a common evolutionary history of individuals within a species, the different types of traits have been subject to different selective pressures.",

    "abstract": "Clonal cells of exponentially growing populations vary substantially from cell to cell. The main drivers of this heterogeneity are the population dynamics and stochasticity in the intracellular reactions, which are commonly studied separately. Here we develop an agent-based framework that allows tracking of the biochemical dynamics in every single cell of a growing population that accounts for both of these factors. Apart from the common intrinsic variability of the biochemical reactions, the framework also predicts extrinsic noise arising from fluctuations in the histories of cells without the need to introduce fluctuating rate constants. Instead, these extrinsic fluctuations are explained by cell cycle fluctuations and differences in cell age, which are ubiquitously observed in growing populations. We give explicit formulas to quantify mean molecule numbers, intrinsic and extrinsic noise statistics as measured in two-colour experiments. We find that these statistics may differ significantly depending on the experimental setup used to observe the cells. We illustrate this fact using (i) averages over an isolated cell lineage tracked over many generations as observed in the mother machine, (ii) snapshots of a growing population with known cell ages as recorded in time-lapse microscopy, and (iii) snapshots of unknown cell ages as measured from static images. Our integrated approach applies to arbitrary biochemical networks and generation time distributions. By employing models of stochastic gene expression and feedback regulation, we elucidate that isolated lineages, as compared to snapshot data, can significantly overestimate the mean number of molecules, overestimate extrinsic noise but underestimate intrinsic noise and have qualitatively different sensitivities to cell cycle fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "AimAlthough various theories have been proposed to explain the outstanding endemism of plants in the Cerrado, four hypotheses about the mechanisms of diversification and distribution are most supported: (1) plateau/valley, (2) stable/unstable climate, (3) core/peripheral distribution, and (4) soil fertility. The first argues that plateaus harbor more ancient lineages than valleys and therefore presents higher endemism. The second theory suggests that climatic stable environments maintained more paleoendemic species. The third scenario attributes the distribution of endemism to gradients of conditions available to locally adapted species and predicts higher endemism in nuclear than in marginal areas. The last theory suggests that lower fertility soils account for higher endemism due to the habitat specialization of its species. We compared endemism patterns with the predictions of each theory to discuss their importance.\\n\\nLocationBrazil.\\n\\nTime periodQuaternary.\\n\\nMajor taxa studiedAngiosperms.\\n\\nMethodsWe mapped the endemism using records of 311 plant species of the Cerrado and applied spatial analysis and distribution models to summarize the importance of each predictor of endemism.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 28 areas in which the higher endemism of Cerrado plants were concentrated and presented a map of its distribution. We found correlations among endemism, climate stability, elevation, and marginality, which supported the plateau/valley, core/peripheral, and stable/unstable hypotheses. No association between soil fertility and endemism was detected. We propose that plateaus are more stable climatic environments, and this characteristic along with their elevation and centrality are predictive of endemism.\\n\\nMain conclusionsWe concluded that most of the endemism is concentrated in overlapping areas of stability of species, which are concentrated in higher elevation central regions. Soil fertility was not linked to endemism. We recommend that central plateaus in the Cerrado require special attention in conservation to optimize the protection of endemic species in the biome.",

Here we exploit the relationship between Wrights FST and average coalescence times to develop an analytic theory describing how FST depends on both the distance and time separating pairs of sampled genomes. We apply this theory to several simple models of population history. If there is a time series of samples, partial population replacement creates a discontinuity in pairwise FST values. The magnitude of the discontinuity depends on the extent of replacement. In stepping-stone models, pairwise FST values between archaic and present-day samples reflect both the spatial and temporal separation. At long distances, an isolation by distance pattern dominates. At short distances, the time separation dominates. Analytic predictions fit patterns generated by simulations. We illustrate our results with applications to archaic samples from European human populations. We compare present-day samples with a pair of archaic samples taken before and after a replacement event.",

One typical demonstration of this is that the rate of auditory flutter assimilates the rate of concurrent visual flicker. To date, however, this auditory dominance effect has largely been studied using regular auditory rhythms. It thus remains unclear whether irregular rhythms would have a similar impact on visual temporal processing; what information is extracted from the auditory sequence that comes to influence visual timing; and how the auditory and visual temporal rates are integrated together in quantitative terms. We investigated these questions by assessing, and modeling, the influence of a task-irrelevant auditory sequence on the type of \\\"Ternus apparent motion\\\": group motion versus element motion. The type of motion seen critically depends on the time interval between the two Ternus display frames. We found that an irrelevant auditory sequence preceding the Ternus display modulates the visual interval, making observers perceive either more group motion or more element motion. This biasing effect manifests whether the auditory sequence is regular or irregular, and it is based on a summary statistic extracted from the sequential intervals: their geometric mean. However, the audiovisual interaction depends on the discrepancy between the mean auditory and visual intervals: if it becomes too large, no interaction occurs - which can be quantitatively described by a partial Bayesian integration model. Overall, our findings reveal a crossmodal perceptual averaging principle that may underlie complex audiovisual interactions in many everyday dynamic situations.",

    "abstract": "Infancy is the foundational period for learning from adults, and the dynamics of the social environment have long been proposed as central to childrens development. Here we reveal a novel, highly naturalistic approach for studying live interactions between infants and adults. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we simultaneously and continuously measured the brains of infants (9-15 months) and an adult while they communicated and played with each other in real time. We found that time-locked neural coupling within dyads was significantly greater when they interacted with each other than with control individuals. In addition, we found that both infant and adult brains continuously tracked the moment-to-moment fluctuations of mutual gaze, infant emotion, and adult speech prosody with high temporal precision. This investigation advances what is currently known about how the brains and behaviors of infants both shape and reflect those of adults during real-life communication.",

    "abstract": "Central to the concept of the  cognitive map is that it confers behavioural flexibility, allowing animals to take efficient detours, exploit shortcuts and realise the need to back-track rather than persevere on a poorly chosen route. The neural underpinnings of such naturalistic and flexible behaviour remain unclear. During fMRI we tested human subjects on their ability to navigate to a set of goal locations in a virtual desert island riven by lava, which occasionally shifted to block selected paths (necessitating detours) or receded to open new paths (affording shortcuts). We found that during self-initiated back-tracking, activity increased in frontal regions and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, while activity in regions associated with the core default-mode network was suppressed. Detours activated a network of frontal regions compared to shortcuts. Activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specifically increased when participants encountered new plausible shortcuts but which in fact added to the path (false shortcuts). These results help inform current models as to how the brain supports navigation and planning in dynamic environments.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAdaptation to change is important for survival. Although real-world spatial environments are prone to continual change, little is known about how the brain supports navigation in dynamic environments where flexible adjustments to route plans are needed. Here, we used fMRI to examine the brain activity elicited when humans took forced detours, identified shortcuts and spontaneously back-tracked along their recent path. Both externally and internally generated changes in the route activated the fronto-parietal attention network, whereas only internally generated changes generated increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex with a concomitant disengagement in regions associated with the default-mode network. The results provide new insights into how the brain plans and re-plans in the face of a changing environment.",
