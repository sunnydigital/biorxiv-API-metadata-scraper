    "abstract": "Diverging semi-isolated lineages either meet in narrow clinal hybrid zones, or have a mosaic distribution associated with environmental variation. Intrinsic reproductive isolation is often emphasized in the former and local adaptation in the latter, although both can contribute to isolation. Rarely these two patterns of spatial distribution are reported in the same study system. Here we report that the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus is subdivided into discrete panmictic entities by both types of hybrid zones. Along the European Atlantic coasts, a northern and a southern lineage meet in the southwest of France where they coexist in sympatry with little hybridization. In the Mediterranean Sea, two lineages have a mosaic distribution, associated with lagoon-like and marine habitats. A fifth lineage was identified in the Black Sea. Genetic homogeneity over large spatial scales contrasts with isolation maintained in sympatry or close parapatry at a fine scale. A high variation in locus-specific introgression rates provides additional evidence that partial reproductive isolation must be maintaining the divergence. Surprisingly, fixed differences between lagoon and marine populations in the Mediterranean Sea belong to the most differentiated SNPs between the two Atlantic lineages, against the genome-wide pattern of structure. These parallel outlier SNPs cluster on a single chromosome-wide island of differentiation. Since Atlantic lineages do not match the lagoon-sea habitat variation, genetic parallelism at the genomic island suggests a shared genetic barrier contributes to reproductive isolation in contrasting contexts -i.e. spatial vs. ecological. We discuss how a genomic hotspot of parallel differentiation could have evolved and become associated either with space or with a patchy environment in a single study system.",

    "abstract": "IL-7 is a key factor in T-cell immunity and IL7R polymorphisms are implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. IL7R mRNA is induced in stimulated monocytes in a genetically determined manner, yet a role for IL7R in monocyte biology remains unexplored. Here we characterize genetic regulation of IL7R at the protein level across multiple cell subsets and conditions in healthy individuals. We find monocyte surface and soluble IL7R (sIL7R) protein are markedly expressed in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We further demonstrate alleles of rs6897932, a non-synonymous IL7R polymorphism associated with susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis, Ankylosing Spondylitis and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, form the key determinant of both surface IL7R and sIL7R in the context of inflammation. No effect of this allele was observed in unstimulated monocytes or across lymphoid subsets. Production of sIL7R by monocytes greatly exceeded that of CD4+ T-cells, and was strongly associated with both rs6897932 genotype and expression of the splicing factor gene DDX39A. Stimulated monocytes were sensitive to exogenous IL-7, which elicits a defined transcriptional signature. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing of synovial fluid derived monocytes from patients with spondyloarthritis showed an enlarged subset of IL7R+ monocytes with a unique transcriptional profile that markedly overlaps that induced by IL-7 in-vitro and shows similarity to the previously described  Mono4 subset. These data demonstrate disease-associated genetic variants at IL7R specifically impact monocyte surface IL7R and sIL7R following innate immune stimulation, suggesting a previously unappreciated key role for monocytes in IL-7 pathway biology and IL7R-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins lamins A and C, cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and other diseases collectively known as laminopathies. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these diseases remain incompletely understood, but the muscle-specific defects suggest that mutations may render nuclei more susceptible to mechanical stress. Using three mouse models of muscle laminopathies, we found that Lmna mutations caused extensive NE abnormalities, consisting of chromatin protrusions into the cytoplasm and transient rupture of the NE in skeletal muscle cells. NE damage was associated with DNA damage, activation of DNA damage response pathways, and reduced viability. Intriguingly, NE damage resulted from nuclear migration in maturing skeletal muscle cells, rather than actomyosin contractility. NE damage and DNA damage was reduced by either depletion of kinesin-1 or disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. LINC complex disruption rescued myofiber function and viability in Lmna mutant myofibers, indicating that the myofiber dysfunction is the result of mechanically induced NE damage. The extent of NE damage and DNA damage in Lmna mouse models correlated with the disease onset and severity in vivo. Moreover, inducing DNA damage in wild-type muscle cells was sufficient to phenocopy the reduced cell viability of lamin A/C-deficient muscle cells, suggesting a causative role of DNA damage in disease pathogenesis. Corroborating the mouse model data, muscle biopsies from patients with LMNA muscular dystrophy revealed significant DNA damage compared to age-matched controls, particularly in severe cases of the disease. Taken together, these findings point to a new and important role of DNA damage as a pathogenic contributor for LMNA skeletal muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infection of the uterus is a normal event after parturition. While the healthy cow achieves uterine clearance early postpartum, cows unable to control the infection within 21 days after calving develop postpartum endometritis. Studies on the Microbial Ecology of the bovine reproductive tract have focused on either vaginal or uterine microbiomes. This is the first study that compares both microbiomes in the same animals. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the 16S rRNA gene showed that despite large differences associated to individuals, a shared community exist in vagina and uterus during the postpartum period. The largest changes associated with development of endometritis were observed at 7 days postpartum, a time when vaginal and uterine microbiomes were most similar. 16S rRNA Pyrosequencing of the vaginal microbiome at 7 days postpartum showed at least three different microbiome types that were associated with postpartum endometritis. All three microbiome types featured reduced bacterial diversity. Taken together, the above findings support a scenario where disruption of the compartmentalization of the reproductive tract during parturition results in the dispersal and mixing of the vaginal and uterine microbiomes, which subsequently are subject to differentiation. This microbial succession is likely associated to early clearance in the healthy cow. In contrast, loss of bacterial diversity and dominance of the microbiome by few bacterial taxa were related to a delayed succession in cows developing endometritis at 7 DPP.",

The Pv11 cell line, derived from embryos of the midge, shows desiccation tolerance by pretreatment with trehalose before desiccation; they can resume proliferation after rehydration. To address the underlying molecular mechanisms, we desiccated Pv11 cells after pretreatment with the medium containing trehalose and induced proliferation by rehydration. We collected the cells at each before and after desiccation and rehydration step and performed CAGE-seq of mRNA of those cells. By analysing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the results of CAGE-seq, we detected 384 DEGs after trehalose treatment and 14 DEGs after rehydration. Hierarchical clustering of the identified DEGs indicated that rehydration returns their expression pattern to that in the control culture state. DEGs involved in various stress responses, detoxification of harmful chemicals, and regulation of oxidoreduction were upregulated by trehalose treatment. DEGs for rehydration supported that DNA repair is one of the potential mechanisms involves recovery. This study provided initial insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the extreme desiccation tolerance of Pv11 cells with a potential for proliferation following rehydration.",

Disrupted glycosylation associated processes including atypical sphingolipid metabolism, reduced polysialylation of cell adhesion molecules, abnormal proteoglycan expression, and irregular glycan synthesis and branching have also been reported in this disorder. These pathways are regulated by the expression of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, classes of enzymes which comprise approximately 2% of the genome. Many glycosylation enzymes can participate in multiple glycosylation pathways and dysregulation of enzyme expression could represent a common mechanism leading to a variety of glycan processing deficits in schizophrenia. In matched pairs of elderly schizophrenia and comparison subject (N = 12 pairs) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we measured mRNA levels of 84 key glycosylation enzymes by qPCR array. We found dysregulated transcript expression of 36 glycosylation enzymes from 12 functional categories. All of the abnormally expressed enzymes demonstrated increased transcript expression in schizophrenia, and many altered enzymes are known to modify substrates that have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology this illness. These findings suggest that abnormal glycosylation enzyme expression in schizophrenia may contribute to dysregulation of multiple glycosylation pathways, and disruptions of these central cell signaling processes may underlie a variety of deficits in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) modulate attention, memory, and higher executive functioning, but it has remained unclear whether nAChR sub-receptors tap into different neural mechanisms of these functions. We therefore set out to contrast the contributions of selective alpha-7 nAChR and alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonists in mediating value learning and attentional filtering of distractors in the nonhuman primate. We found that the alpha-7 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 selectively enhanced the learning speed of feature values but did not modulate how salient distracting information was filtered from ongoing choice processes. In contrast, the selective alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonist ABT-089 did not affect learning speed but reduced distractibility. This double dissociation was dose-dependent and evident in the absence of systematic changes in overall performance, reward intake, motivation to perform the task, perseveration tendencies, or reaction times. These results suggest nicotinic sub-receptor-specific mechanisms consistent with (1) alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR specific amplification of cholinergic transients in prefrontal cortex linked to enhanced cue detection in light of interferences, and (2) alpha-7 nAChR specific activation prolonging cholinergic transients, which could facilitate subjects to follow-through with newly established attentional strategies when outcome contingencies change. These insights will be critical for developing function-specific drugs alleviating attention and learning deficits in neuro-psychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) of the non-human primate show neural firing correlations and synchronize at theta and beta frequencies during the monitoring and shifting of attention. These functional interactions might be based on synaptic connectivity that is equally efficacious in both directions, but it might be that there are systematic asymmetries in connectivity consistent with reports of more effective inhibition within the ACC than IPFC, or with a preponderance of ACC projections synapsing onto inhibitory neurons in the IPFC. Here, we tested effective ACC-IPFC connectivity in awake monkeys and report systematic asymmetries in the temporal patterning and latencies of effective connectivity as measured using electrical microstimulation. We found that ACC stimulation triggered evoked fields (EFPs) were more likely to be multiphasic in the IPFC than in the reverse direction, with a large proportion of connections showing 2-4 inflection points resembling resonance in the 20-30 Hz beta frequency range. Stimulation of ACC [-&gt;] IPFC resulted, on average, in shorter-latency EFPs than IPFC [-&gt;] ACC. Overall, latencies and connectivity strength varied more than two-fold depending on the precise anterior-to-posterior location of the connections. These findings reveal systematic asymmetries in effective connectivity between ACC and IPFC in the awake non-human primate and document the spatial and temporal patchiness of effective synaptic connections. We speculate that measuring effective connectivity profiles will be essential for understanding how local synaptic efficacy and synaptic connectivity translates into functional neuronal interactions to support adaptive behaviors.",

One of the ten proteins encoded by the viral genome, the matrix protein M1, is abundantly produced in infected cells and plays a structural role in determining the morphology of the virus. During assembly of new viral particles, M1 is recruited to the host cell membrane where it associates with lipids and other viral proteins. The structure of M1 is only partially known. In particular, structural details of M1 interactions with the cellular plasma membrane as well as M1-protein interactions and multimerization have not been clarified, yet.\\n\\nIn this work, we employed a set of complementary experimental and theoretical tools to tackle these issues. Using raster image correlation, surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopies, we quantified membrane association and oligomerization of full-length M1 and of different genetically engineered M1 constructs (i.e., N- and C-terminally truncated constructs and a mutant of the polybasic region, residues 95-105). Furthermore, we report novel information on structural changes in M1 occurring upon binding to membranes.

    "abstract": "The synaptonemal complex (SC) keeps homologous chromosomes in close alignment during meiotic crossover. A hallmark of SC formation is the presence of its protein component SYCP3 on the chromosome axis. As SC assembly progresses, SYCP3 is deposited on both axes of the homologue pair, forming the lateral element (LE) in the tripartite structure of the mature SC. We have used cryo-electron tomography and atomic force microscopy to study the mechanism of assembly and DNA binding of the SYCP3 fibre. We find that the three-dimensional architecture of the fibre is built on a highly irregular arrangement of SYCP3 molecules displaying very limited local geometry. Interaction between SYCP3 molecules is driven by the intrinsically disordered tails of the protein, with no contact between the helical cores, resulting in a flexible fibre assembly. We demonstrate that the SYCP3 fibre can engage in extensive interactions with DNA, indicative of an efficient mechanism for incorporation of DNA within the fibre. Taken together, our findings suggest that, upon deposition on the chromosome axis, SYCP3 spreads by polymerising into a fibre that is fastened to the chromosome surface via DNA binding. The resulting layer of SYCP3 coating the chromosome axis might provide a structural basis for LE assembly in meiotic prophase.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor is a cell-envelope-embedded macromolecular machine that functions as a propeller to move the cell. Rather than being an invariant machine, the flagellar motor exhibits significant variability between species, allowing bacteria to adapt to, and thrive in, a wide range of environments. For instance, different torque-generating stator modules allow motors to operate in conditions with different pH and sodium concentrations and some motors are adapted to drive motility in high-viscosity environments. How such diversity evolved is unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography to determine the in situ macromolecular structures of the flagellar motors of three Gammaproteobacteria species: Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, providing the first views of intact motors with dual stator systems. Complementing our imaging with bioinformatics analysis, we find a correlation between the stator system of the motor and its structural complexity. Motors with a single H+-driven stator system have only the core P- and L-rings in their periplasm; those with dual H+-driven stator systems have an extra component elaborating their P-ring; and motors with Na+- (or dual Na+-H+)- driven stator systems have additional rings surrounding both their P- and L-rings. Our results suggest an evolution of structural complexity that may have enabled pathogenic bacteria like L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa to colonize higher-viscosity environments in animal hosts.",

    "abstract": "The self-assembly of cellular macromolecular machines such as the bacterial flagellar motor requires the spatio-temporal synchronization of gene expression, protein localization and association of a dozen or more unique components. In Salmonella and Escherichia coli, a sequential, outward assembly mechanism has been proposed for the flagellar motor starting from the inner membrane, with each subsequent component stabilizing the last. Here, using electron cryo-tomography of intact Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis cells, we observe stable outer-membrane-embedded sub-complexes of the flagellar motor. These sub-complexes consist of the periplasmic embellished P- and L-rings, in the absence of other flagellar components, and bend the membrane inward dramatically. Additionally, we also observe independent inner-membrane sub-complexes consisting of the C- and MS-rings and export apparatus. These results suggest an alternate model for flagellar motor assembly in which outer- and inner-membrane-associated sub-complexes form independently and subsequently join, enabling later steps of flagellar production to proceed.",

    "abstract": "The modulation of an animals behavior through external sensory stimuli, previous experience and its internal state is crucial to survive in a constantly changing environment. In most insects, octopamine (OA) and its precursor tyramine (TA) modulate a variety of physiological processes and behaviors by shifting the organism from a relaxed or dormant condition to a responsive, excited and alerted state. Even though OA/TA neurons of the central brain are described on single cell level in Drosophila melanogaster, the periphery was largely omitted from anatomical studies. Given that OA/TA is involved in behaviors like feeding, flying and locomotion, which highly depend on a variety of peripheral organs, it is necessary to study the peripheral connections of these neurons to get a complete picture of the OA/TA circuitry. We here describe the anatomy of this aminergic system in relation to peripheral tissues of the entire fly. OA/TA neurons arborize onto skeletal muscles all over the body and innervate reproductive organs, the heart, the corpora allata, and sensory neurons in the antenna, wings and halteres underlining their relevance in modulating complex behaviors.",

Here, we report characterization and structural assembly of eight such proteins associated with division and docking them with anti-amoebic quassinoid compounds. Quassinoids have been implicated as inhibitors of cell proliferation of amoeboid species as well as tumor cells. Here, they were screened computationally to find interaction mechanism as well as binding energies with CDPs of N. fowleri. The identified inhibitors could play a role in prevention of cell division and hence, stop N. fowleri growth and proliferation during infection. This study supports CDPs as a target for anti-amoebic intervention and identifies quassinoid phytochemical compounds as suitable for optimization into a new therapy against N. fowleri.",

Azacitidine (AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) widely used to treat MDS and AML, yet the impact of AZA on the cell surface proteome has not been defined. To identify potential therapeutic targets for use in combination with AZA in AML patients, we investigated the effects of AZA treatment on four AML cell lines (KG1a, HL60, HNT34, and AML193), representing different stages of differentiation. The effect of AZA treatment on these cell lines was characterized at three levels: the DNA methylome (methylation array), the transcriptome (gene expression array), and the cell surface proteome (glycoprotein capture with SILAC labeling). Untreated AML cell lines showed substantial overlap in their methylomes, transcriptomes, and cell surface proteomes. AZA treatment globally reduced DNA methylation in all cell lines, but changes in the transcriptome and surface proteome were subtle and differed among the cell lines. Transcriptome analysis identified five commonly up-regulated coding genes upon AZA treatment in all four cell lines, TRPM4 being the only gene encoding a surface protein, and surface proteomics analysis found no commonly regulated proteins. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of differentially-regulated RNA and surface proteins showed a decrease in metabolism pathways and an increase in immune defense response pathways. As such, AZA treatment in four AML cell lines had diverse effects at the individual gene and protein level, but converged to regulation of metabolism and immune response at the pathway level. Given the heterogeneous response of AZA in the four cell lines at the gene and protein level, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for combinations with AZA.",

Deregulation of the Hippo pathway component YAP1 has recently been demonstrated to play a role in HPV-mediated cervical cancer, but whether other components of this pathway are implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease remains poorly understood.\\n\\nThe expression level and activation status of critical Hippo pathway components were analysed across multiple cytology samples from patients with cervical disease, as well as HPV positive (HPV+) and HPV negative (HPV-) cervical cancer cell lines using real time qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. In parallel, we assessed the effects of MST1 and MST2 overexpression upon cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, we interrogated the consequences of interrupted MST1 and MST2 function using a targeted small molecule inhibitor in tandem with kinase inactive MST mutants. Our analysis found that expression of the Ste20 kinase MST1 was decreased within both HPV+ primary patient samples and cervical cancer cell lines. This effect was mediated by the virus-coded oncoproteins E6 and E7, which impair MST1 transcription. Reintroduction of MST1, or its paralogue MST2, into HPV positive cervical cancer cells re-activated the Hippo pathway, leading to a reduction in cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, using a small molecule inhibitor of MST1/2 or kinase inactive mutants of either protein, we demonstrated that this effect required the kinase function of MST1/2. Our results reveal that HPV down regulates MST1 expression to inactivate the Hippo pathway and so drive cells towards transformation.",

    "abstract": "Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones, and their mutations or altered expression are linked to multiple human disease states. sHsp monomers assemble into large oligomers with dimeric substructure, and the dynamics of sHsp oligomers has led to major questions about the form that captures substrate, a critical aspect of their mechanism of action. We show that substructural dimers of plant dodecameric sHsps, Ta16.9 and homologous Ps18.1, are functional units in the initial encounter with unfolding substrate. We introduced inter-polypeptide disulfide bonds at the two dodecameric interfaces, dimeric and non-dimeric, to restrict how their assemblies can dissociate. When disulfide bonded at the non-dimeric interface, mutants of Ta16.9 and Ps18.1 (TaCT-ACD and PsCT-ACD) were inactive, but when reduced had wild-type-like chaperone activity, demonstrating that dissociation at non-dimeric interfaces is essential for activity. In addition, the size of the TaCT-ACD and PsCT-ACD covalent unit defined a new tetrahedral geometry for these sHsps, different than the Ta16.9 x-ray structure. Importantly, oxidized Tadimer (disulfide bonded at the dimeric interface) showed greatly enhanced ability to protect substrate, indicating that strengthening the dimeric interface increases chaperone efficiency. Size and secondary structure changes with temperature revealed that folded sHsp dimers interact with substrate, and support dimer stability as a determinant of chaperone efficiency. These data yield a model in which sHsp dimers capture substrate prior to assembly into larger, heterogeneous sHSP-substrate complexes for subsequent substrate refolding or degradation, and suggest that tuning the strength of the dimer interface can be used to engineer sHsp chaperone efficiency.",

Samples intensively collected from Korea, which is a small but central region in the distribution geography of soybean, were genotyped to provide sufficient data to underpin genome-wide population genetic questions. After removing natural hybrids and duplicated or redundant accessions, we obtained a non-redundant set comprising 1,957 domesticated and 1,079 wild accessions to perform population structure analyses. Our analysis demonstrates that while wild soybean germplasm will require additional sampling from diverse indigenous areas to expand the germplasm base, the current domesticated soybean germplasm is saturated in terms of genetic diversity. We then showed that our genome-wide polymorphism map enabled us to detect genetic loci underling flower color, seed-coat color, and domestication syndrome. A representative soybean set consisting of 194 accessions were divided into one domesticated subpopulation and four wild subpopulations that could be traced back to their geographic collection areas. Population genomics analyses suggested that the monophyletic group of domesticated soybeans was originated in eastern Japan. The results were further substantiated by a phylogenetic tree constructed from domestication-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in this study.",

    "abstract": "Apomixis is a highly desirable trait in modern agriculture, due to the maintenance of characteristics of the mother plant in the progeny. However, incorporating it into breeding programs requires a deeper knowledge of its regulatory mechanisms. Paspalum notatum is considered a good model for such studies because it exhibits both sexual and apomictic cytotypes, facilitating the performance of comparative approaches. Therefore, we used comparative transcriptomics between contrasting P. notatum cytotypes to identify novel candidate genes involved in the regulation of the expression of this phenotype. We assembled and characterized a transcriptome from leaf and inflorescence from apomictic tetraploids and sexual diploids/tetraploids of P. notatum accessions, and then assembled a coexpression network based on pairwise correlation between transcripts expression profiles. We identified genes exclusively expressed in each cytotype and differentially expressed genes between pairs of cytotypes. Gene ontology enrichment analyses were performed for the interpretation of data. We de novo assembled 114,306 of reference transcripts. 536 novel candidate genes for the control of apomixis were detected through statistical analyses of expression data, contains in this set, the interactions among genes potentially linked to the apomixis-controlling region, differentially expressed, several genes also already reported in the literature and their neighbors transcriptionally related in the coexpression network. The reference transcriptome obtained in this study represents a robust set of expression data for P. notatum. Additionally, novel candidate genes identified in this work represent a valuable resource for future grass breeding programs.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryClonal mode of reproduction by seeds is termed apomixis, which results from the failure of gamete formation (meiosis) and fertilization in the sexual female reproductive pathway. The manipulation of seeds production genetically identical to the mother plant bears great promise for agricultural applications, however clarification regarding gene interactions involved in reproductive process is needed. Paspalum is considered a model genus for the analysis of apomixis mechanisms. Here, we describe an overall analysis of the expression profiles of Paspalum notatum transcripts in response to changes in reproductive mode (sexual to apomictic), which allowed us to identify several candidate apomixis genes. Among these, we found genes potentially associated with the apomixis control region, in addition to genes already described in the literature for Paspalum, which highlights the representativeness of assembled transcriptome. For the first time in the literature, we explored the main biological processes involved in controlling the expression of apomictic reproduction based on co-regulatory networks of candidate apomixis genes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe promise of higher phylogenetic stability through increasing dataset size within Tree of Life (TOL) reconstructions has not been fulfilled, especially for deep nodes. Among the many causes proposed are changes in species composition (taxon sampling) that could influence phylogenetic accuracy of the methods by altering the relative weight of the evolutionary histories of each individual species. This effect would be stronger in clades that are represented by few lineages, which is common in many Prokaryote phyla. Indeed, phyla with fewer taxa showed the most discordance among recent TOL studies. Thus, we implemented an approach to systematically test how the number of taxa and the identity of those taxa among a larger dataset affected the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction.\\n\\nResultsWe utilized an empirical dataset of 766 fully-sequenced proteomes for phyla within Terrabacteria as a reference for subsampled datasets that differed in both number of species and composition of species. After evaluating the backbone of trees produced as well as the internal nodes, we found that trees with fewer species were more dissimilar to the tree produced from the full dataset. Further, we found that even within scenarios consisting of the same number of taxa, the species used strongly affected phylogenetic stability. These results hold even when the tree is composed by many phyla and only one of them is being altered. Thus, the effect of taxon sampling in one group does not seem to be buffered by the presence of many other clades, making this issue relevant even to very large datasets. Our results suggest that a systematic evaluation of phylogenetic stability through taxon resampling is advisable even for very large datasets.\\n\\nContactbattistu@oakland.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary text and figures are available on the journals website.",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe respiratory mucosa coordinates responses to infections, allergens, and exposures to air pollution. A relatively unexplored aspect of the respiratory mucosa are the expression and function of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC transporters are conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with humans expressing 48 transporters divided into 7 classes (ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, ABCD, ABDE, ABCF, and ABCG). Throughout the human body, ABC transporters regulate cAMP levels, chloride secretion, lipid transport, and anti-oxidant responses. A deeper exploration of the expression patterns of ABC transporters in the respiratory mucosa is warranted to determine their relevance in lung health and disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a bioinformatic approach complemented with in vitro experimental methods for validation of candidate ABC transporters. We analyzed the expression profiles of all 48 human ABC transporters in the respiratory mucosa using bronchial epithelial cell gene expression datasets available in NCBI GEO from well-characterized patient populations of healthy subjects and individuals that smoke cigarettes, or have been diagnosed with COPD or asthma. The Calu-3 airway epithelial cell line was used to interrogate selected results using a cigarette smoke extract exposure model.\\n\\nResultsUsing 9 distinct gene-expression datasets of primary human airway epithelial cells, we completed a focused analysis on 48 ABC transporters in samples from healthy subjects and individuals that smoke cigarettes, or have been diagnosed with COPD or asthma. In situ gene expression data demonstrate that ABC transporters are i) variably expressed in epithelial cells from different airway generations (top three expression levels - ABCA5, ABCA13, and ABCC5), ii) regulated by cigarette smoke exposure (ABCA13, ABCB6, ABCC1, and ABCC3), and iii) differentially expressed in individuals with COPD and asthma (ABCA13, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC9). An in vitro cell culture model of cigarette smoke exposure was able to recapitulate the in situ changes observed in cigarette smokers for ABCA13 and ABCC1.\\n\\nConclusionsOur in situ human gene expression data analysis reveals that ABC transporters are expressed throughout the airway generations in airway epithelial cells and can be modulated by environmental exposures important in chronic respiratory disease (e.g. cigarette smoking) and in individuals with chronic lung diseases (e.g. COPD or asthma). Our work highlights select ABC transporter candidates of interest and a relevant in vitro model that will enable a deeper understanding of the contribution of ABC transporters in the respiratory mucosa in lung health and disease.",

Disentangling the effects related to particular population backgrounds can help in both understanding cancer biology and in tailoring therapeutic interventions.

While algorithms to analyze ancestry structure from healthy individuals have been developed, an easy-to-use tool to assign population groups based on genotyping data from SNP profiles is still missing and benchmarking for the validity of population assignment strategy for aberrant cancer genomes was not tested.\\n\\nWe benchmarked the consistency and accuracy of cross-platform population assignment. We also demonstrated its high accuracy to process unaltered as well as cancer genomes. Despite widespread and extensive somatic mutations of cancer profiling data, population assignment consistency between germline and highly mutated samples from cancer patients reached of 97% and 92% for assignment into 5 and 26 populations re-spectively. Comparison of our benchmarked results with self-reported meta-data estimated a matching rate between 88% to 92%.

    "abstract": "Gene expression is controlled by regulator genes that together with effector genes form gene regulatory networks. How mutation in the genes comprising gene regulatory networks influences cell population dynamics has not been adequately investigated. In this study, we develop mathematical models to study how a mutation in a regulator gene that reaches the effector gene with a time delay affects short-term and long-term population growth. Using theory and experiment, we find a paradoxical outcome of evolution where a mutation in a regulator gene leads to an interaction between gene regulatory network and population dynamics, causing in certain cases a permanent decrease in population fitness in a constant environment.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe properties of a cell are largely the products of its proteins, synthesized at rates depending on the regulation of protein coding genes. Single-cell measurements show that genetically identical cells can differ radically in their protein levels, partially due to the random production and degradation of proteins. It is currently unknown how mutants arise and spread in populations affected by such biological variability. We use computer simulations and evolution experiments to study how a mutant spreads in a population that carries a synthetic drug resistance gene network. Our results show for the first time a paradoxical outcome of evolution, where an initially beneficial mutation can interact with gene regulatory network dynamics and cause a permanent decrease in population fitness in the same environment.",

    "abstract": "Correlation among traits is a fundamental feature of biological systems. From morphological characters, to transcriptional or metabolic networks, the correlations we routinely observe between traits reflect a shared regulation that remains poorly understood and difficult to study. To address this problem, we developed a new and flexible approach that allows us to identify factors associated with variation in correlation between individuals. Here, we use data from three large human cohorts to study the effects of genetic variation and environmental perturbation on correlations among mRNA transcripts and among NMR metabolites. We first show that environmental exposures (namely, infection and disease) lead to a systematic loss of correlation, which we define as  decoherence. Using longitudinal data, we show that decoherent metabolites are better predictors of whether someone will develop metabolic syndrome than metabolites commonly used as biomarkers of this disease. Finally, we show that correlation itself is a trait under genetic control: specifically, we mapped and replicated hundreds of  correlation QTLs, which often involve transcription factors or their known target genes. Together, this work furthers our understanding of how and why coordinated biological processes break down, and highlights the role of decoherence in disease emergence.",

    "abstract": "Metazoan eggs have a specialized coat of extracellular matrix that aids in sperm-egg recognition. The coat is rapidly remodeled after fertilization to prevent polyspermy and establish a more permanent barrier to protect the developing embryo. In nematodes, this coat is called the vitelline layer, which is remodeled into the outermost layer of a rigid and impermeable eggshell. We have identified three key components of the vitelline layer structural scaffold - PERM-2, PERM-4 and CBD-1, the first such proteins to be described in the nematode C. elegans. CBD-1 recruited PERM-2 and PERM-4 to the nascent vitelline layer via two N-terminal chitin-binding domains. After fertilization, all three proteins redistributed from the zygote surface to the outer eggshell. Depletion of PERM-2 and PERM-4 from the scaffold led to a porous vitelline layer that permitted soluble factors to leak through the eggshell and resulted in embryonic death. In addition to its role in vitelline layer assembly, CBD-1 is also known to scaffold a protein complex required for fertilization and egg activation (EGG-1-5/CHS-1/MBK-2). We found the PERM complex and EGG complex to be structurally and functionally independent, and regulated through distinct domains of CBD-1. CBD-1 is thus a multifaceted regulator that promotes distinct aspects of vitelline layer assembly and egg activation. In sum, our findings identify the first vitelline layer components in nematodes, and provide a foundation through which to explore both conserved and species-specific strategies used by animals to build protective barriers following fertilization.",

    "abstract": "The strength of learned associations between pairs of stimuli is affected by multiple factors, the most extensively studied of which is prior experience with the stimuli themselves. In contrast, little data is available regarding how experience with incidental stimuli (independent of any conditioning situation) impacts later learning. This lack of research is striking given the importance of incidental experience to survival. We have recently begun to fill this void using conditioned taste aversion (CTA), wherein an animal learns to avoid a taste that has been associated with malaise. We previously demonstrated that incidental exposure to salty and sour tastes (taste pre-exposure, TPE) enhances aversions learned later to sucrose. Here, we investigate the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon. First, we use immediate early gene (cFos) expression to identify gustatory cortex (GC) as a site at which TPE specifically increases the neural activation caused by taste-malaise pairing (i.e., TPE did not change cFos induced by either stimulus in isolation). Next, we use site-specific infection with the optical silencer Archaerhodopsin-T to show that GC inactivation during TPE inhibits the expected enhancements of both learning and CTA related cFos expression, a full day later. Thus, we conclude that GC is almost certainly a vital part of the circuit that integrates incidental experience into later associative learning.",
