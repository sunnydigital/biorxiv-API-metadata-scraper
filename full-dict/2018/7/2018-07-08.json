    "abstract": "Neuronal responses in visual cortex show a diversity of complex temporal properties. These properties include sub-additive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. Here, we hypothesize that these seemingly disparate effects can be explained by a single, shared computational mechanism. We propose a model consisting of a linear stage, followed by history-dependent gain control. The model accounts for these various temporal phenomena, tested against an unusually diverse set of measurements - intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. The model further enables us to uncover a systematic and rich variety of temporal encoding strategies across visual cortex: First, temporal receptive field shape differs both across and within visual field maps. Second, later visual areas show more rapid and pronounced adaptation. Our study provides a new framework to understand the transformation between visual input and dynamical cortical responses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe nervous system extracts meaning from the distribution of light over space and time. Spatial vision has been a highly successful research area, and the spatial receptive field has served as a fundamental and unifying concept that spans perception, computation, and physiology. While there has also been a large interest in temporal vision, the temporal domain has lagged the spatial domain in terms of quantitative models of how signals are transformed across the visual hierarchy. Here we present a model of temporal dynamics of neuronal responses in human cerebral cortex. We show that the model can accurately predict responses at the millisecond scale using intracortical electrodes in patient volunteers, and that the same model generalizes to multiple types of other measurements, including functional MRI and action potentials from monkey cortex. Further, we show that a single model can account for a variety of temporal phenomena, including short-term adaptation and slower dynamics at low stimulus contrast. By developing a computational model and showing that it successfully generalizes across measurement types, cortical areas, and stimuli, we provide new insights into how time-varying images are encoded and transformed into dynamic cortical responses.",

    "abstract": "Background.Psychiatric nosology lacks objective biological foundation, as well as typical biomarkers for diagnoses, which raises questions about its validity. The problem is particularly evident concerning Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The objective of this study is to estimate whether the \\\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\\" (DSM) is biologically valid for ADHD diagnosis using a multivariate analysis for small samples from a large dataset concerning neurophysiological, behavioral, and psychological variables.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty typically developing boys and 19 boys diagnosed with ADHD, aged 10-13 years, were examined using the Attentional Network Test (ANT) with records of event-related potentials (ERPs). From 815 variables, a reduced number of latent variables (LVs) were extracted with a clustering method, for further reclassification of subjects using the k-means method. This approach allowed multivariate analysis to be applied to a significantly larger number of variables than the number of cases (E. Wigneau et al., 2003, 2015)\\n\\nResultsFrom datasets including ERPs from the mid-frontal, mid-parietal, right frontal, and central channels, only seven subjects were miss-reclassified by the LVs. An estimated specificity of 75.00% and sensitivity of 89.47% for DSM were found in the reclassification. The kappa index between DSM and behavioral/psychological/neurophysiological data was 0.75, which is regarded as a \\\"substantial level of agreement\\\".\\n\\nDiscussionResults showed that CLV is a useful method for diagnostic classification using a large dataset of small samples, suggesting the biological validity of DSM for ADHD diagnosis, in accordance to alterations in fronto-striatal networks previously related to ADHD.",

However, current computational models of neuronal networks use simplistic cylindrical geometries to mimic dendritic arborizations. One reason for this is that current methods to generate dendritic trees have rigid a priori constraints. To address this, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) trained on images of rodent hippocampal granule and pyramidal dendritic trees. Image features learned by the network were used to generate realistic dendritic morphologies. Results show that DCGANs achieved greater stability* and high generalization, as quantified by kernel maximum mean discrepancy, when exposed to instance noise and/or label smoothing during training. Trained models successfully generated realistic morphologies for both neuron types, with high false positive rate reported by expert reviewers.

By taking into account the complex heterogeneity of evolutionary processes among sites in a genome, Bayesian infinite mixture models of genomic evolution enable robust phylogenetic inference. With large modern data sets, however, the computational burden of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques becomes prohibitive. Here, we have developed a variational Bayesian procedure to speed up the widely used PhyloBayes MPI program, which deals with the heterogeneity of amino acid profiles. Rather than sampling from the posterior distribution, the procedure approximates the (unknown) posterior distribution using a manageable distribution called the variational distribution. The parameters in the variational distribution are estimated by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. To examine performance, we analyzed three empirical data sets consisting of mitochondrial, plastid-encoded, and nuclear proteins. Our variational method accurately approximated the Bayesian phylogenetic tree, mixture proportions, and the amino acid propensity of each component of the mixture while using orders of magnitude less computational time.",

Urine was sampled monthly from individual mice for 4 months. Microbial DNA was extracted from the urine, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequenced. Animals were sacrificed and their bladders harvested for histopathology. Bladder sections were graded by a blinded pathologist. The composition and diversity of the urinary microbiome were compared between the BBN and control mice. Metabolic pathway analysis was completed using PICRUST.\\n\\nResultsBladder histology in the BBN group showed normal tissue with inflammation (BBN-normal, n=5), precancerous pathologies, (BBN-precancerous, n=3), and invasive cancer (BBN-cancer, n=2). Alpha diversity did not differ between the mice exposed to BBN and the control mice at any timepoint. There were no differences in the urinary microbiomes between the BBN and control mice at baseline. At month 4, mice exposed to BBN had higher proportion of both Gardnerella and Bifidobacterium compared to control mice. There were no differences in proportions of specific bacteria between either the BBN-precancer or BBN-cancer and controls at month 4. However, the BBN-normal mice had higher proportions of Gardnerella, Haemophilus, Bifidobacterium, and Ureaplasma Actinobaculum, and lower proportions of Actinomyces, compared to control mice at month 4. Functional pathway analysis demonstrated increases in genes related to purine metabolism, phosphotransferase systems, peptidases, protein folding, and bacterial toxins in the BBN-mice compared to control mice at month 4.\\n\\nConclusionMice exposed to 4 months of BBN, a bladder-specific carcinogen, have distinct urine microbial profiles compared to control mice.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the small heat shock proteins -crystallins have been linked to autosomal dominant cataracts in humans. Extensive studies in vitro have revealed a spectrum of alterations to the structure and function of these proteins including shifts in the size of the oligomer, modulation of subunit exchange and modification of their affinity to client proteins. Although mouse models of these mutants were instrumental in identifying changes in cellular proliferation and lens development, a direct comparative analysis of their effects on lens proteostasis has not been performed. Here, we have transgenically expressed cataract-linked mutants of A- and B-crystallin in the zebrafish lens to dissect the underlying molecular changes that contribute to the loss of lens optical properties. Zebrafish lines expressing these mutants displayed a range of morphological lens defects. Phenotype penetrance and severity were dependent on the mutation even in fish lines lacking endogenous -crystallin. The mechanistic origins of these differences were investigated by the transgenic co-expression of a destabilized human{gamma} D-crystallin mutant. We found that the R49C but not the R116C mutant of A-crystallin promoted aggregation of {gamma}D-crystallin, although both mutants have similar affinity to client proteins in vitro. Our working model attributes these differences to the propensity of R49C, located in the buried N-terminal domain of A-crystallin, to disulfide crosslinking as previously demonstrated in vitro. Our findings complement and extend previous work in mouse models and emphasize the need of investigating chaperone/client protein interactions in appropriate cellular context.",

Lithobates berlandieri was captured during every month of the year except November, and adults were most frequently encountered during January-September with a distinct peak in May. Mean body size of adult males (69.5 mm) was smaller than that of adult females (77.5 mm), and both sexes were larger in mean body sizes than those of New Mexico populations (M = 64.4 mm; F = 73.5 mm). Females were gravid during January-September, and most gravid females were captured from late-winter to early-summer. Gonadal enlargement in males was generally high throughout January-September with no detectable seasonal increase. Feeding became widespread in both sexes during May-June shortly after a spring breeding bout. Spent females were common in July and lipid deposition increased in June/July, signaling oogenesis for breeding in the fall. From 15 gravid females, we estimated a mean clutch size of 3,107 eggs which was correlated with female body size, yet egg diameter was not related to clutch or body size. Age to metamorphosis was likely 2 to 4 months depending upon whether eggs were laid in the winter/spring or late fall. If metamorphosis occurred in May/June, the minimum size at sexual maturity in adult males (50.1 mm) could have been reached in 3-4 months and in 6-7 months for adult females (57.2 mm). Mean adult body sizes, however, may have taken 12 to 17 months to reach. A synthesis across Texas populations suggests that the breeding season extends almost continuously from the fall through the winter and spring until mid-summer and is interrupted by winter and summer peaks in seasonal temperatures.",

Changes in environmental conditions induced workers to quickly transport the brood to a preferred location. Only a minority of the workers, mainly nurses, participated in this task. Using a large number of statistical tests we could further show that these transporters omitted to recruit help, and relied only on private information rather than information obtained from other workers.

In this study, we encapsulated two epithelial cell lineages, MDCK and J3B1A, into hollow alginate tubes and grew them under cylindrical confinement. Once formed, the epithelial MDCK layer detached from the alginate shell, while J3B1A layer remained adherent. Detachment resulted from contractile forces within cell layers that pulled cells away from the shell. We concluded that J3B1A cells have lower contractility than MDCK cells. As the pulling forces depend on the radius of the tube, we induced detachment of J3B1A cells by reducing the size of the hollow tube by two. Moreover, in bent tubes, detachment was more pronounced on the outer side of the turn, while extrusion occurred in the inner side, further highlighting the coupling between curvature and cell contractility.",

    "abstract": "Dominance hierarchies and unequal resource partitioning among individuals are key mechanisms of population regulation. The strength of dominance hierarchies can be influenced by size dependent trade-offs between foraging and predator avoidance whereby competitively inferior subdominants can access a larger proportion of limiting resources by accepting higher predation risk. Foraging-predation risk trade-offs also depend on resource abundance. Yet, few studies have manipulated predation risk and resource abundance simultaneously; consequently, their joint effect on resource partitioning within dominance hierarchies are not well understood. We addressed this gap by measuring behavioural responses of masu salmon to experimental manipulations of predation risk and resource abundance in a natural temperate forest stream. Responses to predation risk depended on body size such that larger dominants exhibited more risk-averse behaviour (e.g., lower foraging and appearance rates) relative to smaller subdominants after exposure to a simulated predator. The magnitude of this effect was lower when resources were elevated, indicating that dominant fish accepted a higher predation risk to forage on abundant resources. However, the influence of resource abundance did not extend to the population level, where predation risk altered the distribution of foraging attempts (a proxy for energy intake) from being skewed towards large individuals to being skewed towards small individuals after predator exposure. Our results imply that size dependent foraging-predation risk trade-offs can mediate the strength of dominance hierarchies by allowing competitively inferior subdominants to access resources that would otherwise be monopolized.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsSN, TS, and RU designed the study and performed the fieldwork; SN analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript with input from all authors.",

    "abstract": "Rapid adaptation can be necessary to prevent extinction when populations are exposed to extremely marginal or stressful environments. Factors that affect the likelihood of evolutionary rescue from extinction have been identified, but much less is known about the evolutionary dynamics and genomic basis of successful evolutionary rescue, particularly in multicellular organisms. We conducted an evolve and resequence experiment to investigate the dynamics and repeatability of evolutionary rescue at the genetic level in the cowpea seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, when it is experimentally shifted to a stressful host plant, lentil (Lens culinaris). Low survival (~ 1%) at the onset of the experiment caused population decline. But adaptive evolution quickly rescued the population with survival rates climbing to 69% by the F5 generation and 90% by the F10 generation. Population genomic data showed that rescue likely was caused by rapid evolutionary change at multiple loci, with many alleles fixing or nearly fixing within five generations of selection on lentil. By comparing estimates of selection across five lentil-adapted C. maculatus populations (two new sublines and three long-established lines), we found that adaptation to lentil involves a mixture of parallel and idiosyncratic evolutionary changes. Parallelism was particularly pronounced in sublines that were formed after the parent line had passed through an initial bottleneck. Overall, our results suggest that evolutionary rescue in this system is driven by very strong selection on a modest number of loci, and these results provide empirical evidence that ecological dynamics during evolutionary rescue cause distinct evolutionary trajectories and genomic signatures relative to adaptation in less stressful environments.\\n\\nImpact StatementEvolutionary adaptation is an ongoing process in most populations, but when populations occupy particularly stressful or marginal environments, adaptation can be necessary to prevent extinction. Adaptation that reverses demographic decline and allows for population persistence is termed evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue can prevent species loss from climate change or other environmental stresses, but it can also thwart attempts to control or eradicate agricultural pests and pathogens. Many factors affect the likelihood of evolutionary rescue, but little is known about the underlying evolutionary dynamics, particularly molecular evolutionary changes in multicellular organisms. Here we use a powerful combination of experimental evolution and genomics to track the evolutionary dynamics and genomic outcomes of evolutionary rescue. We focus on the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, which is both an agricultural pest and a convenient model system. We specifically examine how this species is able to persist on a novel and very poor crop host, lentil.\\n\\nWe show that evolution in an experimental seed beetle populations increases survival on lentil from ~1% to >80% in fewer than a dozen generations. This rapid adaptive evolutionary change at the trait (i.e., phenotypic) level was associated with equally rapid evolution at the molecular level, with some gene variants (i.e., alleles) showing frequency shifts of around 30% in a single generation. In contrast to most other experimental evolution studies in multicellular organisms (particularly Drosophila fruit flies), we find that gene variants at multiple loci rapidly fix, that is, reach a frequency of 100%, during adaptation to lentil. Our results suggest that the dynamics and genetics of adaptation to severe conditions could be distinct from adaptation under more benign conditions. By comparing outcomes of adaptation across multiple lines and sublines, we show that repeated rapid adaptation at the trait level does not necessarily involve the same evolutionary changes at the molecular level. This limited parallelism was likely driven by extreme population bottlenecks caused by low survival in the early generations on lentil. Indeed, evolutionary changes in sublines formed after recovery from a common bottleneck were highly parallel. This coupling of demographic (i.e., ecological) and evolutionary changes during evolutionary rescue may therefore limit the predictability of evolution. Because colonization of novel environments may often occur after a bottleneck, our results could be of general significance for understanding patterns of parallel (and non-parallel) evolutionary change in nature.",

    "abstract": "The transcription elongation factor Spt6 and the H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 are both required for H3K36 methylation and transcriptional fidelity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By selecting for suppressors of a transcriptional defect in an spt6 mutant, we have isolated dominant SET2 mutations (SET2sup mutations) in a region encoding a proposed autoinhibitory domain. The SET2sup mutations suppress the H3K36 methylation defect in the spt6 mutant, as well as in other mutants that impair H3K36 methylation. ChIP-seq studies demonstrate that the H3K36 methylation defect in the spt6 mutant, as well as its suppression by a SET2sup mutation, occur at a step following the recruitment of Set2 to chromatin. Other experiments show that a similar genetic relationship between Spt6 and Set2 exists in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Taken together, our results suggest a conserved mechanism by which the Set2 autoinhibitory domain requires multiple interactions to ensure that H3K36 methylation occurs specifically on actively transcribed chromatin.",

    "abstract": "The progressive loss of midbrain (MB) dopaminergic (DA) neurons defines the motor features of Parkinson disease (PD) and modulation of risk by common variation in PD has been well established through GWAS. Anticipating that a fraction of PD-associated genetic variation mediates their effects within this neuronal population, we acquired open chromatin signatures of purified embryonic mouse MB DA neurons. Correlation with >2,300 putative enhancers assayed in mice reveals enrichment for MB cis-regulatory elements (CRE), data reinforced by transgenic analyses of six additional sequences in zebrafish and mice. One CRE, within intron 4 of the familial PD gene SNCA, directs reporter expression in catecholaminergic neurons of transgenic mice and zebrafish. Sequencing of this CRE in 986 PD patients and 992 controls reveals two common variants associated with elevated PD risk. To assess potential mechanisms of action, we screened >20,000 DNA interacting proteins and identify a subset whose binding is impacted by these enhancer variants. Additional genotyping across the SNCA locus identifies a single PD-associated haplotype, containing the minor alleles of both of the aforementioned PD-risk variants. Our work posits a model for how common variation at SNCA may modulate PD risk and highlights the value of cell context-dependent guided searches for functional non-coding variation.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence from case/control studies indicates that genetic risk for psychiatric disorders derives primarily from numerous common variants, each with a small phenotypic impact. The literature describing apparent segregation of bipolar disorder (BP) in numerous multigenerational pedigrees suggests that, in such families, large-effect inherited variants might play a greater role. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conducted genetic analyses in 26 Colombian (CO) and Costa Rican (CR) pedigrees ascertained for BP1, the most severe and heritable form of BP. In these pedigrees, we performed microarray SNP genotyping of 856 individuals and high-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 454 individuals. Compared to their unaffected relatives, BP1 individuals had higher polygenic risk scores estimated from SNPs associated with BP discovered in independent genome-wide association studies, and also displayed a higher burden of rare deleterious single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and rare copy number variants (CNVs) in genes likely to be relevant to BP1. Parametric and non-parametric linkage analyses identified 15 BP1 linkage peaks, encompassing about 100 genes, although we observed no significant segregation pattern for any particular rare SNVs and CNVs. These results suggest that even in extended pedigrees, genetic risk for BP appears to derive mainly from small to moderate effect rare and common variants.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of cell division is critical for cell viability under DNA damaging conditions. In bacterial cells, DNA damage induces the SOS response, a process that inhibits cell division while repairs are being made. In coccoid bacteria, such as the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, the process remains poorly understood. Here we have characterized an SOS-induced cell-division inhibitor, SosA, in S. aureus. We find that in contrast to the wildtype, sosA mutant cells continue division under DNA damaging conditions with decreased viability as a consequence. Conversely, overproduction of SosA leads to cell division inhibition and reduced growth. The SosA protein is localized in the bacterial membrane and mutation of an extracellular amino acid, conserved between homologs of other staphylococcal species, abolished the inhibitory activity as did truncation of the C-terminal 30 amino acids. In contrast, C-terminal truncation of 10 amino acids lead to SosA accumulation and a strong cell division inhibitory activity. A similar phenotype was observed upon expression of wildtype SosA in a mutant lacking the membrane protease, CtpA. Thus, the extracellular C-terminus of SosA is required both for cell-division inhibition and for turnover of the protein. Functional studies showed that SosA is likely to interact with one or more divisome components and, without interfering with early cell-division events, halts cell division at a point where septum formation is initiated yet being unable to progress to septum closure. Our findings provide important insights into cell-division regulation in staphylococci that may foster development of new classes of antibiotics targeting this essential process.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is a serious human pathogen and a model organism for cell-division studies in spherical bacteria. We show that SosA is the DNA-damage-inducible cell-division inhibitor in S. aureus that upon expression causes cell swelling and cessation of the cell cycle at a characteristic stage post septum initiation but prior to division plate completion. SosA appears to function via an extracellular activity and is likely to do so by interfering with the essential membrane-associated division proteins, while at the same time being negatively regulated by the membrane protease CtpA. This report represents the first description of the process behind cell-division inhibition in coccoid bacteria. As several pathogens are included in this category, uncovering the molecular details of SosA activity and control can lead to identification of new targets for development of valuable anti-bacterial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory ammonification and denitrification are two evolutionarily unrelated dissimilatory nitrogen (N) processes central to the global N cycle, the activity of which is thought to be controlled by carbon (C) to nitrate (NO3-) ratio. Here we find that Intrasporangium calvum C5, a novel menaquinone-based dual-pathway denitrifier/respiratory ammonifier, disproportionately utilizes ammonification rather than denitrification when grown under carbon or nitrate limitation, not C:NO3- ratio. Higher growth rates are promoted by ammonification and metabolite and transcriptional profiles during growth show that the bacterium produces its own formate from a fermentable carbon source (lactate) to further generate a proton motive force for the ammonification pathway. Transcript abundances encoding for nitrite reducing enzymes, NrfAH and NirK, also significantly increase in response to nitrite production. Mechanistically, our results suggest that pathway selection is driven by intracellular redox potential (redox poise), which may be lowered during resource limitation, thereby decreasing catalytic activity of upstream electron transport steps needed for denitrification enzymes.

    "abstract": "Long-lived proteins are subject to spontaneous degradation and may accumulate a range of modifications over time, including subtle alterations such as isomerization. Recently, tandem-mass spectrometry approaches have enabled the identification and detailed characterization of such peptide isomers, including those differing only in chirality. However, the structural and functional consequences of these perturbations remain largely unexplored. Here we examine the site-specific impact of isomerization of aspartic acid and epimerization of serine in human A- and B-crystallin. From a total of 81 sites of modification identified in aged eye lenses, four (BSer59, ASer162, BAsp62, BAsp109) map to crucial oligomeric interfaces. To characterize the effect of isomerization on quaternary assembly, molecular dynamics calculations and native mass spectrometry experiments were performed on recombinant forms of A- and B-crystallin that incorporate, or mimic, isomerized residues. In all cases, oligomerization is significantly affected, with epimerization of a single serine residue (ASer162) sufficing to weaken inter-subunit binding dramatically. Furthermore, phosphorylation of BSer59, known to play an important regulatory role in oligomerization, is severely inhibited by serine epimerization and altered by isomerization of nearby BAsp62. Similarly, isomerization of BAsp109 disrupts a vital salt-bridge with BArg120, a loss previously shown to yield aberrant oligomerization and aggregation in several disease variants. Our results illustrate how isomerization of amino-acid residues, which may seem like a minor structural perturbation, can have profound consequences on protein assembly and activity by disrupting specific hydrogen bonds and salt bridges.\\n\\nSignificance StatementProteins play numerous critical roles in our bodies but suffer damage with increasing age. For example, isomerization is a spontaneous post-translational modification that alters the three-dimensional connectivity of an amino acid, yet remains invisible to traditional proteomic experiments. Herein, radical-based fragmentation was used for isomer identification while molecular dynamics and native mass spectrometry were utilized to assess structural consequences. The results demonstrate that isomerization disrupts both oligomeric assembly and phosphorylation in the -crystallins, which are long-lived proteins in the lens of the eye. The loss of function associated with these modifications is likely connected to age-related diseases such as cataract and neurodegenerative disorders, while the methodologies we present represent a framework for structure-function studies on other isomerized proteins.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting, where an alleles expression pattern depends on its parental origin, is thought to result primarily from an intragenomic evolutionary conflict. Imprinted genes are widely expressed in the brain and have been linked to various phenotypes, including behaviors related to risk tolerance. In this paper, we analyze a model of evolutionary bet-hedging in a system with imprinted gene expression. Previous analyses of bet-hedging have shown that natural selection may favor alleles and traits that reduce reproductive variance, even at the expense of reducing mean reproductive success, with the trade-off between mean and variance depending on the population size. In species where the sexes have different reproductive variances, this bet-hedging trade-off differs between maternally and paternally inherited alleles. Where males have the higher reproductive variance, alleles are more strongly selected to reduce variance when paternally inherited than when maternally inherited. We connect this result to phenotypes connected with specific imprinted genes, including delay discounting and social dominance. The empirical patterns are consistent with paternally expressed imprinted genes promoting risk-averse behaviors that reduce reproductive variance. Conversely, maternally expressed imprinted genes promote risk-tolerant, variance-increasing behaviors. We indicate how future research might further test the hypotheses suggested by our analysis.",

Resistant strains are commonly identified by time-consuming and expensive in vitro neutralization experiments. Here, we developed machine learning-based classifiers that accurately predict resistance of HIV-1 strains to 33 neutralizing antibodies. Notably, our classifiers achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 96% for 212 clinical isolates from patients enrolled in four different clinical trials. Moreover, use of the tree-based machine learning method gradient boosting machine enabled us to identify critical epitope features that distinguish between antibody resistance and sensitivity.

Experimental control and clinical use of HIOs is limited by growth in expensive and poorly defined tumor-cell-derived extracellular matrices, prompting investigation of synthetic ECM-mimetics for HIO culture. Since HIOs possess an inner epithelium and outer mesenchyme, we hypothesized that adhesive cues provided by the matrix may be dispensable for HIO culture. Here, we demonstrate that alginate, a minimally supportive hydrogel with no inherent cell adhesion properties, supports HIO growth in vitro and leads to HIO epithelial differentiation that is virtually indistinguishable from Matrigel-grown HIOs. Additionally, alginate-grown HIOs mature to a similar degree as Matrigel-grown HIOs when transplanted in vivo, both resembling human fetal intestine. This work demonstrates that purely mechanical support from a simple-to-use and inexpensive hydrogel is sufficient to promote HIO survival and development.",

    "abstract": "Asexual reproduction has evolved repeatedly from sexual ancestors across a wide range of taxa. While the costs and benefits associated with asexuality have received considerable attention, the molecular changes underpinning the evolution of asexual reproduction remain relatively unexplored. In particular, it is completely unknown whether the repeated evolution of asexual phenotypes involves similar molecular changes, as previous studies have focused on changes occurring in single lineages. Here we investigate the extent of convergent gene expression changes across five independent transitions to asexuality in stick insects. We compared gene expression of asexual females to females of close sexual relatives in whole-bodies, reproductive tracts, and legs. We identified a striking amount of convergent gene expression change (up to 8% of genes), greatly exceeding that expected by chance. Convergent changes were also tissue-specific, and most likely driven by selection for functional changes. Genes showing convergent changes in the reproductive tract were associated with meiotic spindle formation and centrosome organization. These genes are particularly interesting as they can influence the production of unreduced eggs, a key barrier to asexual reproduction. Changes in legs and whole-bodies were likely involved in female sexual trait decay, with enrichment in terms such as sperm-storage and pigmentation. By identifying changes occurring across multiple independent transitions to asexuality, our results provide a rare insight into the molecular basis of asexual phenotypes and suggest that the evolutionary path to asexuality is highly constrained, requiring repeated changes to the same key genes.",

Ad-Seq enriches for DNA fragments containing nuclease digestion resistant DNA-adducts. The genomic location of the resulting reads is aggregated in a quantitative profile showing the DNA-adduct sequence context. Ad-Seq is quantitative and confirms known specificity of damages from Ultra-Violet light (di-pyrimidine) and cisplatin (AG and GG di-purines). Furthermore, in cells, Ad-Seq profile can be compared to chromatin segments to show that cisplatin associated adducts are depleted in open and active chromatin regions. The Ad-Seq assay can therefore generate a broad DNA signature of DNA damage and, by comparing to mutagen exposure or downstream mutational profile and signatures, be used to improve our understanding of cancer molecular etiology.",

The Xi shows weakened topologically associated domains and is instead organized into megadomains and superloops directed by the noncoding loci, Dxz4 and Firre. Their functional significance is presently unclear, though one study suggests that they permit Xi genes to escape silencing. Here, we find that megadomains do not precede Xist expression or Xi gene silencing. Deleting Dxz4 disrupts megadomain formation, whereas deleting Firre weakens intra-megadomain interactions. Surprisingly, however, deleting Dxz4 and Firre has no impact on Xi silencing and gene escape. Nor does it affect Xi nuclear localization, stability, or H3K27 methylation. Additionally, ectopic integration of Dxz4 and Xist is not sufficient to form megadomains on autosomes, further uncoupling megadomain formation from chromosomal silencing. We conclude that Dxz4 and megadomains are dispensable for Xi silencing and escape from X-inactivation.",

    "abstract": "Rhizopus spp are the most common etiological agents of mucormycosis, causing over 90% mortality in disseminated infection. Key to pathogenesis is the ability of fungal spores to swell, germinate, and penetrate surrounding tissues. Antibiotic treatment in at-risk patients increases the probability of the patient developing mucormycosis, suggesting that bacteria have the potential to control the growth of the fungus. However, research into polymicrobial relationships involving Rhizopus spp has not been extensively explored. Here we show that co-culturing Rhizopus microsporus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa results in the inhibition of spore germination. This inhibition was mediated via the secretion of bacterial siderophores, confirming the essential role of iron for fungal growth. Addition of P. aeruginosa siderophores to R. microsporus spores in the zebrafish larval model of infection resulted in inhibition of fungal germination and reduced host mortality. Therefore, during infection antibacterial treatment may relieve bacterial imposed nutrient restriction resulting in secondary fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-Seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet-cell and multiplet-cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell-types can appear as hybrid scRNA-Seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic and cell-hashing cell singlets and doublets from scRNA-Seq datasets of varying cellular complexity. DoubletDecon is able to account for cell-cycle effects and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms (e.g., ICGS, Seurat). We believe this approach has the potential to become a standard quality control step for the accurate delineation of cell states.",

    "abstract": "Human contrast discrimination performance is limited by transduction nonlinearities and variability of the neural representation (noise). Whereas the nonlinearities have been well-characterised, there is less agreement about the specifics of internal noise. Psychophysical models assume that it impacts late in sensory processing, whereas neuroimaging and intracranial electrophysiology studies suggest that the noise is much earlier. We investigated whether perceptually-relevant internal noise arises in early visual areas or later decision making areas. We recorded EEG and MEG during a two-interval-forced-choice contrast discrimination task and used multivariate pattern analysis to decode target/non-target and selected/non-selected intervals from evoked responses. We found that perceptual decisions could be decoded from both EEG and MEG signals, even when the stimuli in both intervals were physically identical. Above-chance decision classification started <100ms after stimulus onset, suggesting that neural noise affects sensory signals early in the visual pathway. Classification accuracy increased over time, peaking at >500ms. Applying multivariate analysis to separate anatomically-defined brain regions in MEG source space, we found that occipital regions were informative early on but then information spreads forwards across parietal and frontal regions. This is consistent with neural noise affecting sensory processing at multiple stages of perceptual decision making. We suggest how early sensory noise might be resolved with Birdsalls linearisation, in which a dominant noise source obscures subsequent nonlinearities, to allow the visual system to preserve the wide dynamic range of early areas whilst still benefitting from contrast-invariance at later stages.

Multiple secretory routes exist in cells, which paves the way to the development of inhibitory molecules able to specifically perturb the transport of a chosen cargo. We used differential high-content screening of chemical libraries to identify molecules reducing the secretion of CCR5, the major co-receptor for HIV-1 entry. Three molecules strongly affected the anterograde transport of CCR5, without inhibiting the transport of the related G protein-coupled receptors CCR1 and CXCR4. These three molecules perturb the transport of endogenous CCR5 and decrease the entry of HIV in human primary target cells. Two molecules were found to share the same mode of action, inhibiting palmitoylation of CCR5. Our results demonstrate that secretory routes can be specifically targeted which allows to envisage novel strategies to provoke the intracellular retention or rerouting of secretory proteins involved in disease development.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) can productively infect many different cell types of human and non-human origin. Here we demonstrate interconnected roles for two host enzymes, heparanase (HPSE) and cathepsin L in HSV-2 release from cells. In vaginal epithelial cells and other cell lines tested, HSV-2 causes heparan sulfate shedding and upregulation in HPSE levels during the productive phase of infection. We also noted increased levels of cathepsin L and show that regulation of HPSE by cathepsin L via cleavage of HPSE proenzyme is important for infection. Furthermore, inhibition of HPSE by a specific inhibitor, OGT 2115, dramatically reduces HSV-2 release from vaginal epithelial cells. Likewise, we show evidence that the inhibition of cathepsin L is detrimental to the infection. The HPSE increase after infection is mediated by an increased NF-{kappa}B nuclear localization and a resultant activation of HPSE transcription. Together these mechanisms contribute to the removal of heparan sulfate from the cell surface, and thus facilitate virus release from cells.\\n\\nImportanceGenital infections by HSV-2 represent one of the most common sexually transmitted viral infections. The virus causes painful lesions, and sores around the genitals or rectum. Intermittent release of the virus from infected tissues during sexual activities is the most common cause of transmission. At the molecular level, cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) is known to provide attachment sites for HSV-2. While the removal of HS during HSV-1 release has been shown, not much is known about the host factors and their regulators that contribute to HSV-2 release from natural target cell types. Here we suggest a role for the host enzyme heparanase in HSV-2 release. Our work reveals that in addition to the regulation of transcription by NF-{kappa}B, HPSE is also regulated post-translationally by cathepsin L and that inhibition of heparanase activity directly affects HSV-2 release. We provide unique insights into the host mechanisms controlling HSV-2 egress and spread.",

    "abstract": "The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is the global iron biosensor in many bacteria. Fur functions as an iron-activated transcriptional repressor for most of its regulated genes. There are a few examples where holo-Fur activates transcription, either directly or indirectly. Recent studies suggest that apo-Fur might also act as a positive regulator and, besides iron metabolism, the Fur regulon might encompass other biological processes such as DNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and biofilm formation. Here, we obtained a genomic view of the Fur regulatory network in Bacillus subtilis using ChIP-seq. Besides the known Fur target sites, 70 putative DNA binding sites were identified, and the vast majority had higher occupancy under iron sufficient conditions. Among the new sites detected, a Fur binding site in the promoter region of the catDE operon is of particular interest. This operon, encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, is critical for catechol degradation and is under negative regulation by CatR and YodB. These three repressors function cooperatively to regulate the transcription of catDE, with Fur functioning as a sensor of iron-limitation and CatR as the major sensor of catechol stress. Genetic analysis suggests that CatDE is involved in metabolism of the catecholate siderophore bacillibactin, particularly when bacillibactin is constitutively produced and accumulates intracellularly, potentially generating endogenous toxic catechol derivatives. This study documents a role for catechol degradation in bacillibactin metabolism, and provides evidence that catechol 2,3-dioxygenase can detoxify endogenously produced catechol substrates in addition to its more widely studied role in biodegradation of environmental aromatic compounds and pollutants.\\n\\nImportanceMany bacteria synthesize high affinity iron chelators (siderophores). Siderophore-mediated iron acquisition is an efficient and widely utilized strategy for bacteria to meet their cellur iron requirements. One prominent class of siderophores uses catecholate groups to chelate iron. B. subtilis bacillibactin, structurally similar to enterobactin (made by enteric bacteria), is a triscatecholate siderophore that is hydrolyzed to monomeric units after import to release iron. However, the ultimate fate of these catechol compounds and their potential toxicity have not been defined previously. Here, we performed genome-wide identification of Fur binding sites in vivo and uncovered a connection between catechol degradation and bacillibactin metabolism in B. subtilis. Beside its role in detoxification of environmental catechols, the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase encoded by catDE also protects cells from intoxication by endogeous bacillibactin-derived catechol metabolites under iron-limited conditions. These findings shed light on the degradation pathway and precursor recycling of the catecholate siderophores.",

    "abstract": "During human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection the frequency of cells harboring an integrated copy of viral cDNA, the proviral load (PVL), is the main risk factor for progression of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Accurate quantification of provirus by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a powerful diagnostic tool with emerging uses for monitoring viral expression. Current ddPCR techniques quantify HTLV-1 PVL in terms of whole genomic cellular material, while the main target of HTLV-1 infection is the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell. Our understanding of HTLV-1 proliferation and the amount of viral burden present in different compartments is limited. Recently a sensitive ddPCR assay was applied to quantifying T-cells by measuring loss of germline T-cell receptor genes as method of distinguishing non-T-cell from recombined T-cell DNA. In this study, we demonstrated and validated novel applications of the duplex ddPCR assay to quantify T-cells from various sources of human gDNA extracted from frozen material (PBMCs, bronchoalveolar lavage, and induced sputum) from a cohort of remote Indigenous Australians and then compared the T-cell measurements by ddPCR to the prevailing standard method of flow cytometry. The HTLV-1c PVL was then calculated in terms of extracted T-cell gDNA from various compartments. Because HTLV-1c preferentially infects CD4+ T-cells, and the amount of viral burden correlates with HTLV-1c disease pathogenesis, application of this ddPCR assay to accurately measure HTLV-1c-infected T-cells can be of greater importance for clinical diagnostics, prognostics as well as monitoring therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly being used to model complex cognitive and motor tasks performed by behaving animals. Here, RNNs are trained to reproduce animal behavior while also recapitulating key statistics of empirically recorded neural activity. In this manner, the RNN can be viewed as an in silico circuit whose computational elements share similar motifs with the cortical area it is modeling. Further, as the RNN's governing equations and parameters are fully known, they can be analyzed to propose hypotheses for how neural populations compute. In this context, we present important considerations when using RNNs to model motor behavior in a delayed reach task. First, by varying the network's nonlinear activation and rate regularization, we show that RNNs reproducing single neuron firing rate motifs may not adequately capture important population motifs. Second, by visualizing the RNN's dynamics in low-dimensional projections, we demonstrate that even when RNNs recapitulate key neurophysiological features on both the single neuron and population levels, it can do so through distinctly different dynamical mechanisms. To militate between these mechanisms, we show that an RNN consistent with a previously proposed dynamical mechanism is more robust to noise. Finally, we show that these dynamics are sufficient for the RNN to generalize to a target switch task it was not trained on. Together, these results emphasize important considerations when using RNN models to probe neural dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of the molecular responses underpinning diatom responses to ocean acidification is fundamental for predicting how important primary producers will be shaped by the continuous rise in atmospheric CO2. In this study, we have analyzed global transcriptomic changes of the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum following growth for 15 generations in elevated pCO2 by strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq). Our results indicate that no significant effects of elevated pCO2 and associated carbonate chemistry changes on the physiological performance of the cells were observed after 15 generations whereas the expression of genes encoding histones and other genes involved in chromatin structure were significantly down-regulated, while the expression of transposable elements (TEs) and genes encoding histone acetylation enzymes were significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, we identified a series of long non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs) specifically responsive to elevated pCO2, suggesting putative regulatory roles for these largely uncharacterized genome components. Taken together, our integrative analyses reveal that epigenetic elements such as TEs, histone modifications and lncRNAs may have important roles in the acclimation of diatoms to elevated pCO2 over short time scales and thus may influence longer term adaptive processes in response to progressive ocean acidification.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAnalysis of differential alternative splicing from RNA-seq data is complicated by the fact that many RNA-seq reads map to multiple transcripts, besides, the annotated transcripts are often a small subset of the possible transcripts of a gene. Here we describe Yanagi, a tool for segmenting transcriptome to create a library of maximal L-disjoint segments from a complete transcriptome annotation. That segment library preserves all transcriptome substrings of length L and transcripts structural relationships while eliminating unnecessary sequence duplications.\\n\\nContributionsIn this paper, we formalize the concept of transcriptome segmentation and propose an efficient algorithm for generating segment libraries based on a length parameter dependent on specific RNA-Seq library construction. The resulting segment sequences can be used with pseudo-alignment tools to quantify expression at the segment level. We characterize the segment libraries for the reference transcriptomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens and provide gene-level visualization of the segments for better interpretability. Then we demonstrate the use of segments-level quantification into gene expression and alternative splicing analysis. The notion of transcript segmentation as introduced here and implemented in Yanagi opens the door for the application of lightweight, ultra-fast pseudo-alignment algorithms in a wide variety of RNA-seq analyses.\\n\\nConclusionUsing segment library rather than the standard transcriptome succeeds in significantly reducing ambigious alignments where reads are multimapped to several sequences in the reference. That allowed avoiding the quantification step required by standard kmer-based pipelines for gene expression analysis. Moreover, using segment counts as statistics for alternative splicing analysis enables achieving comparable performance to counting-based approaches (e.g. rMATS) while rather using fast and lighthweight pseudo alignment.",

    "abstract": "The study of rare Mendelian diseases through exome sequencing typically yields incomplete diagnostic rates, ~8-70% depending on the disease type. Whole genome sequencing of the unresolved cases allows addressing the hypothesis that causal variants could lay in non-coding regions with damaging regulatory consequences. The large amount of rare and singleton variants found in each individual genome requires computational filtering and scoring strategies to gain power in downstream statistical genetics tests. However, state-of-the-art methods estimating the functional relevance of non-coding genomic regions have been mostly characterized on sets of variants largely composed of trait-associated polymorphisms and associated to common diseases, yet with modest accuracy and strong positional biases. In this work we first curated a collection of n=737 high-confidence pathogenic non-coding single-nucleotide variants in proximal cis-regulatory genomic regions associated to monogenic Mendelian diseases. We then systematically evaluated the ability to predict causal variants of a comprehensive set of natural selection features extracted at three genomic levels: the affected position, the flanking region and the associated gene. In addition to inter-species conservation, a comprehensive set of recent and ongoing purifying selection signals in human was explored, allowing to capture potential constraints associated to recently acquired regulatory elements in the human lineage. A supervised learning approach using gradient tree boosting on such features reached a high predictive performance characterized by an area under the ROC curve = 0.84 and an area under the Precision-Recall curve = 0.47. The figures represent a relative improvement of >10% and >34% respectively upon the performance of current state-of-the-art methods for prioritizing non-coding variants. Performance was consistent under multiple configurations of the sets of variants used for learning and for independent testing. The supervised learning design allowed the assessment of newly seen non-coding variants overcoming gene and positional bias. The scores produced by the approach allow a more consistent weighting and aggregation of candidate pathogenic variants from diverse non-coding regions within and across genes in the context of statistical tests for rare variant association analysis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBurgeoning evidence from randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies suggests that physical activity protects against depression, pointing to a potential modifiable target for prevention. However, the direction of this inverse association is not clear: physical activity may reduce risk for depression, and/or depression may result in decreased physical activity. Here, we used bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to test causal influences between physical activity and depression.\\n\\nMethodsFor genetic instruments, we selected independent top SNPs associated with major depressive disorder (MDD, N = 143,265) and two physical activity phenotypes--self-reported (N = 377,234) and objective accelerometer-based (N = 91,084)--from the largest available, non-overlapping genome-wide association results. We used two sets of genetic instruments: (1) only SNPs previously reported as genome-wide significant, and (2) top SNPs meeting a more relaxed threshold (p < 1x10-7). For each direction of influence, we combined the MR effect estimates from each instrument SNP using inverse variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis, along with other standard MR methods such as weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO.\\n\\nResultsWe found evidence for protective influences of accelerometer-based activity on MDD (IVW odds ratio (OR) = 0.74 for MDD per 1 SD unit increase in average acceleration, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59-0.92, p =.006) when using SNPs meeting the relaxed threshold (i.e., 10 versus only 2 genome-wide significant SNPs, which provided insufficient data for sensitivity analyses). In contrast, we found no evidence for negative influences of MDD on accelerometer-based activity (IVW b = 0.04 change in average acceleration for MDD versus control status, 95% CI = -0.43-0.51, p =.87). Furthermore, we did not see evidence for causal influences between self-reported activity and MDD, in either direction and regardless of instrument SNP criteria.\\n\\nDiscussionWe apply MR for the first time to examine causal influences between physical activity and MDD. We discover that objectively measured--but not self-reported--physical activity is inversely associated with MDD. Of note, prior work has shown that accelerometer-based physical activity is more heritable than self-reported activity, in addition to being more representative of actual movement. Our findings validate physical activity as a protective factor for MDD and point to the importance of objective measurement of physical activity in epidemiological studies in relation to mental health. Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that enhancing physical activity is an effective prevention strategy for depression.",

Here we perform systematic experiments on synthetic sequences to reveal how CNN architecture, specifically convolutional filter size and max-pooling, influences the extent that sequence motif representations are learned by first layer filters. We find that CNNs designed to foster hierarchical representation learning of sequence motifs - assembling partial features into whole features in deeper layers - tend to learn distributed representations, i.e. partial motifs. On the other hand, CNNs that are designed to limit the ability to hierarchically build sequence motif representations in deeper layers tend to learn more interpretable localist representations, i.e. whole motifs. We then validate that this representation learning principle established from synthetic sequences generalizes to in vivo sequences.",

    "abstract": "Population structure in genotype data has been extensively studied, and is revealed by looking at the principal components of the genotype matrix. However, no similar analysis of population structure in gene expression data has been conducted, in part because a naive principal components analysis of the gene expression matrix does not cluster by population. We identify a linear projection that reveals population structure in gene expression data. Our approach relies on the coupling of the principal components of genotype to the principal components of gene expression via canonical correlation analysis. Futhermore, we analyze the variance of each gene within the projection matrix to determine which genes significantly influence the projection. We identify thousands of significant genes, and show that a number of the top genes have been implicated in diseases that disproportionately impact African Americans.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHigh dimensional, multi-modal genomics datasets are becoming increasingly common, which warrants investigation into analysis techniques that can reveal structure in the data without over-fitting. Here, we show that the coupling of principal component analysis to canonical correlation analysis offers an efficient approach to exploratory analysis of this kind of data. We apply this method to the GEUVADIS dataset of genotype and gene expression values of European and Yoruban individuals, finding as-of-yet unstudied population structure in the gene expression values. Moreover, many of the top genes identified by our method have been previously implicated in diseases that disproportionately impact African Americans.",

    "abstract": "The human epigenome has been experimentally characterized by measurements of protein binding, chromatin acessibility, methylation, and histone modification in hundreds of cell types. The result is a huge compendium of data, consisting of thousands of measurements for every basepair in the human genome. These data are difficult to make sense of, not only for humans, but also for computational methods that aim to detect genes and other functional elements, predict gene expression, characterize polymorphisms, etc. To address this challenge, we propose a deep neural network tensor factorization method, Avocado, that compresses epigenomic data into a dense, information-rich representation of the human genome. We use data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium to demonstrate that this learned representation of the genome is broadly useful: first, by imputing epigenomic data more accurately than previous methods, and second, by showing that machine learning models that exploit this representation outperform those trained directly on epigenomic data on a variety of genomics tasks. These tasks include predicting gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions, replication timing, and an element of 3D chromatin architecture. Our findings suggest the broad utility of Avocados learned latent representation for computational genomics and epigenomics.",

We propose HINT-ATAC, a footprinting method that addresses ATAC-seq specific protocol artifacts. HINT-ATAC uses a probabilistic framework based on Variable-order Markov models to learn the complex sequence cleavage preferences of the transposase enzyme. Moreover, we observed specific strand specific cleavage patterns around the binding sites of transcription factors, which are determined by local nucleosome architecture. HINT-ATAC explores local nucleosome architecture to significantly outperform competing footprinting methods in predicting transcription factor binding sites by ChIP-seq.

Knock-out of YBX2 leads to maturation arrest in animal models. YBX2 binds PRM1 and 2 mRNA, which is transcribed early and sequestrated for translation during late spermatogenesis.\\n\\nObjectiveThis study aimed to determine if the loss of YBX2 is associated with MA arrest due to the loss of sequestration of protamines in the human testis. As a second aim, we examined the expression of YBX2, and its transcription factors in maturation arrest (MA)(early and late) and normal controls in men.\\n\\nMethodsRNAseq was performed using RNA extracted from human testis samples from 44 men with non-obstructive azoospermia and ten from healthy controls. Differential expression was performed using JMPgenomics, FDR<0.001. FANTOM5 was used to predict enhancers and inhibitors of YBX2 expression. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to stain testis tissue sections with antibodies against YBX2, SYCP3, and PRM2 in normal and MA samples. Flow cytometry was utilized to characterize YBX2 positive cells.\\n\\nResultsExpression of YBX2 mRNA was significantly downregulated in early and late MA compared to controls. Surprisingly, PRM1&2 mRNAs were also depleted in men with MA. Multifactorial regression analysis demonstrated a decrease in YBX2 expression in MA is due to decrease in COMP levels (p<0.0001). IF localized YBX2 protein in spermatocytes and round spermatids among fertile men, with rare YBX2 positive spermatocytes stained in LMA. PRM1&2 proteins were absent or abnormally sequestrated within spermatocytes.\\n\\nConclusionsDecrease in YBX2 protein expression in men with LMA leads to loss of translational suppression and lack of PRM1 and PRM2 necessary to complete spermatogenesis.",

One large-scale deep-sequencing study of human influenza reported high levels of shared viral genetic diversity among infected individuals in Hong Kong, but subsequent studies of other cohorts have reported little shared viral diversity. We re-analyze sequencing data from four studies of within-host genetic diversity encompassing more than 500 acute human influenza infections. We identify an anomaly in the Hong Kong data that provides a technical explanation for these discrepancies: read pairs from this study are often split between different biological samples, indicating that some reads are incorrectly assigned. These technical abnormalities explain the high levels of within-host variation and loose transmission bottlenecks reported by this study. Studies without these anomalies consistently report low levels of genetic diversity in acute human influenza infections.",

    "abstract": "Full-length isoform sequencing has advanced our knowledge of isoform biology1-11. However, apart from applying full-length isoform sequencing to very few single cells12,13, isoform sequencing has been limited to bulk tissue, cell lines, or sorted cells. Single splicing events have been described for <=200 single cells with great statistical success14,15, but these methods do not describe full-length mRNAs. Single cell short-read 3 sequencing has allowed identification of many cell sub-types16-23, but full-length isoforms for these cell types have not been profiled. Using our new method of single-cell-isoform-RNA-sequencing (ScISOr-Seq) we determine isoform-expression in thousands of individual cells from a heterogeneous bulk tissue (cerebellum), without specific antibody-fluorescence activated cell sorting. We elucidate isoform usage in high-level cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and microglia and finer sub-types, such as Purkinje cells and Granule cells, including the combination patterns of distant splice sites6-9,24,25, which for individual molecules requires long reads. We produce an enhanced genome annotation revealing cell-type specific expression of known and 16,872 novel (with respect to mouse Gencode version 10) isoforms (see isoformatlas.com).\\n\\nScISOr-Seq describes isoforms from >1,000 single cells from bulk tissue without cell sorting by leveraging two technologies in three steps: In step one, we employ microfluidics to produce amplified full-length cDNAs barcoded for their cell of origin. This cDNA is split into two pools: one pool for 3 sequencing to measure gene expression (step 2) and another pool for long-read sequencing and isoform expression (step 3). In step two, short-read 3-sequencing provides molecular counts for each gene and cell, which allows clustering cells and assigning a cell type using cell-type specific markers. In step three, an aliquot of the same cDNAs (each barcoded for the individual cell of origin) is sequenced using Pacific Biosciences (\\\"PacBio\\\")1,2,4,5,26 or Oxford Nanopore3. Since these long reads carry the single-cell barcodes identified in step two, one can determine the individual cell from which each long read originates. Since most single cells are assigned to a named cluster, we can also assign the cells cluster name (e.g. \\\"Purkinje cell\\\" or \\\"astrocyte\\\") to the long read in question (Fig 1A) - without losing the cell of origin of each long read.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/364950_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (66K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4df0cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fc4beborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc485forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1138a3e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO (A) Outline of our ScISOr-Seq approach.

It has been investigated as an antibiotic, inhibitor of viral entry, therapeutic for cystic fibrosis, and tumor and vasculature imaging agent. Duramycin contains a {beta}-hydroxylated Asp (Hya) and four macrocycles, including an essential lysinoalanine (Lal) crosslink. The mechanism of Lal formation is not known. We here show that Lal is installed stereospecifically by DurN via addition of Lys19 to a dehydroalanine. The structure of DurN reveals an unusual dimer with a new fold. Surprisingly, in the structure of duramycin bound to DurN, no residues of the enzyme are near the Lal. Instead, Hya15 of the substrate makes interactions with Lal suggesting it acts as a base to deprotonate Lys19 during catalysis. Biochemical data suggest that DurN preorganizes the reactive conformation of the substrate, such that the Hya15 of the substrate can serve as the catalytic base for Lal formation.",

    "abstract": "How ions affect RNA folding thermodynamics and kinetics is an important but a vexing problem that remains unsolved. Experiments have shown that the free energy change, {Delta}G(c), of RNA upon folding varies with the salt concentration (c) as, {Delta}G(c) = kc ln c + const, where the coefficient kc is proportional to the difference in the uptake of ions (ion preferential coefficient), {Delta}{Gamma}, between the folded and unfolded states. We performed simulations of a coarse-grained model, by modeling electrostatic interactions implicitly and with explicit representation of ions, to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of the relationship between folding free energy and ion preferential coefficient. Without any input from experiments, the simulations quantitatively reproduce the heat capacity for the -1 frame shifting pseudoknot (PK) from Beet Western Yellow Virus, thus validating the model. We show that {Delta}G(c) calculated directly from {Delta}{Gamma} varies linearly with ln c (c < 0.2M), for a hairpin and the PK, thus demonstrating a molecular link between the two quantities for RNA molecules that undergo substantial conformational changes during folding. Explicit ion simulations also show the linear dependence of {Delta}G(c) on ln c at all c with kc = 2kBT, except that {Delta}G(c) values are shifted by about 2 kcal/mol higher than experiments at all salt concentrations. The discrepancy is due to an underestimate the {Gamma} values for both the folded and unfolded states, while giving accurate values for {Delta}{Gamma}. The predictions for the salt dependence of {Delta}{Gamma} are amenable to test using single molecule pulling experiments. Our simulations, representing a significant advance in quantitatively describing ion effects in RNA, show that the framework provided here can be used to obtain accurate thermodynamics of RNA folding.",

Zebrafish were used to determine the ability of rs1967017 to direct tissue-specific gene expression. Luciferase assays in HEK293 and HepG2 cells measured the effect of rs1967017 on transcription amplitude.\\n\\nPAINTOR analysis revealed rs1967017 as most likely to be causal and rs1967017 was an eQTL for PDZK1 in the intestine. The region harboring rs1967017 was capable of directly driving green fluorescent protein expression in the kidney, liver and intestine of zebrafish embryos, consistent with a conserved ability to confer tissue-specific expression. The urate-increasing T-allele of rs1967017 strengthens a binding site for the transcription factor HNF4A. siRNA depletion of HNF4A reduced endogenous PDZK1 expression in HepG2 cells. Luciferase assays showed that the T-allele of rs1967017 gains enhancer activity relative to the urate-decreasing C-allele, with T-allele enhancer activity abrogated by HNF4A depletion. HNF4A physically binds the rs1967017 region, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation of PDZK1 by HNF4A.\\n\\nWith other reports our data predict that the urate-raising T-allele of rs1967017 enhances HNF4A binding to the PDZK1 promoter, thereby increasing PDZK1 expression. As PDZK1 is a scaffold protein for many ion channel transporters, increased expression can be predicted to increase activity of urate transporters and alter excretion of urate.",

    "abstract": "Replicative aging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an established model system for eukaryotic cellular aging. A major limitation in yeast lifespan studies has been the difficulty of separating old cells from young cells in large quantities for in-depth comparative analyses. We engineered a new platform, the Miniature-chemostat Aging Device (MAD), that enables purification of aged cells at sufficient quantities to enable genomic and biochemical characterization of aging yeast populations. Using the MAD platform, we measured DNA accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and gene expression (RNA-Seq) changes in aging cells. Our data highlight an intimate connection between aging, growth rate, and stress, as many (but not all) genes that change with age have altered expression in cells that are subjected to stress. Stress-independent genes that change with age are highly enriched for targets of the signal recognition particle (SRP). By obtaining pure populations of old cells, we find that nucleosome occupancy does not change significantly with age; however, significant age-dependent changes in accessibility at ~12% of genomic loci reflect decreased replication and changing activities of cell cycle and metabolic regulators. Finally, ATAC-seq revealed that upregulating the proteasome by deleting UBR2 reduces rDNA instability usually observed in aging cells, demonstrating a connection between proteasome activity and genomic stability.",
