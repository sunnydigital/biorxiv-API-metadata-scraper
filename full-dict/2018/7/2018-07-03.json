    "abstract": "A gnotobiotic chicken model was developed to study the succession of intestinal microflora from hatching to 18 days of age. Intestinal samples were collected from a local population of feral chickens and administered orally to germ-free 3 day old chicks. Animals were enthanized on 0, 9 and 18 days of age and intestinal samples were collected and subjected to genomic analysis. The five most prevalent phyla were Bacteroidetes (45.73{+/-}3.35%), Firmicutes (36.47{+/-}2.60%), Proteobacteria (8.28{+/-}0.91%), Actinobacteria (5.09{+/-}0.52%), and Spriochetes (2.10{+/-}0.38%). Principle coordinate analysis indicated the 0, 9 day and 18 day variables clustered together and the microbial communities changed temporally. The Morista-Horn index values ranged from 0.72 to 1, indicating the communities at 0, 9 or 18 days were more similar than dissimilar. The predicted functional profiles of the microbiomes of 0, 9 and 18 days were also similar. These results indicate the gnotobiotic chicks stably maintain the phylogentic diversity and predicted metabolic functionality of the inoculum community.\\n\\nImportanceThe domestic chicken is the cornerstone of animal agriculture worldwide with a flock population exceeding 40 billion birds/year. It serves as the economically valuable source of protein globally. Microbiome of poultry has important effects on chicken growth, feed conversion, immune status and pathogen resistance. The significance of our research is in developing a gnotobiotic chicken model to study chicken gut microbiota function. Our experimental model shows that young germfree chicks are able to colonize diverse set of gut bacteria. Therefore, besides using this model to study mechanisms of gut microbiota interactions in the chicken gut, our model could be also used for applied aspects such as determining the safety and efficacy of new probiotic strains derived from chicken gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research has established that humans have preferences for some colors (e.g., blue) and a dislike of others (e.g., dark chartreuse), with preference varying systematically with variation in hue (e.g., Hurlbert & Owen, 2015). Here, we used functional MRI to investigate why humans have likes and dislikes for simple patches of color, and to understand the neural basis of preference, aesthetics and value judgements more generally. We looked for correlations of a behavioural measure of color preference with the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response when participants performed an irrelevant orientation judgement task on colored squares. A whole brain analysis found a significant correlation between BOLD activity and color preference in the posterior midline cortex (PMC), centred on the precuneus but extending into the adjacent posterior cingulate and cuneus. These results demonstrate that brain activity is modulated by color preference, even when such preferences are irrelevant to the ongoing task the participants are engaged. They also suggest that color preferences automatically influence our processing of the visual world. Interestingly, the effect in the PMC overlaps with regions identified in neuroimaging studies of preference and value judgements of other types of stimuli. Therefore, our findings extends this literature to show that the PMC is related to automatic encoding of subjective value even for basic visual features such as color.",

    "abstract": "Low-level visual features have been known to play a role in value-based decision-making. However, thus far, mainly single features were tested on one type of item using one method of measurement. Here, we test the contribution of low-level visual features on three items types: fractal-art images, faces, and snack food items. We test the role of visual features on preferences using both subjective ratings and choices. We show that low-level visual features contribute to value-based decision-making even after controlling for higher level configural features of faces like eye-distance and market features of snacks like calories. Importantly, we show that while low-level visual features consistently contribute to value-based decision-making, different features contribute to different types of items when using different measurement methods. Our study highlights the necessity of using multiple item types and multiple measurement methods to construct a unifying framework regarding the contribution of low-level features to value-based decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Resting heart rate variability (HRV), an index of parasympathetic cardioregulation and an individual trait marker related to mental and physical health, decreases with age. Previous studies have associated resting HRV with structural and functional properties of the brain - mainly in cortical midline and limbic structures. We hypothesized that HRV may alter its relationship with brain structure and function across the adult lifespan. In 388 healthy subjects of three age groups (140 younger: 26.0{+/-}4.2 years, 119 middle-aged: 46.3{+/-}6.2 years, 129 older: 66.9{+/-}4.7 years), gray matter structure (voxel-based morphometry) and resting-state functional connectivity (eigenvector centrality mapping and exploratory seed-based functional connectivity) were related to resting HRV, measured as the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Confirming previous findings, resting HRV decreased with age. For HRV-related gray matter volume, there were no statistically significant differences between the age groups, nor similarities across all age groups. In whole-brain functional connectivity analyses, we found an age-dependent association between resting HRV and eigenvector centrality in the bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), driven by the younger adults. Across all age groups, HRV was positively correlated with network centrality in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis using the vmPFC cluster revealed an HRV-related cortico-cerebellar network in younger but not in middle-aged or older adults. Our results indicate that the decrease of HRV with age is accompanied by changes in functional connectivity along the cortical midline. This extends our knowledge of brain-body interactions and their changes over the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulation plays a critical role in brain function in both health and disease. New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. These nIRCat nanosensors may be advantageous for future use because i) they do not require virus delivery, gene delivery, or protein expression, ii) their near-infrared fluorescence facilitates imaging in optically scattering brain tissue and is compatible for use in conjunction with other optical neuroscience tool sets, iii) the broad availability of unique near-infrared colors have the potential for simultaneous detection of multiple neurochemical signals, and iv) they are compatible with pharmacology. Together, these data suggest nIRCats and other nanosensors of this class can serve as versatile new optical tools to report dynamics of extracellular neuromodulation in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Chondrocytes use the pathways of central metabolism to synthesize molecular building blocks and energy for cartilage homeostasis. An interesting feature of the in vivo chondrocyte environment is the cyclical loading generated in various activities (e.g. walking). However, it is unknown if central metabolism is altered by mechanical loading. We hypothesized that physiological dynamic compression alters central metabolism in chondrocytes to promote production of amino acid precursors for matrix synthesis. We measured the expression of central metabolites (e.g. glucose, its derivatives, and relevant co-factors) for primary human osteoarthritic chondrocytes in response to 0-30 minutes of compression. To analyze the data, we used principal components analysis and ANOVA simultaneous components analysis, as well as metabolic [fl]ux analysis. Compression induced metabolic responses consistent with our hypothesis. Additionally, these data show that chondrocyte samples from different patient donors exhibit different sensitivity to compression. Most important, we [fi]nd that grade IV osteoarthritic chondrocytes are capable of synthesizing non-essential amino acids and precursors in response to mechanical loading. These results suggest that further advances in metabolic engineering of chondrocyte mechanotransduction may yield novel translational strategies for cartilage repair.",

    "abstract": "Absolute pitch (AP) refers to the rare ability to name the pitch of a tone without external reference. It is widely believed that AP is only for the selected few with rare genetic makeup and early musical training during the critical period. Accordingly, acquiring AP in adulthood is impossible. Previous studies have not offered a strong test of the effect of training because of issues like small sample size and insufficient training. In three experiments, adults learned to name pitches in a computerized and personalized protocol for 12 to 40 hours. They improved considerably, with a continuous distribution of learning progress among them. 14% of the participants (6 out of 43) were able to name twelve pitches at accuracy of 90% or above, comparable to that of  AP possessors as defined in the literature. In general, AP learning showed classic characteristics of perceptual learning, including generalization of learning dependent on the training stimuli, and sustained improvement for at least one to three months. Overall, the finding that AP continues to be learnable in adulthood calls for reconsidering the role of learning in the occurrence of AP. The finding also pushes the field to pinpoint and explain, if any, the differences between the aspects of AP more trainable in adulthood and the aspects of AP that are potentially exclusive for the few exceptional AP possessors.",

Here, we present de novo assemblies of the nuclear (~520 million base pairs [bp]) and mitochondrial (13,752 bp) genomes for L. tumana. The L. tumana nuclear genome is the most complete stonefly genome reported to date, with ~71% of genes present in complete form and > 4,600 contigs longer than 10 kilobases (kb). The L. tumana mitochondrial genome is the second for the family Nemouridae and the first from North America. Together, both genomes represent important foundational resources, setting the stage for future efforts to understand the evolution of L. tumana, stoneflies, and aquatic insects worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Species-specific vocal signals allow listeners to locate potential mates. During the tetrapod transition from water to land, lungs replaced gills, allowing expiration to drive sound production. Several groups, e.g. cetaceans and some frogs, then returned to water. Here we explore how air-driven sound production changed upon re-entry and how essential acoustic information on species identity was preserved in the secondarily aquatic frog Xenopus. We filmed movements of cartilage and muscles during evoked sound production in isolated larynges. Our results refute the current theory for Xenopus vocalization, cavitation, and instead favor sound production by mechanical excitation of laryngeal resonance modes following rapid separation of laryngeal arytenoid discs. The resulting frequency resonance modes (dyads) are intrinsic to the larynx rather than due to neuromuscular control. We show that dyads are a distinctive acoustic signature across species. While dyad component frequencies overlap across species, their ratio is shared within each Xenopus clade and thus provide information on species identity, potentially facilitating both conspecific localization and ancient species divergence.",

Here we simulated RI vision and investigated if object recognition in RI patients can be improved and maintained through training. Importantly, we asked if the trained object recognition can be generalized to a new task context, and to new viewpoints of the trained objects. For this purpose, we adopted two training tasks, a naming task where participants had to choose the correct label out of other distracting labels for the presented object, and a discrimination task where participants had to choose the correct object out of other distracting objects to match the presented label. Our results showed that, despite of the task order, recognition performance was improved in both tasks and lasted at least for a week. The improved object recognition, however, can be transferred only from the naming task to the discrimination task but not vice versa. Additionally, the trained object recognition can be transferred to new viewpoints of the trained objects only in the naming task but not in the discrimination task. Training with the naming task is therefore recommended for RI patients to achieve persistent and flexible visual perception.",

    "abstract": "Energy landscape theory suggests that native interactions are a major determinant of the folding mechanism of a protein. Thus, structure-based (G[o]) models have, aided by coarse-graining techniques, shown great success in capturing the mechanisms of protein folding and conformational changes. In certain cases, however, non-native interactions and atomic details are also essential to describe the protein dynamics, prompting the development of a variety of structure-based models which include non-native interactions, and differentiate between different types of attractive potentials. Here, we describe an all-protein-atom hybrid model, termed ProfasiGo, that integrates an implicit solvent all-atom physics-based model (called Profasi) and a structure-based G[o] potential, and its implementation in two software packages (PHAISTOS and ProFASi) that are developed for Monte Carlo sampling of protein molecules. We apply the ProfasiGo model to study the folding free energy landscapes of four topologically similar proteins, one of which can be folded by the simplified potential Profasi, and two that have been folded by explicit solvent, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with the CHARMM22* force field. Our results reveal that the hybrid ProfasiGo model is able to capture many of the details present in the physics-based potentials, while retaining the advantages of G[o] models for sampling and guiding to the native state. We expect that the model will be widely applicable to study the folding of more complex proteins, or to study conformational dynamics and integration with experimental data.",

In this study we aimed to find the factors affecting university students smoking status.\\n\\nMethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2017 with a simple random sampling method. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette smoking status, and the related risk factors. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis with the Backward:LR test were performed.\\n\\nResultsOut of 2723 students, 2505 students data were available and suitable for analysis. Mean participant age was 20.9{+/-}2.5, with female dominance (58.9%). Students studying in two-year degree departments comprised 45.6% of the study population, and the remaining 54.4% of the students were in 4-year degree departments. In terms of parental smoking habits, 36.1% reported a smoker father, while that rate was 10.3% for mothers and 15.0% for siblings. Current smokers represented 27.9% of the group: 46% among males and 15.3% among females. Mean age for beginning smoking was 16.34{+/-}2.72, 15.65{+/-}2.67 for males, 16.34{+/-}2.72 for females (p<0.05). Mean Fagerstromtest score was 4.43{+/-}1.82, and female students had lower test scores than males (p<0.05). After controlling for potential confounders in multivariate analysis, it was seen that five factors were positively associated with current smoking (p<0.05): male gender (OR:3.43; 95%, CI:2.75-4.28), studying in two-year programs (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.18), having at least one close family member who is a smoker (OR:1.63; 95% CI:1.31-2.04), having close friends who are all smokers (OR:1.81; 95% CI: 1.40-2.33), and alcohol consumption (OR:4.39; 95% CI: 3.51-5.49).\\n\\nConclusionOur study showed a higher smoking rate among our study population, both compared to similar nationalstudies and the countrys overall smoking rate. Underlying factors should be evaluated via qualitative studies and preventive strategies should be implemented accordingly.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBecause human epidermal growth factor-like receptor (HER) 2 is expressed on the surface of human pancreatic carcinoma cells to varying degrees, trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), is expected to exert antibody-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the cells. However, some reports found that the effect of trastuzumab against human pancreatic carcinoma cells was limited because most express only limited HER2.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined whether anti-CD137 stimulating mAb could enhance trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1, a human pancreatic cancer cell line with low HER2 expression, in vitro.\\n\\nResultsSupplementation of anti-CD137 mAb could improve trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 which was insufficient without this stimulating antibody. The ADCC differed in individual cells, and this was related to the expression of CD137 on the surface of NK cells after trastuzumab stimulation in association with the Fc{gamma}-RIIIA polymorphism. NK cells with Fc{gamma}-RIIIA-VV/VF showed high levels of ADCC against Panc-1, but those with Fc{gamma}-RIIIA-FF did not show optimal ADCC. In addition, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against the human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 with high HER2 expression was generally high and not affected by the Fc{gamma}-RIIIA polymorphism.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results demonstrated that in Fc{gamma}-RIIIA-VV/VF-carrying hosts, trastuzumab plus CD137 mAb could induce effective ADCC against HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. This also indicates the therapeutic potential for unresectable human pancreatic cancer, in which HER-2 expression is generally low.",

    "abstract": "Representatives of helping professions are particularly exposed to occupational stress. The aim of the study was to evaluate mental and physical well-being, as well as their correlates and predictors in a group of employees working at youth educational centres and sociotherapy centres. A total of 96 employees working at youth educational centres and sociotherapy centres in Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodeship took part in the study. The following psychometric tools were used: the Psychosocial Working Conditions Questionnaire, the Mini-COPE, the LOT-R, and the GSES. The results obtained indicate that people working in helping professions experience mental and physical health problems. Only 3% of the subjects declared they sleep all night. Over 40% and over 35% of the subjects estimate they suffer from low mood and irritation episodes, respectively, rather frequently or continually. Subjects with poorer mental health are more likely to use Helplessness, Avoidance behaviours, or Turning to religion to cope with stress. The strongest predictor of mental well-being is the sense of self-efficacy. Whereas, the strongest predictor of physical well-being is the ability to cope with stress by giving into the feeling of Helplessness. The study demonstrated poor mental and physical well-being of the subjects. A statistically significant correlation was found between sex and the level of mental and physical health. Employees working at youth educational centres and sociotherapy centres with better mental and physical well-being had a stronger sense of self-efficacy and a higher level of life optimism. Hence, the sense of self-efficacy is a predictor for better mental well-being.",

    "abstract": "In language comprehension, a variety of contextual cues act in unison to render upcoming words more or less predictable. As a sentence unfolds, we use prior context (sentential constraints) to predict what the next words might be. Additionally, in a conversation, we can predict upcoming sounds through observing the mouth movements of a speaker (visual constraints). In electrophysiological studies, effects of visual salience have typically been observed early in language processing, while effects of sentential constraints have typically been observed later. We hypothesized that the visual and the sentential constraints might feed into the same predictive process such that effects of sentential constraints might also be detectable early in language processing through modulations of the early effects of visual salience. We presented participants with audiovisual speech while recording their brain activity with magnetoencephalography. Participants saw videos of a person saying sentences where the last word was either sententially constrained or not, and began with a salient or non-salient mouth movement. We found that sentential constraints indeed exerted an early (N1) influence on language processing. Sentential modulations of the N1 visual predictability effect were visible in brain areas associated with semantic processing, and were differently expressed in the two hemispheres. In the left hemisphere, visual and sentential constraints jointly suppressed the auditory evoked field, while the right hemisphere was sensitive to visual constraints only in the absence of strong sentential constraints. These results suggest that sentential and visual constraints can jointly influence even very early stages of audiovisual speech comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Face processing plays a central role in human social life. Humans readily infer social traits (e.g. attractiveness and trustworthiness) from a strangers face. Previous attempts to characterize the facial (physiognomic) features underlying social processing have lacked either systematicity or interpretability. Here, we utilize a statistical framework to tackle this problem, by learning a vector space to represent faces, and a linear mapping from this face space into human social trait judgments. Specifically, we obtain a face space by training the Active Appearance Model on large datasets of face images. Based on human evaluations of numerous social traits on these images, we then use regression to find linear combinations of facial features (what we call Linear Trait Axis, or LTA) that best predict human social judgments. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in overall predictive accuracy - comparable to the best convolutional neural network and better than human prediction of other human ratings. To interpret the LTAs, we regress them against a large repertoire of geometric features. To understand the relationship between the facial features that underlie different social, emotional, and demographic traits, we present a novel \\\"dual space analysis\\\" that characterizes the geometric relationship among LTA vectors. It shows that facial features important for social trait perception are largely distinct from those underlying demographic and emotion perception, contrary to previous suggestions that social trait perception is driven by over-generalization of relatively primitive demographic and emotion perception processes. In addition, we present a novel correlation decomposition analysis that quantifies how correlations in trait judgments (e.g. between attractiveness and babyfacedness) independently arise from (1) shared facial features among traits, and (2) correlation in the distribution of facial features in the human population.",

Genome-wide analyses of endothelial cells revealed abundant microRNA-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal, adhesive and extracellular matrix (CAM) mRNAs. High-throughput assays showed co-transcriptional regulation of microRNA and CAM genes on stiff substrates, which buffers CAM expression. Disruption of global or individual microRNA-dependent suppression of CAM genes induced hyper-adhesive, hyper-contractile phenotypes in multiple systems in vitro, and increased tissue stiffness in the zebrafish fin-fold during homeostasis and regeneration in vivo. Thus, a network of microRNAs and CAM mRNAs mediate tissue mechanical homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "It has been an ongoing scientific debate whether biological parameters are conserved across experimental setups with different media, pH values, and other experimental conditions. Our work explores this question using Bayesian probability as a rigorous framework to assess the biological context of parameters in a model of the cell growth controller in You et al. When this growth controller is uninduced, the E. coli cell population grows to carrying capacity; however, when the circuit is induced, the cell population growth is regulated to remain well below carrying capacity. This growth control controller regulates the E. coli cell population by cell-cell communication using the signaling molecule AHL and by cell death using the bacterial toxin CcdB.\\n\\nTo evaluate the context dependence of parameters such as the cell growth rate, the carrying capacity, the AHL degradation rate, the leakiness of AHL, the leakiness of toxin CcdB, and the IPTG induction factor, we collect experimental data from the growth control circuit in two different media, at two different pH values, and with several induction levels. We define a set of possible context-dependencies that describe how these parameters may differ with the experimental conditions and we develop mathematical models of the growth controller across the different experimental contexts. We then determine whether these parameters are shared across experimental contexts or whether they are context-dependent. For each of these possible context-dependencies, we use Bayesian inference to assess its plausibility and to estimate the growth controllers parameters assuming this context-dependency. Ultimately, we find that there is significant experimental context-dependence in this circuit. Moreover, we also find that the estimated parameter values are sensitive to our assumption of a context relationship.",

Although statistical evidence from individual studies has been mixed, it has been assumed that sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle activity could be used to distinguish between two neural circuits involved in movement triggering. We summarized meta-analytically the available evidence for this hypothesis, comparing the difference in premotor reaction time (RT) of actions where SCM activity was elicited (SCM+ trials) by loud acoustic stimuli against trials in which it was absent (SCM- trials). We found ten studies, all reporting comparisons between SCM+ and SCM- trials. Our mini meta-analysis showed that premotor RTs are faster in SCM+ than in SCM- trials. We also present experimental data showing the effects of foreperiod predictability can induce differences in RT that would be of similar size to those attributed to the activation of different neurophysiological pathways to trigger prepared actions. We discuss plausible physiological mechanisms that would explain differences in premotor RTs between SCM+ and SCM-trials.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration processes are fundamental to our sense of self as embodied beings. Bodily illusions, such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI) and the size-weight illusion (SWI), allow us to investigate how the brain resolves conflicting multisensory evidence during perceptual inference in relation to different facets of body representation. In the RHI, synchronous tactile stimulation of a participants hidden hand and a visible rubber hand creates illusory bodily ownership; in the SWI, the perceived size of the body can modulate the estimated weight of external objects. According to Bayesian models, such illusions arise as an attempt to explain the causes of multisensory perception and may reflect the attenuation of somatosensory precision, which is required to resolve perceptual hypotheses about conflicting multisensory input. Recent hypotheses propose that the precision or salience of sensorimotor representations is determined by modulators of synaptic gain, like dopamine, acetylcholine and oxytocin. However, these neuromodulatory hypotheses have not been tested in the context of embodied multisensory integration. The present, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossed-over study (N = 41 healthy volunteers) aimed to investigate the effect of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on multisensory integration processes, tested by means of the RHI and the SWI. Results showed that IN-OT enhanced the subjective feeling of ownership in the RHI, only when synchronous tactile stimulation was involved. Furthermore, IN-OT increased the embodied version of the SWI (quantified as weight estimation error). These findings suggest that oxytocin might modulate processes of visuo-tactile multisensory integration by increasing the precision of top-down signals against bottom-up sensory input.",

This buckling suggests a spring-like resistance against myocyte shortening, which could store energy and aid myocyte relaxation. Despite this visual suggesting of elastic behavior, the precise mechanical contribution of the cardiac MT network remains to be defined.\\n\\nMethodsHere we experimentally and computationally probe the mechanical contribution of stable microtubules and their influence on myocyte function. We use multiple approaches to interrogate viscoelasticity and cell shortening in primary murine myocytes where either MTs are depolymerized or detyrosination is suppressed, and use the results to inform a mathematical model of myocyte viscoelasticity.\\n\\nResultsMT ablation by colchicine concurrently enhances both the degree of shortening and speed of relaxation, a finding inconsistent with simple spring-like microtubule behavior, and suggestive of a viscoelastic mechanism. Axial stretch and transverse indentation confirm that microtubules increase myocyte viscoelasticity. Specifically, increasing the rate of strain amplifies the MT contribution to myocyte stiffness. Suppressing MT detyrosination with parthenolide or via overexpression of tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) has mechanical consequences that closely resemble colchicine, suggesting that the mechanical impact of MTs relies on a detyrosination-dependent linkage with the myocyte cytoskeleton. Mathematical modeling affirms that alterations in cell shortening conferred by either MT destabilization or tyrosination can be attributed to internal changes in myocyte viscoelasticity.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results suggest that the cardiac MT network regulates contractile amplitudes and kinetics by acting as a cytoskeletal shock-absorber, whereby MTs provide breakable cross-links between the sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric cytoskeleton that resist rapid length changes during both shortening and stretch.",

    "abstract": "The importance of within-species diversity in determining the evolutionary potential of a population to evolve drug resistance or tolerance is not well understood, including in eukaryotic pathogens. To examine the influence of genetic background, we evolved replicates of twenty different clinical isolates of Candida albicans, a human fungal pathogen, in fluconazole, the commonly used antifungal drug. The isolates hailed from the major C. albicans clades and had different initial levels of drug resistance and tolerance to the drug. The majority of replicates rapidly increased in fitness in the evolutionary environment, with the degree of improvement inversely correlated with ancestral strain fitness in the drug. Improvement was largely restricted to up to the evolutionary level of drug: only 4% of the evolved replicates increased resistance (MIC) above the evolutionary level of drug. Prevalent changes were altered levels of drug tolerance (slow growth of a subpopulation of cells at drug concentrations above the MIC) and increased diversity of genome size. The prevalence and predominant direction of these changes differed in a strain-specific manner but neither correlated directly with ancestral fitness or improvement in fitness. Rather, low ancestral strain fitness was correlated with high levels of heterogeneity in fitness, tolerance, and genome size among evolved replicates. Thus, ancestral strain background is an important determinant in mean improvement to the evolutionary environment as well as the diversity of evolved phenotypes, and the range of possible responses of a pathogen to an antimicrobial drug cannot be captured by in-depth study of a single strain background.\n\nImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is an evolutionary phenomenon with clinical implications. We tested how replicates from diverse strains of Candida albicans, a prevalent human fungal pathogen, evolve in the commonly-prescribed antifungal drug fluconazole. Replicates on average increased in fitness in the level of drug they were evolved to, with the least fit ancestral strains improving the most. Very few replicates increased resistance above the drug level they were evolved in. Notably, many replicates increased in genome size and changed in drug tolerance (a drug response where a subpopulation of cells grow slowly in high levels of drug) and variability among replicates in fitness, tolerance and genome size was higher in strains that initially were more sensitive to the drug. Genetic background influenced the average degree of adaptation and the evolved variability of many phenotypes, highlighting that different strains from the same species may respond and adapt very differently during adaptation.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe epidermal cells of leaves lend themselves readily to observation and display many shapes and types: tabular pavement cells, complex trichomes, and stomatal complexes1. Pavement cells from Zea mays (maize) and Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) both have highly undulate anticlinal walls and are held as representative of monocots and eudicots, respectively. In these two model species, we have a nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms that generate undulating pavement cell shape2-9. This model-system dominance has led to two common assumptions: first, that particular plant lineages are characterized by particular pavement cell shapes; and second, that undulatory pavement cell shapes are common enough to be model shapes. To test these assumptions, we quantified pavement cell shape in the leaves of 278 vascular plant taxa and assessed cell shape metrics across large taxonomic groups. We settled on two metrics that described cell shape diversity well in this dataset: aspect ratio (degree of cell elongation) and solidity (a proxy for margin undulation). We found that pavement cells in the monocots tended to have weakly undulating margins, pavement cells in ferns had strongly undulating margins, and pavement cells in the eudicots showed no particular degree of undulation. Indeed, we found that cells with strongly undulating margins, like those of arabidopsis and maize, were in the minority in seed plants. At the organ level, we found a trend towards cells with more undulating margins on the abaxial leaf surface vs. the adaxial surface. We also detected a correlation between cell and leaf aspect ratio: highly elongated leaves tended to have highly elongated cells (low aspect ratio), but not in the eudicots. This indicates that while plant anatomy and plant morphology can be connected, superficially similar leaves can develop through very different underlying growth dynamics (cell expansion and division patterns). This work reveals the striking diversity of pavement cell shapes across vascular plants, and lays the quantitative groundwork for testing hypotheses about pavement cell form and function.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/361717_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (83K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a571a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8cf7dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae3090org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f666ce_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Unstructured peptides, or linear motifs, present a poorly understood molecular language within the context of cellular signaling. These modular regions are often short, unstructured and interact weakly and transiently with folded target proteins. Thus, they are difficult to study with conventional structural biology methods. We present Ligand-Footprinting Mass Spectrometry, or LiF-MS, as a method of mapping the binding sites and dynamic disorder of these peptides on folded protein domains. LiF-MS uses a cleavable crosslinker to mark regions of a protein contacted by a bound linear motif. We demonstrate this method can detect both conformation ensembles and binding orientations of a linear motif in its binding pocket to amino-acid-level detail. Furthermore, marked amino acids can be used as constraints in peptide-protein docking simulations to improve model quality. In conclusion, LiF-MS proves a simple and novel method of elucidating peptide docking structural data not accessible by other methods in the context of a purified system.",

    "abstract": "Cytokinetic abscission facilitates the irreversible separation of daughter cells. This process requires the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery and is tightly regulated by Charged Multivesicular body Protein 4C (CHMP4C), an ESCRT-III subunit that engages the abscission checkpoint (NoCut) in response to mitotic problems such as persisting chromatin bridges within the midbody. Importantly, a human polymorphism in CHMP4CT232 (rs35094336), increases cancer susceptibility. Here, we explain the structural and functional basis for this cancer association: the CHMP4CT232 allele unwinds the C-terminal helix of CHMP4C, impairs binding to the early-acting ESCRT factor ALIX, and disrupts the abscission checkpoint. Cells expressing CHMP4CT232 exhibit increased levels of DNA damage and are sensitized to several conditions that increase chromosome mis-segregation, including DNA replication stress, inhibition of the mitotic checkpoint, and loss of p53. Our data demonstrate the biological importance of the abscission checkpoint, and suggest that dysregulation of abscission by CHMP4CT232 may synergize with oncogene-induced mitotic stress to promote genomic instability and tumorigenesis.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe final step of cell division, abscission, is temporally regulated by the Aurora B kinase and CHMP4C in a conserved pathway called the abscission checkpoint which arrests abscission in the presence of lingering mitotic problems. Despite extensive study, the physiological importance of this pathway to human health has remained elusive. We now demonstrate that a cancer predisposing polymorphism in CHMP4C disrupts the abscission checkpoint and results in DNA damage accumulation. Moreover, deficits in this checkpoint synergize with p53 loss and generate aneuploidy under stress conditions that increase the frequency of chromosome missegregation. Therefore, cells expressing the cancer-associated polymorphism in CHMP4C are genetically unstable, thus suggesting a novel oncogenic mechanism that may involve the dysregulation of abscission.",

    "abstract": "The infection of cells by multiple copies of a given virus can impact virus evolution in a variety of ways, for example through recombination and reassortment, or through intra-cellular interactions among the viruses in a cell, such as complementation or interference. Surprisingly, multiple infection of cells can also influence some of the most basic evolutionary processes, which has not been studied so far. Here, we use computational models to explore how infection multiplicity affects the fixation probability of mutants, the rate of mutant generation, and the timing of mutant invasion. This is investigated for neutral, disadvantageous, and advantageous mutants. Among the results, we note surprising growth dynamics for neutral and disadvantageous mutants: Starting from a single mutant-infected cell, an initial growth phase is observed which is more characteristic of an advantageous mutant and is not observed in the absence of multiple infection. Therefore, in the short term, multiple infection increases the chances that neutral or dis-advantageous mutants are present. Following this initial growth phase, however, the mutant dynamics enter a second phase that is driven by neutral drift or negative selection, respectively, which determines the long-term fixation probability of the mutant. Contrary to the short-term dynamics, the probability of mutant fixation, and thus existence, is lower in the presence compared to the absence of multiple infection, and declines with infection multiplicity. Hence, while infection multiplicity promotes mutant existence in the short term, it makes it less likely in the longer term. Understanding of these dynamics is essential for the investigation of more complex viral evolutionary processes, for which the dynamics described here for the basis. We demonstrate relevance to the interpretation of experiments in the context of published data on phage {varphi}6 evolution at low and high multiplicities.",
