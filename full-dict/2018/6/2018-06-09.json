    "abstract": "The Drosophila genus is a unique group containing a wide range of species that occupy diverse ecosystems. In addition to the most widely studied species, Drosophila melanogaster, many other members in this genus also possess a well-developed set of genetic tools. Indeed, high-quality genomes exist for several species within the genus, facilitating studies of the function and evolution of cis-regulatory regions and proteins by allowing comparisons across at least 50 million years of evolution. Yet, the available genomes still fail to capture much of the substantial genetic diversity within the Drosophila genus. We have therefore tested protocols to rapidly and inexpensively sequence and assemble the genome from any Drosophila species using single-molecule sequencing technology from Oxford Nanopore. Here, we use this technology to present high-quality genome assemblies of 15 Drosophila species: 10 of the 12 originally sequenced Drosophila species (ananassae, erecta, mojavensis, persimilis, pseudoobscura, sechellia, simulans, virilis, willistoni, and yakuba), four additional species that had previously reported assemblies (biarmipes, bipectinata, eugracilis, and mauritiana), and one novel assembly (triauraria). Genomes were generated from an average of 29x depth-of-coverage data that after assembly resulted in an average contig N50 of 4.4 Mb. Subsequent alignment of contigs from the published reference genomes demonstrates that our assemblies could be used to close over 60% of the gaps present in the currently published reference genomes. Importantly, the materials and reagents cost for each genome was approximately $1,000 (USD). This study demonstrates the power and cost-effectiveness of long-read sequencing for genome assembly in Drosophila and provides a framework for the affordable sequencing and assembly of additional Drosophila genomes.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and comprehensive characterization of genetic variation is essential for deciphering the genetic basis of diseases and other phenotypes. A vast amount of genetic variation stems from large-scale sequence changes arising from the duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation of sequences. In the past 10 years, high-throughput short reads have greatly expanded our ability to assay sequence variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, a recent de novo assembly of a second Drosophila melanogaster reference genome has revealed that short read genotyping methods miss hundreds of structural variants, including those affecting phenotypes. While genomes assembled using high-coverage long reads can achieve high levels of contiguity and completeness, concerns about cost, errors, and low yield have limited widespread adoption of such sequencing approaches. Here we resequenced the reference strain of D. melanogaster (ISO1) on a single Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell run for 24 hours. Using only reads longer than 1 kb or with at least 30x coverage, we assembled a highly contiguous de novo genome. The addition of inexpensive paired reads and subsequent scaffolding using an optical map technology achieved an assembly with completeness and contiguity comparable to the D. melanogaster reference assembly. Comparison of our assembly to the reference assembly of ISO1 uncovered a number of structural variants (SVs), including novel LTR transposable element insertions and duplications affecting genes with developmental, behavioral, and metabolic functions. Collectively, these SVs provide a snapshot of the dynamics of genome evolution. Furthermore, our assembly and comparison to the D. melanogaster reference genome demonstrates that high-quality de novo assembly of reference genomes and comprehensive variant discovery using such assemblies are now possible by a single lab for under $1,000 (USD).",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, a zoonotic kinetoplastid protozoan with a complex genome, is the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). The parasite uses a highly diverse repertoire of surface molecules, with roles in cell invasion, immune evasion and pathogenesis. Thus far, the genomic regions containing these genes have been impossible to resolve and it has been impossible to study the structure and function of the several thousand repetitive genes encoding the surface molecules of the parasite. We here present an improved genome assembly of a T. cruzi clade I (TcI) strain using high coverage PacBio single molecule sequencing, together with Illumina sequencing of 34 T. cruzi TcI isolates and clones from different geographic locations, sample sources and clinical outcomes. Resolution of the surface molecule gene structure reveals an unusual duality in the organisation of the parasite genome, a core genomic region syntenous with related protozoa flanked by unique and highly plastic subtelomeric regions encoding surface antigens. The presence of abundant interspersed retrotransposons in the subtelomeres suggests that these elements are involved in a recombination mechanism for the generation of antigenic variation and evasion of the host immune response. The comparative genomic analysis of the cohort of TcI strains revealed multiple cases of such recombination events involving surface molecule genes and has provided new insights into T. cruzi population structure.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged auditory sensory deprivation leads to brain reorganization, indicated by functional enhancement in remaining sensory systems, a phenomenon known as cross-modal plasticity. In this study we investigated differences in functional brain network shifts from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions between deaf and hearing people. Electroencephalography activity was recorded in deaf (N = 71) and hearing people (N = 122) living in rural Africa, which yielded a unique data-set of congenital, pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf people, with a divergent experience in American Sign Language. Functional networks were determined from the synchronization of electroencephalography signals between fourteen electrodes distributed over the scalp. We studied the synchronization between the auditory and visual cortex and performed whole-brain minimum spanning tree analysis based on the phase lag index of functional connectivity. This tree analysis accounts for variations in global network density and allows unbiased characterization of functional network backbones. We found increased functional connectivity between the auditory and visual cortex in deaf people during the eyes-closed condition in both the alpha and beta bands. Furthermore, we found functional network backbone shifts both in deaf and healthy people as they went from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions. In both the alpha and beta band the deafs brain showed larger functional backbone-shifts in node strength compared to controls. In the alpha band this shift in network strength differed among deaf participants and depended on type of deafness: congenital, pre-lingual or post-lingual deafness. In addition, a correlation was found between functional backbone characteristics and experience of sign language. Our study revealed more insights in functional network reorganization specifically due to prolonged lack of auditory input, but might also be helpful for sensory deprivation and cross-modal plasticity in general. Global cortical network reorganization in deaf people supports the plastic capacities of the young brain. The differences between type of deafness stresses that etiology affects functional reorganization, whereas the association between network organization and acquired sign language experience reflects ongoing brain adaptation in people with hearing disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Bats are among the most diverse animals on the planet and harbor numerous bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic symbionts. The interplay between bacterial community composition and parasitism in bats is not well understood and may have important implications for studies of similar systems. Here we present a comprehensive survey of dipteran and haemosporidian parasites, and characterize the gut, oral, and skin microbiota of Afrotropical bats. We identify significant correlations between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages, as well as links between the oral microbiome and malarial parasitism, suggesting a potential mechanism for host selection and vector-borne disease transmission in bats. In contrast to recent studies of host-microbe phylosymbiosis in mammals, we find no correlation between chiropteran phylogenetic distances and bacterial community dissimilarity across the three anatomical sites, suggesting that host environment is more important than shared ancestry in shaping the composition of bat-associated bacterial communities.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEAnimals rely on bacterial symbionts for numerous biological functions, such as digestion and immune system development. Increasing evidence suggests that host-associated microbes may play a role in mediating parasite burden. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive survey of bacterial symbionts from multiple anatomical sites across a broad taxonomic range of Afrotropical bats, demonstrating significant associations between the bat microbiome and parasite prevalence. This study provides a framework for future approaches to systems biology of host-symbiont interactions across broad taxonomic scales, emphasizing the interdependence between microbial symbionts and vertebrate health in the study of wild organisms and their natural history.",

    "abstract": "We describe a multi-step CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method to create endogenously tagged GFP-fusions of transcriptionally silent genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), allowing visualization of proteins that are only expressed upon differentiation. To do this, we designed a donor template containing the monomeric EGFP (mEGFP) fusion tag and an mCherry selection cassette delivered in tandem to a target locus via homology directed repair (HDR). mCherry expression was driven by a constitutive promoter and served as a drug-free, excisable selection marker. Following selection, the mCherry cassette was excised with Cas9, creating an mEGFP-fusion with the target gene. We achieved scarless excision by using repetitive sequences to guide microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and introduce linker sequences between the mEGFP tag and the target gene. Using this strategy, we successfully tagged genes encoding the cardiomyocyte sarcomeric proteins troponin I (TNNI1), alpha-actinin (ACTN2), titin (TTN), myosin light chain 2a (MYL7), and myosin light chain 2v (MYL2) with mEGFP in undifferentiated hiPSCs.

Yet the disease is far more prevalent within rodent reservoirs than in humans. One of the main means of outbreak prevention is extensive wildlife surveillance, where accurate and rapid detection is essential to prevent spillover into the human population from which, it may otherwise spread more rapidly and over larger distances. Moreover, detection and quantification of the agent aids in investigative studies to understand aspects of the pathogen such as transmission mechanics, pathology, contamination risk and more. Partially based on a previously developed assay by Gabitzsch et al. 2008 we designed a TaqMan(R) mismatch amplification mutation assay (TaqMAMA) where a primer leverages a species-specific SNP in the chromosomal single copy ferric uptake regulator gene of Yersinia pestis. The assay allows for specific, rapid detection and quantification of Yersinia pestis using only a single species-specific marker in a highly conserved virulence gene. This low-cost and simple modification of an existing assay eliminates the need for running multiple molecular markers for pathogen detection or performing time-consuming culturing and counting of colonies for quantification.",

Here we performed a retrospective EHR study and derived a cohort of 3,652 individuals with self-reported sleep behaviors, documented from visits to the sleep clinic. These individuals were obese (mean body mass index 33.6 kg/m2) and had a high prevalence of sleep apnea (60.5%), however we found sleep behaviors largely concordant with prior prospective cohort studies. In our cohort, average wake time was one hour later and average sleep duration was 40 minutes longer on weekends than on weekdays (p<1{middle dot}10-12). Sleep duration also varied considerably as a function of age, and tended to be longer in females and in whites. Additionally, through phenome-wide association analyses, we found an association of long weekend sleep with depression, and an unexpectedly large number of associations of long weekday sleep with mental health and neurological disorders (q<0.05). We then sought to replicate previously published genetic associations with morning/evening preference on a subset of our cohort with extant genotyping data (n=555). While those findings did not replicate in our cohort, a polymorphism (rs3754214) in high linkage disequilibrium with a previously published polymorphism near TARS2 was associated with long sleep duration (p<0.01).

    "abstract": "The ability to learn novel motor skills is both a central part of our daily lives and can provide a model for rehabilitation after a stroke. However, there are still fundamental gaps in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underpin human motor plasticity. The acquisition of new motor skills is dependent on changes in local circuitry within the primary motor cortex (M1). This reorganisation has been hypothesised to be facilitated by a decrease in local inhibition via modulation of the neurotransmitter GABA, but this link has not been conclusively demonstrated in humans. Here, we used 7T MR Spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of GABA concentrations in human M1 during the learning of an explicit, serial reaction time task. We observed a significant reduction in GABA concentration during motor learning that was not seen in an equivalent motor task lacking a learnable sequence, nor during a passive resting task of the same duration. No change in glutamate was observed in any group. Furthermore, baseline M1 GABA was strongly predictive of the degree of subsequent learning, such that greater inhibition was associated with poorer subsequent learning. This result suggests that higher levels of cortical inhibition may present a barrier that must be surmounted in order achieve an increase in M1 excitability, and hence encoding of a new motor skill. These results provide strong support for the mechanistic role of GABAergic inhibition in motor plasticity, raising questions regarding the link between population variability in motor learning and GABA metabolism in the brain.\\n\\nFunding informationJ.K.:Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship (204696/Z/16/Z).

    "abstract": "The success of humans in novel environments is partially supported by our ability to implement new task procedures via instructions. This complex skill has been associated with the activity of control-related brain areas. Current models link fronto-parietal and a cingulo-opercular networks with transient and sustained modes of cognitive control, based on observations during repetitive task settings or rest (Dosenbach et al. 2008). The current study extends this dual model to novel instructed tasks. We employed a mixed design and an instruction-following task to extract phasic and tonic brain signals associated with the encoding and implementation of novel verbal rules. We also performed a representation similarity analysis to capture consistency in task-set encoding within trial epochs. Our findings show that both networks are involved while following novel instructions: transiently, during the implementation of the instruction, and in a sustained fashion, across novel trials blocks. Moreover, the multivariate results showed that task representations in the cingulo-opercular network were more stable than in the fronto-parietal one. Our data extend the dual model of cognitive control to novel demanding situations, highlighting the high flexibility of control-related regions in adopting different temporal profiles.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo test the hypothesis that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) influences performance in a 20-min time-trial self-paced exercise and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory brain activity in a group of trained male cyclists.\\n\\nDesignThe study consisted of a pre-registered (https://osf.io/rf95j/), randomised, sham-controlled, single-blind, within-subject design experiment.\\n\\nMethods36 trained male cyclists, age 27 (6.8) years, weight 70.1 (9.5) Kg; VO2max: 54 (6.13) ml.min-1.kg-1, Maximal Power output: 4.77 (0.6) W/kg completed a 20-min time-trial self-paced exercise in three separate sessions, corresponding to three stimulation conditions: anodal, cathodal and sham. tDCS was administered before each test during 20-min at a current intensity of 2.0 mA. The anode electrode was placed over the DLPFC and the cathode in the contralateral shoulder. In each session, power output, heart rate, sRPE and EEG (at baseline and during exercise) was measured.\\n\\nResultsThere were no differences (F = 0.31, p > 0.05) in power output between the stimulation conditions: anodal (235 W [95%CI 222 - 249 W]; cathodal (235 W [95%CI 222 - 248 W] and sham (234 W [95%CI 220 - 248 W]. Neither heart rate, sRPE nor EEG activity were affected by tDCS (all Ps > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusiontDCS over the left DLFC did not affect self-paced exercise performance in trained cyclists. Moreover, tDCS did not elicit any change on oscillatory brain activity either at baseline or during exercise. Our data suggest that the effects of tDCS on endurance performance should be taken with caution.",

    "abstract": "By engulfing potentially harmful microbes, professional phagocytes are continually at risk from intracellular pathogens. To avoid becoming infected, the host must kill pathogens in the phagosome before they can escape or establish a survival niche. Here, we analyse the role of the phosphoinositide (PI) 5-kinase PIKfyve in phagosome maturation and killing, using the amoeba and model phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum.\\n\\nPIKfyve plays important but poorly understood roles in vesicular trafficking by catalysing formation of the lipids phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)2) and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI(5)P). Here we show that its activity is essential during early phagosome maturation in Dictyostelium. Disruption of PIKfyve inhibited delivery of both the vacuolar V-ATPase and proteases, dramatically reducing the ability of cells to acidify newly formed phagosomes and digest their contents. Consequently, PIKfyve- cells were unable to generate an effective antimicrobial environment and efficiently kill captured bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate that cells lacking PIKfyve are more susceptible to infection by the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. We conclude that PIKfyve-catalysed phosphoinositide production plays a crucial and general role in ensuring early phagosomal maturation, protecting host cells from diverse pathogenic microbes.\\n\\nImportanceCells that capture or eat bacteria must swiftly kill them to prevent pathogens from surviving long enough to escape the bactericidal pathway and establish an infection. This is achieved by the rapid delivery of components that produce an antimicrobial environment in the phagosome, the compartment containing the captured microbe. This is essential both for the function of immune cells and for amoebae that feed on bacteria in their environment. Here we identify a central component of the pathway used by cells to deliver antimicrobial components to the phagosome and show that bacteria survive over three times as long within the host if this pathway is disabled. We show that this is of general importance for killing a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, and that it is physiologically important if cells are to avoid infection by the opportunistic human pathogen Legionella.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveDysbindin is downregulated in several schizophrenia brain regions and modulates copper transport required for myelination and monoamine metabolism. We sought to determine dysbindin and copper transporter protein expression in schizophrenia subjects.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied the substantia nigra (which exhibits one of the highest copper contents of the human brain) using Western blot analysis. We characterized specific protein domains of copper transporters ATP7A, CTR1, ATP7B, and dysbindin isoforms 1A and 1B/C in postmortem substantia nigra in schizophrenia subjects (n=15) and matched controls (n=11). As a preliminary investigation, we examined medication status in medicated (n=11) versus unmedicated schizophrenia subjects (n=4).\\n\\nResultsThe combined schizophrenia group exhibited increased levels of C-terminus, but not N-terminus, ATP7A. Schizophrenia subjects expressed less transmembrane CTR1 and dysbindin 1B/C than controls. When subdivided, the increased C-terminus ATP7A protein was present only in medicated subjects versus controls. Unmedicated subjects exhibited less N-terminus ATP7A protein than controls and medicated subjects, suggesting medication-induced rescue of the ATP7A N-terminus. Transmembrane CTR1 was decreased to a similar extent in both treatment groups versus controls, suggesting no medication effect.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results provide the first evidence of disrupted copper transport into and within schizophrenia nigral cells that may be modulated by specific dysbindin isoforms and antipsychotic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Amongst multiple distinct isoforms, Nrf1D is synthesized from translation of an alternatively-spliced transcript of Nrf1 mRNA, with a naturally-occurring deletion of its stop codon-flanking 1466 nucleotides. This molecular event leads to the reading frameshift mutation, which results in a constitutive substitution of the intact Nrf1s C-terminal 72 amino acids (aa, covering the second half of the leucine zipper motif to C-terminal Neh3L domain) by an additional extended 80-aa stretch to generate a unique variant Nrf1D. The C-terminal extra 80-aa region of Nrf1D was identified to fold into a redox-sensitive transmembrane domain that enables it to be tightly integrated within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Notably, the salient feature of Nrf1D confers it to be distinguishable from prototypic Nrf1, such that Nrf1D is endowed with only a less ability than wild-type Nrf1 at mediating target gene expression. Further evidence has been presented revealing that both mRNA and protein levels of Nrf1D were detected to varying extents in somatic tissues. Surprisingly, we also found the existence of Nrf1D-derived isoforms in the blood plasma, implying that it is a candidate secretory transcription factor, although its precursor acts as an integral transmembrane-bound CNC-bZIP protein that entails dynamic topologies, before being unleashed from the ER to enter the blood plasma.",

    "abstract": "The dermcidin-derived peptide DCD-1L has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity over a wide pH range and in high salt concentrations. Thus, it offers a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. Furthermore, it plays a role in wound healing, atopic dermatitis and acne vulgaris, indicating applications in cosmetic industries. Recently, dermcidin has been identified as a tumor marker improving cancer prognosis. Hence, large quantities of purified DCD-1L peptide are required to meet the needs of basic research and clinical trials. In the current study, we demonstrate SUMO-based heterologous DCD-1L production in Escherichia coli, followed by affinity chromatography purification. The SUMO tag is cleaved with SUMO-specific protease following purification, leaving free DCD-1L peptide without any additional amino acids. The mass of the peptide was further confirmed by MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis. Furthermore, the cleaved DCD-1L showed antimicrobial activity against the E. coli DH5 alpha test strain. The production and purification of DCD-1L using SUMO tag compare advantageously to other protocols previously described. Thus, the SUMO tag system enables large scale recombinant production of the antimicrobial peptide DCD-1L, which constitutes pharmaceutical and therapeutic potential as an alternative antibiotic.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the FMR1 gene. FXS is a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and inherited intellectual disability (ID). In most cases, the mutation is an expansion of a microsatellite (CGG triplet), which leads to suppressed expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in multiple aspects of mRNA metabolism. Interestingly, we found that the previously published Fmr1 knockout rat model of FXS expresses a transcript with an in-frame deletion of a K-homology (KH) domain, KH1. KH domains are RNA-binding domains of FMR1 and several of the few, known point mutations associated with FXS are found within them. We observed that this deletion leads to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dependent attention deficits, similar to those observed in FXS, and to alterations in transcriptional profiles within the mPFC, which mapped to two weighted gene coexpression network analysis modules. We demonstrated that these modules are conserved in human frontal cortex, are enriched for known FMRP targets and for genes involved in neuronal and synaptic processes, and that one is enriched for genes that are implicated in ASD, ID, and schizophrenia. Hub genes in these conserved modules represent potential targets for FXS. These findings provide support for a prefrontal deficit in FXS, indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating the pathophysiology of FXS and a potential readout for pharmacotherapy testing, and identify dysregulated gene expression modules in a relevant brain region.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe significance of the current study lies in two key domains. First, this study demonstrates that deletion of the Fmrp-KH1 domain is sufficient to cause major mPFC-dependent attention deficits in both males and females, like those observed in both individuals with FXS and in knockout mouse models for FXS. Second, the study shows that deletion of the KH1 domain leads to alterations in the transcriptional profiles within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which are of potential translational value for subjects with FXS. These findings indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating the pathophysiology of FXS and a potential readout for pharmacotherapy testing and also highlight hub genes for follow up.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic hormone adiponectin is secreted into the circulation by adipocytes, and mediates key biological functions including insulin sensitivity, adipocyte development, and fatty acid oxidation. Adiponectin is also abundant in saliva, where its functions are poorly understood. Here we report that murine taste receptor cells express adiponectin receptors, and may be a target for salivary adiponectin. Analysis of a transcriptome dataset obtained by RNA-seq analysis of purified circumvallate taste buds, revealed high expression levels for three adiponectin receptor types. Immunohistochemical studies showed that two of these receptors, AdipoR1 and T-cadherin, are localized to subsets of taste receptor cells. Immunofluorescence for T-cadherin was primarily co-localized with the Type 2 taste receptor cell marker phospholipase {beta}2, suggesting that adiponectin signaling could impact sweet, bitter, or umami taste signaling. However, adiponectin null mice showed no differences in taste responsiveness compared to wildtype controls in brief-access taste testing. AAV-mediated overexpression of adiponectin in the salivary glands of adiponectin null mice did result in a small but significant increase in behavioral taste responsiveness to the fat emulsion Intralipid. Together, these results suggest that salivary adiponectin can effect taste receptor cell function, though its impact on taste responsiveness and peripheral taste coding remains unclear.",

Herein, we develop and use microfluidic chips containing post arrays to induce microfluidic vortex shedding, or VS, for cell membrane poration that permits delivery of mRNA into primary human T lymphocytes. We demonstrate transfection with VS by delivery of a 996-nucleotide mRNA construct encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and assessed transfection efficiencies by quantifying levels of EGFP protein expression. We achieved high transfection efficiency (63.6 {+/-} 3.44% EGFP+ viable cells) with high cell viability (77.3 {+/-} 0.58%) and recovery (88.7 {+/-} 3.21%) in CD3+ T cells 19 hrs after VS processing. Importantly, we show that processing cells via VS does not negatively affect cell growth rates or alter cell states. We also demonstrate processing speeds of greater than 2.0 x 106 cells s-1 at volumes ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 milliliters. Altogether, these results highlight the use of VS as a rapid and gentle delivery method with promising potential to engineer primary human cells for research and clinical applications.",

However, unlike traditional model organisms, such as yeast, flies and worms, choanoflagellates have been refractory to DNA delivery methods for expressing foreign genes. Here we report the establishment of a robust method for expressing transgenes in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, overcoming barriers that have previously hampered DNA delivery and expression. To demonstrate how this method accelerates the study of S. rosetta cell biology, we engineered a panel of fluorescent protein markers that illuminate key features of choanoflagellate cells. We then investigated the localization of choanoflagellate septins, a family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that are hypothesized to regulate the multicellular rosette development in S. rosetta. Fluorescently tagged septins localized to the basal pole of S. rosetta single cells and rosettes in a pattern resembling septin localization in animal epithelia. The establishment of transfection in S. rosetta and its application to the study of septins represent critical advances in the growth of S. rosetta as an experimental model for investigating choanoflagellate cell biology, core mechanisms underlying animal cell biology, and the origin of animals.",

Haematopoietically-expressed-homeobox (Hhex) protein plays an essential role in the establishment of HPD, however, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that zebrafish hhex-null mutants fail to develop the HPD system characterized by lacking the biliary marker Annexin A4 and the HPD marker sox9b. The mutant HPD system is replaced by an intrahepatic intestinal tube characterized by expressing the intestinal marker fatty-acid-binding-protein 2a (fabp2a). Cell lineage analysis showed that this intrahepatic intestinal tube is not originated from hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. Further analysis revealed that cdx1b and pdx1 were expressed ectopically in the intrahepatic intestinal tube and knockdown of cdx1b and pdx1 restored the expression of sox9b in the mutant. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that Hhex binds to the promoters of pdx1 and cdx1b genes to repress their expression. We therefore propose that Hhex, Cdx1b and Pdx1 form a genetic network governing the patterning and morphogenesis of the HPD and digestive tract systems in zebrafish.",
