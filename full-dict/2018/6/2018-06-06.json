    "abstract": "In the study of DNA methylation, genetic variation between species, strains, or individuals can result in CpG sites that are exclusive to a subset of samples, and insertions and deletions can rearrange the spatial distribution of CpGs. How to account for this variation in an analysis of the interplay between sequence variation and DNA methylation is not well understood, especially when the number of CpG differences between samples is large. Here we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencint data on two highly divergent inbred mouse strains to study this problem. We find that while the large number of strain-specific CpGs necessitates considerations regarding the reference genomes used during alignment, properties such as CpG density are surprisingly conserved across the genome. We introduce a method for including strain-specific CpGs in differential analysis, and show that accounting for strain-specific CpGs increases the power to find differentially methylated regions between the strains. Our method uses smoothing to impute methylation levels at strain-specific sites, thereby allowing strain-specific CpGs to contribute to the analysis, and also allowing us to account for differences in the spatial occurrences of CpGs. Our results have implications for analysis of genetic variation and DNA methylation using bisulfite-converted DNA.",

    "abstract": "We present a new phylogenetic approach SelAC (Selection on Amino acids and Codons), whose substitution rates are based on a nested model linking protein expression to population genetics. Unlike simpler codon models which assume a single substitution matrix for all sites, our model more realistically represents the evolution of protein coding DNA under the assumption of consistent, stabilizing selection using cost-benefit approach. This cost-benefit approach allows us generate a set of 20 optimal amino acid specific matrix families using just a handful of parameters and naturally links the strength of stabilizing selection to protein synthesis levels, which we can estimate. Using a yeast dataset of 100 orthologs for 6 taxa, we find SelAC fits the data much better than popular models by 104-105 AICc units. Our results indicate there is great potential for more accurate inference of phylogenetic trees and branch lengths from already existing data through the use of nested, mechanistic models. Additional parameters estimated by SelAC indicate that a large amount of non-phylogenetic, but biologically meaningful, information can be inferred from exisiting data. For example, SelAC prediction of gene specific protein synthesis rates correlates well with both empirical (r=0.33-0.48) and other theoretical predictions (r=0.45-0.64) for multiple yeast species. SelAC also provides estimates of the optimal amino acid at each site. Finally, because SelAC is a nested approach based on clearly stated biological assumptions, future modifications, such as including shifts in the optimal amino acid sequence within or across lineages, are possible.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are dynamic membrane protrusions driven by polymerization of an actin filament core, mediated by formin molecules at the filopodia tips. Filopodia can adhere to the extracellular matrix and experience both external and cell generated pulling forces. The role of such forces in filopodia adhesion is however insufficiently understood. Here, we induced sustained growth of filopodia by applying pulling force to their tips via attached fibronectin-coated beads trapped by optical tweezers. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of myosin IIA, which localized to the base of filopodia, resulted in weakening of filopodia adherence strength. Inhibition of formins, which caused detachment of actin filaments from formin molecules, produced similar effect. Thus, myosin IIA-generated centripetal force transmitted to the filopodia tips through interactions between formins and actin filaments are required for filopodia adhesion. Force-dependent adhesion led to preferential attachment of filopodia to rigid versus fluid substrates, which may underlie cell orientation and polarization.",

    "abstract": "Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a major constraint on cassava yields in East and Central Africa and threatens production in West Africa. CBSD is caused by two species of positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Potyviridae, genus Ipomovirus: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Diseases caused by the family Potyviridae require the interaction of viral genome-linked protein (VPg) and host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) isoforms. Cassava encodes five eIF4E proteins: eIF4E, eIF(iso)4E-1, eIF(iso)4E-2, novel cap-binding protein-1 (nCBP-1), and nCBP-2. Protein-protein interaction experiments consistently found that VPg proteins associate with cassava nCBPs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was employed to generate ncbp-1, ncbp-2, and ncbp-1/ncbp-2 mutants in cassava cultivar 60444. Challenge with CBSV showed that ncbp-1/ncbp-2 mutants displayed delayed and attenuated CBSD aerial symptoms, as well as reduced severity and incidence of storage root necrosis. Suppressed disease symptoms were correlated with reduced virus titer in storage roots relative to wild-type controls. Our results demonstrate the ability to modify multiple genes simultaneously in cassava to achieve tolerance to CBSD. Future studies will investigate the contribution of remaining eIF4E isoforms on CBSD and translate this knowledge into an optimized strategy for protecting cassava from disease.",

    "abstract": "The multilingual brain must implement mechanisms that serve to select the appropriate language as a function of the communicative environment. Engaging these mechanisms on a regular basis appears to have consequences for brain structure and function. Studies have implicated the caudate nuclei as important nodes in polyglot language control processes, and have also shown structural differences in the caudate nuclei in bilingual compared to monolingual populations. However, the majority of published work has focused on the categorical differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals, and little is known about whether these findings extend to multilingual individuals, who have even greater language control demands. In the present paper, we present an analysis of the volume and morphology of the caudate nuclei in 75 multilingual individuals who speak three or more languages. Volumetric analyses revealed a significant relationship between multilingual experience and right caudate volume, as well as a marginally-significant relationship with left caudate volume. Vertexwise analyses revealed a significant enlargement of dorsal and anterior portions of the left caudate nucleus having connectivity to executive brain regions, as a function of multilingual expertise. These results suggest that multilingual expertise might exercise a continuous impact on the brain, and that as additional languages beyond a second are acquired, the additional demands for control result in modifications to brain structures associated with language management processes.",

    "abstract": "The second messenger, cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) regulates biofilm formation for many bacteria. The binding of c-d{inverted exclamation}-GMP by the inner-membrane protein LapD controls biofilm formation, and the LapD receptor is central to a complex network of c-di-GMP-mediated biofilm formation. In this study, we examine how c-di-GMP signaling specificity by a diguanylate cyclase (DGC), GcbC, is achieved via interactions with the LapD receptor and by small ligand sensing via GcbCs calcium channel chemotaxis (CACHE) domain. We provide evidence that biofilm formation is stimulated by the environmentally relevant organic acid citrate (and a related compound, isocitrate) in a GcbC-dependent manner through enhanced GcbC-LapD interaction, which results in increased LapA localization to the cell surface. Furthermore, GcbC shows little ability to synthesize c-di-GMP in isolation. However, when LapD is present GcbC activity is significantly enhanced ~8-fold, indicating that engaging the LapD receptor stimulates the activity of this DGC; citrate-enhanced GcbC-LapD interaction further stimulates c-di-GMP synthesis. We propose that the l-site of GcbC serves two roles beyond allosteric control of this enzyme: promoting GcbC-LapD interaction and stabilizing the active conformation of GcbC in the GcbC-LapD complex. Finally, given that LapD can interact with a dozen different DGCs of P. fluorescens, many of which have ligand-binding domains, the ligand-mediated enhanced signaling via LapD-GcbC interaction described here is likely a conserved mechanism of signaling in this network. Consistent with this idea, we identify a second example of ligand-mediated enhancement of DGC-LapD interaction that promotes biofilm formation.\\n\\nImportanceIn many bacteria, dozens of enzymes produce the dinucleotide signal c-di-GMP, however it is unclear how undesired crosstalk is mitigated in the context of this soluble signal, and how c-di-GMP signaling is regulated by environmental inputs. We demonstrate that GcbC, a DGC, shows little ability to synthesize c-d{inverted exclamation}-GMP in the absence of its cognate receptor LapD; GcbC-LapD interaction enhances c-di-GMP synthesis by GcbC, likely mediated by the l-site of GcbC. We further show evidence for a ligand-mediated mechanism of signaling specificity via increased physical interaction of a DGC with its cognate receptor. We envision a scenario wherein a \\\"cloud\\\" of weakly active DGCs can increase their activity by specific interaction with their receptor in response to appropriate environmental signals, concomitantly boosting c-di-GMP production, ligand-specific signaling and biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Antisense (as)lncRNAs can regulate gene expression but the underlying mechanisms and the different cofactors involved remain unclear. Using Native Elongating Transcript sequencing, here we show that stabilization of antisense Exo2-sensitivite IncRNAs (XUTs) results in the attenuation, at the nascent transcription level, of a subset of highly expressed genes displaying prominent promoter-proximal nucleosome depletion and histone acetylation. Mechanistic investigations on the catalase gene ctt1 revealed that its induction following oxidative stress is impaired in Exo2-deficient cells, correlating with the accumulation of an asXUT. Interestingly, expression of this asXUT was also activated in wild-type cells upon oxidative stress, concomitant to ctt1 induction, indicating a potential attenuation feedback. This attenuation correlates with asXUT abundance, it is transcriptional, characterized by low RNAPII-ser5 phosphorylation, and it requires an histone deacetylase activity and the conserved Set2 histone methyltransferase. Finally, we identified Dicer as another RNA processing factor acting on ctt1 induction, but independently of Exo2. We propose that asXUTs could modulate the expression of their paired-sense genes when it exceeds a critical threshold, using a conserved mechanism independent of RNAi.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYExamples of regulatory antisense (as)lncRNAs acting on gene expression have been reported in multiple model organisms. However, despite their regulatory importance, aslncRNAs have been poorly studied, and the molecular bases for aslncRNAs-mediated regulation remain incomplete. One reason for the lack of global information on aslncRNAs appears to be their low cellular abundance. Indeed, our previous studies in budding and fission yeasts revealed that aslncRNAs are actively degraded by the Xrn1/Exo2-dependent cytoplasmic 5'-3' RNA decay pathway. Using a combination of single-gene and genome-wide analyses in fission yeast, here we report that the stabilization of a set of Exo2-sensitive aslncRNAs correlates with attenuation of paired-sense genes transcription. Our work provides fundamental insights into the mechanism by which aslncRNAs could regulate gene expression. It also highlights for the first time that the level of sense gene transcription and the presence of specific chromatin features could define the potential of aslncRNA-mediated attenuation, raising the idea that aslncRNAs only attenuate those genes with expression levels above a \\\"regulatory threshold\\\". This opens novel perspectives regarding what the potential determinants of aslncRNA-dependent regulation, as previous models in budding yeast rather proposed that aslncRNA-mediated repression is restricted to lowly expressed genes.",

Using large databases of natural images we trained a deep convolutional generative adversarial network capable of generating gray scale photos, similar to stimUli presented during two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. Using a linear model we learned to predict the generative models latent space from measured brain activity. The objective was to create an image similar to the presented stimulus image through the previously trained generator. Using this approach we were able to reconstruct structural and some semantic features of a proportion of the natural images sets. A behavioral test showed that subjects were capable of identifying a reconstruction of the original stimuhis in 67.2% and 66.4% of the cases in a pairwise comparison for the two natural image datasets respectively. our approach does not require end-to-end training of a large generative model on limited neuroimaging data.

    "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, the germband forms directly on the egg surface and solely consists of embryonic tissue. In contrast, most insect embryos undergo a complicated set of tissue rearrangements to generate a condensed, multi-layered germband. The ventral side of the germband is embryonic, while the dorsal side is thought to be an extraembryonic tissue called the amnion. While this tissue organisation has been accepted for decades, and has been widely reported in insects, its accuracy has not been directly tested in any species. Using live cell tracking and differential cell labelling in the short germ beetle Tribolium castaneum, I show that most of the cells previously thought to be amnion actually give rise to large parts of the embryo. This process occurs via the dorsal-to-ventral flow of cells and contributes to germband extension. In addition, I show that true  amnion cells in Tribolium originate from a small region of the blastoderm. Together, my findings show that development in the short germ embryos of Tribolium and the long germ embryos of Drosophila is more similar than previously proposed. Dorsal-to-ventral cell flow also occurs in Drosophila during germband extension, and I argue that the flow is driven by a conserved set of underlying morphogenetic events in both species. Furthermore, the revised Tribolium fatemap that I present is far more similar to that of Drosophila than the classic Tribolium fatemap. Lastly, my findings show that there is no qualitative difference between the tissue structure of the cellularised blastoderm and the short/intermediate germ germband. As such, the same tissue patterning mechanisms could function continuously throughout the cellularised blastoderm and germband stages, and easily shift between them over evolutionary time.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn many animals, certain groups of cells in the embryo do not directly contribute to adult structures. Instead, these cells generate so-called  extra-embryonic tissues that support and facilitate development, but degenerate prior to birth/hatching. In most insect species, embryos are described as having two major extra-embryonic tissues; the serosa, which encapsulates the entire embryo and yolk, and the amnion, which covers one side of the embryo. This tissue structure has been widely reported for over a century, but detailed studies on the amnion are lacking. Working in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, I used long-term fluorescent live imaging, cell tracking and differential cell labelling to investigate amnion development. In contrast to our current understanding, I show that most cells previously thought to be amnion actually form large parts of the embryo. In addition, I show how these cells  flow as a whole tissue and contribute to elongation of the embryo, and how only a relatively small number of cells form the actual amnion. Lastly, I describe how my findings show that despite exhibiting substantial differences in overall structure, embryos of Tribolium and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, utilise a conserved set of morphogenetic processes.",

However, although their consensus binding sites have been well defined in vitro, the in vivo selectivity for recognition by GATA factors remains poorly characterized. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified the Dal80 GATA factor targets in yeast. Our data reveal Dal80 binding to a large set of promoters, sometimes independently of GATA sites. Strikingly, Dal80 was also detected across the body of promoter-bound genes, correlating with high, Dal80-sensitive expression. Mechanistic single-gene experiments showed that Dal80 spreading across gene bodies is independent of intragenic GATA sites but requires transcription elongation. Consistently, Dal80 co-purified with the post-initiation form of RNA Polymerase II. Our work suggests that GATA factors could play dual, synergistic roles during transcription initiation and post-initiation steps, promoting efficient remodeling of the gene expression program in response to environmental changes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGATA transcription factors are highly conserved among eukaryotes and play key roles in cancer progression and hematopoiesis. In budding yeast, four GATA transcription factors are involved in the response to the quality of nitrogen supply. We have determined the whole genome binding profile of one of them, Dal80, and revealed that it also binds across the body or promoter-bound genes. Our observation that ORF binding correlated with elevated transcription levels and exquisite Dal80 sensitivity suggests that GATA factors could play other, unexpected roles at post-initiation stages in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus is emerging as an important pathogen in chronic lung diseases with concern regarding patient to patient transmission. The recent introduction of routine whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a replacement for existing reference techniques in England provides an opportunity to characterise the genetic determinants of resistance. We conducted a systematic review to catalogue all known resistance determining mutations. This knowledge was used to construct a predictive algorithm based on mutations in the erm(41) and rrl genes which was tested on a collection of 203 sequentially acquired clinical isolates for which there was paired genotype/phenotype data. A search for novel resistance determining mutations was conducted using an heuristic algorithm.\\n\\nThe sensitivity of existing knowledge for predicting resistance in clarithromycin was 95% (95% CI 89 - 98%) and the specificity was 66% (95% CI 54 - 76%). Subspecies alone was a poor predictor of resistance to clarithromycin. Eight potential new resistance conferring SNPs were identified. WGS demonstrates probable resistance determining SNPs in regions the NTM-DR line probe cannot detect. These mutations are potentially clinically important as they all occurred in samples predicted to be inducibly resistant, and for which a macrolide would therefore currently be indicated. We were unable to explain all resistance, raising the possibility of the involvement of other as yet unidentified genes.",

    "abstract": "Online educational materials are largely disseminated through videos, and yet there is little understanding of how these videos engage students and fuel academic success. We hypothesized that components of the electroencephalogram (EEG), previously shown to reflect video engagement, would be predictive of academic performance in the context of educational videos. Two groups of subjects watched educational videos in either an intentional learning paradigm, in which they were aware of an upcoming test, or in an incidental learning paradigm, in which they were unaware that they would be tested. \\\"Neural engagement\\\" was quantified by the inter-subject correlation (ISC) of the EEG that was evoked by the videos. In both groups, students with higher neural engagement retained more information. Neural engagement also discriminated between attentive and inattentive video viewing. These results suggest that this EEG metric is a marker of the stimulus-related attentional mechanisms necessary to retain information. In the future, EEG may be used as a tool to design and assess online educational content.",

    "abstract": "Typical responses of cortical neurons to identical sensory stimuli are highly variable. It has thus been proposed that the cortex primarily uses a rate code. However, other studies have argued for spike-time coding under certain conditions. The potential role of spike-time coding is constrained by the intrinsic variability of cortical circuits, which remains largely unexplored. Here, we quantified this intrinsic variability using a biophysical model of rat neocortical microcircuitry with biologically realistic noise sources. We found that stochastic neurotransmitter release is a critical component of this variability, which, amplified by recurrent connectivity, causes rapid chaotic divergence with a time constant on the order of 10-20 milliseconds. Surprisingly, weak thalamocortical stimuli can transiently overcome the chaos, and induce reliable spike times with millisecond precision. We show that this effect relies on recurrent cortical connectivity, and is not a simple effect of feed-forward thalamocortical input. We conclude that recurrent cortical architecture supports millisecond spike-time reliability amid noise and chaotic network dynamics, resolving a long-standing debate.",

    "abstract": "The use of RNA-sequencing has garnered much attention in the recent years for characterizing and understanding various biological systems. However, it remains a major challenge to gain insights from a large number of RNA-seq experiments collectively, due to the normalization problem. Current normalization methods are based on assumptions that fail to hold when RNA-seq profiles become more abundant and heterogeneous. We present a normalization procedure that does not rely on these assumptions, or on prior knowledge about the reference transcripts in those conditions. This algorithm is based on a graph constructed from intrinsic correlations among RNA-seq transcripts and seeks to identify a set of densely connected vertices as references. Application of this algorithm on our benchmark data showed that it can recover the reference transcripts with high precision, thus resulting in high-quality normalization. As demonstrated on a real data set, this algorithm gives good results and is efficient enough to be applicable to real-life data.\\n\\n2012 ACM Subject ClassificationApplied computing [-&gt;] Computational transcriptomics, Applied computing [-&gt;] Bioinformatics\\n\\nDigital Object Identifier10.4230/LIPIcs.WABI.2018.xxx\\n\\nFundingThis material was based on research supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-NIH sponsored Programs of Excellence in Glycosciences [grant number HL107152 to B.K.], and partially by NSF [CAREER grant 1350344 to M.M.].

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin formation during early embryogenesis is timed precisely, but it has been elusive how this process is regulated. Here we report the discovery of a histone methyltransferase complex whose nuclear accumulation and activation establishes the onset of heterochromatin formation in C. elegans embryos. We find that the inception of heterochromatin generation coincides with the accumulation of the Histone H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase MET-2 (SETDB) into nuclear hubs. The absence of MET-2 results in delayed and disturbed heterochromatin formation, whereas accelerated nuclear localization of the methyltransferase leads to precocious H3K9 methylation. We identify two factors that bind to and function with MET-2: LIN-65, which resembles ATF7IP, localizes MET-2 into nuclear hubs, and ARLE-14, orthologous to ARL14EP, promotes stable association of MET-2 with chromatin. These data reveal that nuclear accumulation of MET-2 in conjunction with LIN-65 and ARLE-14 regulates timing of heterochromatin domains during embryogenesis.\\n\\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYMET-2/SETDB1 and interactors LIN-65/ATF7IP and ARLE-14/ARL14EP initiate heterochromatin formation during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A common measure of multisensory integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent auditory and visual speech are integrated to produce an entirely different percept. Published studies report that participants who differ in age, gender, culture, native language, or traits related to neurological or psychiatric disorders also differ in their susceptibility to the McGurk effect. These group-level differences are used as evidence for fundamental alterations in sensory processing between populations. However, there is high variability in the McGurk effect within groups: some participants never report the illusion while others always do. High within-group variability means that sample sizes much larger than those in the published literature are necessary to accurately estimate between-group differences. Using empirical data and simulations, we show that a typical study with a sample size of 15 participants per group and a true group difference of 10% will report a group difference of 31%, an effect inflation of three-fold. Reducing the effect inflation by half requires increasing the sample size ten-fold, to 150 participants per group. The combination of within-group variability and small sizes explains two prominent features of the McGurk literature. First, group differences are inflated and highly variable across studies. Second, follow-up studies fail to replicate published reports of large between-group susceptibility differences because initial effect-size estimates are driven by statistical inflation rather than true group differences. These replication failures are especially problematic in studies of clinical populations because they have real-world consequences. Due to the high within-group variability, caution is essential when using the McGurk effect to assess deficits in clinical groups or propose treatment plans, such as training to improve sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Allostery is a fundamental principle of protein regulation that remains poorly understood and hard to engineer, in particular in ion channels. Here we use human Inward Rectifier K+ Channel Kir2.1 to establish domain insertion  permissibility as a new experimental paradigm to identify engineerable allosteric sites. We find that permissibility is best explained by dynamic protein properties, such as conformational flexibility. Many allosterically regulated sites in Kir2.1 or sites equivalent to those regulated in homologs, such as G-protein-gated inward rectifier K+ channels (GIRK), have differential permissibility; that is, for these sites permissibility depends on the structural properties of the inserted domain. Our data and the well-established link between protein dynamics and allostery led us to propose that differential permissibility is a metric of both existing and latent allostery in Kir2.1. In support of this notion, inserting light-switchable domains into either existing or latent allosteric sites, but not elsewhere, renders Kir2.1 activity sensitive to light.",

One species was identified entirely based on a daytime chorus from outside the normal breeding season.

While the regulation of EGFR endocytosis in interphase is well understood, little is known regarding the regulation of EGFR endocytosis during mitosis. Here, we studied the mechanisms regulating mitotic EGFR endocytosis. We found that contrary to interphase cells, mitotic EGFR endocytosis is more reliant on the activation of the E3 ligase CBL. At high EGF doses, inhibition of inhibited EGFR endocytosis of mitotic cells, but not of interphase cells. Moreover, the endocytosis of mutant EGFR Y1045F-YFP was strongly delayed. The endocytosis of truncated EGFR {Delta}1044-YFP that does not bind to CBL was completely inhibited. EGF induced stronger ubiquitination of mitotic EGFR than interphase EGFR and mitotic EGFR is trafficked to lysosome for degradation. Furthermore, during mitosis low doses of EGF also stimulate EGFR endocytosis by NCE. Contrary to interphase, CBL and the CBL-binding regions of EGFR were required for mitotic EGFR endocytosis at low doses. This may be due to the mitotic ubiquitination of the EGFR even at low EGF doses. In conclusion, mitotic EGFR endocytosis solely proceed through CBL-mediated NCE.",

    "abstract": "The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) prevents erroneous chromosome segregation by delaying mitotic progression when chromosomes are incorrectly attached to the mitotic spindle. This delay is mediated by Mitotic Checkpoint Complexes (MCCs), which assemble at unattached kinetochores and repress the activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). The cellular localizations of MCCs are likely critical for proper SAC function, yet remain poorly defined. We recently demonstrated that in mammalian cells, in which the nuclear envelope disassembles during mitosis, MCCs diffuse throughout the spindle region and cytoplasm. Here, we employed binucleate yeast zygotes to examine the localization dynamics of SAC effectors required for MCC assembly and function in budding yeast, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact throughout mitosis. Our findings indicate that in yeast MCCs are confined to the nuclear compartment and excluded from the cytoplasm during mitosis. In contrast, we find that effectors of the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) - a pathway that initiates disassembly of the anaphase spindle only when it is properly oriented - are in fact freely exchanged between multiple nuclei within a shared cytoplasm. Our study provides insight into how cell cycle checkpoints have evolved to function in diverse cellular contexts.",

Although there was no difference in the case-control analyses for GIPR Glu354Gln for cardiometabolic group, regarding C allele carriers there were twice associated with arterial hypertension (p<0,001) and dyslipidemia (p<0,03).\\n\\nConclusionThe prevalence of the GIPR Glu354Gln for the CC genotype and for the C polymorphic allele was 25.7% and 3.2%, respectively. This study shows the potential participation of the GIPR Glu354Gln polymorphism with the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia in this Brazilian population. Taking into account the rarity of the CC genotype, additional studies with larger numbers of participants could contribute to a better understanding.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResistant starch is a prebiotic metabolized by the gut bacteria. It has been shown to attenuate chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in rats. Previous studies employed taxonomic analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling. Here we expand these studies by metaproteomics, gaining new insight into the host-microbiome interaction.\\n\\nMethodsDifferences between cecum contents in CKD rats fed a diet containing resistant starch with those fed a diet containing digestible starch were examined by comparative metaproteomics analysis. Taxonomic information was obtained using unique protein sequences. Our methodology results in quantitative data covering both host and bacterial proteins.\\n\\nResults5,834 proteins were quantified, with 947 proteins originating from the host organism. Taxonomic information derived from metaproteomics data surpassed previous 16S RNA analysis, and reached species resolutions for moderately abundant taxonomic groups. In particular, the Ruminococcaceae family becomes well resolved - with butyrate producers and amylolytic species such as R. bromii clearly visible and significantly higher while fibrolytic species such as R. flavefaciens are significantly lower with resistant starch feeding. The observed changes in protein patterns are consistent with fiber-associated improvement in CKD phenotype. Several known host CKD-associated proteins and biomarkers of impaired kidney function were significantly reduced with resistant starch supplementation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008845.\\n\\nConclusions- Metaproteomics analysis of cecum contents of CKD rats with and without resistant starch supplementation reveals changes within gut microbiota at unprecedented resolution, providing both functional and taxonomic information.

In this study, sublethal effects of the new acaricide SYP-9625 on Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval), effects of application concentration of SYP-9625 on the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) and functional responses of N. californicus were assessed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and explore the application of new acaricide SYP-9625 with natural enemy N. californicus.\\n\\nMethodAll the experiments were under laboratory conditions [25 {+/-} 1 {degrees}C, 16:8 (L:D) h and 75 {+/-} 5% RH] and based on an age-stage, two-sex life table. The sublethal concentrations against T. cinnabarinus, including LC10 (0.375 g/mL) and LC30 (0.841 g/mL) and the application concentration (100 g/mL) of SYP-9625, were used to evaluate effects on population parameters of N. californicus.\\n\\nResultT. cinnabarinus females treated with LC30 exhibited significantly reduced net reproductive rates (R0=11.02) of offspring compared to females treated with LC10 (R0=14.96) and untreated females (>R0=32.74). However, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate of increase ({lambda}) of N. californicus indicated that the application concentration of SYP-9625 had no significant negative effect on treated N. californicus eggs (rm=0.277,{lambda} =1.319) compared to the control (rm=0.292,{lambda} =1.338). Additionally, the sublethal concentrations against T. cinnabarinus including LC10 and LC30 showed a dose-dependent mechanism on the predatory mite. SYP-9625 also stimulated the predatory capacity of N. californicus against immobile stages such as eggs and larvae.\\n\\nConclusionIt is demonstrated that sublethal concentrations of SYP-9625 can inhibit population growth of T. cinnabarinus. And the sublethal concentrations and application concentration had little effect on the population growth of N. californicus. The two advantages showed great commercial potential of this new acaricide. Therefore, N. californicus can manage T. cinnabarinus populations effectively with appropriate SYP-9625 concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Peptide drugs have been used in the treatment of multiple pathologies. During peptide discovery, it is crucially important to be able to map the potential sites of cleavages of the proteases. This knowledge is used to later chemically modify the peptide drug to adapt it for the therapeutic use, making peptide stable against individual proteases or in complex medias. In some other cases it needed to make it specifically unstable for some proteases, as peptides could be used as a system to target delivery drugs on specific tissues or cells. The information about proteases, their sites of cleavages and substrates are widely spread across publications and collected in databases such as MEROPS. Therefore, it is possible to develop models to improve the understanding of the potential peptide drug proteolysis. We propose a new workflow to derive protease specificity rules and predict the potential scissile bonds in peptides for individual proteases. WebMetabase stores the information from experimental or external sources in a chemically aware database where each peptide and site of cleavage is represented as a sequence of structural blocks connected by amide bonds and characterized by its physicochemical properties described by Volsurf descriptors. Thus, this methodology could be applied in the case of non-standard amino acid. A frequency analysis can be performed in WebMetabase to discover the most frequent cleavage sites. These results were used to train several models using logistic regression, support vector machine and ensemble tree classifiers to map cleavage sites for several human proteases from four different families (serine, cysteine, aspartic and matrix metalloproteases). Finally, we compared the predictive performance of the developed models with other available public tools PROSPERous and SitePrediction.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal beyond the local patch in clonal plants was typically thought to result from sexual reproduction via seed dispersal. However, evidence for the separation, transport by water, and re-establishment of asexual propagules (asexual hydrochory) is mounting suggesting other important means of dispersal in aquatic plants. Using an unprecedented sampling size and microsatellite genetic identification, we describe the distribution of seagrass clones along tens of km within a coastal lagoon in Southern Portugal. Our spatially explicit individual-based sampling design covered 84 km2 and collected 3 185 Zostera noltei ramets from 803 sites. We estimated clone age, assuming rhizome elongation as the only mechanism of clone spread, and contrasted it with paleo-oceanographic sea level change. We also studied the association between a source of disturbance and the location of large clones. A total of 16 clones were sampled more than 10 times and the most abundant one was sampled 59 times. The largest distance between two samples from the same clone was 26.4 km and a total of 58 and 10 clones were sampled across more than 2 and 10 km, respectively. The number of extremely large clone sizes, and their old ages when assuming the rhizome elongation as the single causal mechanism, suggests other processes are behind the span of these clones. We discuss how the dispersal of vegetative fragments in a stepping-stone manner might have produced this pattern. We found higher probabilities to sample large clones away from the lagoon inlet, considered a source of disturbance. This study corroborates previous experiments on the success of transport and re-establishment of asexual fragments and supports the hypothesis that asexual hydrochory is responsible for the extent of these clones.",

Results showed that the primers rbcL-4 and matK-4 amplified walnut, peanut, sesame, soybean, and hazelnut. Peanut genomic DNA and soybean genomic DNA were added to the genomic DNA of walnut in different proportions. Primer rbcL-4 can detect 10% peanut genome DNA, and primer matK-4 can detect 10% soybean genome DNA. Calculation results of the extraction rate revealed that primer rbcL-4 can detect 8.88% peanut raw materials and primer matK-4 can detect 2.30% soybean raw materials. The combination of these two primers can be used as a universal primer for the identification of adulterated components in walnut beverage.

The proposed algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art classification methods for 16S rRNA metagenomic data, including Random Forests and the phylogeny-based Metaphyl algorithm, for varying sample size, classification difficulty, and dimensionality (number of OTUs), using both synthetic and real metagenomic data sets.

In particular, in the case where the ratio of sample size to dimensionality is small, it was observed that the proposed method can vastly outperform the others.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRecent studies have highlighted the interplay between host genetics, gut microbes, and colorectal tumor initiation/progression. The characterization of microbial communities using metagenomic profiling has therefore received renewed interest. In this paper, we propose a method for classification, i.e., prediction of different outcomes, based on 16S rRNA metagenomic data. The proposed method employs a Bayesian approach, which is suitable for data sets with small ration of number of available instances to the dimensionality.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is exponentially increasing its impact on healthcare. As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, e.g. from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.

We introduce the DAPPER framework for validation based on a rigorous Data Analysis Plan derived from the FDAs MAQC project, designed to analyse causes of variability in predictive biomarkers. We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and they play an important role in various biological processes in the human body. Therefore, identifying their regulation mechanisms is essential for the diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of diseases. There have been a large number of researches which use gene expression profiles to resolve this problem. However, the current methods have their own limitations. Some of them only identify the correlation of miRNA and mRNA expression levels instead of the causal or regulatory relationships while others infer the causality but with a high computational complexity. To overcome these issues, in this study, we propose a method to identify miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships in breast cancer using the invariant causal prediction. The key idea of invariant causal prediction is that the cause miRNAs of their target mRNAs are the ones which have persistent causal relationships with the target mRNAs across different environments. In this research, we aim to find miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Thus, first of all, we apply the Pam50 method to categorise BRCA samples into different   environment\\\" groups based on different cancer subtypes. Then we use the invariant causal prediction method to find miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships across subtypes. We validate the results with the miRNA-transfected experimental data and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also integrate this new method with the Pearson correlation analysis method and Lasso in an ensemble method to take the advantages of these methods. We then validate the results of the ensemble method with the experimentally confirmed data and the ensemble method shows the best performance, even comparing to the proposed causal method. Functional enrichment analyses show that miRNAs in the regulatory relationship predicated by the proposed causal method tend to synergistically regulate target genes, indicating the usefulness of these methods, and the identified miRNA targets could be used in the design of wet-lab experiments to discover the causes of breast cancer.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCancer is a disease of cells in human body and it causes a high rate of deaths world wide. There has been evidence that non-coding RNAs are key players in the development and progression of cancer. Among the different types of non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, which are short non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression and play an important role in different biological processes as well as various cancer types. To design better diagnostic and therapeutic plans for cancer patients, we need to know the roles of miRNAs in cancer initialisation and development, and their regulation mechanisms in the human body. In this study, we propose algorithms to identify miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships in breast cancer. Comparing our methods with existing methods in predicting miRNA targets, our methods show a better performance. The estimated miRNA targets from our methods could be a potential source for further wet-lab experiments to discover the causes of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Measles is a highly transmissible disease and is one of the leading causes of death among young children under 5 globally. While the use of ongoing surveillance data and - recently - dynamic models offer insight on measles dynamics, both suffer notable shortcomings when applied to measles outbreak prediction. In this paper, we apply the Sequential Monte Carlo approach of particle filtering, incorporating reported measles incidence for Saskatchewan during the pre-vaccination era, using an adaptation of a previously contributed measles compartmental model. To secure further insight, we also perform particle filtering on an age structured adaptation of the model in which the population is divided into two interacting age groups - children and adults. The results indicate that, when used with a suitable dynamic model, particle filtering can offer high predictive capacity for measles dynamics and outbreak occurrence in a low vaccination context. We have investigated five particle filtering models in this project. Based on the most competitive model as evaluated by predictive accuracy, we have performed prediction and outbreak classification analysis. The prediction results demonstrated that this model could predict the measles transmission patterns and classify whether there will be an outbreak or not in the next month (Area under the ROC Curve of 0.89). We conclude that anticipating the outbreak dynamics of measles in low vaccination regions by applying particle filtering with simple measles transmission models, and incorporating time series of reported case counts, is a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in estimating risk and magnitude of measles outbreaks. Such approach offer particularly strong value proposition for other pathogens with little-known dynamics, critical latent drivers, and in the context of the growing number of high-velocity electronic data sources. Strong additional benefits are also likely to be realized from extending the application of this technique to highly vaccinated populations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMeasles is a highly infectious disease and is one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. In 2016, close to 90,000 people died from measles. Measles can cause outbreaks particularly in people who did not receive protective vaccine. Understanding how measles outbreaks unfold can help public health agencies to design intervention strategies to prevent and control this potentially deadly infection. Although traditional methods - including the use of ongoing monitoring of infectious diseases trends by public health agencies and simulation of such trends using scientific technique of mathematical modeling - offer insight on measles dynamics, both have shortcomings when applied to our ability to predict measles outbreaks. We seek to enhance the accuracy with which we can understand the current measles disease burden as well as number of individuals who may develop measles because of lack of protection and predict future measles trends. We do this by applying a machine learning technique that combines the best features of insights from ongoing observations and mathematical models while minimizing important weaknesses of each. Our results indicate that, coupled with a suitable mathematical model, this technique can predict future measles trends and measles outbreaks in areas with low vaccination coverage.",

    "abstract": "One of the problems in cancer registry of developing countries is misclassification error. This error leads to overestimation and underestimation of cancer rate in different provinces. The aim of this study is to use Bayesian method to correct for misclassification in registering cancer incidence in neighboring provinces of Iran. Incidence data of colorectal cancer were extracted from Iranian annual of national cancer registration reports 2005 to 2008 And Eighteen of the thirty Iranian provinces were selected to enter the Bayesian model and to correct their misclassification. Always a province with appropriate medical facilities is comparable to its neighbor or neighbors. Between years of 2005 and 2008, on the average, 28% misclassification was estimated between the province of East Azarbaijan and West Azarbayjan, 56% between the province of Fars and Hormozgan, 43% between the province of Isfahan and Charmahal and Bakhtyari, 46% between the province of Isfahan and Lorestan, 58% between the province of Razavi Khorasan and North Khorasan, 50% between the province of Razavi Khorasan and South Khorasan, 74% between the province of Razavi Khorasan and Sistan and Balochestan, 43% between the province of Mazandaran and Golestan, 37% between the province of Tehran and Qazvin, 45% between the province of Tehran and Markazi, 42% between the province of Tehran and Qom, 47% between the province of Tehran and Zanjan. Correcting the regional misclassification and obtaining the correct rates of cancer incidence in different regions is necessary for making cancer control and prevention programs and in healthcare resource allocation.",

    "abstract": "Speciation is facilitated when traits subject to divergent selection also contribute to non-random mating--so-called  magic traits. Diet is a potential magic trait in animal populations because selection for divergence in consumed food may contribute to assortative mating and therefore sexual isolation. However, the mechanisms causing positive diet-based assortment are largely unknown. Here, using diet manipulations in a sexually imprinting species of mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus (the cotton mouse), we tested the hypothesis that sexual imprinting on a divergent diet could be a mechanism that generates rapid and significant sexual isolation. We provided breeding pairs with novel garlic- or orange-flavored water and assessed whether their offspring, exposed to these flavors in utero and in the nest before weaning, later preferred mates that consumed the same flavored water as their parents. While males showed no preference, females preferred males of their parental diet, which generated significant sexual isolation. Thus, our experiment demonstrates that sexual imprinting on dietary cues learned in utero and/or postnatally can facilitate reproductive isolation and potentially speciation.",

    "abstract": "Maternal genetic variations, including variations in mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and oxidative phosphorylation (OP), have been associated with placental abruption (PA). However, the role of maternal-fetal genetic interactions (MFGI) and parent-of-origin (imprinting) effects in PA remain unknown. We investigated MFGI in MB-OP, and imprinting effects in relation to risk of PA. Among Peruvian mother-infant pairs (503 PA cases and 1,052 controls), independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with linkage-disequilibrium coefficient <0.80, were selected to characterize genetic variations in MB-OP (78 SNPs in 24 genes) and imprinted genes (2713 SNPs in 73 genes). For each MB-OP SNP, four multinomial models corresponding to fetal allele effect, maternal allele effect, maternal and fetal allele additive effect, and maternal-fetal allele interaction effect were fit under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, random mating, and rare disease assumptions. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used for model selection. For each SNP in imprinted genes, imprinting effect was tested using a likelihood ratio test.\\n\\nBonferroni corrections were used to determine statistical significance (p-value<6.4e-4 for MFGI and p-value<1.8e-5 for imprinting). Abruption cases were more likely to experience preeclampsia, have shorter gestational age, and deliver infants with lower birthweight compared with controls. Models with MFGI effects provided improved fit than models with only maternal and fetal genotype main effects for SNP rs12530904 (log-likelihood ratio=18.2; p-value=1.2e-04) in CAMK2B, and, SNP rs73136795 (log-likelihood ratio=21.7; p-value=1.9e-04) in PPARG, both MB genes. We identified 311 SNPs in 35 maternally-imprinted genes (including KCNQ1, NPM, and, ATP10A) associated with abruption. Top hits included rs8036892 (p-value=2.3e-15) in ATP10A, rs80203467 (p-value=6.7e-15) and rs12589854 (p-value=1.4e-14) in MEG8, and rs138281088 in SLC22A2 (p-value=1.7e-13). We identified novel PA-related maternal-fetal MB gene interactions and imprinting effects that highlight the role of the fetus in PA risk development. Findings can inform mechanistic investigations to understand the pathogenesis of PA.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPlacental Abruption (PA) is a complex multifactorial and heritable disease characterized by premature separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. PA is a consequence of complex interplay of maternal and fetal genetics, epigenetics, and metabolic factors. Previous studies have identified common maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and oxidative phosphorylation (OP) genes that are associated with PA risk, although findings were inconsistent. Using the largest assembled mother-infant dyad of PA cases and controls, that includes participants from a previous report, we identified novel PA-related maternal-fetal MB gene interactions and imprinting effects that highlight the role of the fetus in PA risk development. Our findings have the potential for enhancing our understanding of genetic variations in maternal and fetal genome that contribute to PA.",

    "abstract": "The hypervirulent Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS) serogroup III clonal cluster 17 has been associated with neonatal GBS invasive disease and meningits. Serogroup III, ST283 has recently been implicated in invasive disease among non-pregnant adults in Asia. These strains cluster with strains from freshwater fishes from aquaculture and a foodborne outbreak of sepsis, especially with septic arthritis, had been linked to such consumption in Singapore in 2015. Through comparative genome analyses of invasive and non-invasive strains of ST283, we identified a truncated response regulator gene in the non-invasive strain. This two component response gene, previously named a DNA binding regulator, is conserved among GBS strains and is a homologue of Bacillus subtilis BceR, the response regulator of the BceRSAB system. Loss of function of the BceR response gene in the invasive GBS strain demonstrated bacitracin susceptibility in{Delta} BceR mutant with MICs of 256-fold and four-fold reduction in bacitracin and human cathelicin LL-37 compared to wild type and complementation strains. Upregulation of dltA of wild type strain vs{Delta} BceR mutant was demonstrated (p<0.0001), and was previously shown in Staphylococcus aureus to resist and repel cationic peptides through excess positive charges with D-alanylation of teichoic acids on the cell wall. In addition,{Delta} BceR mutant was less susceptible under oxidative stress under H2O2 stress when compared to wild type strain (p<0.001) and inhibited biofilm formation (p<0.05 and p < 0.0001 for crystal violet staining and cfu counts). The{Delta} BceR mutant also showed reduced mortality as compared to wild type strain (p<0.01) in a murine infection model. Taken together, BceRS is involved in bacitracin and antimicrobial peptide resistance, survival under oxidative stress, biofilm formation and play an important role in the virulence of GBS.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTwo-component systems (TCSs) play an important role in virulence in bacteria, and are involved in detecting environmental changes. Although S. agalactiae was reported to contain more predicted TCSs than Streptococcus pneumoniae, few have been studied in detail. In this work, comparative genomic analysis of GBS invasive (hyper-virulent) and non-invasive serotype III-4 strains were performed to determine any gene differences that may account for severity of disease in humans. BceR-like TCS was selected and suspected to be involved in virulence, and thus BceR was deleted in a hyper-virulent GBS serotype III-4 strain. We demonstrated that this BceR-like TCS is involved in GBS virulence and induced proinflammatory host immune responses. Our study of TCS BceR may guide further research into the role of other TCSs in GBS pathogenicity, and further explore therapeutic targets for GBS disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) has a high disease burden and the World Health Organization (WHO) states it is a global emergency. TB is the most important cause of death from infectious disease in adults. It is directly related to access to health services and socioeconomic factors. Primary health care (PHC) provides greater linkage of people to health services and greater medication adherence in some chronic diseases. It also provides supervised treatment and more effective search for contactants. The PHC Reform started in 2009 in Rio de Janeiro, increasing coverage from 7% to 46.16% in 2015.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal findingsThis paper aims to evaluate the spatial distribution of new TB cases closed with a cure outcome in dwellers of Rio de Janeiro in the period 2012-2014, according to PHC coverage, controlling socioeconomic, demographic and epidemiological factors. Variables were obtained from the Notifiable Diseases Information System for Tuberculosis (SINAN-TB) and the socioeconomic variables from the 2010 national census at census tract level. The socioeconomic variables were selected from multivariate analysis using main factors analysis technique. The generalized additive model (GAM) was used for the spatial analysis. Association was found between TB cure and variables education, alcoholism, contacts search, HIV serology and elderly. People with family health coverage between 35 and 41 months were 1.64 more likely of cure when compared to people without coverage (95% CI 1.07-2.51). Spatial analysis identified areas with less probability of cure for tuberculosis in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTuberculosis is associated to social and demographic conditions. Lack of access to healthcare contributes to delay in diagnosis and in the beginning of the treatment. Primary health care improve access and adherence to treatment. This study can be useful as a public health policy, since it is possible to prioritize the region in the map to improve TB cure. We found association between tuberculosis cure and the duration of implantation of the primary health care teams. This finding corroborates the importance of treating tuberculosis in this level of care. The spatial analysis of cases of tuberculosis cure showed a significant spatial association with the cure of tuberculosis. The results of this study can contribute reinforcing the policy makers for developing primary health care to improve the access to health services and to reach better TB cure rates. Spatial analysis may be an useful tool for identifying the areas where to prioritize efforts for reaching better results.",

We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 2,308 individuals from families containing multiple affected children, including analysis of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and structural variants (SV). We identified 16 new ASD-risk genes, including many supported by inherited variation, and provide statistical support for 69 genes in total, including previously implicated genes. These risk genes are enriched in pathways involving negative regulation of synaptic transmission and organelle organization. We identify a significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network seeded by inherited, predicted damaging variants disrupting highly constrained genes, including members of the BAF complex and established ASD risk genes. Analysis of WGS also identified SVs effecting non-coding regulatory regions in developing human brain, implicating NR3C2 and a recurrent 2.5Kb deletion within the promoter of DLG2. These data lend support to studying multiplex families for identifying inherited risk for ASD.

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial fission machinery, comprising a dynamin-related GTPase, DRP-1, is crucial for the regulation of mitochondrial membrane dynamics. Recent reports suggest that the tubular architecture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marks the constriction sites on the mitochondria to facilitate DRP-1-mediated mitochondrial fission. However, the role of several ER shaping proteins that maintain the elaborate network of tubes and sheets in mitochondrial constriction and fission is not yet known. In this report, we demonstrate that modulation of the expression levels of key ER shaping proteins, namely Reticulon1 (RTN-1), Reticulon 4 (RTN-4), Lunapark-1 (LNP-1) and CLIMP-63, markedly decreased the extent of mitochondrial fission mediated by BH3 mimetics, despite no detectable changes in DRP-1 recruitment to the mitochondria. Furthermore, modulation of ER shaping proteins significantly decreased other hallmarks of apoptosis, such as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, caspase activation and phosphatidylserine externalization, and functioned independently of mitochondrial cristae remodeling, thus demonstrating a requirement of ER shaping proteins and ER structural integrity for the efficient execution of the instrinsic apoptotic pathway.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCETP inhibitors raise circulating concentrations of HDL-cholesterol, and potent inhibitors also lower non-HDL-cholesterol and risk of vascular disease. Previous genome-wide pharmacogenetic analysis of a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CETP inhibitor, dalcetrapib, found variants in ADCY9 to associate with response to treatment. More recently, findings from a pharmacogenetic analysis of the CETP inhibitor evacetrapib reported a lack of such an association.\\n\\nAimsTo clarify the totality of evidence on whether ADCY9 genotype modifies the treatment response to CETP inhibition on risk of major adverse cardiac events through systematic review and meta-analysis.\\n\\nMethodsWe searched PubMed on 22nd May 2018 to identify RCTs of CETP inhibition that reported vascular disease effect estimates stratified by ADCY9 genotype. Stratum-specific estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Tests of heterogeneity between, and trend across, genotypic strata were assessed using Chi2.\\n\\nResultsNine studies were identified from PubMed, of which two (dal-OUTCOMES and ACCELERATE) were RCTs reporting the treatment response to CETP inhibition by ADCY9 genotype, and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In meta-analysis of dal-OUTCOMES and ACCELERATE, treatment with a CETP inhibitor was associated with a relative risk (RR) for major adverse cardiac events of RR 0.80 (95%CI, 0.65-0.99) in carriers of ADCY9 rs1967309 AA. For carriers of AG, the corresponding estimate was a RR of 1.01 (95%CI, 0.89-1.13), and for GG carriers, it was RR 1.21 (95%CI, 1.06-1.40). We identified evidence of heterogeneity (P=0.004) and a trend (P=0.0009) across genotypic groups.\\n\\nConclusionsIn contrast to the interpretation provided by authors of the analysis based in the ACCELERATE trial, the available evidence lends weak support to a potential interaction of CETP treatment by ADCY9 genotype on risk of major adverse cardiac events. Additional data, e.g. from the ongoing dal-GenE trial focused explicitly on this interaction, should provide further clarity regarding the robustness of this pharmacogenetic effect.",

    "abstract": "Facial attractiveness is a complex human trait of great interest in both academia and industry. Literature on sociological and phenotypic factors associated with facial attractiveness is rich, but its genetic basis is poorly understood. In this paper, we conducted a genome-wide association study to discover genetic variants associated with facial attractiveness using 3,928 samples in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. We identified two genome-wide significant loci and highlighted a handful of candidate genes, many of which are specifically expressed in human tissues involved in reproduction and hormone synthesis. Additionally, facial attractiveness showed strong and negative genetic correlations with BMI in females and with blood lipids in males. Our analysis also suggested sex-specific selection pressure on variants associated with lower male attractiveness. These results revealed sex-specific genetic architecture of facial attractiveness and provided fundamental new insights into its genetic basis.",

    "abstract": "Most population isolates examined to date were founded from a single ancestral population. Consequently, there is limited knowledge about the demographic history of admixed population isolates. Here we investigate genomic diversity of recently admixed population isolates from Costa Rica and Colombia and compare their diversity to a benchmark population isolate, the Finnish. These Latin American isolates originated during the 16th century from admixture between a few hundred European males and Amerindian females, with a limited contribution from African founders. We examine whole genome sequence data from 449 individuals, ascertained as families to build mutigenerational pedigrees, with a mean sequencing depth of coverage of approximately 24X. We find that Latin American isolates have increased genetic diversity relative to the Finnish. However, there is an increase in the amount of identity by descent (IBD) segments in the Latin American isolates relative to the Finnish. The increase in IBD segments is likely a consequence of a very recent and severe population bottleneck during the founding of the admixed population isolates. Furthermore, the proportion of the genome that falls within a long run of homozygosity (ROH) in Costa Rican and Colombian individuals was significantly greater than that in the Finnish, suggesting more recent consanguinity in the Latin American isolates relative to that seen in the Finnish. Lastly, we found that recent consanguinity increased the number of deleterious variants found in the homozygous state, which is relevant if deleterious variants are recessive. Our study suggests there is no single genetic signature of a population isolate.",

Here, we studied DNA methylation (DNAm) at over 750,000 CpG sites in mononuclear blood cells collected at birth and age 7 from 196 children of primarily self-reported Black and Hispanic ethnicities to study race-associated DNAm patterns. We developed a novel Bayesian method for high dimensional longitudinal data and showed that race-associated DNAm patterns at birth and age 7 are nearly identical. Additionally, we estimated that up to 51% of all self-reported race-associated CpGs had race-dependent DNAm levels that were mediated through local genotype and, quite surprisingly, found that genetic factors explained an overwhelming majority of the variation in DNAm levels at other, previously identified, environmentally-associated CpGs. These results not only indicate that race-associated DNAm patterns in blood are present at birth and are primarily genetically, and not environmentally, determined, but also that DNAm in blood cells overall is robust to many environmental exposures during the first 7 years of life.",

Many studies have shown that sensory deprivation can lead to cross-modal functional recruitment of sensory deprived cortices. Little is known however about how structural reorganization may support these functional changes. In this study, we examined early deaf, hearing signer and hearing non-signer individuals using diffusion MRI to evaluate the potential structural connectivity linked to the functional recruitment of the temporal voice area by face stimuli in deaf individuals. More specifically, we characterized the structural connectivity between occipital, fusiform and temporal regions typically supporting voice- and face-selective processing. Despite the extensive functional reorganization for face processing in the temporal cortex of the deaf, macroscopic properties of these connections did not differ across groups. However, both occipito- and fusiform-temporal connections showed significant microstructural changes between groups (fractional anisotropy reduction, radial diffusivity increase). We propose that the reorganization of temporal regions after early auditory deprivation builds on intrinsic and mainly preserved anatomical connectivity between functionally specific temporal and occipital regions.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMacrostructural connectivity of the face-voice system is preserved in early deafness\\nC_LIO_LIEarly deafness impacts on the microstructural connectivity of the face-voice system\\nC_LIO_LIBoth genetics and experience shape structural connections in the face-voice system\\nC_LIO_LIInnate anatomical networks might constrain the expression of cross-modal plasticity\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations",

We discover that the perceived mass is mainly determined by the ground-truth mass output by the force-feedback device. Different from the classic Material Weight Illusion (MWI), however, heavy-looking objects (e.g. steel) are consistently rated heavier than light-looking ones (e.g. fabric) with the same ground-truth mass. Analysis of the initial accelerated velocity of the movement trajectories of the virtual probe shows greater acceleration for materials with heavier rated mass. This effect is diminished when the participants lift the object for the second time, meaning that the influence of visual appearance disappears in the movement trajectories once it is calibrated by the force-feedback. We also show how the material categories are affected by both the visual appearance and the weight of the object. We conclude that visual appearance has a significant interaction with haptic force-feedback on the perception of mass and also affects the kinematics of how participants manipulate the object.\\n\\nCCS CONCEPTS* Human-centered computing [-&gt;] Empirical studies in HCI; Empirical studies in interaction design; Empirical studies in visualization;\\n\\nACM Reference FormatWenyan Bi, Jonathan Newport, and Bei Xiao. 2018.

    "abstract": "Autophagy has been implicated in innate immune responses against various intracellular pathogens. Recent studies have reported that autophagy can be triggered by pathogen recognizing sensors, including Toll-like receptors and cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase, to participate in innate immunity. In the present study, we examined whether the RIG-I signaling pathway, which detects viral infections by recognizing viral RNA, triggers the autophagic process. The introduction of polyI:C into the cytoplasm, or Sendai virus infection, significantly induced autophagy in normal cells but not in RIG-I-deficient cells. PolyI:C transfection or Sendai virus infection induced autophagy in the cells lacking type-I interferon signaling. This demonstrated that the effect was not due to interferon signaling. RIG-I-mediated autophagy diminished by the deficiency of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6, showing that the RIG-I-MAVS-TRAF6 signaling axis was critical for RIG-I-mediated autophagy. We also found that Beclin-1 was translocated to the mitochondria, and it interacted with TRAF6 upon RIG-I activation. Furthermore, Beclin-1 underwent K63-polyubiquitination upon RIG-I activation, and the ubiquitination decreased in TRAF6-deficient cells. This suggests that the RIG-I-MAVS-TRAF6 axis induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of Beclin-1, which has been implicated in triggering autophagy. Collectively, the results of this study show that the recognition of viral infection by RIG-I is capable of inducing autophagy to control viral replication. As deficient autophagy increases the type-I interferon response, the induction of autophagy by the RIG-I pathway might also contribute to preventing an excessive interferon response as a negative-feedback mechanism.\\n\\nImportanceMammalian cells utilize various innate immune sensors to detect pathogens. Among those sensors, RIG-I recognizes viral RNA to detect intracellular viral replication. Although cells experience diverse physiological changes upon viral infection, studies to understand the role of RIG-I signaling have focused on the induction of type-I interferon. Autophagy is a process that sequesters cytosolic regions and degrades the contents to maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy participates in the immune system, and has been known to be triggered by some innate immune sensors, such as TLR4 and cGAS. We demonstrated that autophagy can be triggered by the activation of RIG-I. In addition, we also proved that MAVS-TRAF6 downstream signaling is crucial for the process. Beclin-1, a key molecule in autophagy, is translocated to mitochondria, where it undergoes K63-ubiquitination in a TRAF6-dependent manner upon RIG-I activation. As autophagy negatively regulates RIG-I-mediated signaling, the RIG-I-mediated activation of autophagy may function as a negative-feedback mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOA) use limiting dilutions of CD4+ T cells to measure the size of the latent HIV-1 reservoir, a major obstacle to curing HIV-1. Efforts to reduce the reservoir require assays that can reliably quantify its size in blood and tissues. Although QVOA is regarded as a \\\"gold standard\\\" for reservoir measurement, little is known about its accuracy and precision or about how cell storage conditions or laboratory-specific practices affect results. Owing to this lack of knowledge, confidence intervals around reservoir size estimates - as well as judgments of the ability of therapeutic interventions to alter the size of the replication-competent but transcriptionally inactive latent reservoir - rely on theoretical statistical assumptions about dilution assays. To address this gap, we have carried out a Bayesian statistical analysis of QVOA reliability on 75 split samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 5 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed participants, measured using four different QVOAs at separate labs, estimating assay precision and the effect of frozen cell storage on estimated reservoir size. We found that typical assay results are expected to differ from the true value by a factor of 1.6 to 1.9 up or down. Systematic assay differences comprised a 24-fold range between the assays with highest and lowest scales, likely reflecting differences in viral outgrowth readout and input cell stimulation protocols. We also found that controlled-rate freezing and storage of samples did not cause substantial differences in QVOA compared to use of fresh cells (95% probability of < 2-fold change), supporting continued use of frozen storage to allow transport and batched analysis of samples. Finally, we simulated an early-phase clinical trial to demonstrate that batched analysis of pre- and post-therapy samples may increase power to detect a three-fold reservoir reduction by 15 to 24 percentage points.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe latent reservoir of resting CD4+ T cells is a major, if not the primary, obstacle to curing HIV. Quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOAs) are used to measure the latent reservoir in ART-suppressed HIV-infected people. Using QVOA is difficult, however, as the fraction of cells constituting the latent reservoir is typically about one in one million, far lower than other infectious disease biomarkers. To study reliability of these assays, we distributed 75 PBMC samples from five ART-suppressed HIV-infected participants among four labs, each conducting QVOA and following prespecified sample batching procedures. Using a Bayesian statistical method, we analyzed detailed assay output to understand how results varied within batches, between batches, and between labs. We found that, if batch variation can be controlled (i.e., a lab assays all samples in one batch), typical assay results are expected to differ from the true value by a factor of 1.6 to 1.9 up or down. We also found that freezing, storing, and thawing samples for later analysis caused no more than a 2-fold change in results. These outcomes, and the statistical methods developed to obtain them, should lead towards more precise and powerful assessments of HIV cure strategies.",

    "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is responsible for millions of infections annually. Due to the few available anti-fungal drugs and the increasing incidence of drug resistance, the number of C. albicans infections is dramatically increasing. Morphological switches, such as the white-opaque switch and the yeast-hyphae switch, are key for the development of C. albicans pathogenic traits. Lysine deacetylases are emerging as important regulators of morphological switches. Yet, targeting lysine deacetylases for drug development is problematic due to the high homology between the fungal and human proteins that could result in toxicity. Here we provide evidence that the fungal specific proteins Hda2 and Hda3 interact with the lysine deacetylase Hda1. By combining phenotypic analyses with genome-wide transcriptome analyses, we demonstrate that Hda2 and Hda3 control C. albicans morphological switches. Under nutrient-rich conditions, deletion of HDA2 or HDA3 leads to moderate overexpression of the master regulator of white-opaque switching WOR1 and increase switching frequency. Under hyphae inducing conditions, deletion of HDA2 and HDA3 block hyphae development. However, deletion of HDA2 and HDA3 does not affect hyphae-formation and virulence in vivo. We propose that Hda2 and Hda3 are good targets for the development of anti-fungal drugs to be used in combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "The focus of present study was to isolate and characterize bacteria which can be effectively used for toluene, a highly recalcitrant pollutant, bioremediation. For isolation of bacteria from the tannery effluents selective enrichment and serial dilution methods were employed. The isolated bacteria were subjected to growth curve analysis, estimation of toluene removal efficiencies, biochemical tests, antibiotic sensitivity assays and molecular characterization based upon 16S rRNA gene. The rRNA genes sequences were analyzed through BLAST to determine similarity index of isolates with bacterial database sequences. To trace the evolutionary history, phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA version 7. Total twenty toluene metabolizing bacteria (IUBT1-2, 4-12, 16, 19, 21, 23-26, 28 and 30) were isolated and characterized. Their rRNA gene sequences have been submitted to Genbank. Fifteen of the twenty isolates showed homology to Brevibacillus agri strain NBRC 15538, four found similar to Bacillus paralicheniformis strain KJ-16 and one homologous to Burkholderia lata strain 383. All bacterial isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol but sensitive to teicoplanin and linezolid. However, few (i. e.; IUBT9 and 26) were sensitive to oxacillin. Biochemical characterization indicated all bacteria positive for alkaline phosphatases (100%). While many were found positive for p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl {beta}, D-glucosaminidase (35%), hydroxyproline {beta}-naphthylaminopeptidase (15%), esculinase (65%), mannitol (75%), sorbitol (95%) and inulin (90%) fermentation. Biochemical profile suggests the use of isolated bacteria for future exploitation in several fields like bioremediation of toluene, ethanol production, biomass hydrolysis, biosensors, biofertilizers, as a marker for milk pasteurization in dairy industries and evaluation of soil quality.\\n\\nImportanceToluene is a highly toxic environmental pollutant. We have isolated bacteria which can be effectively used for the removal of toluene from environmental resources.

    "abstract": "Conjugative plasmids from the IncHI incompatibility group are relevant vectors for multidrug resistance. In this study, a comparison of the similarities and differences in the 44 publicly available sequences of IncHI plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae (1961-2013), revealed extensive conservation of their coding sequences. However, each genome had accessory regions with features of degradation or resistance to antibacterial agents. This article elucidates the IncHI1, IncHI2 and IncHI3 subgroup plasmids from the evolutive line based on multiple drug-resistant modules, explains the origin of the IncHI1 pAKU1-like composite transposon lineage, typifies the subgroup IncHI3, which is distantly related to IncHI1 and IncHI2 in phylogenetic analyses, confirms the relations within the transfer regions of H-group plasmids, and points to the divergence time of evolution with phylogenetic trees. Homology between subgroups, as measured by the molecular clock test, indicated that the contemporary IncHI1 and IncHI2 transfer region lineages diverged from an ancestral clone approximately 8,000 years ago (17,000 years ago if the divergent IncHI3 plasmids are included), although the IncH backbone was older. The uniformity of the composite transposon shared by most IncHI1 subgroup plasmids might be functionally equivalent to the heavy metal resistance that is mediated by some operons in the IncHI2 subgroup plasmids. A comparison of the DNA among these closely related plasmids provided insights on the horizontal and vertical transfers that were involved in their development.",

    "abstract": "Variant interpretation in the era of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is challenging. While many resources and guidelines are available to assist with this task, few integrated end-to-end tools exist. Here we present \\\"PeCanPIE\\\" - the Pediatric Cancer Variant Pathogenicity Information Exchange, a web- and cloud-based platform for annotation, identification, and classification of variations in known or putative disease genes. Starting from a set of variants in Variant Call Format (VCF), variants are annotated, ranked by putative pathogenicity, and presented for formal classification using a decision-support interface based on published guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The system can accept files containing millions of variants and handle single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), simple insertions/deletions (indels), multiple-nucleotide variants (MNVs), and complex substitutions. PeCanPIE has been applied to classify variant pathogenicity in cancer predisposition genes in two large-scale investigations involving >4,000 pediatric cancer patients, and serves as a repository for the expert-reviewed results. While PeCanPIEs web-based interface was designed to be accessible to non-bioinformaticians, its back end pipelines may also be run independently on the cloud, facilitating direct integration and broader adoption. PeCanPIE is publicly available and free for research use.",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies of non-communicable diseases identify multimorbidities that reflect our relatively limited fixed metabolic capacity. Despite the fact that we have [~]24000 genes, we do not understand the genetic pathways that contribute to the development of multimorbid non-communicable disease. We created a \\\"multimorbidity atlas\\\" of traits based on pleiotropy of spatially regulated genes using convex biclustering. Using chromatin interaction and expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) data, we analysed 20,782 variants (p < 5 x 10-6) associated with 1,351 phenotypes, to identify 16,248 putative eQTL-eGene pairs that are involved in 76,013 short- and long-range regulatory interactions (FDR < 0.05) in different human tissues. Convex biclustering of eGenes that are shared between phenotypes identified complex inter-relationships between nominally different phenotype associated SNPs. Notably, the loci at the centre of these inter-relationships were subject to complex tissue and disease specific regulatory effects. The largest cluster, 40 phenotypes that are related to fat and lipid metabolism, inflammatory disorders, and cancers, is centred on the FADS1-FADS3 locus (chromosome 11). Our novel approach enables the simultaneous elucidation of variant interactions with genes that are drivers of multimorbidity and those that contribute to unique phenotype associated characteristics.",

Here, we show experimentally and computationally that the ensemble fluctuations of RNA helices substantially impact RNA tertiary structure stability. We updated a model for the conformational ensemble of the RNA helix using crystallographic structures of Watson-Crick base pair steps. To test this model, we made blind predictions of the thermodynamic stability of >1500 tertiary assemblies with differing helical sequences and compared calculations to independent measurements from a high-throughput experimental platform. The blind predictions accounted for thermodynamic effects from changing helix sequence and length with unexpectedly tight accuracies (RMSD of 0.34 and 0.77 kcal/mol, respectively). These comparisons lead to a detailed picture of how RNA base pair steps fluctuate within complex assemblies and suggest a new route toward predicting RNA tertiary structure formation and energetics.",

    "abstract": "mTORC1 is a central signal hub that integrates multiple environmental cues, such as cellular stresses, energy levels, nutrients and certain amino acids, to modulate metabolic status and cellular responses. Recently, SLC38A9, a lysosomal amino acid transporter, has emerged as a sensor for luminal arginine levels and as an activator of mTOCRC1. The activation of mTORC1 occurs through the N-terminal domain of SLC38A9. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SLC38A9 and surprisingly found its N-terminal fragment inserted deep into the transporter, bound in the substrate binding pocket where normally arginine would bind. Compared with our recent arginine bound structure of SLC38A9, a significant conformational change of the N-terminal domain was observed. A ball-and-chain model is proposed for mTORC1 activation where in the starved state the N-terminal domain of SLC38A9 is buried deep in the transporter but in the fed state the N-terminal domain could be released becoming free to bind the Rag GTPase complex and to activate mTORC1. This work provides important new insights into how SLC38A9 senses the fed state and activates the mTORC1 pathways in response to dietary amino acids.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryN-plug inserted state of SLC38A9 reveals mechanisms of mTORC1 activation and arginine-enhanced luminal amino acids efflux.",

    "abstract": "Natural populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have been used extensively as a model system to investigate the effect of neutral and selective processes on genetic variation. The species expanded outside its Afrotropical ancestral range during the last glacial period and numerous studies have focused on identifying molecular adaptations associated with the colonization of northern habitats. The sequencing of many genomes from African and non-African natural populations has facilitated the analysis of the interplay between adaptive and demographic processes. However, most of the non-African sequenced material has been sampled from American and Australian populations that have been introduced within the last hundred years following recent human dispersal and are also affected by recent genetic admixture with African populations. Northern European populations, at the contrary, are expected to be older and less affected by complex admixture patterns and are therefore more appropriate to investigate neutral and adaptive processes. Here we present a new dataset consisting of 14 fully sequenced haploid genomes sampled from a natural population in Ume[a], Sweden. We co-analyzed this new data with an African population to compare the likelihood of several competing demographic scenarios for European and African populations. We show that allowing for gene flow between populations in neutral demographic models leads to a significantly better fit to the data and strongly affects estimates of the divergence time and of the size of the bottleneck in the European population. Our results indicate that the time of divergence between cosmopolitan and ancestral populations is 30,000 years older than reported by previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are increasing in the health care setting, and there are few antimicrobial agents available to treat infections caused by these bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen in burn patients and individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), and a leading cause of nosocomial infections. P. aeruginosa is inherently resistant to many antibiotics and can develop or acquire resistance to others, limiting options for treatment. P. aeruginosa has virulence factors that are regulated by sigma factors in response to the tissue microenvironment. The alternative sigma factor, RpoN ({sigma}54), regulates many virulence genes and is linked to antibiotic resistance. Recently, we described a cis-acting peptide, RpoN*, which acts as a \\\"molecular roadblock\\\", binding RpoN consensus promoters at the -24 site and blocking transcription. RpoN* reduces virulence of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains both in vitro and in vivo, but its effects in clinical isolates was not known. We investigated the effects of RpoN* on phenotypically varied P. aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. RpoN* expression reduced motility, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis in a P. aeruginosa - C. elegans infection model. RpoN* expression increased susceptibility to several beta-lactam based antibiotics in the lab strain P. aeruginosa PA19660 Xen5. Here, we show that using a cis-acting peptide to block RpoN consensus promoters has potential clinical implications in reducing virulence and enhancing the activity of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations play a crucial role in communication between remote brain areas. Transcranial electric stimulation with alternating currents (TACS) can manipulate these brain oscillations in a non-invasive manner. Of particular interest, TACS protocols using multiple electrodes with phase shifted stimulation currents were developed to alter the connectivity between two or more brain regions. Typically, an increase in coordination between two sites is assumed when they experience an in-phase stimulation and a disorganization through an anti-phase stimulation. However, the underlying biophysics of multi-electrode TACS has not been studied in detail, thus limiting our ability to develop a mechanistic understanding. Here, we leverage direct invasive recordings from two non-human primates during multi-electrode TACS to show that the electric field magnitude and phase depend on the phase of the stimulation currents in a non-linear manner. Further, we report a novel phenomenon of a \\\"traveling wave\\\" stimulation where the location of the electric field maximum changes over the stimulation cycle. Our results provide a basis for a mechanistic understanding of multi-electrode TACS, necessitating the reevaluation of previously published studies, and enable future developments of novel stimulation protocols.",

This semi-analytic method exploits the tractability of GP regression when the membrane potential is observed. The resulting posterior is then marginalized analytically in order to obtain the posterior of the response functions given the spike sequences alone.

The technique combines prior knowledge of the wingspan of the bird with a camera calibration procedure that needs to be used only once in the lifetime of the system. The system delivers the exact 3D coordinates of the position of the bird at the time of every full wing extension and uses interpolated height estimates to compute the 3D positions of the bird in the video frames between successive wing extensions.

We previously developed MethylMix, a model-based algorithmic approach to identify epigenetically regulated driver genes. MethylMix identifies genes where methylation likely executes a functional role by using transcriptomic data to select only methylation events that can be linked to changes in gene expression. However, given that proteins more closely link genotype to phenotype recent high-throughput proteomic data provides an opportunity to more accurately identify functionally relevant abnormal methylation events. Here we present ProteoMix, which refines nominations for epigenetic driver genes by leveraging quantitative high-throughput proteomic data to select only genes where DNA methylation is predictive of protein abundance. Applying our algorithm across three cancer cohorts we find that ProteoMix narrows candidate nominations, where the effect of DNA methylation is often buffered at the protein level. Next, we find that ProteoMix genes are enriched for biological processes involved in cancer including functions involved in epithelial and mesenchymal transition. ProteoMix results are also enriched for tumor markers which are predictive of clinical features like tumor stage and we find clustering on ProteoMix genes captures cancer subtypes.",

    "abstract": "A dendritic spine is a small structure on the dendrites of a neuron that processes input timing information from other neurons. Tens of thousands of spines are present on a neuron. Why are spines so small and many? Because of the small number of molecules in the spine volume, biochemical reactions become stochastic. Therefore, we used the stochastic simulation model of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated Ca2+ increase to address this issue. NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ increase codes the input timing information between prespiking and postspiking. We examined how much the input timing information is encoded by Ca2+ increase against prespiking fluctuation. We found that the input timing information encoded in the spine volume (10-1 m3) is more robust against prespiking fluctuation than that in the cell volume (103 m3). We further examined the mechanism of the robust information transfer in the spine volume. We demonstrated that the necessary and sufficient condition for robustness is that the stochastic NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ increase (intrinsic noise) becomes much larger than the prespiking fluctuation (extrinsic noise). The condition is satisfied in the spine volume, but not in the cell volume. Moreover, we compared the information transfer in many small \\\"spine-volume\\\" spines with that in a single large \\\"cell-volume\\\" spine. We found that many small \\\"spine-volume\\\" spines is much more efficient for information transfer than a single large \\\"cell-volume\\\" spine when prespiking fluctuation is large. Thus, robustness and efficiency are two functional reasons why dendritic spines are so small and many.\\n\\nSignificanceA dendritic spine is a small platform for information processing in a neuron, and tens of thousands of spines are present on a neuron.

    "abstract": "The endothelial to haematopoietic transition (EHT) is the process whereby haemogenic endothelium differentiates into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The intermediary steps of this process are unclear, in particular the identity of endothelial cells that give rise to HSPCs is unknown. Using single-cell transcriptome analysis and antibody screening we identified CD44 as a new marker of EHT enabling us to isolate robustly the different stages of EHT in the aorta gonad mesonephros (AGM) region. This allowed us to provide a very detailed phenotypical and transcriptional profile for haemogenic endothelial cells, characterising them with high expression of genes related to Notch signalling, TGFbeta/BMP antagonists (Smad6, Smad7 and Bmper) and a downregulation of genes related to glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Moreover, we demonstrated that by inhibiting the interaction between CD44 and its ligand hyaluronan we could block EHT, identifying a new regulator of HSPC development.",

    "abstract": "Balamuthia mandrillaris is a pathogenic free-living amoeba that causes a rare but almost always fatal infection of the central nervous system called granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). Two distinct forms of B. mandrillaris - a proliferative trophozoite form and a non-proliferative cyst form, which is highly resistant to harsh physical and chemical conditions - have been isolated from environmental samples worldwide and are both observed in infected tissue. Patients suffering from GAE are typically treated with aggressive and prolonged multi-drug regimens often including the antimicrobial agents miltefosine and pentamidine isethionate. However, survival rates remain low and studies evaluating the susceptibility of B. mandrillaris to these compounds and other potential therapeutics are limited. To address the need for more effective treatments, we screened 2,177 clinically-approved compounds for in vitro activity against B. mandrillaris. The quinoline antibiotic nitroxoline, which has safely been used in humans to treat urinary tract infections, was identified as a lead compound. We show that nitroxoline inhibits both trophozoites and cysts at low micromolar concentrations, which are within a physiologically relevant range. We compare the in vitro efficacy of nitroxoline to drugs currently used in the standard of care for GAE and find that nitroxoline is the most potent and selective inhibitor of B. mandrillaris tested. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nitroxoline prevents B. mandrillaris-mediated destruction of host cells in cultured fibroblast and primary brain explant models also at physiologically relevant concentrations. Together, our findings indicate that nitroxoline is a promising candidate for repurposing as a novel treatment of B. mandrillaris infections.\\n\\nImportanceBalamuthia mandrillaris is responsible for hundreds of reported cases of amoebic encephalitis, the majority of which have been fatal. Despite being an exceptionally deadly pathogen, B. mandrillaris is understudied, leaving many open questions regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Due to the lack of effective drugs to fight B. mandrillaris infections, mortality rates remain high even for patients receiving intensive care. This study addresses the need for new anti-amoebic drugs using a high-throughput screening approach to identify novel B. mandrillaris inhibitors. The most promising candidate identified was the quinoline antibiotic nitroxoline, which has a long history of safe use in humans. We show that nitroxoline kills B. mandrillaris at physiologically relevant concentrations and exhibits greater potency and selectivity than drugs commonly used in the current standard of care. The findings we present demonstrate the potential of nitroxoline to be an important new tool in the treatment of life threatening B. mandrillaris infections.",

    "abstract": "The microbial ecology of oligotrophic deep ocean sediments is understudied relative to their shallow counterparts, and this lack of understanding hampers our ability to predict responses to current and future perturbations. The Gulf of Mexico has experienced two of the largest accidental marine oil spills, the 1979 Ixtoc-1 blowout and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) discharge. Here, microbial communities were characterized for 29 sites across multiple years in >700 samples. The composition of the seafloor microbiome was broadly consistent across the region and was well approximated by the overlying water depth and depth within the sediment column, while geographic distance played a limited role. Biogeographical distributions were employed to generate predictive models for over 4000 OTU that leverage easy-to-obtain geospatial variables which are linked to measured sedimentary oxygen profiles. Depth stratification and putative niche diversification are evidenced by the distribution of taxa that mediate the microbial nitrogen cycle. Further, these results demonstrate that sediments impacted by the DWH spill had returned to near baseline conditions after two years. The distributions of benthic microorganisms in the Gulf can be constrained, and moreover deviations from these predictions may pinpoint impacted sites and aid in future response efforts or long-term stability studies.",

In the study, monobutyrate (MB), monolaurate (ML), monomyristate (MM) were selected to represent the short, medium, and long chain monoglycerides to compare their inhibitory effect against Escherichia coli, and a new dose-dependent inhibitory mechanism was proposed by the key lethal effect. The minimal inhibitory concentration and antibacterial curve showed a huge diversity existed in biology activity of MB, ML and MM. The results in scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry assay indicated that the interference level of MB on cell membrane was obviously weaker than that of ML and MM, while the latter two had similar performance in increasing cell permeability at low doses. The results presented in UV-Vis spectroscopy, cell cycle and biomacromolecules synthesis inhibition assay showed that the cell cycle of Escherichia coli was obviously affected by three monoglycerides at doses near MIC, which was therefore regarded as the key lethal effect. The reason for the better biological activity of MM than ML was the stronger interference ability on bacterial cell cycle. In addition, an expanded antibacterial mode was raised that cell permeability increase at low doses was antimicrobial basis, cell cycle arrest at medium doses played the key lethal effect, and cell lysis at high doses was the result of combined action.",

    "abstract": "Imbalances of the microbiome also referred to as microbial dysbiosis, could lead to a series of different diseases. One factor that has been shown to lead to dysbiosis of the microbiome is exposure to psychological stressors. Throughout evolution microorganisms of the human microbiome have developed systems for sensing host-associated signals such as hormones associated with those stressors, enabling them to recognize essential changes in its environment thus changing its expression gene profile to fit the needs of the new environment. The most widely accepted theory explaining the ability of hormones to affect the outcome of an infection involves the suppression of the immune system. Commensal microbiota is involved in stressor-induced immunomodulation, but other biological effects are not yet known. Here we present the impact that cortisol had on the community-wide transcriptome of the oral community. We used a metatranscriptomic approach to obtain first insights into the metabolic changes induced by this stress hormone as well as which members of the oral microbiome respond to the presence of cortisol in the environment. Our findings show that the stress hormone cortisol directly induces shifts in the gene expression profiles of the oral microbiome that reproduce results found in the profiles of expression of periodontal disease and its progression.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill patients have a high risk of sepsis. Various studies have demonstrated that propofol has anti-inflammatory effects that may benefit critically ill patients who require anesthesia. However, the mechanism and therapeutic effect remain incompletely understood. Our previous data suggest that propofol can act as a formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) antagonist. Here, we hypothesize that propofol mitigates sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) by inhibiting mitochondria-derived N-formyl peptide-mediated neutrophil activation. In human neutrophils, propofol competitively reduced the release of elastase, superoxide, and reactive oxygen species induced by fMMYALF, a human mitochondria-derived N-formyl peptide. In addition, propofol significantly inhibited fMMYALF-induced chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, and phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinases. These results indicate that propofol suppresses neutrophil activation by blocking the interaction between endogenous N-formyl peptide and its receptor, FPR1, thus inhibiting downstream signaling. Furthermore, propofol alleviated alveolar wall disruption, edematous changes, and neutrophil infiltration in lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI in mice. Noticeably, propofol improved the survival of sepsis mice. This study indicates that the anti-neutrophil effects of propofol may benefit critically ill septic patients.",

In order to predict the plant acclimation to future climate changes, we attempted to understand which factors underlie photosynthetic stress acclimation.\\n\\nStress acclimation to three major long-term abiotic stresses (drought, salinity and temperature) was investigated by measuring growth, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf structure. We developed a stress index that allowed to precisely define stress level, enabling a comparison between stress types. For each stress, photosynthesis-limiting factors were compared: stomatal conductance (gs), mesophyll conductance (gm) and maximum capacity for Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax).\\n\\nPhotosynthesis under all stresses was limited mostly by gs and gm (80-90%); whereas biochemistry (Vcmax) made a minor contribution (10-20%). The relative contribution of gs and gm on photosynthetic limitation was influenced by stress type. During acclimation to drought or salinity, photosynthesis was limited by a decline in gs, while intolerance to low temperatures was driven by decline in gm. Low mesophyll-imposed limitation was the best predictor of abiotic stress tolerance.\\n\\nThe results demonstrate how warming climate benefits thermophilic species. Moreover, current work gives methodology for stress studies, and defines the main factors underlying the plant response to climate change.\\n\\nHighlightWe have compared the photosynthesis limitation resulting from long-term acclimation to three major a-biotic stresses (drought, salinity and temperature) to understand which limiting-factor are dominant under each type of stress.",
