    "abstract": "MotivationAccurately clustering cell types from a mass of heterogeneous cells is a crucial first step for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Although several methods have been recently developed, they utilize different characteristics of data and yield varying results in terms of both the number of clusters and actual cluster assignments.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present SAFE-clustering, Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) clustering, a flexible, accurate and robust method for clustering scRNA-Seq data. SAFE-clustering takes as input, results from multiple clustering methods, to build one consensus solution. SAFE-clustering currently embeds four state-of-the-art methods, SC3, CIDR, Seurat and t-SNE + k-means; and ensembles solutions from these four methods using three hypergraph-based partitioning algorithms. Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32,695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.9 - 50.0% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 28.9% improvement, and up to 34.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking <10 minutes to process 28,733 cells.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationSAFE-clustering, including source codes and tutorial, is free available on the web at http://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/safe/.\\n\\nContactyunli@med.unc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssessment of sleep/wake by electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) is invasive, resource intensive, and not amenable to rapid screening at scale for drug discovery. In the preclinical development of therapeutics for narcolepsy, efficacy tests are hindered by the lack of a non-EEG/EMG based translational test of symptom severity. The current methods study offers proof-of-principle that PiezoSleep (noninvasive, unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring of gross body movement, together with respiration patterns during behavioral quiescence), can be used to determine sleep/wake as applicable to the development of wake-promoting therapeutics. First, the translational wake-maintenance score (WMS, the ratio of time during the first half of the dark period spent in long wake bouts to short sleep bouts) of the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen was introduced as a means by which to rank narcoleptic orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type mice by sleep/wake fragmentation severity. Accuracy of the WMS to detect narcoleptic phenotypes were determined in genotype-confirmed orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type colony mates. The WMS was used to identify the most highly symptomatic mice for resource-intensive EEG/EMG studies for further analysis of specific arousal states. Second, PiezoSleep was demonstrated for use in high-throughput screening of wake-promoting compounds using modafinil in orexin/ataxin-3 and wild type mice.\\n\\nResultsThe WMS detected a narcoleptic phenotype with 89% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 98% positive predictive value. A 15-fold difference in WMS differentiated wild type littermates from the most severely affected orexin/ataxin-3 mice. Follow-up EEG/EMG study indicated 82% of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice with the lowest wake-maintenance scores met or exceeded the cataplexy-occurrence threshold ([&ge;] 3 bouts) for inclusion in therapeutic efficacy studies. In the PiezoSleep dose-response study, the ED50 for wake-promotion by modafinil was approximately 50 mg/kg in both genotypes. Using unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring, the efficacy of wake-promoting compounds can be determined in a 5-arm study with 60 mice in less than one week--a fraction of the time compared to EEG/EMG studies.\\n\\nConclusionsThe WMS on the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen quantifies the inability to sustain wakefulness and provides an accurate measure of the narcoleptic phenotype in mice. PiezoSleep offers rapid, scalable assessment of sleep/wake for high-throughput screening in drug discovery.",

In order to obtain high HDR percentages in mammalian cells, we engineered Cas9 protein fused to a high-affinity monoavidin domain to deliver biotinylated donor DNA to a DSB site. In addition, we used the cationic polymer, polyethylenimine, to deliver Cas9 RNP-donor DNA complex into the cell. Combining these strategies improved HDR percentages of up to 90% in three tested loci (CXCR4, EMX1, and TLR) in standard HEK293 cells.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genome editing have greatly improved knock-in (KI) efficiency1-9. Searching for factors to further improve KI efficiency for therapeutic use and generation of non-human primate (NHP) models, we found that the strand exchange protein RAD51 can significantly increase homozygous KI using CRISPR/Cas9 in mouse embryos through an interhomolog repair (IHR) mechanism. IHR is well-described in the context of meiosis10, but only occurs at low frequencies in mitotic cells11,12 and its existence in zygotes is controversial. Using a variety of approaches, we provide evidence for an endogenous IHR mechanism in zygotes that can be enhanced by RAD51. We show that this process can be harnessed for generating homozygous KI animals from wildtype zygotes based on exogenous donors and for converting heterozygous alleles into homozygous alleles without exogenous templates. Furthermore, we elucidate additional factors that contribute to zygotic IHR and identify a RAD51 mutant capable of insertion-deletion (indel)-free stimulation of IHR. Thus, our study provides conclusive evidence for the existence of zygotic IHR and demonstrates methods to enhance IHR for potential use in gene drives, gene therapy, and biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Control of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation at human mucosal surfaces is critical to reducing the burden of pneumonia and invasive disease, interrupting onward transmission, and in achieving herd protection. We hypothesised that the pattern of pneumococcal-epithelial engagement dictates the inflammatory response to colonisation, and that this epithelial sensing is linked to bacterial clearance. Here we have used nasal curette biopsies from a serotype 6B Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage Model (EHPC) to visualize S. pneumoniae colonisation and relate these interactions to epithelial surface marker expression and transcriptomic profile upregulation. We have used a Detroit 562 cell co-culture model to further understand these processes and develop an integrated epithelial transcriptomic module to interrogate gene expression in the EHPC model. We have shown for the first time that pneumococcal colonisation in humans is characterised by microcolony formation at the epithelial surface, microinvasion, cell junction protein association, epithelial sensing, and both epithelial endocytosis and paracellular transmigration. Comparisons with other clinical strains in vitro has revealed that the degree of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell surface marker expression (ICAM-1 and CD107), cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8 and ICAM-1) and the transcriptomic response. In the context of retained barrier function, epithelial microinvasion is associated with the upregulation of a wide range of epithelial innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes. The prominence of epithelial TLR4R signalling pathways implicates pneumolysin, a key virulence factor, but although pneumolysin gene deletion partially ameliorates the inflammatory transcriptional response in vitro, critical inflammatory pathways persist in association with enhanced epithelial adhesion and microinvasion. Importantly, the pattern of the host-bacterial interaction seen with the 6B strain in vitro is also reflected in the EHPC model, with evidence of microinvasion and a relatively silent epithelial transcriptomic profile that becomes most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance. Together these data suggest that epithelial sensing of the pneumococcus during colonisation in humans is enhanced by microinvasion, resulting in innate epithelial responses that are associated with bacterial clearance.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nO_LIColonisation of the human mucosa by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with microcolony formation, microinvasion, epithelial sensing and an epithelial innate response.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing adherence to the epithelial cell surface, microinvasion of the epithelium may occur by endocytosis and/or lateral migration between cells without necessarily compromising barrier integrity.\\nC_LIO_LIThe pattern of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell response through a range of innate signaling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes.\\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial sensing is triggered by, but not wholly dependent on pneumolysin, a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae.\\nC_LI",

Current predictors for peptide:MHC-II binding are trained on binding affinity data, generated in-vitro and therefore lacking information about antigen processing. For the first time, we here describe prediction models of peptide:MHC-II binding trained directly on naturally eluted peptides, and show that these, in addition to peptide binding to the MHC, incorporate identifiable rules of antigen processing. In fact, we observed detectable signals of protease cleavage at defined positions of the peptides. We also hypothesize a role of the length of the terminal ligand protrusions for trimming the peptide to the epitope presented. The results of integrating binding affinity and eluted ligand data in a combined model demonstrate improved performance for the prediction of MHC-II ligands, and foreshadow a new generation of improved peptide:MHC-II prediction tools of considerable importance for understanding and manipulating immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Performing quality control to detect image artifacts and data-processing errors is crucial in structural magnetic resonance imaging, especially in developmental studies. Currently, many studies rely on visual inspection by trained raters for quality control. The subjectivity of these manual procedures lessens comparability between studies, and with growing study sizes quality control is increasingly time consuming. In addition, both inter-rater as well as intra-rater variability of manual quality control is high and may lead to inclusion of poor quality scans and exclusion of scans of usable quality. In the current study we present the Qoala-T tool, which is an easy and free to use supervised-learning model to reduce rater bias and misclassification in manual quality control procedures. First, we manually rated quality of N = 784 FreeSurfer-processed T1-weighted scans. Different supervised-learning models were then compared to predict manual quality ratings. Results show that the Qoala-T tool using random forests is able to predict scan quality with both high sensitivity and specificity (mean area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). In addition, the Qoala-T tool was also able to adequately predict the quality of a novel unseen dataset (N = 112; mean AUC = 0.95). These outcomes indicate that using Qoala-T in other datasets could greatly reduce the time needed for quality control. More importantly, this procedure could further help to reduce variability related to manual quality control, thereby benefiting the comparability of data quality between studies.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on sequential detection and localization of individual molecular blinking events. Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLMs temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscopes point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

GALNTs are activated by trafficking from Golgi to ER, a process driven by the Src kinase and negatively regulated by ERK8. This GALNTs activation (aka GALA) pathway induces high Tn levels and is a key driver of liver tumor growth. Recently, Tabak and colleagues have contested our previous data that EGF stimulation can induce GALNTs relocation. Here, we show that relocation induced by EGF is actually detectable in the images acquired by Tabak et al. Furthermore, we show that expression of EGFR enhances relocation and appears required to drive relocation induced by ERK8 depletion. We also propose that quantification of O-glycosylation of the ER resident protein PDIA4 provides an alternative measure of GALA. In sum, we demonstrate that non-reproducibility was due to experimental errors, that EGFR is indeed a driver of GALA and propose additional markers to facilitate the study of this pathway.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is a major concern for malaria vector control, because these are the compounds used in almost all insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITNs), and are also widely used for indoor residual spraying (IRS). Pyrethroids target the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), an essential component of the mosquito nervous system, but substitutions in the amino acid sequence can disrupt the activity of these insecticides, inducing a resistance phenotype. Here we use Illumina whole-genome sequence data from phase 1 of the Anopheles gambiae 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G) to provide a comprehensive account of genetic variation in the Vgsc gene in mosquito populations from eight African countries. In addition to the three known resistance alleles, we describe 20 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions at appreciable frequency in one or more populations that are previously unknown in Anopheles mosquitoes. Thirteen of these novel alleles were found to occur almost exclusively on haplotypes carrying the known L995F resistance allele (L1014F in Musca domesticus codon numbering), and may enhance or compensate for the L995F resistance pheno-type. A novel mutation I1527T, which is adjacent to a predicted pyrethroid binding site, was found in tight linkage with either of two alleles causing a V402L substitution, similar to a combination of substitutions found to cause pyrethroid resistance in several other insect species. We analyse the genetic backgrounds on which non-synonymous alleles are found, to determine which alleles have experienced recent positive selection, and to refine our understanding of the spread of resistance between species and geographical locations. We describe twelve distinct haplotype groups with evidence of recent positive selection, five of which carry the known L995F resistance allele, five of which carry the known L995S resistance allele, one of which carries the novel I1527T allele, and one of which carries a novel M490I allele. Seven of these groups are localised to a single geographical location, and five comprise haplotypes from different countries, in one case separated by over 3000 km, providing new information about the geographical distribution and spread of resistance. We also find evidence for multiple introgression events transmitting resistance alleles between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. We identify markers that could be used to design high-throughput, low-cost genetic assays for improved surveillance of pyrethroid resistance in the field. Our results demonstrate that the molecular basis of target-site pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors is more complex than previously appreciated, and provide a foundation for the development of new genetic tools to track the spread insecticide resistance and improve the design of strategies for insecticide resistance management.",

Constraints exerted by nutrient limitation or nutrient imbalance can influence the maximal value that fitness components such as reproduction and lifespan attains, and organisms may shift how resources are allocated to different structures and functions in response to changes in nutrition. Whether the phenotypic changes associated with changes in nutrition represent an adaptive response is largely unknown. Further, it is unclear whether the response of fitness components to diet even has the potential to evolve in most systems. In this study, we use an admixed multiparental population of Drosophila melanogaster reared in three different diet conditions to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for lifespan and fecundity. We find significant genetic variation for both traits in our population and show that lifespan has moderate to high heritabilities within diets. Genetic correlations for lifespan between diets were significantly less than one, demonstrating a strong genotype by diet interaction. These findings demonstrate substantial standing genetic variation in our population that is comparable to natural populations and highlights the potential for adaptation to changing nutritional environments.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive processes, such as the generation of language, can be mapped onto the brain using fMRI. These maps can in turn be used for decoding the respective processes from the brain activation patterns. Given individual variations in brain anatomy and organization, analyzes on the level of the single person are important to improve our understanding of how cognitive processes correspond to patterns of brain activity. They also allow to advance clinical applications of fMRI, because in the clinical setting making diagnoses for single cases is imperative. In the present study, we used mental imagery tasks to investigate language production, motor functions, visuo-spatial memory, face processing, and resting-state activity in a single person. Analysis methods were based on similarity metrics, including correlations between training and test data, as well as correlations with maps from the NeuroSynth meta-analysis. The goal was to make accurate predictions regarding the cognitive domain (e.g. language) and the specific content (e.g. animal names) of single 30-second blocks. Four teams used the dataset, each blinded regarding the true labels of the test data. Results showed that the similarity metrics allowed to reach the highest degrees of accuracy when predicting the cognitive domain of a block. Overall, 23 of the 25 test blocks could be correctly predicted by three of the four teams. Excluding the unspecific rest condition, up to 10 out of 20 blocks could be successfully decoded regarding their specific content. The study shows how the information contained in a single fMRI session and in each of its single blocks can allow to draw inferences about the cognitive processes an individual engaged in. Simple methods like correlations between blocks of fMRI data can serve as highly reliable approaches for cognitive decoding. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of clinical fMRI applications, with a focus on how decoding can support functional localization.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing has yet been reported in parasitic or indeed any species of the phylum Platyhelminthes. We tested this approach by targeting omega-1 ({omega}1) of Schistosoma mansoni as a proof of principle. This secreted ribonuclease is crucial for Th2 priming and granuloma formation, providing informative immuno-pathological readouts for programmed genome editing. Schistosome eggs were either exposed to Cas9 complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) complementary to exon 6 of {omega}1 by electroporation or transduced with pseudotyped lentivirus encoding Cas9 and the sgRNA. Some eggs were also transduced with a single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor transgene that encoded six stop codons, flanked by 50 nt-long 5-and 3-microhomology arms matching the predicted Cas9-catalyzed double stranded break (DSB) within {omega}1. CRISPResso analysis of amplicons spanning the DSB revealed [~]4.5% of the reads were mutated by insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, with an efficiency for homology directed repair of 0.19% insertion of the donor transgene. Transcripts encoding {omega}1 were reduced >80% and lysates of {omega}1-edited eggs displayed diminished ribonuclease activity indicative that programmed editing mutated the {omega}1 gene. Whereas lysates of wild type eggs polarized Th2 cytokine responses including IL-4 and IL-5 in human macrophage/T cell co-cultures, diminished levels of the cytokines followed the exposure to lysates of {omega}1-mutated schistosome eggs. Following injection of schistosome eggs into the tail vein of mice, the volume of pulmonary granulomas surrounding {omega}1-mutated eggs was 18-fold smaller than wild type eggs. Programmed genome editing was active in schistosomes, Cas9-catalyzed chromosomal breakage was repaired by homology directed repair and/or non-homologous end joining, and mutation of {omega}1 impeded the capacity of schistosome eggs both to drive Th2 polarization and to provoke formation of pulmonary circumoval granulomas. Knock-out of {omega}1 and the impaired immunological phenotype showcase the novel application of programmed gene editing in and functional genomics for schistosomes.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of interictal spikes in EEG may provide insight on epilepsy disease burden, but manual quantification of spikes is time-consuming and subject to bias. We present a probability-based, automated method for the classification and quantification of interictal events, using EEG data from kainate- and saline-injected mice (C57BL/6J background) several weeks post-treatment. We first detected high-amplitude events, then projected event waveforms into Principal Components space and identified clusters of spike morphologies using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We calculated the odds-ratio of events from kainate-versus saline-treated mice within each cluster, converted these values to probability scores, P(kainate), and calculated an Hourly Epilepsy Index for each animal by summing the probabilities for events where the cluster P(kainate) > 0.5 and dividing the resultant sum by the record duration. This Index is predictive of whether an animal received an epileptogenic treatment (i.e., kainate), even if a seizure was never observed. We applied this method to an out-of-sample dataset to assess epileptiform spike morphologies in five kainate mice monitored for ~1 month. The magnitude of the Index increased over time in a subset of animals and revealed changes in the prevalence of epileptiform (P(kainate) > 0.5) spike morphologies. Importantly, in both data sets, animals that had electrographic seizures also had a high Index. This analysis is fast, unbiased, and provides information regarding the salience of spike morphologies for disease progression. Future refinement will allow a better understanding of the definition of interictal spikes in quantitative and unambiguous terms.",

    "abstract": "Polarised targeting of diverse mRNAs to motile cellular protrusions is a hallmark of cell migration1-3. Although a widespread phenomenon, definitive functions for endogenous targeted mRNAs and their relevance to modulation of in-vivo tissue dynamics remain elusive. Here, using single-molecule analysis, endogenous gene-edited mRNAs and zebrafish in-vivo live-cell imaging, we report that mRNA polarisation acts as a molecular compass that orients motile cell polarity and spatially directs tissue movement. Clustering of protrusion-derived RNAseq datasets defined a core 192 bp localisation element underpinning precise mRNA targeting to incipient sites of filopodia formation at cell protrusions. Such targeting of the small GTPase, RAB13, generated tight spatial coupling of mRNA localisation, translation and protein activity, achieving precise subcellular compartmentalisation of RAB13 protein function to create a polarised domain of filopodia extension. Consequently, genomic excision of this localisation element and specific perturbation of endogenous RAB13 targeting - but not translation - depolarised filopodial dynamics in motile endothelial cells and induced miss-patterning of nascent blood vessels in-vivo. Hence, mRNA polarisation, not expression, is the primary spatial determinant of the site of RAB13 action, preventing ectopic functionality at inappropriate subcellular loci and orienting tissue morphogenesis. Considering the unexpected spatial diversity of other polarised mRNA clusters we identified, mRNA-mediated compartmentalisation of protein function at distinct subcellular sites likely coordinates broad aspects of in-vivo tissue behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy by checkpoint blockade proves that an effective immune response to a tumor can be induced clinically. However, little is known about the evolution of tumor-associated T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires without intervention. Here we studied TCR repertoire evolution in mice spontaneously developing mammary tumors; we sequenced peripheral blood alpha and beta TCRs of CD4+CD62L+CD44- T cells monthly for 8 months in 10 FVB/NJ mice transgenic at the Erbb2 locus, all developing tumors; 5 FVB/NJ mice without the transgene were age-matched controls. Sequences were either private (restricted to one mouse) or public (shared among mice); public sequences were either exclusive to the tumor group or inclusive among different groups. We now report that 1), public AA sequences were each encoded by many different nucleotide sequences (NT) recombinations (convergent recombination; CR); 2) mice developing tumors evolved tumor-exclusive public sequences, derived initially from private or from inclusive public sequences; and 3) tumor-exclusive public sequences in mice were also present among published public TCR sequences from human breast cancer patients. These cross-species tumor-exclusive TCR sequences manifested high CR; but the AA sequences shared by mice and humans did not share NT sequences. Thus, tumor-exclusive TCR AA sequences across species are selected from different NT recombination events. The roles of tumor-exclusive TCR repertoires in advancing or inhibiting tumor development and the effects of tumor immunotherapy on these T cells remain to be seen.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex illness that involves the interaction of different brain systems, pathways, and cell types. Past molecular studies of MDD relied on cellular homogenates of post-mortem brain tissue, making it impossible to determine gene expression changes within individual cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we examined almost 80,000 nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with MDD and healthy controls. Our analyses identified 26 distinct cellular clusters, and over 60% of these showed transcriptional differences between groups. Specifically, 96 genes were differentially expressed, the majority of which were downregulated. Convergent evidence from our analyses, including gene expression, differential correlation, and gene ontology implicated dysregulation of synaptic plasticity in the etiopathogenesis of MDD. Our results show that this high-resolution approach can reveal previously undetectable changes in specific cell types in the context of complex phenotypes and heterogeneous tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA previously published pilot study assessed energy expenditure (EE) of participants with overweight and obesity after they were switched from a baseline high-carbohydrate diet (BD) to an isocaloric low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD). EE measured using metabolic chambers increased transiently by what was considered a relatively small extent after the switch to the KD, whereas EE measured using doubly labeled water (EEDLW) increased to a greater degree after the response in the chambers had waned. Using a publicly available dataset, we examined the effect of housing conditions on the magnitude of the increase in EEDLW after the switch to the KD and the role of physical activity in that response.\\n\\nMethodsThe 14-day EEDLW measurement period included 4 days when subjects were confined to chambers instead of living in wards. To determine the effect on EEDLW only for the days subjects were living in the wards, we calculated non-chamber EE (EEnonchamber). To assess the role of physical activity in the response to the KD, we analyzed chamber and non-chamber accelerometer data for the BD and KD EEDLW measurement periods.\\n\\nResultsIn comparison with the increase in average 14-day EEDLW of 151 kcal/d {+/-} 63 (P = 0.03) after the switch to the KD, EEnonchamber increased by 203 {+/-} 89 kcal/d (P = 0.04) or 283 {+/-} 116 kcal/d(P = 0.03) depending on the analytical approach. Hip accelerometer counts decreased significantly (P = 0.01) after the switch to the KD, whereas wrist and ankle accelerometer counts did not change.\\n\\nConclusionsSwitching from the BD to the KD substantially increased EEDLW, but apparently only on days subjects were living in the ward outside the metabolic chamber. Increased physical activity as measured by accelerometry did not appear to account for this effect.",

Among other potential pathogens, we identified one novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, from the blood of a child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, and Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx of a child with rash and sepsis. We also identified two novel human rhinovirus C species.\\n\\nConclusionsThis exploratory pilot study demonstrates the utility of mNGS and the IDseq platform for defining the molecular landscape of febrile infectious diseases in resource limited areas.

Here we apply advanced image analysis to reveal ECM-responsive cell behaviors that drive elongation of the Drosophila follicle, a model 3D system in which basement membrane stiffness instructs tissue morphogenesis. Through in toto morphometric analyses of WT and  round egg mutants, we find that neither changes in average cell shape nor oriented cell division are required for appropriate organ shape. Instead, a major element is a reorientation of elongated cells at the follicle anterior. Polarized reorientation is regulated by mechanical cues from the basement membrane, which are transduced by the Src tyrosine kinase to alter junctional E-cadherin trafficking. This mechanosensitive cellular behavior represents a conserved mechanism that can elongate  edgeless tubular epithelia in a process distinct from those that elongate bounded, planar epithelia.",

However, considerable confusion exists about how to analyse spatially autocorrelated data collected using classical sampling methods (e.g. simple random sampling). We show that the two common discordant views about autocorrelated data depend upon the desired scale of inference. Although inferential statistics seeking to generalise to different unsampled spatial areas need to be adjusted for autocorrelation, if the inference is restricted to the area from which samples have been taken, then standard tests are applicable. In the latter case, incorporating autocorrelation into the model may actually improve the precision and power of the analysis. We found that the scale of spatial inference is rarely discussed, despite being of central importance to any spatial analysis. We suggest that spatial inference should rarely be formally generalised to unsampled areas, since it typically requires some assumption of stationarity, and is thus vulnerable to accusations of \\\"pseudo-replication\\\".",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonads are ubiquitous group of environmental proteobacteria, well known for their roles in biogeochemical cycling, in the breakdown of xenobiotic materials, as plant growth promoters, and as pathogens of a variety of host organisms. We have previously identified a large megaplasmid present within one isolate the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, and here we report that a second member of this megaplasmid family is found within an environmental Pseudomonad isolate most closely related to P. putida. Many of the shared genes are involved in critical cellular processes like replication, transcription, translation, and DNA repair. We argue that presence of these shared pathways sheds new light on discussions about the types of genes that undergo horizontal gene transfer (i.e. the complexity hypothesis) as well as the evolution of pangenomes. Furthermore, although both megaplasmids display a high level of synteny, genes that are shared differ by over 30% on average at the amino acid level. This combination of conservation in gene order despite divergence in gene sequence suggests that this Pseudomonad megaplasmid family is relatively old, that gene order is under strong selection within this family, and that there are likely many more members of this megaplasmid family waiting to be found in nature.",

    "abstract": "Tinnitus and hyperacusis are life-disrupting perceptual abnormalities that are often preceded by acoustic overexposure. Animal models of overexposure have suggested a link between these phenomena and neural hyperactivity, i.e. elevated spontaneous rates (SRs) and sound-evoked responses. Prior work has focused on changes in central auditory responses, with less attention paid to the exact nature of the associated peripheral damage. The demonstration that acoustic overexposure can cause cochlear nerve damage without permanent threshold elevation suggests this type of peripheral damage may be a key elicitor of tinnitus and hyperacusis in humans with normal audiograms. We addressed this idea by recording responses in the mouse inferior colliculus (IC) following a bilateral, neuropathic noise exposure. Two wks post-exposure, mean SRs were unchanged in mice recorded while awake, or under anesthesia. SRs were also unaffected by more intense, or unilateral exposures. These results suggest that neither neuropathy nor hair cell loss are sufficient to raise SRs in the IC, at least in mice. However, its not clear whether our mice had tinnitus. Tone-evoked rate-level functions at the CF were steeper following exposure, specifically in the region of maximal neuropathy. Furthermore, suppression driven by off-CF tones and by ipsilateral noise were also reduced. Both changes were especially pronounced in neurons of awake mice. These findings align with prior reports of elevated acoustic startle in neuropathic mice, and indicate that neuropathy may initiate a compensatory response in the central auditory system leading to the genesis of hyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "Brain atrophy as measured from structural MR images, is one of the primary imaging biomarkers used to track neurodegenerative disease progression. In diseases such as frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimers disease, atrophy can be observed in key brain structures years before any clinical symptoms are present. Atrophy is most commonly captured as volume change of key structures and the shape changes of these structures are typically not analysed despite being potentially more sensitive than summary volume statistics over the entire structure.\\n\\nIn this paper we propose a spatiotemporal analysis pipeline based Large Diffeomorphic Deformation Metric Mapping (LDDMM) to detect shape changes from volumetric MRI scans. We applied our framework to a cohort of individuals with genetic variants of frontotemporal dementia and healthy controls from the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) study. Our method, take full advantage of the LDDMM framework, and relies on the creation of a population specific average spatiotemporal trajectory of a relevant brain structure of interest, the thalamus in our case. The residuals from each patient data to the average spatiotemporal trajectory are then clustered and studied to assess when presymptomatic mutation carriers differ from healthy control subjects.\\n\\nWe found statistical differences in shape in the anterior region of the thalamus at least five years before the mutation carrier subjects develop any clinical symptoms. This region of the thalamus has been shown to be predominantly connected to the frontal lobe, consistent with the pattern of cortical atrophy seen in the disease.",

    "abstract": "Working memory is a critical function of the brain to maintain and manipulate information over delay periods of seconds. Sensory areas have been implicated in working memory; however, it is debated whether the delay-period activity of sensory regions is actively maintaining information or passively reflecting top-down inputs. We hereby examined the anterior piriform cortex, an olfactory cortex, in head-fixed mice performing a series of olfactory working memory tasks. Information maintenance is necessary in these tasks, especially in a dual-task paradigm in which mice are required to perform another distracting task while actively maintaining information during the delay period. Optogenetic suppression of the piriform cortex activity during the delay period impaired performance in all the tasks.Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings revealed that the delay-period activity of the anterior piriform cortex encoded odor information with or without the distracting task.Thus, this sensory cortex is critical for active information maintenance in working memory.",

    "abstract": "The rice bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) injects transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that bind and activate host  susceptibility (S) genes important for disease. Clade III SWEET genes are major S genes for bacterial blight. The resistance genes xa5, which reduces TALE activity generally, and xa13, a SWEET11 allele not recognized by the cognate TALE, have been effectively deployed. However, strains that defeat both resistance genes individually were recently reported in India and Thailand. To gain insight into the mechanism(s), we completely sequenced the genome of one such strain from each country and examined the encoded TALEs. Strikingly, the two strains are clones, sharing nearly identical TALE repertoires, including a TALE known to activate SWEET11 strongly enough to be effective even when diminished by xa5. We next investigated SWEET gene induction by the Indian strain. The Indian strain induced no clade III SWEET in plants harbouring xa13, indicating a pathogen adaptation that relieves dependence on these genes for susceptibility. The findings open a door to mechanistic understanding of the role SWEET genes play in susceptibility and illustrate the importance of complete genome sequence-based monitoring of Xoo populations in developing varieties with effective disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "The brain is a complex system that operates based on coordinated neuronal activities. Brain-wide cellular calcium imaging techniques have quickly advanced in recent years and become powerful tools for understanding the neuronal activities of small animal models. The whole brain imaging generally requires to extract the neuronal activities from three-dimensional (3D) image series. Unfortunately, the 3D image series are obtained under imaging conditions different among laboratories and extracting neuronal activities from the data requires multiple processes. Therefore researchers need to develop their own software, which has prevented the application of whole-brain imaging experiments in more laboratories. Here, we combined traditional image processing techniques with the powerful deep-learning method which can be flexibly modified to fit 3D image data in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans obtained under different conditions. We first trained the 3D U-net deep network to classify each pixel into cell and non-cell categories. Cells merged as a whole region were further separated into individual cells by watershed segmentation. The cells were then tracked in 3D space over time with the combination of a feedforward network and a point set registration method to use local and global relative positions of the cells, respectively. Remarkably, one manually annotated 3D image combined with data augmentation was sufficient for training the deep networks to obtain satisfactory tracking results. Our method correctly tracked more than 98% of neurons in three different image datasets and successfully extracted brain-wide neuronal activities. Our method worked well even when the sampling rate was reduced: 86% correct in case 4/5 frames were removed, and when artificial noise was added into the raw images: 91% correct in case 35 times of background-level noise was added. Our results proved that deep learning is widely applicable to different datasets and can help us in establishing a flexible pipeline for extracting whole brain activities.",

NeRF can be parallelized to process multiple polymers simultaneously, but is not parallelizable along the length of a single polymer. A mathematically equivalent algorithm, pNeRF, has been derived that is parallelizable along a polymers length. Empirical analysis demonstrates an order-of-magnitude speed up using modern GPUs and CPUs. In machine learning-based workflows, in which partial derivatives are backpropagated through NeRF equations and neural network primitives, switching to pNeRF can reduce the fractional computational cost of coordinate conversion from over two-thirds to around 10%.

    "abstract": "Phenotypic differentiation among natural populations can be explained by natural selection or by neutral processes such as drift. There are many examples in the literature where comparing the effects of these processes on multiple populations has allowed the detection of local adaptation. However, these studies rarely identify the agents of selection. Whether population adaptive divergence is caused by local features of the environment, or by the environmental demand emerging at a more global scale, for example along altitudinal gradients, is a question that remains poorly investigated. Here, we measured neutral genetic (FST) and quantitative genetic (QST) differentiation among 13 populations of snapdragon plants (Antirrhinum majus) in a common garden experiment. We found low but significant genetic differentiation at putatively neutral markers, which supports the hypothesis of either ongoing pervasive homogenisation via gene flow between diverged populations or reproductive isolation between disconnected populations. Our results also support the hypothesis of local adaptation involving phenological, morphological, reproductive and functional traits. They also showed that phenotypic differentiation increased with altitude for traits reflecting the reproduction and the phenology of plants, thereby confirming the role of such traits in their adaptation to environmental differences associated with altitude. Our approach allowed us to identify candidate traits for the adaptation to climate change in snapdragon plants. Our findings imply that environmental conditions changing with altitude, such as the climatic envelope, influenced the adaptation of multiple populations of snapdragon plants on the top of their adaptation to local environmental features. They also have implications for the study of adaptive evolution in structured populations because they highlight the need to disentangle the adaptation of plant populations to climate envelopes and altitude from the confounding effects of selective pressures acting specifically at the local scale of a population.",

In this developing field, different connectome construction strategies have emerged in parallel. However, there is a need to understand the influences of different strategies on subsequent analyses when constructing a connectome. This study systematically compares connectome construction strategies based on their biological relevance to functional networks in neurodegeneration.\\n\\nWe asked which functional connectome construction strategy was best able to discriminate HD gene carriers from healthy controls, and how such a strategy affected modular organization of the network. The major factors compared were principal component-based correction versus wavelet decomposition for physiological noise correction, the type of parcellation atlas (functional, structural and multi-modal), weighted versus binarized networks, and unthresholded versus proportionally thresholded networks. We found that principal component-based correction generated the most discriminatory connectomes, while binarization and proportional thresholding did not increase discrimination between HD gene carriers and healthy controls. When a functional parcellation atlas was used, the highest discrimination rates were obtained. We observed that the group differences in modular organization of the functional connectome were greatly affected by binarization and thresholding, showing no consistent pattern of modularity.\\n\\nThis study suggests that functional connectome construction strategies using principal component-based correction and weighted unthresholded connectivity matrices may outperform other strategies.",

Thus, we sought to determine the efficacy of 13 SCRAs at CB1 using receptor depletion with the irreversible CB1 antagonist AM6544 followed by fitting the curve with the Black and Leff operational model to calculate efficacy.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACHReceptor depletion in mouse AtT-20 neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human CB1 was achieved by pre-treatment of cells with AM6544 (10 {micro}M, 60 mins). The CB1-mediated hyperpolarisation of AtT20 cells was measured using membrane potential dye. From data fit to the operational model, the efficacy (tau) and affinity (KA) parameters were obtained for each drug.\\n\\nKEY RESULTSAM6544 did not affect the potency or maximal effect of native somatostatin receptor-induced hyperpolarisation (Control, pEC50 9.13 {+/-} 0.05, Emax 38 {+/-} 1%; AM6544 treated pEC50 9.18 {+/-} 0.04, Emax 39 {+/-} 0.7%). The tau value of {triangleup}9-THC was 70-fold less than the reference CB-agonist CP55940, and 240-fold less than the highest efficacy SCRA, 5F-MDMB-PICA. Most of the SCRAs had about 50% of the efficacy of CP55940. There was no correlation between the tau and KA values for any SCRA.\\n\\nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONSAll the SCRA tested showed substantially higher agonist activity at CB1 than {triangleup}9-THC, which may contribute to the adverse effects seen with these drugs but not {triangleup}9-THC, although the mechanisms underlying SCRA toxicity are still poorly defined.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnplanned readmission of a hospitalized patient is an extremely undesirable outcome as the patient may have been exposed to additional risks. The rates of unplanned readmission are, therefore, regarded as an important performance indicator for the medical quality of a hospital and healthcare system. Identifying high-risk patients likely to suffer from readmission before release benefits both the patients and the medical providers. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to develop efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate) that are significant in time series with temporal dependencies, which cannot be properly captured by traditional static models, but can be captured by our proposed deep neural network based model. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD9 embeddings. Our machine learning models identifies ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate (0.742) and an improved Area Under the Curve (0.791) compared with traditional methods. We also illustrate the importance of each portion of the features and different combinations of the models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.\\n\\nConclusionOur manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision making accuracy, and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven results enable clinicians to make assisted decisions within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for hospitals by improving the detection of possible readmission. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, hospital administration, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive and inexorable loss of dopaminergic cells in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). A full understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of this cell loss is unavailable, though a number of mechanisms have been indicated in the literature. A couple of these mechanisms, however, show potential for the development of radical and promising PD therapeutics. One of these mechanisms is the peculiar metabolic vulnerability of SNc cells by virtue of their excessive energy demands; the other is the excitotoxicity caused by excessive glutamate release onto SNc by an overactive Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). To investigate the latter hypothesis computationally, we developed a spiking neuron network model of the SNc-STN-GPe system. In the model, prolonged stimulation of SNc cells by an overactive STN leads to an increase in a  stress variable; when the stress in a SNc neuron exceeds a stress threshold the neuron dies. The model shows that the interaction between SNc and STN involves a positive feedback due to which, an initial loss of SNc cells that crosses a threshold causes a runaway effect that leads to an inexorable loss of SNc cells, strongly resembling the process of neurodegeneration. The model further suggests a link between the two aforementioned PD mechanisms: metabolic vulnerability and glutamate excitotoxicity. Our simulation results show that the excitotoxic cause of SNc cell loss in PD might be initiated by weak excitotoxicity mediated by energy deficit, followed by strong excitotoxicity, mediated by a disinhibited STN. A variety of conventional therapies are simulated in the model to test their efficacy in slowing down or arresting SNc cell loss. Among the current therapeutics, glutamate inhibition, dopamine restoration, subthalamotomy and deep brain stimulation showed superior neuroprotective effects in the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Cortical collapse factors affect microtubule (MT) dynamics at the plasma membrane. They play important roles in neurons, as suggested by inhibition of axon growth and regeneration through the Arf activator Efa6 in C. elegans, and by neurodevelopmental disorders linked to the mammalian kinesin Kif21A. How cortical collapse factors influence axon growth is little understood. Here we studied them, focussing on the function of Drosophila Efa6 in experimentally and genetically amenable fly neurons. First, we show that Drosophila Efa6 can inhibit MTs directly without interacting molecules via an N-terminal 18 amino acid motif (MT elimination domain/MTED) that binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule growth in vitro and cells. If N-terminal MTED-containing fragments are in the cytoplasm they abolish entire microtubule networks of mouse fibroblasts and whole axons of fly neurons. Full-length Efa6 is membrane-attached, hence primarily blocks MTs in the periphery of fibroblasts, and explorative MTs that have left axonal bundles in neurons. Accordingly, loss of Efa6 causes an increase of explorative MTs: in growth cones, they enhance axon growth, in axon shafts, explorative MTs cause excessive branching, as well as atrophy through perturbations of MT bundles. Efa6 over-expression causes the opposite phenotypes. Taken together, our work conceptually links molecular and sub-cellular functions of cortical collapse factors to axon growth regulation and reveals new roles in axon branching and in the prevention of axonal atrophy. Furthermore, the MTED delivers a promising tool that can be used to inhibit MTs in a compartmentalised fashion when fusing it to specifically localising protein domains.\\n\\nSummary statementThe cortical collapse factor Efa6 inhibits microtubule polymerising outside axonal bundles.

    "abstract": "SignificanceForaged leafy greens are consumed around the globe, including in urban areas, and may play a larger role when food is scarce or expensive. It is thus important to assess the safety and nutritional value of wild greens foraged in urban environments.\\n\\nMethodsField observations, soil tests, and nutritional and toxicology tests on plant tissue were conducted for three sites, each roughly 9 square blocks, in disadvantaged neighborhoods in the East San Francisco Bay Area in 2014-2015. The sites included mixed-use areas and areas with high vehicle traffic.\\n\\nResultsEdible wild greens were abundant, even during record droughts. Soil at some survey sites had elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium, but tissue tests suggest that rinsed greens of the tested species are safe to eat. Daily consumption of standard servings comprise less than the EPA reference doses of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals. Pesticides, glyphosate, and PCBs were below detection limits.\\n\\nThe nutrient density of 6 abundant species compared favorably to that of the most nutritious domesticated leafy greens.\\n\\nConclusionsWild edible greens harvested in industrial, mixed-use, and high-traffic urban areas in the San Francisco East Bay area are abundant and highly nutritious. Even grown in soils with elevated levels of heavy metals, tested species were safe to eat after rinsing in tap water. This does not mean that all edible greens growing in contaminated soil are safe to eat--tests on more species, in more locations, and over a broader range of soil chemistry are needed to determine what is generally safe and what is not. But it does suggest that wild greens could contribute to nutrition, food security, and sustainability in urban ecosystems. Current laws, regulations, and public-health guidance that forbid or discourage foraging on public lands, including urban areas, should be revisited.",

    "abstract": "Background: In 2016, the first global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis was endorsed with the goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. In Tunisia, effective vaccines for hepatitis B (HBV) have been added to the expanded programme of immunization (EPI) since July 1995 for new borns. We expected to have a decreasing trend in the prevalence rate of reported HBV. Our study aimed to address the epidemiological profile of HBV, to assess trends by age and gender in Monastir governorate over a period of 18 years according to immunization status and to estimate the burden (years lived with disability YLDs) of this pathology. Methods: We performed a descriptive cross sectional study of declared HBV from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017 defined as having positive serologic markers for HBs Ag. All declared patients were residents of Monastirs Governorate. EPI included two periods, the first between 1995 and 2006 following a three-dose schedule (3, 4, 9 months). The second PI cohort after 2006 following a three-dose schedule (0, 2, 6 months). Results: During 18 years, 1526 cases of HBV were declared in Monastir with a mean of 85 cases per year. We estimated a mean of 1699 declared cases per year of HBV in Tunisia. CPR was 16.85/100,000 inh being the higher in age group of 20-39 years and in men .ASR was 15.99/100,000 inh, being 35.5 in men and 8.69 in women. During the study period, declared cases among presumed immunized (PI) person against HBV were 32(2.0%). Among PI cases, 29 were from the first period and 3 were from the second. We established a negative trend over 18 years of hepatitis B. The age group of 20 to 39 was the most common with a sharply decline. Presumed not immunized (PNI) HBV cases are decreasing by years with a prediction of 35 cases in 2024. Reported HBV contributed to 1.26 YLDs per 100,000 inh. The highest rate of YLDs occurred at the age 20-39 (2.73 YLDs per 100,000 inh). During 18 years, YLDs were 114.45 in Monastir with a mean of 2293.65 YLDs of HBV in Tunisia. Conclusion, this study showed a law prevalence rate and a decreasing trend of HBV during 18 years showing an efficacy of immunization and confirming that the universal hepatitis B vaccination in Tunisia has resulted in progress towards the prevention and control of hepatitis B infection. These findings should be demonstrated in other Tunisian regions with a standardized serological profile.",

Behavioral studies suggest that such egocentric mental rotations rely on brain areas that are also involved in processing actual self-motion, thus depending on vestibular input. In a combined galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the brain areas that underlie both simulated changes in self-location and the processing of vestibular stimulation within the same individuals. Participants performed an egocentric mental rotation task, an object-based mental rotation task, or a pure lateralization task during GVS or sham stimulation. At the neural level, we expected an overlap between brain areas activated during vestibular processing and egocentric mental rotation (against object-based mental rotation) within area OP2 and the Posterior Insular Cortex (PIC), two core brain regions involved in vestibular processing. The fMRI data showed a small overlap within area OP2 and a larger overlap within the PIC for both egocentric mental rotation against object-based mental rotation and vestibular processing. GVS did not influence the ability to perform egocentric mental rotation.\\n\\nOur results provide evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying perceived and simulated self-motion. We conclude that mental rotation of ones body involves neural activity in the PIC and area OP2, but the behavioral results also suggest that those mental simulations of ones body might be robust to modulatory input from vestibular stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Here, we introduce a novel behavioural paradigm to study neural circuits and mechanisms underlying action selection and decision-making in freely moving Drosophila. We first validate our approach by studying FoxP mutants and show that normally invariant patterns of motor activity and turning behaviour are altered in these flies, reminiscent of indecision. Then, focusing on central complex (CX) circuits known to integrate different sensory modalities and controlling premotor regions, we show that action sequences and turning behaviour are regulated by dopamine D1 (Dop1R1) receptor signalling. Dop1R1 inputs onto CX columnar wedge and ellipsoid body R2/R4m ring neuron circuits both negatively gate motor activity but inversely control turning behaviour. While flies deficient of D1 receptor signalling present normal turning behaviour despite decreased activity, restoring Dop1R1 level in R2/R4m-specific circuitry affects the temporal organisation of motor actions and turning. These findings suggest that columnar wedge and ring neuron circuits of the CX differentially modulate patterns of motor action sequences and turning behaviour by comparative Dop1R1 signalling for goal-directed locomotion.",

For this reason, education and community participation are considered crucial for source reduction and mosquito control. In the current study, we tried to relate for the first time in Greece, the effectiveness of resident education in an urban area with the number of breeding sites based on previous KAP (knowledge, attitudes and practices) studies. Our study examines the relationship between mosquito breeding sources and socioeconomic or demographic characteristics of different households in a Greek municipality and evaluates efficacy of resident education. The results revealed that only a minority of residents knew where mosquitoes breed (18.6%) and only 46% felt that residents had any responsibility for managing breeding habitat. Our findings strongly suggest that only the presence of scientific staff inspecting possible habitats in their properties, could be enough to stimulate practices towards source reduction. However, educational interventions alone with printed education material cannot enhance significant community participation and source reduction.",

These consequences activate autophagy, which degrades damaged cellular content, as well as inducing the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor, and thereby the expression of protective genes. Melatonin has protective roles in normal cells and cytotoxic actions in cancer cells, with effects involving autophagy and Nrf2 pathways. The current study shows melatonin to differentially modulate autophagy and Nrf2 pathways in tumor and normal placental cells exposed to H/R. BeWo, a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line, and primary villous cytotrophoblasts isolated from normal term placenta, were maintained in normoxia (8% O2) for 24 h or exposed to hypoxia (0.5% of O2 for 4 h) followed by 20 h of normoxia, creating a H/R, in the presence or absence of 1 mM melatonin. Melatonin induced a 7-fold increase in the activation of 5 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an upstream modulator of autophagy, rising to a 16-fold increase in cells co-exposed to H/R and melatonin, compared to controls. H/R induced autophagosome formation via the increased expression of Beclin-1 (by 94 %) and ATG7 (by 97%). H/R also induced autophagic activity, indicated by the by the 630% increase in P62, and increased Nrf2 by 314%. In H/R conditions, melatonin reduced autophagy by 74% and Nrf2 expression by 66%, leading to BeWo cell apoptosis. In contrast, in human primary villous cytotrophoblasts, H/R induced autophagy and Nrf2, which melatonin further potentiated, thereby affording protection against H/R. This study demonstrates that melatonin differentially modulates autophagy and the Nrf2 pathway in normal vs. tumor trophoblast cells, being cytoprotective in normal cells whilst increasing apoptosis in tumoral trophoblast cells.",

    "abstract": "Adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are important vectors of human disease. The size of the adult female affects her success, fitness, and ability to transmit diseases. The size of the adults is determined during the aquatic larval stage. Competition among larvae for food influences the size of the pupa and thus the adult. In these experiments, the food level (mg/larva) and the density (larvae/vial) both affect intraspecific competition, which shows up as the interaction of the two factors. Furthermore, the total food per vial affects the nature of competition among the larvae, also apparent in the interaction of food and density. Male larvae are affected by the percent of males in the vial, but females are not. Seven biologically significant dependent variables were examined, and the data analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance to gain insight into the relationships among the variables and the effects of these factors on the larvae as they grew in small containers. Male and female larvae compete differently from one another for the particulate yeast cells in this experiment; female larvae outcompete males through larger size and by retaining cells within their gut at low total food levels. Under conditions of more intense competition, the pupal masses of both males and females are smaller, so the effect of competition is a reduced apparent food level. The age at pupation is also affected by food and density. Across the twenty treatment combinations of food/larva and larvae/vial, female larvae grew as though there were six different ecological environments while male larvae grew as though there were only four different environments. No interference competition was observed. Eradication efforts aimed at adult populations of this mosquito may inadvertently increase the size and robustness of the next generation of larvae, resulting in a subsequent adult population increase in the second generation.",

Descriptive analysis, student t-test, one way ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient were implemented.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, the mean size of anterior fontanelle in term neonates was 3.00 {+/-} 0.62 cm (range 1.70 - 5.50 cm). The mean size of anterior fontanelle was 3.10 {+/-} 0.66 cm for males, and 2.88 {+/-} 0.57 cm for females. There was statistically significant difference in anterior fontanelle size in neonates of different genders (p<0.001), mode of delivery (p<0.001) and duration of labour (p=0.006). However, the size of anterior fontanelle was not significantly affected by the birth order, onset of labour and sociodemographic variables of the mother except occupation of the mother (p=0.01). There was a significant positive correlation between the mean size of anterior fontanelle with birth weight (r=0.11; p=0.04) and head circumference (r=0.17; p=0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsAt term, male neonates had significantly larger anterior fontanelle than female neonates and anterior fontanelle size has a direct relationship with birth weight and head circumference.",

    "abstract": "Many lung diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), display significant regional heterogeneity, with patches of severely injured tissue adjacent to apparently healthy tissue. Current mouse models that aim to mimic ARDS generally produce diffuse injuries that cannot reproducibly generate ARDSs regional heterogeneity. This deficiency prevents the evaluation of how well therapeutic agents reach the most injured regions, and precludes many regenerative medicine studies, since it is not possible to know which apparently healing regions suffered severe injury initially. Finally, these diffuse injury models must be mild to allow for survival, as their diffuse nature does not allow for residual healthy lung to keep an animal alive long enough for many drug and regenerative medicine studies. To solve all of these deficiencies of current animal models, we have created a simple and reproducible technique to selectively induce lung injury in specific areas of the lung. Our technique, catheter-in-catheter selective lung injury (CICSLI), involves guiding an inner catheter to a particular area of the lung and delivering an injurious agent mixed with nanoparticles (fluorescently and/or radioactively labeled) that can be used to track the location and extent of where the initial injury was, days later. Further, we demonstrate that CICSLI can produce a more severe injury than diffuse models, yet has much higher survival since CICSLI intentionally leaves undamaged lung regions. Collectively, these attributes of CICSLI will allow better study of how drugs act within heterogeneous lung pathologies and how regeneration occurs in severely damaged lung tissue, thereby aiding the development of new therapies for ARDS and other lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to identify the candidate biomarkers of heat stress (HS) in the urine of lactating dairy goats through the application of proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomic analysis. Dairy does (n = 16) in mid-lactation were submitted to thermal neutral (TN; indoors; 15 to 20{degrees}C; 40 to 45% humidity) or HS (climatic chamber; 37{degrees}C day, 30{degrees}C night; 40% humidity) conditions according to a crossover design (2 periods of 21 days). Thermophysiological traits and lactational performances were recorded and milk composition analyzed during each period. Urine samples were collected at day 15 of each period for 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) assessment with cross validation were used to identify the goat urinary metabolome from Human Metabolome Data Base. HS increased rectal temperature (1.2{degrees}C), respiratory rate (3.5-fold) and water intake (74%), but decreased feed intake (35%) and body weight (5%) of the lactating does. No differences were detected in milk yield, but HS decreased the milk contents of fat (9%), protein (16%) and lactose (5%). Metabolomics allowed separating TN and HS urinary clusters by PLS-DA. Most discriminating metabolites were hippurate and other phenylalanine (Phe) derivative compounds, which increased in HS vs. TN does. The greater excretion of these gut-derived toxic compounds indicated that HS induced a harmful gastrointestinal microbiota overgrowth, which should have sequestrated aromatic amino acids for their metabolism and decreased the synthesis of neurotransmitters and thyroid hormones, with negative impact on milk yield and composition. In conclusion, HS markedly changed the thermophysiological traits and lactational performances of dairy goats, which were translated into their urinary metabolomic profile through the presence of gut-derived toxic compounds. Hippurate and other Phe-derivative compounds are suggested as urinary biomarkers to detect heat stressed dairy animals in practice.",

    "abstract": "The sugarcane (Saccharum sp.), of great importance for being one of the most traditional rural agroindustries in Latin America and the Caribbean, as part of the agricultural systems, is vulnerable to increases or reductions in the incidence of pests associated with extreme events of climate change, such as prolonged droughts, hurricanes, heavy and out of season rains, among others, contributing to the increase losses in agricultural production, which forces farmers to make excessive expenditures on pesticides that generally fail to solve the issue. (Vazquez, 2011). The main pest belongs to the Diatraea complex (Vargas et al., 2013; Gallego et al., 1996), a larval stage perforator habit. Different field evaluations have revealed the presence of a species that had not been reported in sugarcane crops, Diatraea busckella, and to corroborate the finding, a method of identification was needed whose advantage was to be quick and also low cost, in this sense, geometric morphometry is a mathematical tool with biological basis (Bookstein, 1991), which allows to decompose the variation resulting from the physiology of individuals of the most stable individuals of the population, product of the genetic component. CLIC (Collecting Landmarks for Identification and Characterization) was used for identification, with reference to the previous right wing (De La Riva et al., 2001; Belen et al., 2004; Schachter-Broide et al., 2004; Dvorak et al., 2006; Soto Vivas et al., 2007). Wing morphometry was performed using generalized Procrustes analysis (Rohlf and Marcus, 1993). The analysis clearly differentiated between D. busckella and D. saccharalis, eliminating the environmental factors that could generate some level of error, being considered a support tool that validates the molecular biology processes for the identification of organisms.",

    "abstract": "Many plants can reproduce vegetatively, producing clonal progeny from vegetative cells; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha), a basal land plant, propagates asexually via gemmae, which are clonal plantlets formed in gemma cups on the dorsal side of the vegetative thallus [1]. The initial stage of gemma development involves elongation and asymmetric divisions of a specific type of epidermal cell, called a gemma initial, which forms on the floor of the gemma cup [2, 3]. To investigate the regulatory mechanism underlying gemma development, we focused on two allelic mutants in which no gemma initial formed; these mutants were named karappo, meaning \\\"empty\\\". We used whole-genome sequencing of both mutants, and molecular genetic analyses to identify the causal gene, KARAPPO (KAR), which encodes a Rop guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RopGEF) carrying a PRONE catalytic domain. In vitro GEF assays showed that the full-length KAR protein and the PRONE domain have significant GEF activity toward MpRop, the only Rop GTPase in M. polymorpha. Moreover, genetic complementation experiments showed a significant role for the N- and C-terminal variable regions in gemma development. Our investigation demonstrated an essential role for KAR/RopGEF in the initiation of plantlet development from a differentiated cell, which may involve cell polarity formation and subsequent asymmetric cell division via activation of Rop signaling, implying a similar developmental mechanism in vegetative reproduction of various land plants.",

    "abstract": "We developed a 3D localization-based super-resolution technique providing a slowly varying localization precision over a 1 m range with precisions down to 15 nm. The axial localization is performed through a combination of point spread function (PSF) shaping and supercritical angle fluorescence (SAF), which yields absolute axial information. Using a dual-view scheme, the axial detection is decoupled from the lateral detection and optimized independently to provide a weakly anisotropic 3D resolution over the imaging range. This method can be readily implemented on most homemade PSF shaping setups and provides drift-free, tilt-insensitive and achromatic results. Its insensitivity to these unavoidable experimental biases is especially adapted for multicolor 3D super-resolution microscopy, as we demonstrate by imaging cell cytoskeleton, living bacteria membranes and axon periodic submembrane scaffolds. We further illustrate the interest of the technique for biological multicolor imaging over a several-m range by direct merging of multiple acquisitions at different depths.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli can induce a group of stress-response proteins, including carbon starvation-induced lipoprotein (Slp), which is an outer membrane lipoprotein expressed in response to stressful environments. In this paper, slp null mutant\\n\\nE. coli were constructed by insertion of the group II intron, and then the growth sensitivity of the slp mutant strain was measured under 0.6% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide. The changes in resistance to hydrogen peroxide stress were investigated by detecting antioxidant activity and gene expression in the slp mutant strain. The results showed that deletion of the slp gene increased the sensitivity of E. coli under 0.6% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide oxidative stress. Analysis of the unique mapping rates from the transcriptome libraries revealed that four of thirteen remarkably up/down-regulated genes in E. coli were involved in antioxidant enzymes after mutation of the slp gene. Mutation of the slp gene caused a significant increase in catalase activity, which contributed to an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity. The katG gene was activated by the OxyR regulator, which was activated directly by 0.6% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide, and HPI encoded by katG was induced against oxidative stress. Therefore, the carbon starvation-induced lipoprotein Slp regulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes and the transcriptional activator OxyR in response to the hydrogen peroxide environment, ensuring that cells are protected from hydrogen peroxide oxidative stress at the level of enzyme activity and gene expression.",

This study aims to explore the relationship between miRNAs expression profles and platelets function, as well as miRNAs potential roles during platelet storage lesions. Platelets were collected from 15 healthy men with O blood types. MiRNAs profiles in platelets were detected by Agilent Human miRNA Array Differential miRNA levels were studied using human platelets after apheresis and stored for 2, 5 and 8 days using microarray. There were 167 and 230 altered miRNAs during the 5 and 8 day storage, respectively. In addition, the number of reduced miRNAs was much greater than that of increased. And many of them are involved in functions of platelet activation, degranulation, PDGF receptor signaling pathway and cell differentiation. The results of RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-21-5p, miR-21-3p and miR-155 decreased on the 5th day, while miR-223, miR-3162 and let-7b increased. Flow cytometry results revealed that with increase of storage time, the expression of P2Y12 increased and phosphorylation level of VASP reduced. Meanwhile, the platelet reactivity index (PRI) decreased from 72.7% to 18.2%, while the apoptotic percentage of platelet significantly increased. For the first time, we found altered miRNAs are closely related to platelet aggregation, including P2Y12, VASP and GPb/a. Through KEGG database prediction, we verified there were many miRNAs impacting the pathway of platelet aggregation, such as miR-223, miR-21 and let-7b, which indicated miRNAs might serve as potential biomarkers of storage lesion in platelet. These target miRNAs are related to activation, degranulation and PDGF receptor signaling pathway of platelet.",

The intestinal microbiota also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and iron supplementation likely influences gut bacterial diversity in patients with IBD. Here, we assessed the impact of dietary iron, using chow diets containing either 100, 200 or 400 ppm, fed ad libitum to adult female C57BL/6 mice in the presence or absence of colitis induced using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), on (i) clinical and histological severity of acute DSS-induced colitis, and (ii) faecal microbial diversity, as assessed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA. Increasing or decreasing dietary iron concentration from the standard 200 ppm exacerbated both clinical and histological severity of DSS-induced colitis. DSS-treated mice provided only half the standard levels of iron ad libitum (i.e. chow containing 100 ppm iron) lost more body weight than those receiving double the amount of standard iron (i.e. 400 ppm); p<0.01. Faecal calprotectin levels were significantly increased in the presence of colitis in those consuming 100 ppm iron at day 8 (5.94-fold) versus day-10 group (4.14-fold) (p<0.05), and for the 400 ppm day-8 group (8.17-fold) versus day-10 group (4.44-fold) (p<0.001). In the presence of colitis, dietary iron at 400 ppm resulted in a significant reduction in faecal abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and increase of Proteobacteria, changes which were not observed with lower dietary intake of iron at 100 ppm. Overall, altering dietary iron intake exacerbated DSS-induced colitis; increasing the iron content of the diet also led to changes in intestinal bacteria diversity and composition after colitis was induced with DSS.",

    "abstract": "The sequenced genome of the arboviral vector mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is replete with repetitive DNA and it harbors an unusually large number of endogenous viral sequences, collectively called Nonretroviral Integrated RNA Virus Sequences (NIRVS). NIRVS are enriched both within protein-coding gene exons and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters, where they encode piRNAs. Based on these features, NIRVS have been proposed to function as novel mosquito antiviral immune factors. However, the relative importance and contributions of different NIRVS as functional antiviral elements and their mechanisms of action remain open questions.\\n\\nWe apply an analytical approach that intersects computational, evolutionary and molecular methods to identify NIRVS most likely affecting mosquito immunity. Using this strategy, we show that NIRVS are a highly dynamic component of the Ae. albopictus repeatome, which nevertheless maintains a core set of seemingly the oldest NIRVS with similarity to Rhabdoviruses. Population-level polymorphism of NIRVS varies depending on whether they occur in intergenic regions, piRNA clusters or are part of gene exons. NIRVS from piRNA clusters are differentially widespread in diverse populations but conserved at the sequence level. This is consistent with the hypothesis that they act analogously to fragments of transposable elements in piRNA clusters and contribute to piRNA-based immunity. Among NIRVS from gene exons, AlbRha52 and AlbRha12 have the hallmarks of domestication as they are fixed across populations, stably expressed, and as polymorphic at the sequence level as fast-evolving genes. Overall these results support the hypothesis that NIRVS contribute to mosquito immunity, potentially through diverse modes of action.",

Several computational methods for drug repurposing exist, and many of these methods rely on combinations of different sources of information, extract hand-crafted features and use a computational model to predict targets or indications for a drug. One of the distinguishing features between different drug repurposing systems is the selection of features. Recently, a set of novel machine learning methods have become available that can efficiently learn features from datasets, and these methods can be applied, among others, to text and structured data in knowledge graphs.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a novel method that combines information in literature and structured databases, and applies feature learning to generate vector space embeddings. We apply our method to the identification of drug targets and indications for known drugs based on heterogeneous information about drugs, target proteins, and diseases. We demonstrate that our method is able to combine complementary information from both structured databases and from literature, and we show that our method can compete with well-established methods for drug repurposing. Our approach is generic and can be applied to other areas in which multi-modal information is used to build predictive models.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/multi-drug-embedding\\n\\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",

We find that recombination occurs at high frequency in pairwise crosses between all three mating types, despite the absence of the SPO11 enzyme that is normally required to initiate crossover formation. In crosses involving three strains, transient fusions involving more than two gametes frequently lead to triparental inheritance, with recombined nuclear haplotypes inherited from two parents and the mitochondrial genome from a third. Cells that do not contribute genetically to the Dictyostelium zygote nucleus thereby have a stake in the next haploid generation.

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus infection usually causes a mild to moderately severe respiratory disease in humans. However, infection with the 1918 H1N1 pandemic or highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype, can lead to viral pneumonia, systemic disease and death. The molecular processes that determine the outcome of influenza virus infection are multifactorial and involve a complex interplay between host, viral, and bacterial factors1. However, it is generally accepted that a strong innate immune dysregulation known as  cytokine storm contributes to the pathology of pandemic and avian influenza virus infections2-4. The RNA sensor Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) plays an important role in sensing viral infection and initiating a signalling cascade that leads to interferon (IFN) expression5. Here we show that short aberrant RNAs (mini viral RNAs; mvRNAs), produced by the viral RNA polymerase during the replication of the viral RNA genome, bind and activate the intracellular pathogen sensor RIG-I, and lead to the expression of interferon-{beta}. We find that erroneous polymerase activity, dysregulation of viral RNA replication, or the presence of avian-specific amino acids underlie mvRNA generation and cytokine expression in mammalian cells and propose an intramolecular copy-choice mechanism for mvRNA generation. By deep-sequencing RNA samples from lungs of ferrets infected with influenza viruses we show that mvRNAs are generated during infection of animal models. We propose that mvRNAs act as main agonists of RIG-I during influenza virus infection and the ability of influenza virus strains to generate mvRNAs should be considered when assessing their virulence potential.",

For example, in a celebrated experiment Jacques Monod showed that bacteria cultured in media containing two different sugars consume them sequentially, resulting in bi-phasic growth curves called \\\"diauxic shifts\\\". From the theoretical point of view, microbial communities are commonly described using MacArthurs consumer-resource model, which describes the population dynamics of species competing for a given set of resources. In this model, however, metabolic strategies are treated as constant parameters. Here, we introduce adaptive metabolic strategies in the framework of consumer-resource models, allowing the strategies to evolve to maximize each species relative fitness. By doing so, we are able to describe quantitatively, and without invoking any specific molecular mechanisms for the metabolism of the microbial species, growth curves of the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae measured in a controlled experimental set-up, with galactose as the primary carbon source. We also show that metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment. A connection between the Competitive Exclusion Principle and the metabolic theory of ecology is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in phylogenomic analyses and increased genomic sampling of uncultured prokaryotic lineages brought compelling evidence in support of the emergence of eukaryotes from within the Archaea domain of life. The discovery of Asgardaeota archaea and their recognition as the closest extant relative of eukaryotes fuelled the revival of a decades-old debate regarding the topology of the tree of life. While it is apparent that Asgardaeota encode a plethora of eukaryotic-specific proteins (the highest number identified to date in prokaryotes), the lack of genomic information and metabolic characterization has precluded inferences about their lifestyles and the metabolic landscape that may have favoured the emergence of the hallmark eukaryotic subcellular architecture. Here, we use advanced phylogenetic analyses to infer the deep ancestry of eukaryotes and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions to shed light on the metabolic milieu of the closest archaeal eukaryotic ancestors discovered till date. In doing so, we: i) generate the largest Asgardaeota genomic dataset available so far, ii) describe a new clade of rhodopsins encoded within the recovered genomes, iii) provide unprecedented evidence for mixotrophy within Asgardaeota, iv) present first-ever proofs that the closest extant archaeal relatives to all eukaryotes (Heimdallarchaeia) have microoxic lifestyles with aerobic metabolic pathways unique among Archaea (i.e. kynurenine pathway) and v) generate the first images of Asgardaeota.",

    "abstract": "The selective breeding for extreme behavior on the elevated plus-maze (EPM) resulted in two mouse lines namely high-anxiety behaving (HAB) and low-anxiety behaving (LAB) mice. Using novel behavioral tests we demonstrate that HAB animals additionally exhibit maladaptive escape behavior and defensive vocalizations, whereas LAB mice show profound deficits in escaping from approaching threats which partially results from sensory deficits. We could relate these behavioral distortions to tonic changes in brain activity within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in HAB mice and the superior colliculus (SC) in LAB mice, using in vivo manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) followed by pharmacological or chemogenetic interventions. Therefore, midbrain-tectal structures govern the expression of both anxiety-like behavior and defensive responses. Our results challenge the uncritical use of the anthropomorphic terms anxiety or anxiety-like for the description of mouse behavior, as they imply higher cognitive processes, which are not necessarily in place.",

    "abstract": "Combining multiple layers of information underlying biological complexity into a structured framework, and in particular deciphering the molecular mechanisms behind cellular phenotypes, represent two challenges in systems biology. A key task is the formalisation of such information in models describing how biological entities interact to mediate the response to external and internal signals. Several databases with signaling information, such as SIGNOR, SignaLink and IntAct, focus on capturing, organising and displaying signaling interactions by representing them as binary, causal relationships between biological entities. The curation efforts that build these individual databases demand a concerted effort to ensure interoperability among resources, through the development of a standardized exchange format, ontologies and controlled vocabularies supporting the domain of causal interactions. Aware of the enormous benefits of standardization efforts in the molecular interaction research field, representatives of the signalling network community agreed to extend the PSI-MI controlled vocabulary to include additional terms representing aspects of causal interactions. Here, we present a common standard for the representation and dissemination of signaling information: the PSI Causal Interaction tabular format (CausalTAB) which is an extension of the existing PSI-MI tab-delimited format, now designated MITAB2.8. We define the new term \\\"causal interaction\\\", and related child terms, which are children of the PSI-MI \\\"molecular interaction\\\" term. The new vocabulary terms in this extended PSI-MI format will enable systems biologists to model large-scale signaling networks more precisely and with higher coverage than before.",

    "abstract": "Infections with several flatworm parasites represent group 1 biological carcinogens, i.e. definite causes of cancer. Infection with the food-borne liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini causes cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Whereas the causative agent for most cancers, including CCA in the West, remains obscure, the principal risk factor for CCA in Thailand is opisthorchiasis. We exploited this established link to explore the role of the secreted parasite growth factor termed liver fluke granulin (Ov-GRN-1) in pre-malignant lesions of the biliary tract. We targeted the Ov-grn-1 gene for programmed knockout and investigated gene-edited parasites in vitro and in experimentally infected hamsters. Both adult and juvenile stages of the liver fluke were transfected with a plasmid encoding a guide RNA sequence specific for exon 1 of Ov-grn-1 and the Cas9 nuclease. Deep sequencing of amplicon libraries from genomic DNA from gene-edited parasites exhibited programmed, Cas9-catalyzed mutations within the Ov-grn-1 locus, and tandem analyses by RT-PCR and western blot revealed rapid depletion of Ov-grn-1 transcripts and protein. Newly excysted juvenile flukes that had undergone editing of Ov-grn-1 colonized the biliary tract, grew and developed over a period of 60 days, were active and motile, and induced a clinically relevant pathophysiological tissue phenotype of attenuated biliary hyperplasia and fibrosis in comparison to infection with wild type flukes. This is the first report of gene knock-out using CRISPR/Cas9 in a parasitic flatworm, demonstrating the activity and utility of the process for functional genomics in these pathogens. The striking clinical phenotype highlights the role in virulence that liver fluke growth factors play in biliary tract morbidity during chronic opisthorchiasis.",

    "abstract": "Contactins (CNTNs) are important cell adhesion molecules that mediate neuronal and axoglial contacts, and lesions in these molecules are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. The extracellular domain of CNTNs contains six Ig domains and four FNIII domains. Crystal structures have shown that Ig1-Ig4 forms a horseshoe-shaped headpiece, in which the N-terminal domains might fold back on the C-terminal domains to form molecular super-U shaped architecture. The arrangement of these domains has been controversial, which may due to the structural dynamics and conformation heterogeneity of the protein. Here, we used a single-molecule 3D imaging method, individual-particle electron tomography (IPET), to study the extracellular domain of CNTN2 that forms monomers with a broad spectrum of conformations, and obtained 60 three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions. In addition to the known horseshoe-shaped headpiece, ~75% headpieces unexpectedly adopt an open (elongated) or a semi-open conformations contributed to our understanding about structural dynamics. The ectodomains formed curve but not double-back in any uniform way, with an averaged molecular dimension of ~255 [A]. The first-time demonstration of the dynamic nature and conformational preferences of the full-length CNTN2 ectodomain suggest that the headpiece exists in equilibrium in the  closed or  not-closed states. The important architecture may provide a structural platform for protein partners to influence this balance regulating the function of CNTN2. Encoding the ability of this neural adhesion molecule to form both homomers with itself, as well as recruit different protein partner to neuronal and axoglial contact points play the key role in mediating cell-cell interactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn situ bioremediation to achieve immobilization of toxic metals and radionuclides or detoxification of chlorinated solvents relies on electron donor additions. This practice promotes microbial Fe(III)-oxide mineral reduction that could change soil pore structure, release soil colloids, alter matrix surface properties, and cause the formation of secondary (i.e., reduced) Fe-mineral phases. These processes in turn may impact rates of bioremediation, groundwater quality, and ultimately contaminant fate. Continuous flow columns packed with water-stable soil aggregates high in Fe-oxides were infused with artificial groundwater containing acetate as electron donor and operated for 20 or 60 days inside an anoxic chamber. Soluble Fe(II) and soil colloids were detected in the effluent within one week after initiation of the acetate addition, demonstrating Fe(III)-bioreduction and colloid formation. Br-, 2,6-difluorobenzoate (DFBA), and silica-shelled silver nanoparticles (SSSNP) were selected as diffusible tracer, low-diffusible tracer, and non-diffusible nanoparticles, respectively, to perform transport experiments before and after the active 20-day bioreduction phase, with an aim of assessing the changes in soil structure and surface chemical properties resulting from Fe(III)-bioreduction. The transport of diffusible Br- was not influenced by the Fe(III)-bioreduction as evidenced by identical breakthrough curves before and after the introduction of acetate. Low-diffusible DFBA showed earlier breakthrough and less tailing after the bioreduction, suggesting alterations in flow paths and surface chemical properties of the soils. Similarly, non-diffusible SSSNP exhibited early breakthrough and enhanced transport after the bioreduction phase. Unexpectedly, the bioreduction caused complete retention of SSSNP in the soil columns when the acetate injection was extended from 20 days to 60 days, though no changes were observed for Br- and DFBA during the extended bioreduction period. The large change in the transport of SSSNP was attributed to the enhancement of soil aggregate breakdown and soil colloid release causing mechanical straining of SSSNP and the exposure of iron oxide surfaces previously unavailable within aggregate interiors favorable to the attachment of SSSNP. These results demonstrate that microbial activity can affect soil properties and transport behaviors of diffusivity-varying solutes and colloids in a time dependent fashion, a finding with implication for interpreting the data generated from soil column experiments under continuous flow.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIFe(III)-bioreduction causes time-dependent aggregate breakdown and colloid release.\\nC_LIO_LIShort-term bioreduction alters soil aggregate surface chemistry and tracer transport.\\nC_LIO_LIElectron donor amendment enhances transport of nanoparticle tracer.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The regulation of ion and pH homeostasis of endomembrane organelles is critical for functional protein trafficking, sorting and modification in eukaryotic cells. pH homeostasis is maintained through the activity of vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) pumping protons (H+) into the endomembrane lumen, and counter-action by cation/proton exchangers such as the NHX family of Na+(K+)/H+ exchangers. In plants, disturbing V-ATPase activity at the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) impairs secretory and endocytic trafficking. However, it is unclear if the endosomal NHX-type antiporters NHX5 and NHX6 play functionally similar roles in endomembrane trafficking through maintaining ion and pH homeostasis. Here we show through genetic, pharmacological, and live-cell imaging approaches that double knockout of endosomal isoforms NHX5 and NHX6 results in impairment of endosome motility, protein recycling at the TGN/EE, but not in the secretion of integral membrane proteins. Furthermore, we report that nhx5 nhx6 mutants are partially insensitive to osmotic swelling of TGN/EE induced by the monovalent cation ionophore monensin. Similarly, nhx5 nhx6 cells are unresponsive to late endosomal swelling by the phosphatidylinositol 3/4-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, demonstrating that NHX5 and NHX6 are required for maintaining endosomal cation balance. Lastly, we report that the distal region of the cytosolic tail of NHX6 is required for mediating NHX6 localisation to late endosomes, but does not appear to be essential for NHX6 function.",

    "abstract": "Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) is among the leading causes of blood stream infections in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions, especially among pediatric populations. Invasive NTS can be difficult to treat and have high case-fatality rates, in part due to emergence of strains resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Furthermore, improper treatment contributes to increased antibiotic resistance and death. Point of care (POC) diagnostic tests that rapidly identify invasive NTS infection, and differentiate between resistant and non-resistant strains, may greatly improve patient outcomes and decrease resistance at the community level. Here we present for the first time a model for NTS dynamics in high risk populations that can analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of four strategies involving POC diagnostic deployment, and the resulting impact on antimicrobial treatment for patients. Our analysis strongly supports the use of POC diagnostics coupled with targeted antibiotic use for patients upon arrival in the clinic for optimal patient and public health outcomes. We show that even the use of imperfect POC diagnostics can significantly reduce total costs and number of deaths, provided that the diagnostic gives results quickly enough that patients are likely to return or stay to receive targeted treatment.",

    "abstract": "1. Abstract1.1. ObjectiveStratified medicine requires models of disease risk incorporating genetic and environmental factors. These may combine estimates from different studies and models must be easily updatable when new estimates become available. The logit scale is often used in genetic and environmental association studies however the liability scale is used for polygenic risk scores and measures of heritability, but combining parameters across studies requires a common scale for the estimates.\\n\\n1.2. MethodsWe present equations to approximate the relationship between univariate effect size estimates on the logit scale and the liability scale, allowing model parameters to be translated between scales.\\n\\n1.3. ResultsThese equations are used to build a risk score on the liability scale, using effect size estimates originally estimated on the logit scale. Such a score can then be used in a joint effects model to estimate the risk of disease, and this is demonstrated for schizophrenia using a polygenic risk score and environmental risk factors.\\n\\n1.4. ConclusionThis straightforward method allows conversion of model parameters between the logit and liability scales, and may be a key tool to integrate risk estimates into a comprehensive risk model, particularly for joint models with environmental and genetic risk factors.",
