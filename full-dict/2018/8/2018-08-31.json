    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading genetic cause of renal failure. We have recently shown that inhibiting miR-17~92 is a potential novel therapeutic approach for ADPKD. However, miR-17~92 is a polycistronic cluster that encodes microRNAs (miRNAs) belonging to the miR-17, miR-18, miR-19 and miR-25 families, and the relative pathogenic contribution of these miRNA families to ADPKD progression is unknown. Here we performed an in vivo anti-miR screen to identify the miRNA drug targets within the miR-17~92 miRNA cluster. We designed anti-miRs to individually inhibit miR-17, miR-18, miR-19 or miR-25 families in an orthologous ADPKD model. Treatment with anti-miRs against the miR-17 family reduced cyst proliferation, kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratio and cyst index. In contrast, treatment with anti-miRs against the miR-18, 19, or 25 families did not affect cyst growth. Anti-miR-17 treatment recapitulated the gene expression pattern observed after miR-17~92 genetic deletion and was associated with upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism, suppression of the mTOR pathway, induction of autophagy, and inhibition of cyst-associated inflammation. Our results argue against functional cooperation between the various miR-17~92 cluster families in promoting cyst growth, and instead point to miR-17 family is the primary therapeutic target for ADPKD.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of function from the maternal allele of UBE3A, a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase. UBE3A is only expressed from the maternally-inherited allele in mature human neurons due to tissue-specific genomic imprinting. Imprinted expression of UBE3A is restricted to neurons by expression of UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS) from the paternally-inherited allele, which silences the paternal allele of UBE3A in cis. However, the mechanism restricting UBE3A-ATS expression and UBE3A imprinting to neurons is not understood. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to functionally define a bipartite boundary element critical for neuron-specific expression of UBE3A-ATS in humans. Removal of this element led to upregulation of UBE3A-ATS without repressing paternal UBE3A. However, increasing expression of UBE3A-ATS in the absence of the boundary element resulted in full repression of paternal UBE3A, demonstrating that UBE3A imprinting requires both the loss of function from the boundary element as well as upregulation of UBE3A-ATS. These results suggest that manipulation of the competition between UBE3A-ATS and UBE3A may provide a potential therapeutic approach for AS.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAngelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of function from the maternal allele of UBE3A, an imprinted gene. The paternal allele of UBE3A is silenced by a long, non-coding antisense transcript in mature neurons. We have identified a boundary element that stops the transcription of the antisense transcript in human pluripotent stem cells, and thus restricts UBE3A imprinted expression to neurons. We further determined that UBE3A imprinting requires both the loss of the boundary function and sufficient expression of the antisense transcript to silence paternal UBE3A. These findings provide essential details about the mechanisms of UBE3A imprinting that may suggest additional therapeutic approaches for Angelman syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) contains information on an individuals immune past, present and potential in the form of the evolving sequences that encode the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. AIRR sequencing (AIRR-seq) studies rely on databases of known BCR germline variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes to detect somatic mutations in AIRR-seq data via comparison to the best-aligning database alleles. However, it has been shown that these databases are far from complete, leading to systematic misidentification of mutated positions in subsets of sample sequences. We previously presented TIgGER, a computational method to identify subject-specific V gene genotypes, including the presence of novel V gene alleles, directly from AIRR-seq data. However, the original algorithm was unable to detect alleles that differed by more than 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a database allele. Here we present and apply an improved version of the TIgGER algorithm which can detect alleles that differ by any number of SNPs from the nearest database allele, and can construct subject-specific genotypes with minimal prior information. TIgGER predictions are validated both computationally (using a leave-one-out strategy) and experimentally (using genomic sequencing), resulting in the addition of three new immunoglobulin heavy chain V (IGHV) gene alleles to the IMGT repertoire. Finally, we develop a Bayesian strategy to provide a confidence estimate associated with genotype calls. All together, these methods allow for much higher accuracy in germline allele assignment, an essential step in AIRR-seq studies.",

Despite the important roles of miRNAs in regulating TM function and aqueous outflow, it remains unclear how miRNA and their target genes interact in response to physiological cyclic mechanical stretch. We aimed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and their potential targets in human TM cells in response to cyclic mechanical stress.\\n\\nMethodsMonolayers of TM cells from non-glaucomatous donors (n=3-6) were cultured in the presence or absence of 15% mechanical stretch, 1 cycle/s, for 6 or 24-hours using computer-controlled Flexcell Unit. We profiled the expression of 800 miRNAs using NanoString Human miRNA assays and identified differentially expressed miRNAs using the Bioconductor Limma package. We identified differentially expressed genes using Operon Human Oligo Arrays with GeneSpring software. Pathway analysis with WebGestalt identified stretch-related pathways. We used Integrative miRNA Target Finder from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify potential miRNA-mRNA regulations.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 540 unique genes and 74 miRNAs with differential expression in TM cells upon cyclic mechanical stretch. Pathway analysis indicated the significant enrichment of genes involved in Wnt-signaling, receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling, TGF-{beta} pathway, and response to unfolded protein. We also identified several miRNA master regulators, including miR-19b-3p and miR-93-5p, which may act as switches to control several mechano-responsive genes.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study suggests that cyclic mechanical stress of TM cells triggers alterations in the expression of both mRNAs and miRNAs implicated in glaucoma-associated pathways.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres and the shelterin complex cap and protect the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres are flanked by the subtelomeric sequences that have also been implicated in telomere regulation, although their role is not well defined. Here we show that, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the telo-mere-associated sequences (TAS) present on most subtelomeres are hyper-recombinogenic, have metastable nucleosomes, and unusual low levels of H3K9 methylation. Ccq1, a subunit of shelter-in, protects TAS from nucleosome loss by recruiting the heterochromatic repressor complexes CLRC and SHREC, thereby linking nucleosome stability to gene silencing. Nucleosome instability at TAS is independent of telomeric repeats and can be transmitted to an intrachromosomal locus containing an ectopic TAS fragment, indicating that this is an intrinsic property of the underlying DNA sequence. When telomerase recruitment is compromised in cells lacking Ccq1, DNA se-quences present in the TAS promote recombination between chromosomal ends, independent of nucleosome abundance, implying an active function of these sequences in telomere maintenance. We propose that Ccq1 and fragile subtelomeres co-evolved to regulate telomere plasticity by con-trolling nucleosome occupancy and genome stability.",

    "abstract": "The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori activates the NF-{kappa}B pathway in human epithelial cells via the -kinase 1 (Alpk1)-TIFA axis. We and others have previously shown that heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP) acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). HBP is an intermediate of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in H. pylori and other gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of the hldE (rfaE) gene encoding the enzyme responsible for HBP synthesis, as well as deletion of further upstream genes, causes loss of NF-{kappa}B stimulation by H. pylori, while deletion of the downstream phosphatase encoding gene gmhB does not. This has led to the conclusion that HBP is the PAMP responsible for NF-{kappa}B induction. Here, our attempts to identify HBP in lysates of H. pylori revealed surprisingly low amounts that fail to explain NF-{kappa}B activation. Instead, we identified ADP heptose, a major downstream metabolite of HdlE, as the predominant PAMP in H. pylori lysates, exhibiting [~]100-fold stronger activity compared to HBP. It therefore appears that synthesis of ADP heptose from HBP in H. pylori occurs independently of GmhB. The data lead us to conclude that ADP heptose constitutes the key PAMP, secreted via the pathogens cagPAI encoded type 4 secretion (T4SS).",

We systematically examine here properties of the electrical connectome of the nematode C. elegans through a genome- and nervous system-wide analysis of the expression pattern of the central components of invertebrate electrical synapses, the innexins, revealing highly complex combinatorial patterns of innexin expression throughout the nervous system. We find that the complex expression patterns of 12 out of 14 neuronally expressed innexins change in a strikingly neuron type-specific manner throughout most of the nervous system, if animals encounter harsh environmental conditions and enter the dauer arrest stage. We systematically describe the plasticity of locomotory patterns of dauer stage animals and, by analyzing several individual electrical synapses, we demonstrate that dauer stage-specific electrical synapse remodeling is responsible for specific aspects of the altered locomotory patterns as well as altered chemosensory behavior of dauer stage animals. We describe an intersectional gene regulatory mechanism, involving terminal selector and FoxO transcription factors that are responsible for inducing innexin expression changes in a neuron type- and environment-specific manner. Taken together, our studies illustrate the remarkably dynamic nature of electrical synapses on a nervous system-wide level and describe regulatory strategies for how these alterations are achieved.",

    "abstract": "Despite compelling evidence that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) promotes cortical MAPT (tau) aggregation in familial and idiopathic Alzheimers disease (AD), murine models of cerebral amyloidosis are not considered to develop tau-associated pathology. The absence of neurofibrillary lesions in amyloidosis mice remains a challenge for the amyloidocentric paradigm of AD pathogenesis. It has resulted in the generation of transgenic mice harboring mutations in their tau gene, which may be inappropriate for studying a disease with no known TAU mutations, such as AD. Here, we have used APPswe/PS1{Delta}E9 mice to show that tau pathology can develop spontaneously in murine models of familial AD. Tauopathy was abundant around A{beta} deposits, with Gallyas- and thioflavin-S-positive perinuclear inclusions accumulating in the APPswe/PS1{Delta}E9 cortex by 18 months of age. Age-dependent increases in Gallyas signal correlated positively with binding levels of the paired helical filament (PHF) ligand [18F]Flortaucipir, in all brain areas examined. Sarkosyl-insoluble PHFs were visualized by electron microscopy. Tandem mass tag proteomics identified sequences of hyperphosphorylated tau in transgenic mice, along with signs of RNA missplicing, ribosomal dysregulation and disturbed energy metabolism. Human frontal gyrus tissue was used to validate these findings, revealing primarily quantitative differences between the tauopathy observed in AD patient vs. transgenic mouse tissue. Levels of tau mRNA were not different between APPswe/PS1{Delta}E9 and littermate control animals. As physiological levels of endogenous,  wild-type tau aggregate secondarily to A{beta} in transgenic mice, this study demonstrates that amyloidosis is both necessary and sufficient to drive tauopathy in experimental models of familial AD.",

The ovary is one of few adult tissues that exhibit cyclical changes. Ovarian follicles, the basic units of ovary, are composed of a single oocyte surrounded by expanding layers of granulosa and theca cells. Granulosa cells (GCs) produce sex steroids and growth factors, which facilitate the development of the follicle and maturation of the oocyte. It has been reported that YAP is highly expressed in human GC tumors, but the role of YAP in normal ovarian follicle development is largely unknown. In current study, we examined YAP expression in bovine ovaries. We demonstrate that downstream hippo signaling effector protein, YAP and transcription co-activator, TAZ, are present and localization of both YAP and TAZ are density-dependent. Likewise, YAP and TAZ are critically involved in granulosa cell proliferation. Furthermore, reducing YAP in granulosa cells inhibits FSH-induced aromatase expression and estradiol biosynthesis. The data suggest that YAP plays an important role in the development of ovarian follicles and estradiol synthesis, which are necessary for maintaining normal ovarian function.",

    "abstract": "Many clades that span the marine-freshwater boundary are disproportionately more diverse in the younger, shorter-lived, and scarcer freshwater environments than they are in the marine realm. This disparity is thought to be related to differences in diversification rates between marine and freshwater lineages. However, marine and freshwaters are not ecologically homogeneous, so the study of diversification across the salinity divide should also account for other potentially interacting variables. In diatoms, freshwater and substrate-associated (benthic) lineages are several-fold more diverse than their marine and suspended (planktonic) counterparts. These imbalances provide an excellent system to understand whether these variables interact with diversification. Using multistate hidden-state speciation and extinction models we found that freshwater lineages diversify faster than marine lineages regardless of whether they inhabit the plankton or the benthos. Freshwater lineages also had higher turnover rates (speciation + extinction), suggesting that habitat transitions impact speciation and extinction rates jointly. The plankton-benthos contrast was also consistent with state-dependent diversification, but with modest differences in diversification and turnover rates. Asymmetric, and bidirectional transitions rejected hypotheses about the plankton and freshwaters as absorbing, inescapable habitats. Our results further suggest that the high turnover rate of freshwater diatoms is related to high turnover of freshwater systems themselves.",

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium with an S-layer covering its peptidoglycan cell wall. The S-layer in C. difficile is constructed mainly of S-layer protein A (SlpA), which is a key virulence factor and an absolute requirement for disease. S-layer biogenesis is a complex multi-step process, disruption of which has severe consequences for the bacterium. We examined the subcellular localization of SlpA secretion and S-layer growth; observing formation of S-layer at specific sites that coincide with cell wall synthesis, while the secretion of SlpA from the cell is relatively delocalized. We conclude that this delocalized secretion of SlpA leads to a pool of precursor in the cell wall which is available to repair openings in the S-layer formed during cell growth or following damage.",

    "abstract": "The radial unit hypothesis provides a framework for global (proliferation) and regional (distribution) expansion of the primate cerebral cortex. Using principal component analysis (PCA), we have identified cortical regions with shared variance in their surface area and cortical thickness, respectively, segmented from magnetic resonance images obtained in 23,800 participants. We then carried out meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of the first two principal components for each phenotype. For surface area (but not cortical thickness), we have detected strong associations between each of the components and single nucleotide polymorphisms in a number of gene loci. The first (global) component was associated mainly with loci on chromosome 17 (9.5e-32 [&le;] p [&le;] 2.8e-10), including those detected previously as linked with intracranial volume and/or general cognitive function. The second (regional) component captured shared variation in the surface area of the primary and adjacent secondary visual cortices and showed a robust association with polymorphisms in a locus on chromosome 14 containing Disheveled Associated Activator of Morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1; p=2.4e-34). DAAM1 is a key component in the planar-cell-polarity signaling pathway. In follow-up studies, we have focused on the latter finding and established that: (1) DAAM1 is highly expressed between 12th and 22nd post-conception weeks in the human cerebral cortex; (2) genes co-expressed with DAAM1 in the primary visual cortex are enriched in mitochondria-related pathways; and (3) volume of the lateral geniculate nucleus, which projects to regions of the visual cortex staining for cytochrome oxidase (a mitochondrial enzyme), correlates with the surface area of the visual cortex in major-allele homozygotes but not in carriers of the minor allele. Altogether, we speculate that, in concert with thalamocortical input to cortical subplate, DAAM1 enables migration of neurons to cytochrome-oxidase rich regions of the visual cortex, and, in turn, facilitates regional expansion of this set of cortical regions during development.",

Results on pan-cancer gene expression data and DNA methylation data from over 11,000 samples demonstrate significant improvement over standard denoising autoencoder for both data missing-at-random cases with a range of missing percentages, and missing-not-at-random cases based on expression level and GC-content.

    "abstract": "The high frequency of modern travel has led to concerns about a devastating pandemic since a lethal pathogen strain could spread worldwide quickly. Many historical pandemics have arisen following pathogen evolution to a more virulent form. However, some pathogen strains invoke immune responses that provide partial cross-immunity against infection with related strains. Here, we consider a mathematical model of successive outbreaks of two strains - a low virulence strain outbreak followed by a high virulence strain outbreak. Under these circumstances, we investigate the impacts of varying travel rates and cross-immunity on the probability that a major epidemic of the high virulence strain occurs, and the size of that outbreak. Frequent travel between subpopulations can lead to widespread immunity to the high virulence strain, driven by exposure to the low virulence strain. As a result, major epidemics of the high virulence strain are less likely, and can potentially be smaller, with more connected subpopulations. Cross-immunity may be a factor contributing to the absence of a global pandemic as severe as the 1918 influenza pandemic in the century since.",

By comparing TF-TWAS models to base models that use only gene cis information, we are able to estimate possible mechanisms of the TF polymorphism effect - TF expression or binding affinity within four tissues - whole blood, liver, brain hippocampus and coronary artery.\\n\\nWe identified 48 genes where the TF-TWAS models explain significantly better their expression than cis models alone in at least one of the four tissues. Sixteen of these genes are associated with various diseases, including cancer, neurological, psychiatric and rare genetic diseases.

    "abstract": "Although optimal decision-making is essential for sports performance and fine motor control, it has been repeatedly confirmed that humans show a strong risk-seeking bias, selecting a risky strategy over an optimal solution. Despite such evidence, the ideal method to promote optimal decision-making remains unclear. Here, we propose that interactions with other people can influence motor decision-making and improve risk-seeking bias. We developed a competitive reaching game (a variant of the \"chicken game\") in which aiming for greater rewards increased the risk of no reward and subjects competed for the total reward with their opponent. The game resembles situations in sports, such as a penalty kick in soccer, service in tennis, the strike zone in baseball, or take-off in ski jumping. In five different experiments, we demonstrated that, at the beginning of the competitive game, the subjects robustly switched their risk-seeking strategy to a risk-averse strategy. Following the reversal of the strategy, the subjects achieved optimal decision-making when competing with risk-averse opponents. This optimality was achieved by a non-linear influence of an opponents decisions on a subjects decisions. These results suggest that interactions with others can alter human motor decision strategies and that competition with a risk-averse opponent is key for optimizing motor decision-making.",

We distinguish a core subset following a promoter-specific hyperbolic response. Within this group, we sort genes with regard to their responsiveness to the global regulatory program to show that those with a particularly sensitive linear response are located near the origin of replication.

    "abstract": "Mathematical models provide a rational basis to inform how, where and when to control disease. Assuming an accurate spatially-explicit simulation model can be fitted to spread data, it is straightforward to use it to test the performance of a range of management strategies. However, the typical complexity of simulation models and the vast set of possible controls mean that only a small subset of all possible strategies can ever be tested. An alternative approach - optimal control theory - allows the very best control to be identified unambiguously. However, the complexity of the underpinning mathematics means that disease models used to identify this optimum must be very simple. We highlight two frameworks for bridging the gap between detailed epidemic simulations and optimal control theory: open-loop and model predictive control. Both these frameworks approximate a simulation model with a simpler model more amenable to mathematical analysis. Using an illustrative example model we show the benefits of using feedback control, in which the approximation and control are updated as the epidemic progresses. Our work illustrates a new methodology to allow the insights of optimal control theory to inform practical disease management strategies, with the potential for application to diseases of plants, animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the sharp decline in global under-5 deaths since 1990, uneven progress has been achieved across and within countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the Millennium Development Goals targets for child mortality were met only by a few countries, and recently new targets were set in goals for Sustainable Development that include the eradication of preventable deaths by reducing neonatal and under-5 mortality rates to at least as low 12 and 25 per 1000 live births by 2030, respectively. As the reduction of preventable deaths has a direct impact on their age distribution, the foci of this study are assessing age patterns, trends over time, and forecasts of mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa.\\n\\nMethods and findingsData came from 104 nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys with full birth histories from 31 Sub-Saharan African countries from 1990 to 2016 (a total of 448 country-years of data). We assessed the distribution of age at death through the following demographic model. First, we used a direct method for the estimation of death rates with full-birth histories from survey data to construct age profiles of under-5 mortality on a monthly basis. Second, a two-dimensional P-spline approach was used to smooth out raw estimates of death rates by age and time. Third, a variant of the Lee-Carter model, designed for populations with limited data, was used to fit and forecast age profiles of mortality. We used mortality estimates from the United Nations Inter-agency group for Child Mortality Estimation to adjust, validate and minimize the risk of bias in survival, truncation, and recall in mortality estimation.\\n\\nOur study has three salient findings. First, we observe a monotonous decline of death rates at every age in most countries, but with notable differences in the age-patterns over time. Second, our projections of continued decline of child mortality differ from existing estimates from the United Nations Inter-agency group for Child Mortality Estimation in 5 countries for both neonatal and under-5 mortality. Finally, we predict that only 5 countries (Guinea, Liberia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) are on track to achieve the sustainable development goal targets on child mortality by 2030. Poor data quality issues that include bias in the report of births and deaths, or age heaping, remain a limitation of this study.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study is the first to combine full birth history data and mortality estimates from external reliable sources to model age patterns of under-5 mortality across time in Sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that countries with a rapid pace of mortality reduction across ages would be more likely to achieve the sustainable development goal targets of child mortality reduction. Our mortality model predicts that if neonatal and under-5 deaths decline at the rates observed during the last 25 years, only 5 countries would reach those targets by 2030, 15 would achieve them between 2030 and 2050, and 11 afterwards.",

    "abstract": "PurposeLocal physical and social environment has a defining influence on individual behaviour and health-related outcomes. However, it remains undetermined if its impact is independent of individual socioeconomic status. In this study, we evaluated the spatial distribution of mammography adherence in the state of Geneva (Switzerland) using individual-level data and assessed its independence from socioeconomic status (SES).\\n\\nMethodsGeo-referenced individual-level data from the population-based cross-sectional Bus Sante study (n = 5,002) were used to calculate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and investigate the spatial dependence of mammography adherence. Spatial clusters are reported without adjustment; adjusted for neighbourhood income and individual educational attainment; and demographic factors (age and Swiss nationality). The association between adjusted clusters and the proximity to the nearest screening centre was also evaluated.\\n\\nResultsMammography adherence was not randomly distributed throughout Geneva with clusters geographically coinciding with known SES distributions. After adjustment for SES indicators, clusters were reduced to 56.2% of their original size (n = 1,033). Adjustment for age and nationality further reduced the number of individuals exhibiting spatially dependent behaviour (36.5% of the initial size). The identified SES-independent hot spots and cold-spots of mammography adherence were not explained by proximity to the nearest screening centre.\\n\\nConclusionsSES and demographic factors play an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of mammography adherence. However, the spatial clusters persisted after confounder adjustment indicating that additional neighbourhood-level determinants could influence mammography adherence and be the object of targeted public health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Speciation with gene flow is an alternative to the nascence of new taxa in strict allopatric separation. Indeed, many taxa have parapatric distributions at present. It is often unclear if these are secondary contacts, e.g. caused by past glaciation cycles or the manifestation of speciation with gene flow, which hampers our understanding of how different forces drive diversification. Here we studied genetic, phenotypic and ecological aspects of divergence in a pair of incipient species, the Kentish (Charadrius alexandrinus) and the white-faced Plovers (C. dealbatus), shorebirds with parapatric breeding ranges along the Chinese coast. We assessed divergence based on molecular markers with different modes of inheritance and quantified phenotypic and ecological divergence in aspects of morphometric, dietary and climatic niches. These analyses revealed small to moderate levels of genetic and phenotypic distinctiveness with symmetric gene flow across the contact area at the Chinese coast. The two species diverged approximately half a million years ago in dynamical isolation and secondary contact due to cycling sea level changes between the Eastern and Southern China Sea in the mid-late Pleistocene. We found evidence of character displacement and ecological niche differentiation between the two species, invoking the role of selection in facilitating divergence despite gene flow. These findings imply that the ecology can indeed counter gene flow through divergent selection and thus contribute to incipient speciation in these plovers. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of using integrative datasets to reveal the evolutionary history and underlying mechanisms of speciation.",

In cell-based studies, we show that glucocorticoid signaling - a consequence of psychological stress in humans - is sufficient to induce mtDNA extrusion in a time frame consistent with human psychophysiology.

It is a well-controlled and universal method which can efficiently determine the optimal range of phase modulation that minimizing speckle noise while maximizing image resolution and signal strength for different systems and/or samples.

Despite three decades of research, the spatial extent of the cortical area activated by TMS is still controversial. Moreover, how TMS interacts with task-related activity during motor behavior is unknown. We applied single-pulse TMS over the macaque parietal cortex while recording single-unit activity at various distances from the center of stimulation during grasping. The spatial extent of the TMS-induced activation was remarkably restricted, affecting single neurons in a volume of cortex measuring less than 2 mm. In task-related neurons, TMS evoked a transient excitation followed by reduced activity, which was paralleled by a significantly longer grasping time. Furthermore, TMS- induced activity and task-related activity did not summate in single neurons. These results furnish crucial experimental evidence for the neural basis of the TMS effect at the single-cell level and uncover, the neural underpinnings of behavioral effects of TMS.",

    "abstract": "A quintessential challenge for any perceptual system is the need to focus on task-relevant information without being blindsided by unexpected, yet important information. The human visual system incorporates several solutions to this challenge, one of which is a reflexive covert attention system that is rapidly responsive to both the physical salience and the task-relevance of new information. This paper presents a model that simulates behavioral and neural correlates of reflexive attention as the product of brief neural attractor states that are formed across the visual hierarchy when attention is engaged. Such attractors emerge from an attentional gradient distributed over a population of topographically organized neurons and serve to focus processing at one or more locations in the visual field, while inhibiting the processing of lower priority information. The model moves towards a resolution of key debates about the nature of reflexive attention, such as whether it is parallel or serial, and whether suppression effects are distributed in a spatial surround, or selectively at the location of distractors. Most importantly, the model develops a framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of visual attention as a spatiotopic decision process within a hierarchy and links them to observable correlates such as accuracy, reaction time, and the N2pc and PD components of the EEG. This last contribution is the most crucial for repairing the disconnect that exists between our understanding of behavioral and neural correlates of attention.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe exponential growth of assembled genome sequences greatly benefits metagenomics studies. However, currently available methods struggle to manage the increasing amount of sequences and their frequent updates. Indexing the current RefSeq can take days and hundreds of GB of memory on large servers. Few methods address these issues thus far, and even though many can theoretically handle large amounts of references, time/memory requirements are prohibitive in practice. As a result, many studies that require sequence classification use often outdated and almost never truly up-to-date indices.\n\nResultsMotivated by those limitations we created ganon, a k-mer based read classification tool that uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer counting/filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for indexing references, keeping them updated. It requires less than 55 minutes to index the complete RefSeq of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. The tool can further keep these indices up-to-date in a fraction of the time necessary to create them. Ganon makes it possible to query against very large reference sets and therefore it classifies significantly more reads and identifies more species than similar methods. When classifying a high-complexity CAMI challenge dataset against complete genomes from RefSeq, ganon shows strongly increased precision with equal or better sensitivity compared with state-of-the-art tools. With the same dataset against the complete RefSeq, ganon improved the F1-Score by 65% at the genus level. It supports taxonomy- and assembly-level classification, multiple indices and hierarchical classification.\n\nAvailabilityThe software is open-source and available at: https://gitlab.com/rki_bioinformatics/ganon\n\nContactbernhard.renard@hpi.de",

To better understand the roles of protein associations with this structured intronic region, we undertook a combined bioinformatics (motif searching) and experimental analysis (biotin pulldowns and RNA immunoprecipitations) of protein binding. Result: Characterization of the ribonucleoprotein composition of this region revealed several human proteins as interactors: regulatory proteins hnRNP A1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1), hnRNP U, HuR (human antigen R), and PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor), as well as, unexpectedly, the cytoskeletal protein actin. Treatment of EBV-infected cells with drugs that alter actin polymerization specifically showed marked effects on splicing in this region. This suggests a potentially novel role for nuclear actin in regulation of viral RNA splicing.",

    "abstract": "Background Little is known about the long-term patterns of body size evolution in Crocodylomorpha, the &gt; 200-million-year-old group that includes living crocodylians and their extinct relatives. Extant crocodylians are mostly large-bodied (3\u20137 m) predators. However, extinct crocodylomorphs exhibit a wider range of phenotypes, and many of the earliest taxa were much smaller (&lt; 1.2 m). This suggests a pattern of size increase through time that could be caused by multi-lineage evolutionary trends of size increase or by selective extinction of small-bodied species. In this study, we characterise patterns of crocodylomorph body size evolution using a model fitting-approach (with cranial measurements serving as proxies). We also estimate body size disparity through time and quantitatively test hypotheses of biotic and abiotic factors as potential drivers of crocodylomorph body size evolution.Results Crocodylomorphs reached an early peak in body size disparity during the Late Jurassic, and underwent essentially continually decreases in disparity since then. A multi-peak Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model outperforms all other evolutionary models fitted to our data (including both uniform and non-uniform), indicating that the macroevolutionary dynamics of crocodylomorph body size are better described within the concept of an adaptive landscape, with most body size variation emerging after shifts to new macroevolutionary regimes (analogous to adaptive zones). We did not find support for a consistent evolutionary trend towards larger sizes among lineages (i.e., Cope\u2019s rule), or strong correlations of body size with climate. Instead, the intermediate to large body sizes of some crocodylomorphs are better explained by group-specific adaptations. In particular, the evolution of a more aquatic lifestyle (especially marine) correlates with increases in average body size, though not without exceptions.Conclusions Shifts between macroevolutionary regimes provide a better explanation of crocodylomorph body size evolution than do climatic factors, suggesting a central role for lineage-specific adaptations rather than climatic forcing. Shifts leading to larger body sizes occurred in most aquatic and semi-aquatic groups. This, combined with extinctions of groups occupying smaller body size regimes (particularly during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic), gave rise to the upward-shifted body size distribution of extant crocodylomorphs compared to their smaller-bodied terrestrial ancestors.AbbreviationsCranial measurementsDCLdorsal cranial lengthODCLorbito-cranial lengthEvolutionary modelsBMBrownian motionEBEarly burstOUOrnstein-UhlenbeckBMSmulti-regime BM model that allows parameter \u03c32 to varyOUMVmulti-regime OU model that allows \u03b8 and \u03c32 to varyOUMAmulti-regime OU model in which \u03b8 and \u03b1 can varyOUMVAOU model in which all three parameters (\u03b8, \u03b1 and \u03c32) can varyModel parameters\u03b8trait optimum of OU-based models\u03b1attraction parameter of OU-based models\u03c32Brownian variance or rate parameter of BM or OU-based models\u03bcevolutionary trend parameter of BM-based modelsZ0estimated trait value at the root of the tree of OU-based modelsOptimality criteriaAICAkaike\u2019s information criterionAICcAkaike\u2019s information criterion for finite sample sizesBICBayesian information criterionpBICphylogenetic Bayesian information criterionView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based materials can potentially be used as biomechanical matrices for regenerative medicine implants including the replacement of intervertebral (IV) discs. Glycerol and other plasticizers (low-MW PEG, propylene glycol, and sorbitol) were added to the bulk PEG matrix, gelled using chemical and photochemical methods at different temperature and pressure settings, and compression properties acquired and analyzed. Incorporation of surface bioactive glass particles shortened the blood clotting time, while alginate and laponite additives improved the gels mechanical properties to 645 kPa compressive modulus, 12% yield strain, and 79 kPa yield strength. This IV disc-modeled system endured the cyclic loading and unloading test indicative of an elastic response; but required improvement of its biomechanical tolerance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman visual cortical area hMT+, like its homologue MT in the macaque monkey, has been shown to be particularly selective to visual motion. After damage to the primary visual cortex (V1), patients often exhibit preserved ability to detect moving stimuli, which is associated with neural activity in area hMT+. As an anatomical substrate underlying residual function in the absence of V1, promoting functional plasticity in hMT+ could potentially boost visual performance despite cortical damage.\\n\\nObjectiveTo establish in healthy participants whether it is possible to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over hMT+ to potentiate learning of visual motion direction discrimination.\\n\\nMethodsParticipants were trained daily for five days on a visual motion direction discrimination task. Task difficulty was increased as performance improved, by decreasing the proportion of coherently moving dots, such that participants were always performing at psychophysical threshold. tDCS, either anodal or sham, was applied daily during the 20-minute training session. Task performance was assessed at baseline and at the end of the training period.\\n\\nResultsAll participants showed improved task performance both during and after training. Contrary to our hypothesis, anodal tDCS did not further improve performance compared to sham stimulation. Bayesian statistics indicated significant evidence in favour of the null hypothesis.\\n\\nConclusionAnodal tDCS to hMT+ does not enhance visual motion direction discrimination learning in the young healthy visual system.",

    "abstract": "Consistent estimation of associations in microbial genomic survey count data is fundamental to microbiome research. Technical limitations, including compositionality, low sample sizes, and technical variability, obstruct standard application of association measures and require data normalization prior to estimating associations. Here, we investigate the interplay between data normalization and microbial association estimation by a comprehensive analysis of statistical consistency. Leveraging the large sample size of the American Gut Project (AGP), we assess the consistency of the two prominent linear association estimators, correlation and proportionality, under different sample scenarios and data normalization schemes, including RNA-seq analysis work flows and log-ratio transformations. We show that shrinkage estimation, a standard technique in high-dimensional statistics, can universally improve the quality of association estimates for microbiome data. We find that large-scale association patterns in the AGP data can be grouped into five normalization-dependent classes. Using microbial association network construction and clustering as examples of exploratory data analysis, we show that variance-stabilizing and log-ratio approaches provide for the most consistent estimation of taxonomic and structural coherence. Taken together, the findings from our reproducible analysis workflow have important implications for microbiome studies in multiple stages of analysis, particularly when only small sample sizes are available.",

    "abstract": "Large COPII-coated vesicles serve to convey the large cargo procollagen I (PC1) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The link between large cargo in the lumen of the ER and modulation of the COPII machinery remains unresolved. TANGO1 is required for procollagen (PC) secretion and interacts with PC and COPII on opposite sides of the ER membrane, but evidence suggests that TANGO1 is retained in the ER, and not included in normal size (<100nm) COPII vesicles. Here we show that TANGO1 is exported out of the ER in large COPII-coated PC1 carriers, and retrieved back to the ER by the retrograde coat, COPI, mediated by the C-terminal RDEL retrieval sequence of HSP47. TANGO1 is known to target the COPII initiation factor SEC12 to ER exit sites through an interacting protein, cTAGE5. SEC12 is important for the growth of COPII vesicles, but it is not sorted into small budded vesicles. We found both cTAGE5 and SEC12 were exported with TANGO1 in large COPII carriers. In contrast to its exclusion from small transport vesicles, SEC12 was particularly enriched around ER membranes and large COPII carriers that contained PC1. We constructed a split GFP system to recapitulate the targeting of SEC12 to PC1 via the luminal domain of TANGO1. The minimal targeting system enriched SEC12 around PC1 and generated large PC1 carriers. We conclude that TANGO1, cTAGE5, and SEC12 are co-packed with PC1 into COPII carriers to increase the size of COPII thus ensuring the capture of large cargo.",

    "abstract": "WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling is crucial to all stages of life. It controls early morphogenetic events in embryos, maintains stem-cell niches in adults, and is disregulated in many types of cancer. Despite its ubiquity, little is known about the dynamics of signal transduction or whether it varies across contexts. Here we probe the dynamics of signaling by monitoring nuclear accumulation of {beta}-catenin, the primary transducer of canonical WNT signals, using quantitative live-cell imaging. We show that {beta}-catenin signaling responds adaptively to constant WNT signaling in pluripotent stem cells, and that these dynamics become sustained upon differentiation. Varying dynamics were also observed in the response to WNT in commonly used mammalian cell-lines. Signal attenuation in pluripotent cells is controlled by both intra- and extra-cellular negative regulation of WNT signaling. TGF{beta}-superfamily ligands Activin and BMP, which coordinate with WNT signaling to pattern the gastrula, increase the {beta}-catenin response in a manner independent of their ability to induce new WNT-ligand production. Our results reveal how variables external to the pathway, including differentiation status and crosstalk with other pathways, dramatically alter WNT/{beta}-catenin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have revealed vaccine targets on the viruss Env protein and are themselves promising immunotherapeutics. The efficacy of bnAb-based therapies and vaccines depends in part on how readily the virus can escape neutralization. While structural studies can define contacts between bnAbs and Env, only functional studies can define mutations that confer escape. Here we map how all single amino-acid mutations to Env affect neutralization of HIV by nine bnAbs targeting five epitopes. For most bnAbs, mutations at only a small fraction of structurally defined contact sites mediated escape, and most escape occurred at sites that are near but do not directly contact the antibody. The mutations selected by two pooled bnAbs were similar to those expected from the combination of the bnAbs independent action. Overall, our mutation-level antigenic atlas provides a comprehensive dataset for understanding viral immune escape and refining therapies and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Despite sharing a common architecture with archetypal voltage-gated ion channels (VGIC), the hyperpolarization- and cyclic AMP-activated ion (HCN) channels open upon hyperpolarization rather than depolarization. The basic motions of voltage sensor and pore gates are conserved implying that these domains are inversely coupled in HCN channels. Using structure-guided protein engineering, we systematically assembled an array of mosaic channels that display the full complement of voltage-activation phenotypes observed in the VGIC superfamily. Our studies reveal that the voltage-sensing S3b-S4 transmembrane segment of the HCN channel has an intrinsic ability to drive pore opening in either direction. Specific contacts at the pore-voltage sensor interface and unique interactions near the pore gate forces the HCN channel into a hERG-like inactivated state, thereby obscuring their opening upon depolarization. Our findings reveal an unexpected common principle underpinning voltage gating in the VGIC superfamily and identify the essential determinants of gating polarity.",

    "abstract": "Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is believed to represent a clonal expansion of a transformed skin resident memory T-cell. T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality (i.e. identical sequences of rearranged TCR, {beta} and {gamma}), the key premise of this hypothesis, has been difficult to document conclusively because malignant cells are not readily distinguishable from the tumor infiltrating, reactive lymphocytes, which contribute to the TCR clonotypic repertoire of MF. Here we have successfully adopted the technique of targeted whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing (WES/WTS) to identify the repertoire of rearranged TCR genes in tumor enriched samples from patients with MF. Although most of the investigated biopsies of MF had the expected monoclonal rearrangements of TCR{gamma} of the frequency corresponding to the frequency of tumor cells, in half of the samples we detected multiple (up to seven) TCR and -{beta} clonotypes by WES and WTS. Our findings are compatible with the model in which the initial malignant transformation in MF does not occur in mature, memory T-cells but rather at the level of T-lymphocyte progenitor after TCR{gamma} rearrangement but before TCR{beta} or TCR rearrangements. The WES/WTS method is potentially applicable to other types of T-cell lymphomas and enables comprehensive characterization of the TCR repertoire and mutational landscape in these malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic associations for complex psychiatric disorders and cognitive traits. However, interpretation of most of these findings is complicated by the presence of many significant and highly correlated genetic variants located in non-coding regions. Here, we address this issue by creating a high-resolution map of the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization by applying Hi-C to adult and fetal brain cortex with concomitant RNA-seq, open chromatin (ATAC-seq), and ChIP-seq data (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and CTCF). Extensive analyses established the quality, information content, and salience of these new Hi-C data. We used these data to connect 938 significant genetic loci for schizophrenia, intelligence, ADHD, alcohol dependence, Alzheimers disease, anorexia nervosa, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, and educational attainment to 8,595 genes (with 42.1% of these genes implicated more than once). We show that assigning genes to traits based on proximity provides a limited view of the complexity of GWAS findings and that gene set analyses based on functional genomic data provide an expanded view of the biological processes involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and other complex brain traits.",
