    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advent of in vivo automated single-cell lineaging and sequencing will dramatically increase our understanding of development. New integrative analysis techniques are needed to generate insights from single-cell developmental data.\\n\\nResultsWe applied novel meta-analysis techniques to the EPIC single-cell-resolution developmental gene expression dataset for C. elegans to show that a simple linear combination of the expression levels of the developmental genes is strongly correlated with the developmental age of the organism, irrespective of the cell division rate of different cell lineages. We uncovered a pattern of collective sinusoidal oscillation in gene activation, in multiple dominant frequencies and in multiple orthogonal axes of gene expression, pointing to the existence of a coordinated, multi-frequency global timing mechanism. We developed a novel method based on Fishers Discriminant Analysis (FDA) to identify linear gene expression weightings that are able to produce sinusoidal oscillations of any frequency and phase, adding to the evidence that oscillatory mechanisms likely play an important role in the timing of development. We cross-linked EPIC with gene ontology and anatomy ontology terms, employing FDA methods to identify previously unknown positive and negative genetic contributions to developmental processes and cell phenotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThis meta-analysis demonstrates new evidence for direct linear and/or sinusoidal mechanisms regulating the timing of development. We uncovered a number of previously unknown positive and negative correlations between developmental genes and developmental processes or cell phenotypes. The presented novel analysis techniques are broadly applicable within developmental biology.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells within a tumor are known to display varying degrees of metastatic propensity but the molecular basis underlying such heterogeneity remains unclear. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression data obtained from primary tumors of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients using a novel metastasis biology-based Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Amoeboid Transition (EMAT) gene signature, and identified subtypes associated with distinct prognostic profiles. EMAT subtype status improved prognosis accuracy of clinical parameters and statistically outperformed traditional breast cancer intrinsic subtypes even after adjusting for treatment variables. Additionally, analysis of 3D spheroids from an in vitro isogenic model of breast cancer progression reveals that EMAT subtypes display progression from premalignant to malignant and pre-invasive to invasive cancer. EMAT classification is a biologically informed method to assess metastasis risk in early stage, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEpiretinal prostheses are designed to restore vision in people blinded by photoreceptor degenerative diseases, by directly activating retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) using an electrode array implanted on the retina. In present-day clinical devices, current spread from the stimulating electrode to a distant return electrode often results in the activation of many cells, potentially limiting the quality of artificial vision. In the laboratory, epiretinal activation of RGCs with cellular resolution has been demonstrated with small electrodes, but distant returns may still cause undesirable current spread. Here, the ability of local return stimulation to improve the selective activation of RGCs at cellular resolution was evaluated.\\n\\nApproachA custom multi-electrode array (512 electrodes, 10 m diameter, 60 m pitch) was used to simultaneously stimulate and record from RGCs in isolated primate retina. Stimulation near the RGC soma with a single electrode and a distant return was compared to stimulation in which the return was provided by six neighboring electrodes.\\n\\nMain resultsLocal return stimulation enhanced the capability to activate cells near the central electrode (<30 m) while avoiding cells farther away (>30 m). This resulted in an improved ability to selectively activate ON and OFF cells, including cells encoding immediately adjacent regions in the visual field.\\n\\nSignificanceThese results suggest that a device that restricts the electric field through local returns could optimize activation of neurons at cellular resolution, improving the quality of artificial vision.\\n\\nNovelty & SignificanceThe effectiveness of local return stimulation for enhancing the electrical activation of retinal neurons was tested using high-density multi-electrode recording and stimulation in isolated macaque retina. The results suggest that local returns may reduce unwanted evoked activity and thus optimize the selectivity of stimulation at cellular resolution. Similar patterns could be implemented in a future high-resolution prosthesis to permit a more faithful replication of normal retinal activity for the treatment of incurable blindness.",

    "abstract": "Swarming colonies of the light responsive bacteria Serratia marcescens grown on agar exhibit robust fluctuating large-scale collective flows that include arrayed vortices, jets, and sinuous streamers. We study the immobilization and quenching of these large-scale flows when the moving swarm is exposed to light with a substantial ultra-violet component. We map the response to light in terms of two independent parameters - the light intensity and duration of exposure and identify the conditions under which mobility is affected significantly. For small exposure times and/or low intensities, we find collective mobility to be negligibly affected. Increasing exposure times and/or intensity to higher values temporarily suppresses collective mobility. Terminating exposure allows bacteria regain motility and eventually reestablish large scale flows. For long exposure times or at high intensities, exposed bacteria become paralyzed, with macroscopic speeds eventually reducing to zero. In this process, they form highly aligned, jammed domains. Individual domains eventually coalesce into a large macroscopic domain with mean radial extent growing as the square root of exposure time. Post exposure, active bacteria dislodge exposed bacteria from these jammed configurations; initial dissolution rates are found to be strongly dependent on duration of exposure suggesting that caging effects are substantial at higher exposure times. Based on our experimental observations, we propose a minimal Brownian dynamics model to examine the escape of exposed bacteria from the region of exposure. Our results complement studies on planktonic bacteria and inform models for pattern formation in gradated illumination.",

    "abstract": "Trophic interactions in the microbial food web of soils are crucial for nutrient and carbon cycling. Traditionally, protozoa are considered the major micropredators of bacteria in soil. However, some prokaryotes, such as Myxobacteria and Bdellovibrio are also famous for bacterivorous life style. Until recently, it was impossible to assess the abundance of pro- and eukaryotic micropredators in soils simultaneously. Using a metatranscriptomic three-domain profiling of small subunit ribosomal RNA we investigated the abundance of bacterivores in 28 datasets from eleven European mineral and organic soils of different climatic zones. In all soils, Myxobacteria comprised a significant proportion from 4 - 19% of prokaryotic 16S rRNA transcripts and more than 60% of all bacterivores in most soils. Haliangiaceae and Polyangiaceae were most abundant, while the name-giving Myxococcaceae were barely present. Other bacterial predators like Bdellovibrio were low abundant. Also Protozoan micropredator 18S rRNA transcripts, e.g. from Cercozoa, Amoebozoa and Ciliophora, were on average less abundant, especially in mineral soils. Nematodes were even less abundant. In addition, we applied a longitudinal approach to identify bacterivores during beech litter colonisation. Here, Myxobacteria showed prey-dependent, protozoa-like community dynamics during colonisation. Thus, their broad prey range and high abundance suggests a major influence of Myxobacteria on structuring the prokaryotic community composition in soil, and might warrant their classification as keystone taxon. Our results suggest the presence of an ecologically important \\\"bacterial loop\\\" in soil food webs, independent of protozoa and nematodes.",

Unaffected at-risk groups have also been studied in an attempt to identify brain changes that do not reflect reverse causation or treatment effects. However, no robust associations have been observed between neuroanatomical phenotypes and known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. We tested subcortical brain volume differences between 49 unaffected participants carrying at least one of the 12 copy number variants associated with schizophrenia in UK Biobank and 9,063 individuals who did not carry any of the 93 copy number variants reported to be pathogenic. Our results show that CNV carriers have reduced volume in some of the subcortical structures previously shown to be reduced in schizophrenia. Moreover, these associations were partially accounted for by the association between pathogenic copy number variants and cognitive impairment, which is one of the features of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Most adaptive behaviors require precise tracking of targets in space. In pursuit behavior with a moving target, mice use distance to target to guide their own movement continuously. Here we show that in the sensorimotor striatum, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can represent the distance between self and target during pursuit behavior, while striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which receive FSI projections, can represent self-velocity. FSIs are shown to regulate velocity-related SPN activity during pursuit, so that movement velocity is continuously modulated by distance to target. Moreover, bidirectional manipulation of FSI activity can selectively disrupt performance by increasing or decreasing the self-target distance. Our results reveal a key role of the FSI-SPN interneuron circuit in pursuit behavior, and elucidate how this circuit implements distance to velocity transformation required for the critical underlying computation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionRecently popular sub-perceptual doses of psychedelic substances such as truffles, referred to as microdosing, allegedly have multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults.\\n\\nMethodsDuring a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking, and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were manifested.\\n\\nResultsWe found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected.\\n\\nConclusionWhile this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.",

However, the nature of care coordination and collaboration between caregivers (providers) may also be important in determining patient outcomes. Using data from patients admitted to intensive care units at a large tertiary care hospital, we modeled the caregivers that provided medical service to a specific patient as patient-centric subnetwork embedded within larger caregiver networks of the institute. The caregiver networks were composed of caregivers who treated either a cohort of patients with particular disease or any patient regardless of disease. Our model can generate patient-specific caregiver network features at multiple levels, and we demonstrate that these multilevel network features, in addition to patient-level features, are significant predictors of length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality.",

Here we present whole-genome sequencing data of 4,810 Singaporeans from three diverse ethnic groups: 2,780 Chinese, 903 Malays, and 1,127 Indians. Despite a medium depth of 13.7x, we achieved essentially perfect (>99.8%) sensitivity and accuracy for detecting common variants and good sensitivity (>89%) for detecting extremely rare variants with <0.1% allele frequency. We found 89.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 9.1 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs), more than half of which have not been cataloged in dbSNP. In particular, we found 126 common deleterious mutations (MAF>0.01) that were absent in the existing public databases, highlighting the importance of local population reference for genetic diagnosis. We describe fine-scale genetic structure of Singapore populations and their relationship to worldwide populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. In addition to revealing noticeable amounts of admixture among three Singapore populations and a Malay-related novel ancestry component that has not been captured by the 1000 Genomes Project, our analysis also identified some fine-scale features of genetic structure consistent with two waves of prehistoric migration from south China to Southeast Asia. Finally, we demonstrate that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation not only for Singapore populations, but also for populations across Asia and Oceania. These results highlight the genetic diversity in Singapore and the potential impacts of our data as a resource to empower human genetics discovery in a broad geographic region.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomes cause schistosomiasis, the worlds second most important parasitic disease after malaria. A peculiar feature of schistosomes is their ability to produce viable and fertile hybrids. Originally only present in the tropics, schistosomiasis is now also endemic in Europe. Based on two genetic markers the European species had been identified as a hybrid between the ruminant-infective Schistosoma bovis and the human-infective Schistosoma haematobium.\\n\\nHere we describe for the first time the genomic composition of the European schistosome hybrid (77% of S. haematobium and 23% of S. bovis origins), its morphometric parameters and its compatibility with the European vector snail and intermediate host Compatibility is a key parameter for the parasites life cycle progression. We also show that egg morphology (a classical diagnostic parameter) does not allow for differential diagnosis while genetic tests do so. Additionally, we performed genome assembly improvement and annotation of S. bovis, the parental species for which no satisfactory genome assembly was available.\\n\\nFor the first time since the discovery of hybrid schistosomes, these results reveal at the whole genomic level a complex admixture of parental genomes highlighting (i) the high permeability of schistosomes to other species alleles, and (ii) the importance of hybrid formation for pushing species boundaries not only conceptionally but also geographically.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing of marker genes such as 16S ribosomal RNA is widely used to survey microbial communities. The abundance distribution (AD) of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in a sample is typically summarized by alpha diversity metrics, e.g. richness and entropy, discarding information about the AD shape. In this work, we describe octave plots, histograms which visualize the shape of microbial ADs by binning on a logarithmic scale with base 2. Optionally, histogram bars are colored to indicate possible spurious OTUs due to sequence error and cross-talk. Octave plots enable assessment of (a) the shape and completeness of the distribution, (b) the effects of noise on measured diversity, (c) whether low-abundance OTUs should be discarded, (d) whether alpha diversity metrics and estimators are reliable, and (e) the additional sampling effort (i.e., read depth) required to obtain a complete census of the community. The utility of octave plots is illustrated in a re-analysis of a prostate cancer study showing that the reported core microbiome is most likely an artifact of experimental error.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral reflectance phenotyping and genomic selection are two emerging technologies that have the potential to increase plant breeding efficiency by improving prediction accuracy for grain yield. Hyperspectral cameras quantify canopy reflectance across a wide range of wavelengths that are associated with numerous biophysical and biochemical processes in plants. Genomic selection models utilize genome-wide marker or pedigree information to predict the genetic values of breeding lines. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel GBLUP approach to genomic selection that uses genomic marker-, pedigree-, and hyperspectral reflectance-derived relationship matrices to model the genetic main effects and genotype x environment (G x E) interactions across environments within a bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding program. We utilized an airplane equipped with a hyperspectral camera to phenotype five differentially managed treatments of the yield trials conducted by the Bread Wheat Improvement Program, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) at Ciudad Obregon, Mexico over four breeding cycles. We observed that single-kernel models using hyperspectral reflectance-derived relationship matrices performed similarly or superior to marker-and pedigree-based genomic selection models when predicting within and across environments. Multi-kernel models combining marker/pedigree information with hyperspectral reflectance phentoypes had the highest prediction accuracies; however, improvements in accuracy over marker-and pedigree-based models were marginal when correcting for days to heading. Our results demonstrates the potential of hyperspectral imaging in predicting grain yield within a multi-environment context, it also supports further studies on integration of hyperspectral reflectance phenotyping in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial type 4 pili (T4P) are extracellular polymers that initiate the formation of microcolonies and biofilms. T4P continuously elongate and retract. These pilus dynamics crucially affects the local order, shape, and fluidity of microcolonies. The major pilin subunit of the T4P bears multiple post-translational modifications. By interfering with different steps of the pilin glycosylation and phosphoform modification pathways, we investigated the effect of pilin post-translational modification on the shape and dynamics of microcolonies formed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Deleting the phosphotransferase responsible for phosphoethanolamine modification at residue serine 68 (S68) inhibits shape relaxations of microcolonies after pertubation and causes bacteria carrying the phosphoform modification to segregate to the surface of mixed colonies. We relate these mesoscopic phenotypes to increased attractive forces generated by T4P between cells. Moreover, by deleting genes responsible for the pilin glycan structure, we show that the number of saccharides attached at residue serine 63 (S63) affect the ratio between surface tension and viscosity and cause sorting between bacteria carrying different pilin glycoforms. We conclude that different pilin post-translational modifications moderately affect the attractive forces between bacteria but have severe effects on the materials properties of microcolonies.",
