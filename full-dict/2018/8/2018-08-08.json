    "abstract": "SummaryCryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a mainstream technique for determining the structures of complex biological systems. However, accurate integrative structural modeling has been hampered by the challenges in objectively weighing cryo-EM data against other sources of information due to the presence of random and systematic errors, as well as correlations, in the data. To address these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian scoring function that efficiently and accurately ranks alternative structural models of a macromolecular system based on their consistency with a cryo-EM density map and other experimental and prior information. The accuracy of this approach is benchmarked using complexes of known structure and illustrated in three applications: the structural determination of the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes. The approach is implemented in the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (http://integrativemodeling.org), thus enabling integrative structure determination by combining cryo-EM data with other sources of information.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a modeling approach to integrate cryo-EM data with other sources of information\\nC_LIO_LIWe benchmark our approach using synthetic data on 21 complexes of known structure\\nC_LIO_LIWe apply our approach to the GroEL/GroES, RNA polymerase II, and exosome complexes\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Judgments of the present visual world are affected by what came before. When judgments of visual properties such as orientation are biased in the direction of preceding stimuli, this is called visual serial dependence. Visual serial dependence is thought to arise from mechanisms that support perceptual continuity: because physical properties of an object usually vary smoothly in time, perception might be accurately stabilized by smoothing the perceived features in time. However, mechanisms that support perceptual continuity should be object-specific, because the orientation of one object is more related to its own past than to the past of a distinct object. Thus, we tested the perceptual continuity explanation by comparing the magnitude of serial dependence between objects and within objects. Across three experiments, we manipulated objecthood by varying the color, the location, and both the color and the location of Gabor patches. We observed a serial dependence effect in every experiment but did not observe an effect of objecthood in any experiment. We further observed serial dependence even when the orientations of two successive stimuli were nearly orthogonal. These data are inconsistent with explanations of serial dependence based on visual continuity. We hypothesize that serial dependence arises from a combination of perceptual features and internal response variables, which interact within a common task or decisional context.",

    "abstract": "Neurons project axons to local and distal sites and can display heterogeneous morphologies with limited physical dimensions that may influence the structure of large organelles such as mitochondria. Using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we characterized native environments within axons and presynaptic varicosities to examine whether spatial restrictions within these compartments influence the morphology of mitochondria. Segmented tomographic reconstructions revealed distinctive morphological characteristics of mitochondria residing at the narrowed boundary between presynaptic varicosities and axons with limited physical dimensions (~80 nm), compared to mitochondria in non-spatially restricted environments. Furthermore, segmentation of the tomograms revealed discrete organizations between the inner and outer membranes, suggesting possible independent remodeling of each membrane in mitochondria at spatially restricted axonal/varicosity boundaries. Thus, cryo-ET of mitochondria within axonal subcompartments reveals that spatial restrictions do not obstruct mitochondria from residing within them but limited available space can influence their gross morphology and the organization of the inner and outer membranes. These findings offer new perspectives on the influence of physical and spatial characteristics of cellular environments on mitochondrial morphology and highlights the potential for remarkable structural plasticity of mitochondria to adapt to spatial restrictions within axons.",

    "abstract": "The way that humans and animals perceive the lightness of an object depends on its physical luminance as well as its surrounding context. While neuronal responses throughout the visual pathway are modulated by context, the relationship between neuronal responses and lightness perception is poorly understood. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness by recording responses of neuronal populations in monkey primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 to stimuli that produce a lightness illusion in humans, in which the lightness of a disk depends on the context in which it is embedded. We found that the way individual units encode the luminance (or equivalently for our stimuli, contrast) of the disk and its context is extremely heterogeneous. This motivated us to ask whether the population representation in either V1 or V4 satisfies three criteria: 1) disk luminance is represented with high fidelity, 2) the context surrounding the disk is also represented, and 3) the representations of disk luminance and context interact to create a representation of lightness that depends on these factors in a manner consistent with human psychophysical judgments of disk lightness. We found that populations of units in both V1 and V4 fulfill the first two criteria, but that we cannot conclude that the two types of information in either area interact in a manner that clearly predicts human psychophysical measurements: the interpretation of our population measurements depends on how subsequent areas read out lightness from the population responses.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyA core question in visual neuroscience is how the brain extracts stable representations of object properties from the retinal image. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness perception by determining whether the responses of neuronal populations in primary visual cortex and area V4 could account for a lightness illusion measured using human psychophysics. Our results suggest that comparing psychophysics with population recordings will yield insight into neuronal mechanisms underlying a variety of perceptual phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for the understanding of nuclear architecture and its relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer. However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes, presents challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wide analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We used robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we computed geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compared over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieved accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.",

    "abstract": "Bud sport mutants of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) trees with a highly blushed colouring pattern are mainly caused by the accumulation of anthocyanins in the pericarp. Hormones are important factors modulating anthocyanin accumulation. However, a good understanding of the interplay between hormones and anthocyanin synthesis in apples, especially in mutants at the molecular level, remains elusive. Here, physiological and comparative transcriptome approaches were used to reveal the molecular basis of pericarp pigmentation in  Red Delicious and its mutants, including  Starking Red,  Starkrimson,  Campbell Redchief and  Vallee spur, which were designated G0 to G4, respectively. Pericarp pigmentation gradually proliferated from G0 to G4. The anthocyanin content was higher in the mutants than in  Red Delicious. The activation of early phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes, including ASP3, PAL, 4CL, PER, CHS, CYP98A and F3H, was responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in mutants. In addition, IAA and ABA had a positive regulatory effect on the synthesis of anthocyanins, while GA had the reverse effect. The down-regulation of AACT1, HMGS, HMGR, MVK, MVD2, IDI1 and FPPS2 involved in terpenoid biosynthesis influences anthocyanin accumulation by positively regulating transcripts of AUX1 and SAUR that contribute to the synthesis of IAA, GID2 to GA, PP2C and SnRK2 to ABA. Furthermore, MYB and bHLH members, which are highly correlated (r=0.882-0.980) with anthocyanin content, modulated anthocyanin accumulation by regulating the transcription of structural genes, including CHS and F3H, involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.",

Here, we investigated the evolutionary selective pressures on 16 pneumococcal choline-binding cell-surface proteins since Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the pathogen posing the greatest threats to human health. Phylogenetic and molecular analyses revealed that cbpJ had the highest codon rates to total numbers of codons under significant negative selection among those examined. Our in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that CbpJ functions as a virulence factor in pneumococcal pneumonia by contributing to evasion of neutrophil killing. Deficiency of cbpL under relaxed selective pressure also caused a similar tendency but showed no significant difference in mouse intranasal infection. Thus, molecular evolutionary analysis is a powerful tool that reveals the importance of virulence factors in real-world infection and transmission, since calculations are performed based on bacterial genome diversity following transmission of infection in an uncontrolled population.",

We observed no anatomical, cellular or functional alterations in either fetuses or adult cardiac Myc-deficient mice. We re-examined Myc expression during development and found no expression in developing cardiomyocytes. In contrast, we confirmed that Mycn is essential for cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiogenesis. Mosaic Myc overexpression in a Mycn-deficient background, shows that Myc can replace Mycn function, recovering heart development. We further show that this recovery involves the elimination of Mycn-deficient cells by Cell Competition. Our results indicate that Myc is dispensable during cardiogenesis and adult heart homeostasis and Mycn is exclusively responsible for cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development. Nonetheless, our results show that Myc can functionally replace Mycn. We also show that cardiomyocytes compete according to their overall Myc+Mycn levels and that Cell Competition eliminates flawed cardiomyocytes, suggesting its relevance as a quality control mechanism in cardiac development.",

Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months following a mere association of items with a neutral cue and a speeded response, without external reinforcements. We utilized this paradigm to study preference representation and modification in the brain without external reinforcements. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a novel passive viewing task before, after and 30 days following CAT. We pre-registered the predictions that activity in regions related to memory, top-down attention and value processing underlie behavioral change. We found that bottom-up neural mechanisms, involving visual processing regions, were associated with immediate behavioral change, while reduced top-down parietal activity and enhanced hippocampal activity were related to the long-term change. Enhanced activity in value-related regions was found both immediately and in the long-term. Our findings suggest a novel neural mechanism of preference representation and modification. We suggest that non-reinforced change occurs initially in perceptual representation of items, which putatively lead to long-term changes in memory and top-down processes. These findings could lead to implementation of bottom-up instead of top-down targeted interventions to accomplish long-lasting behavioral change.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of mitochondrial gene expression, caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes, is associated with a diverse group of human disorders characterized by impaired mitochondrial respiration. Within this group, an increasing number of mutations have been identified in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. For instance, pathogenic mutations have been identified in the genes encoding enzymes involved in the precursor transcript processing, including ELAC2. The ELAC2 gene codes for the mitochondrial RNase Z, which is responsible for endonucleolytic cleavage of the 3 ends of mitochondrial pre-tRNAs. Here, we report the identification of sixteen novel ELAC2 variants in individuals presenting with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis. We provided further evidence for the pathogenicity of the three previously reported variants by studying the RNase Z activity in an in vitro system and applied this recombinant system to investigate all novel missense variants, confirming the pathogenic role of these new ELAC2 mutations. We also modelled the residues affected by missense mutation in solved RNase Z structures, providing insight into enzyme structure and function. Finally, we show that primary fibroblasts from the individuals with novel ELAC2 variants have elevated levels of unprocessed mitochondrial RNA precursors. Our study thus broadly confirms the correlation of ELAC2 variants with severe infantile-onset forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. One rare missense variant associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer (p.Arg781His) impairs the mitochondrial RNase Z activity of ELAC2, possibly indicating a functional link between tumorigenesis and mitochondrial RNA metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Members of the family Gobiidae have an unusual lateral line morphology in which some of the lateral line canal segments do not develop or enclose. This loss of lateral line canal segments is frequently accompanied by proliferation of superficial neuromasts. Although the proliferation of superficial neuromasts forms intricate patterns that have been used as a taxonomic tool to identify individual gobiid species, there has never been a detailed study that has documented the development of the lateral line system in gobies. The Round Goby, Neogobius melanostomus, is the focus of this study because the absence of the lateral line canal segments below the eye are accompanied by numerous transverse rows of superficial neuromasts. Our results suggest that the origin of some of these superficial neuromast lines could be the result of single presumptive canal neuromasts that have proliferated after canal enclosure is arrested. Many of the intricate patterns of neuromasts observed in gobiids develop from a simplified pattern of neuromast that is very similar among different species of gobies. The proliferation of superficial neuromasts has evolved several times in fish families such as the tetras, gobies, and sculpins, and may provide an adaptive advantage to  tune the lateral line system for different environments and prey types.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUnderstanding the development of different lateral line morphologies can provide insights into how these morphologies have convergently evolved in many fish taxa. This is the first study to document the progression of the development of the reduced lateral line morphology. This study shows evidence that the developmental origins of orthogonal lines of superficial neuromasts posterior to the eye are not neomorphic lines, but in fact arise from precursor neuromasts that seem to be analogous to presumptive canal neuromasts.",

    "abstract": "Many complex biological systems such as metabolic networks can be divided into functional and organizational subunits, called modules, which provide the flexibility to assemble novel multi-functional hierarchies by a mix and match of simpler components. Here we show that polysaccharide-degrading microbial communities in the ocean can also assemble in a modular fashion. Using synthetic particles made of a variety of polysaccharides commonly found in the ocean, we showed that the particle colonization dynamics of natural bacterioplankton assemblages can be understood as the aggregation of species modules of two main types: a first module type made of narrow niche-range primary degraders, whose dynamics are controlled by particle polysaccharide composition, and a second module type containing broad niche-range, substrate-independent taxa whose dynamics are controlled by interspecific interactions, in particular cross-feeding via organic acids, amino acids and other metabolic byproducts. As a consequence of this modular logic, communities can be predicted to assemble by a sum of substrate-specific primary degrader modules, one for each complex polysaccharide in the particle, connected to a single broad-niche range consumer module. We validate this model by showing that a linear combination of the communities on single-polysaccharide particles accurately predicts community composition on mixed-polysaccharide particles. Our results suggest thus that the assembly of heterotrophic communities that degrade complex organic materials follow simple design principles that can be exploited to engineer heterotrophic microbiomes.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to address this gap in the literature by determining the pooled prevalence of depression among epileptic patients in sub-Saharan Africa.\\n\\nMethodsA systematic desk review and electronic web-based search of PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the World Health Organizations Hinari portal (which includes the SCOPUS, African Index Medicus, and African Journals Online databases) identified peer-reviewed research studies and doctoral dissertations on the prevalence of depression among patients with epilepsy using pre-defined quality and inclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted and descriptive summaries of the studies presented in tabular form. The I2 test was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of comorbidity at a 95% confidence interval (CI). Funnel plot asymmetry and Eggers tests were used to check for publication bias. The final effect size was determined by applying a trim and fill analysis in a random-effects model.\\n\\nResultsOur search identified 167 studies, of which 16 articles were eligible for inclusion the final analysis. The pooled estimate of prevalence of depression among patients with epilepsy was 32.71 (95% CI: 25.50 - 39.91). Regional sub-group analysis found that the pooled prevalence in East Africa was 34.52 (95% CI: 23.53 - 45.51) and 29.69 (95% CI: 22.7 - 36.68) in Southern and West Africa. The odds of depression among epileptic patients receiving polytherapy were 2.65 higher than in those receiving monotherapy (95% CI: 1.49 - 4.71, I2=79.1%, p < 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionOur findings indicate high comorbidity in sub-Saharan Africa and suggests that it may be more prevalent there than elsewhere. Comorbidity is statistically associated with polytherapy. Given the high levels of epilepsy in the region, more attention should be paid to incorporating depression screening and treatment into existing epilepsy programs and to revising treatment guidelines on comorbid depression to reduce polytherapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile overall rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States for the past several decades, New York City (NYC) has experienced two serogroup C meningococcal disease outbreaks in 2005-2006 and in 2010-2013. The outbreaks were centered within drug use and sexual networks, were difficult to control, and required vaccine campaigns.\\n\\nMethodsWhole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was used to analyze preserved meningococcal isolates collected before and during the two outbreaks. We integrated and analyzed epidemiologic, geographic, and genomic data to better understand transmission networks among patients. Betweenness centrality was used as a metric to understand the most important geographic nodes in the transmission networks. Comparative genomics was used to identify genes associated with the outbreaks.\\n\\nResultsNeisseria meningitidis serogroup C (ST11/ET-37) was responsible for both outbreaks with each outbreak having distinct phylogenetic clusters. WGS did identify some misclassifications of isolates that were more distant from the rest of the outbreak, as well as those that should have been included based on high genomic similarity. Genomes for the second outbreak were more similar than the first and no mutation was found to either be unique or specific to either outbreak lineage. Betweenness centrality as applied to transmission networks based on phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the outbreaks were transmitted within focal communities in NYC with few transmission events to other locations.\\n\\nConclusionsNeisseria meningitidis is an ever changing pathogen and comparative genomic analyses can help elucidate how it spreads geographically to facilitate targeted interventions to interrupt transmission.",

    "abstract": "Neurokinin B (NKB) signaling is critical for reproduction in all studied species. The existing consensus is that NKB induces GnRH release via kisspeptin (Kiss1) stimulation in the arcuate nucleus. However, the stimulatory action of NKB is dependent on circulating estrogen (E2) levels, without which, NKB inhibits LH release. Importantly, the evidence supporting the kisspeptin-dependent role of NKB, derives from models of persistent hypogonadal state [e.g. Kiss1r knockout (KO) mice], with reduced E2 levels. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of E2, NKB signaling induces LH release in a kisspeptin-independent manner. Moreover, senktide (NKB receptor agonist) delivery to the medial amygdala (MeA) increases LH in E2-treated Kiss1 KO females (but not males or sham-treated females) similar to controls, and thus, this increase is independent of Kiss1 neurons. These results document a novel kisspeptin-independent regulatory pathway of reproductive function in females mediated by NKB-responsive neurons in the MeA.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of microscopy images is ideally suited for understanding the functional biological correlates of individual molecular species identified by one of the several available \\\"omics\\\" techniques. Due to advances in fluorescent labeling, microscopy engineering and image processing, it is now possible to routinely observe and quantitatively analyze at high temporal and spatial resolution the real-time behavior of thousands of individual cellular structures as they perform their functional task inside living systems. Despite the central role of microscopic imaging in modern biology, unbiased inference, valid interpretation, scientific reproducibility and results dissemination are hampered by the still prevalent need for subjective interpretation of image data and by the limited attention given to the quantitative assessment and reporting of the error associated with each measurement or calculation, and on its effect on downstream analysis steps (i.e., error propagation). One of the mainstays of bioimage analysis is represented by single-particle tracking (SPT)1-5, which coupled with the mathematical analysis of trajectories and with the interpretative modelling of motion modalities, is of key importance for the quantitative understanding of the heterogeneous intracellular dynamic behavior of fluorescently-labeled individual cellular structures, vesicles, virions and single-molecules. Despite substantial advances, the evaluation of analytical error propagation through SPT and motion analysis pipelines is absent from most available tools 6. This severely hinders the critical evaluation, comparison, reproducibility and integration of results emerging from different laboratories, at different times, under different experimental conditions and using different model systems. Here we describe a novel, algorithmic-centric, Monte Carlo method to assess the effect of experimental parameters such as signal to noise ratio (SNR), particle detection error, trajectory length, and the diffusivity characteristics of the moving particle on the uncertainty associated with motion type classification The method is easily extensible to a wide variety of SPT algorithms, is made widely available via its implementation in our Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA) software tool for the management and analysis of tracking data 7, and forms an integral part of our Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE) data model 8.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen heat shock protein 90 kDa (Hsp90) attract significant interest as a viable drug target, particularly for cancer. To date, designed inhibitors that target the ATPase domain demonstrate potent anti-proliferative effects, but have failed clinical trials due to high levels of associated toxicity. To circumvent this, the focus has shifted away from the ATPase domain. One option involves modulation of the protein through allosteric activation/inhibition. Here, we propose a novel approach: we use previously obtained information via residue perturbation scanning coupled with dynamic residue network analysis to identify allosteric drug targeting sites for inhibitor docking. We probe the open conformation of human Hsp90 for druggable sites that overlap with these allosteric control elements, and identify three putative natural compound allosteric modulators: Cephalostatin 17, 20(29)-Lupene-3{beta}-isoferulate and 3'-Bromorubrolide F. We assess the allosteric potential of these ligands by examining their effect on the conformational dynamics of the protein. We find evidence for the selective allosteric activation and inhibition of Hsp90s conformational transition toward the closed state in response to ligand binding and shed valuable insight to further the understanding of allosteric drug design and Hsp90s complex allosteric mechanism of action.",

Their evolution was reconstructed.\\n\\nResultsIntratumor molecular heterogeneity did not correspond to the supposed primary tumor histological evolution. Metastases after systemic treatment could be derived from cancer stem cells not identified in the primary cancer. GCNIS mostly lacked the molecular marks of the primary NS and comprised dominant clones that failed to progress. A BRCA-like mutational signature was observed without evidence for direct involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data strongly support the hypothesis that NS is initiated by whole genome duplication, followed by chromosome copy number alterations in the cancer stem cell population, and accumulation of low numbers of somatic mutations. These observations of heterogeneity at all stages of tumorigenesis should be considered when treating patients with GCNIS-only disease, or with clinically overt NS.",

    "abstract": "The whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a soil-transmitted helminth that dwells in the epithelium of the caecum and proximal colon of their hosts causing the human disease, trichuriasis. Trichuriasis is characterized by colitis attributed to the inflammatory response elicited by the parasite while tunnelling through intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).\\n\\nThe IL-10 family of receptors, comprising combinations of subunits IL-10R, IL-10R{beta}, IL-22R and IL-28R, modulates intestinal inflammatory responses. Here we carefully dissected the role of these subunits in the resistance of mice to infection with T. muris, a mouse model of the human whipworm T. trichiura. Our findings demonstrate that whilst IL-22R and IL-28R are dispensable in the host response to whipworms, IL-10 signalling through IL-10R and IL-10R{beta} is essential to control caecal pathology, worm expulsion and survival during T. muris infections. We show that deficiency of IL-10, IL-10R and IL-10R{beta} results in dysbiosis of the caecal microbiota characterised by expanded populations of opportunistic bacteria of the families Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Moreover, breakdown of the epithelial barrier after whipworm infection in IL-10, IL-10R and IL-10R{beta}-deficient mice, allows the translocation of these opportunistic pathogens or their excretory products to the liver causing organ failure and lethal disease. Importantly, bone marrow chimera experiments indicate that signalling through IL-10R and IL-10R{beta} in haematopoietic cells, but not IECs, is crucial to control worm expulsion and immunopathology. These findings are supported by worm expulsion upon infection of conditional mutant mice for the IL-10R on IECs. Our findings emphasize the pivotal role of systemic IL-10R signalling on immune cells in promoting microbiota homeostasis and maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier, thus preventing immunopathology during whipworms infections.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe human gut is home to millions of bacteria, collectively called the microbiota, and also to parasites that include whipworms. The interactions between gut cells, the microbiota and whipworms define conditions for balanced parasitism. Cells lining the gut host whipworms but also interact with gut immune cells to deploy measures that control or expel whipworms whilst maintaining a barrier to prevent microbial translocation. Whipworms affect the composition of the microbiota, which in turn impacts the condition of the gut lining and the way in which immune cells are activated. In order to avoid tissue damage and disease, these interactions are tightly regulated. Here we show that signalling through a member of the IL-10 receptor family, IL-10R, in gut immune cells is critical for regulating of these interactions. Lack of this receptor on gut immune cells results in persistence of whipworms in the gut accompanied by an uncontrolled inflammation that destroys the gut lining. This tissue damage is accompanied by the overgrowth of members of the microbiota that act as opportunistic pathogens. Furthermore, the destruction of the gut barrier allows these bacteria to reach the liver where they cause organ failure and fatal disease.",

    "abstract": "FcMBL, an engineered version of the blood opsonin mannose-binding lectin (MBL) that contains the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and flexible neck regions of MBL fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1, has been shown to bind various microbes and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). FcMBL also has been used to create an enzyme-linked lectin sorbent assay (ELLecSA) for use as a rapid (< 1 hr) diagnostic of bloodstream infections. Here we extended this work by using the ELLecSA to test FcMBLs ability to bind to more than 200 different isolates from over 100 different pathogen species. FcMBL bound to 86% of the isolates and 110 of the 122 (90%) different pathogen species tested, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. It also bound to PAMPs including, lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and phosphatidylinositol mannoside 6 (PIM6) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The efficiency of pathogen detection and variation between binding of different strains of the same species also could be improved by treating the bacteria with antibiotics prior to FcMBL capture to reveal previously concealed binding sites within the bacterial cell wall. As FcMBL can bind to pathogens and PAMPs in urine as well as blood, its broad-binding capability could be leveraged to develop a variety of clinically relevant technologies, including infectious disease diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in genomics is the knowledge gap between sequence and its encoded function. Gain-of-function methods based on gene overexpression are attractive avenues for phenotype-based functional screens, but are not easily applied in high-throughput across many experimental conditions. Here, we present Dual Barcoded Shotgun Expression Library Sequencing (Dub-seq), a method that greatly increases the throughput of genome-wide overexpression assays. In Dub-seq, a shotgun expression library is cloned between dual random DNA barcodes and the precise breakpoints of DNA fragments are associated to the barcode sequences prior to performing assays. To assess the fitness of individual strains carrying these plasmids, we use DNA barcode sequencing (BarSeq), which is amenable to large-scale sample multiplexing. As a demonstration of this approach, we constructed a Dub-seq library with total Escherichia coli genomic DNA, performed 155 genome-wide fitness assays in 52 experimental conditions, and identified 813 genes with high-confidence overexpression phenotypes across 4,151 genes assayed. We show that Dub-seq data is reproducible, accurately recapitulates known biology, and identifies hundreds of novel gain-of-function phenotypes for E. coli genes, a subset of which we verified with assays of individual strains. Dub-seq provides complementary information to loss-of-function approaches such as transposon site sequencing or CRISPRi and will facilitate rapid and systematic functional characterization of microbial genomes.\\n\\nImportanceMeasuring the phenotypic consequences of overexpressing genes is a classic genetic approach for understanding protein function; for identifying drug targets, antibiotic and metal resistance mechanisms; and for optimizing strains for metabolic engineering. In microorganisms, these gain-of-function assays are typically done using laborious protocols with individually archived strains or in low-throughput following qualitative selection for a phenotype of interest, such as antibiotic resistance. However, many microbial genes are poorly characterized and the importance of a given gene may only be apparent under certain conditions. Therefore, more scalable approaches for gain-of-function assays are needed. Here, we present Dual Barcoded Shotgun Expression Library Sequencing (Dub-seq), a strategy that couples systematic gene overexpression with DNA barcode sequencing for large-scale interrogation of gene fitness under many experimental conditions at low cost. Dub-seq can be applied to many microorganisms and is a valuable new tool for large-scale gene function characterization.",

The extant diversity of lignin-degrading bacteria and fungi is underestimated by culture-dependent methods, limiting our understanding of the functional and ecological traits of decomposers populations. Here, we describe the use of stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with amplicon and shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterize the functional attributes of lignin-, cellulose-and hemicellulose-degrading fungi and bacteria in coniferous forest soils from across North America. We tested the extent to which catabolic genes partitioned among different decomposer taxa; the relative roles of bacteria and fungi, and whether taxa or catabolic genes correlated with variation in lignocellulolytic activity, measured as the total assimilation of 13C-label into DNA and phospholipid fatty acids. We found high overall bacterial degradation of our model lignin substrate, particularly by gram-negative bacteria (Comamonadaceae and Caulobacteraceae), while fungi were more prominent in cellulose-degradation. Very few taxa incorporated 13C-label from more than one lignocellulosic polymer, suggesting specialization among decomposers. Collectively, members of Caulobacteraceae could degrade all three lignocellulosic polymers, providing new evidence for their importance in lignocellulose degradation. Variation in lignin-degrading activity was better explained by microbial community properties, such as catabolic gene content and community structure, than cellulose-degrading activity. SIP significantly improved shotgun metagenome assembly resulting in the recovery of several high-quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes and over 7,500 contigs containing unique clusters of carbohydrate-active genes. These results improve understanding of which organisms, conditions and corresponding functional genes contribute to lignocellulose decomposition.",

    "abstract": "As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, Apteronotus albifrons, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to known coding properties of the closely related species, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate A. albifrons chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that A. albifrons do not exchange frequent chirps in non-breeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the central nervous system vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESender-receiver matching is a phenomenon commonly observed in the peripheral nervous system. It enables communication production and reception to evolve together so that conspecifics remain sensitive to important signals. In this manuscript we examine this phenomenon in the central nervous system of the weakly electric fish A. albifrons and compare its processing of communication signals to a closely related species (A. leptorhynchus). Although some differences across the two species can help tailor the system for processing species-specific signals, our data indicate that encoding of communication signals in A. albifrons is not as sensitive as in A. leptorhynchus for certain categories of signals. Our data support the idea that the extent of sender-receiver matching can vary as a function of behavioral needs.",

    "abstract": "Performance-based incentives tend to increase an individuals motivation, resulting in enhancements in behavioral output. While much work has focused on understanding how the brains reward circuitry influences incentive motivated performance, fewer studies have investigated how such reward representations act on the motor system. Here we measured motor cortical excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while female and male human participants performed a motoric incentive motivation task for prospective monetary gains and losses. We found that individuals performance increased for increasing prospective gains and losses. While motor cortical excitability appeared insensitive to prospective loss, temporal features of motor cortical excitability for prospective gains were modulated by an independent measure of an individuals subjective preferences for incentive (i.e., loss aversion). Those individuals that were more loss averse had a greater motor cortical sensitivity to prospective gain, closer to movement onset. Critically, behavioral sensitivity to incentive and motor cortical sensitivity to prospective gains were both predicted by loss aversion. Furthermore, causal modeling indicated that motor cortical sensitivity to incentive mediated the relationship between subjective preferences for incentive and behavioral sensitivity to incentive. Together our findings suggest that motor cortical activity integrates information about the subjective value of reward to invigorate incentive motivated performance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIncreasing incentives tend to increase motivation and effort. Using a motoric incentive motivation task and transcranial magnetic stimulation, we studied the motor cortical mechanisms responsible for incentive motivated motor performance. We provide experimental evidence that motor cortical sensitivity to incentive mediates the relationship between subjective preferences for incentive and incentive motivated performance. These results indicate that, rather than simply being a reflection of motor output, motor cortical physiology integrates information about reward value to motivate performance.",

    "abstract": "Sea urchins are voracious herbivores that influence the ecological structure and function of nearshore ecosystems throughout the world. Like many species that produce planktonic larvae, their recruitment is thought to be particularly sensitive to climatic fluctuations in temperature that directly or indirectly affect adult reproduction and larval transport and survival. Yet how climate alters sea urchin populations in space and time by modifying larval recruitment and year-class strength on the time-scales that regulate populations remains understudied. Using a, spatially replicated weekly-biweekly dataset spanning 27 years and 1100 km of coastline, we characterized seasonal, interannual, and spatial patterns of larval settlement of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). We show that large spatial differences in temporal patterns of larval settlement were associated with different responses to fluctuations in ocean temperature and climate. Importantly, we found a strong correlation between larval settlement and regional year class strength suggesting that such temporal and spatial variation in settlement plays an important role in controlling population dynamics. These results provide strong evidence over extensive temporal and spatial domains that climatic fluctuations shape broad-scale patterns of larval settlement and subsequent population structure of an important marine herbivore known to control the productivity, community state and provisioning services of marine ecosystems.",

This paper reports the results from a scoping search performed to clarify possible effectiveness, knowledge gaps, underlying concepts and significance.\\n\\nObjectivesTo gain insight into knowledge gaps and understanding of the effectiveness, origins and significance of quality circles.\\n\\nMethodsA search strategy was developed starting with  quality circle in PubMed and the index terms from those articles revealed were then used as search terms to identify further papers. Repeating this process in collaboration with a librarian, search strings relating to quality circles were built, and databases searched up to December 2017. Any paper on structured quality circles or related small group work in primary health care was included when relevant to the objectives.\\n\\nResultsFrom 11973 citations, 82 background papers and 58 key papers were identified, in addition to 12 books and 10 websites. 19 studies, one paper summarizing three studies and one systematic review suggest that quality circles can be effective in behaviour change, though with varying effect sizes. Quality circles and their techniques are complex, as they are not standardized, and changes seem to depend on the topic and context, which requires further research into how and why they work in order to improve them. From their origins in industry, they are now used in primary health care in many countries for continuous medical education, continuous professional development and quality improvement.\\n\\nConclusionThe evidence on quality circles indicates that they can successfully change general practitioner behaviour. As they are a complex intervention, theory-driven research approaches are needed to understand and improve their effectiveness. This is of major importance because they play an important role in quality improvement in primary health care in many countries.",

    "abstract": "Metaphase spindles are arrays of microtubules whose architecture provides the mechanism for regulated force generation required for proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Whereas long-standing models are based on continuous antiparallel microtubule arrays connecting two spindle poles and overlapping at the equator, spindles typically possess a more complex architecture with randomly arranged short filaments. How these heterogeneous multifilament arrays generate and respond to forces has been mysterious, as it has not been possible to directly measure and perturb spindle force while observing relevant filament motility. Here, we combined microneedle-based quantitative micromanipulation with high-resolution microtubule tracking of Xenopus egg extract spindles to simultaneously examine the force and individual filament motility in situ. We found that the microtubule arrays at the middle of the spindle half are considerably weak and fluid-like, being more adaptable to perturbing forces as compared to those near the pole and the equator. We also found that a force altering spindle length induces filament translocation nearer the spindle pole, where parallel microtubules predominate, while maintaining equatorial antiparallel filaments. Molecular perturbations suggested that the distinct mechanical heterogeneity of the spindle emerges from activities of kinesin-5 and dynein, two key spindle motor proteins. Together, our data establish a link between spindle architecture and mechanics, and highlight the importance of parallel microtubule arrays in maintaining its structural and functional stability.",

    "abstract": "O_LIBiodiversity provides support for life, vital provisions, regulating services and has positive cultural impacts. It is therefore important to have accurate methods to measure biodiversity, in order to safeguard it when we discover it to be threatened. For practical reasons, biodiversity is usually measured at fine scales whereas diversity issues (e.g. conservation) interest regional or global scales. Moreover, biodiversity may change across spatial scales. It is therefore a key challenge to be able to translate local information on biodiversity into global patterns.\\nC_LIO_LIMany databases give no information about the abundances of a species within an area, but only its occurrence in each of the surveyed plots. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework to infer species richness and abundances at large spatial scales in biodiversity-rich ecosystems when species presence/absence information is available on various scattered samples (i.e. upscaling).\\nC_LIO_LIThis framework is based on the scale-invariance property of the negative binomial. Our approach allows to infer and link within a unique framework important and well-known biodiversity patterns of ecological theory, such as the Species Accumulation Curve (SAC) and the Relative Species Abundance (RSA) as well as a new emergent pattern, which is the Relative Species Occupancy (RSO).\\nC_LIO_LIOur estimates are robust and accurate, as confirmed by tests performed on both in silico-generated and real forests. We demonstrate the accuracy of our predictions using data from two well-studied forest stands. Moreover, we compared our results with other popular methods proposed in the literature to infer species richness from presence-absence data and we showed that our framework gives better estimates. It has thus important applications to biodiversity research and conservation practice.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Replication is considered to be critical for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans, but is not routinely performed in model organisms. We explored replication using an advanced intercross line (AIL) which is the simplest possible multigenerational intercross. We re-genotyped a previously published cohort of LG/J x SM/J AIL mice (F34; n=428) using a denser marker set and also genotyped a novel cohort of AIL mice (F39-43; n=600) for the first time. We identified 110 significant loci in the F34 cohort, 36 of which were new discoveries attributable to the denser marker set; we also identified 27 novel significant loci in the F39-43 cohort. For traits measured in both cohorts (locomotor activity, body weight, and coat color), the genetic correlations were high, although, the F39-43 cohort showed systematically lower SNP-heritability estimates. We then attempted to replicate loci identified in either F34 or F39-43 in the other cohort. Albino coat color was robustly replicated; we observed only partial replication of associations for locomotor activity and body weight. Finally, we performed a mega-analysis of locomotor activity and body weight by combining F34 and F39-43 cohorts (n=1,028), which identified four novel loci. The incomplete replication was inconsistent with simulations we performed to estimate our power to replicate. This may reflect: 1) false positives errors in the discovery cohort, 2) environmental or genetic heterogeneity between the two samples, or 3) the systematic over estimation of the effect sizes at significant loci (\\\"Winners Curse\\\"). Our results demonstrate that it is difficult to replicate GWAS results even when using similarly sized discovery and replication cohorts drawn from the same population.",

    "abstract": "The major human pathogens Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major are collectively known as the Tritryps. The initial comparative analysis of their genomes has uncovered that Tritryps share a great number of genes, but repetitive DNA seems to be extremely variable between them. However, the in-depth characterization of repetitive DNA in these pathogens has been in part neglected, mainly due to the well-known technical challenges of studying repetitive sequences from de novo assemblies using short reads. Here, we compared the repetitive DNA repertories between the Tritryps genomes using genome-wide, low-coverage Illumina sequencing coupled to RepeatExplorer analysis. Our work demonstrates that this extensively implemented approach for studying higher eukaryote repeatomes is also useful for protozoan parasites like trypanosomatids, as we recovered previously observed differences in the presence and amount of repetitive DNA families. Additionally, our estimations of repetitive DNA abundance were comparable to those obtained from enhanced-quality assemblies using longer reads. Importantly, our methodology allowed us to describe a previously unknown transposable element in Leishmania major (TATE family), highlighting its potential to accurately recover distinctive features from poorly characterized repeatomes. Together, our results support the application of this low-cost, low-coverage sequencing approach for the extensive characterization of repetitive DNA evolutionary dynamics in trypanosomatid and other protozooan genomes.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a highly regulated catabolic pathway that is potently induced by stressors including starvation and infection. An essential component of the autophagy pathway is an ATG16L1-containing E3-like enzyme, which is responsible for lipidating LC3B and driving autophagosome formation. ATG16L1 polymorphisms have been linked to the development of Crohns disease (CD) and phosphorylation of CD-associated ATG16L1 (caATG16L1) has been hypothesized to contribute to cleavage and autophagy dysfunction. Here we show that ULK1 kinase directly phosphorylates ATG16L1 in response to infection and starvation. Moreover, we show that ULK-mediated phosphorylation drives the destabilization of caATG16L1 in response to stress. Additionally, we found that phosphorylated ATG16L1 was specifically localized to the site of internalized bacteria indicating a role for ATG16L1 in the promotion of anti-bacterial autophagy. Lastly, we show that stable cell lines harbouring a phospho-dead mutant of ATG16L1 have impaired xenophagy. In summary, our results show that ATG16L1 is a novel target of ULK1 kinase and that ULK-signalling to ATG16L1 is a double-edged sword, enhancing function of the wildtype ATG16L1, but promoting degradation of caATG16L1.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionRecently popular sub-perceptual doses of psychedelic substances such as truffles, referred to as microdosing, allegedly have multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults.\\n\\nMethodsDuring a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking, and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were manifested.\\n\\nResultsWe found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected.\\n\\nConclusionWhile this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.",

The identity of the kinases that phosphorylate NS5A, and the consequences for HCV biology, remain largely undefined. We previously identified serine 225 (S225) within low complexity sequence (LCS) I as a major phosphorylation site and used a phosphoablatant mutant (S225A) to define a role for S225 phosphorylation in the regulation of genome replication, interactions of NS5A with several host proteins and the sub-cellular localisation of NS5A. To investigate this further, we raised an antiserum to S225 phosphorylated NS5A (pS225). Western blot analysis revealed that pS225 was exclusively found in the hyper-phosphorylated NS5A species. Furthermore, using kinase inhibitors we demonstrated that S225 was phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (CK1) and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Using a panel of phosphoablatant mutants of other phosphorylation sites in LCSI we obtained the first direct evidence of bidirectional hierarchical phosphorylation initiated by phosphorylation at S225.\\n\\nUsing super-resolution microscopy (Airyscan and Expansion), we revealed a unique architecture of NS5A-positive clusters in HCV-infected cells - pS225 was concentrated on the surface of these clusters, close to lipid droplets. Pharmacological inhibition of S225 phosphorylation resulted in the condensation of NS5A-positive clusters into larger structures, recapitulating the S225A phenotype. Although S225 phosphorylation was not specifically affected by daclatasvir treatment, the latter also resulted in a similar condensation. These data are consistent with a key role for S225 phosphorylation in the regulation of NS5A function.\\n\\nImportanceNS5A has obligatory roles in the hepatitis C virus lifecycle, and is proposed to be regulated by phosphorylation. As NS5A is a target for highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as daclatasvir (DCV) it is vital to understand how phosphorylation occurs and regulates NS5A function. We previously identified serine 225 (S225) as a major phosphorylation site. Here we used an antiserum specific for NS5A phosphorylated at S225 (pS225-NS5A) to identify which kinases phosphorylate this residue. Using super-resolution microscopy we showed that pS225 was present in foci on the surface of larger NS5A-positive clusters likely representing genome replication complexes. This location would enable pS225-NS5A to interact with cellular proteins and regulate the function and distribution of these complexes. Both loss of pS225 and DCV treatment resulted in similar changes to the structure of these complexes, suggesting that DAA treatment might target a function of NS5A that is also regulated by phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Microbial diversity is strongly affected by the bottom-up effects of resource availability. However, because resource pools often exist as heterogeneous mixtures of distinct molecules, resource heterogeneity may also affect community diversity. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed bacterial communities in lakes that varied in resource concentration. In addition, we characterized resource heterogeneity in these lakes using an ecosystem metabolomics approach. Overall, resource concentration and resource heterogeneity affected bacterial resource-diversity relationships. We found strong relationships between bacterial alpha-diversity (richness and evenness) and resource concentration and richness, but richness and evenness responded in different ways. Likewise, we found associations between the composition of the bacterial community and both resource concentration and composition, but the relationship with resource composition was stronger. Last, in the surveyed communities the presence of resource generalists may have reduced the effect of resource heterogeneity on community composition. These results have implications for understanding the interactions between bacteria and organic matter and suggest that changes in organic matter composition may alter the structure and function of bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "The maternal brain displays considerable plasticity, and motherhood is associated with changes in affective and cognitive function. Motherhood can alter the trajectory of brain ageing, including modifications to neuroplasticity and cognition. Here, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of motherhood on hippocampal neurogenesis, microglial density and morphology, and circulating cytokines, domains known to be altered with age and implicated in cognition and mood. Female rats were bred then euthanized during gestation or at various postpartum timepoints, culminating in middle age, and nulliparous rats served as age-matched controls. Hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly suppressed during gestation and the postpartum period. Interestingly, neurogenesis declined significantly in middle-aged nulliparous rats, but increased in primiparous rats across the same period. Transient postpartum adaptations to the neuroimmune environment of the hippocampus were evidenced, as Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia assumed a de-ramified morphology followed by increased density. Intriguingly, ageing-related changes in circulating cytokines were dependent on parity. These adaptations in neurogenic and immune processes may have ramifications for maternal mood and cognition across the peripartum period and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Many evolutionary conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants regulate transcription factors with key functions in development. Hence, mutations in the core components of the miRNA biogenesis machinery cause strong growth defects. An essential aspect of miRNA biogenesis is the precise excision of the small RNA from its precursor. In plants, miRNA precursors are largely variable in size and shape and can be processed by different modes. Here, we optimized an approach to detect intermediates during miRNA biogenesis. We characterized a miRNA whose processing is triggered by a terminal branched loop. Plant miRNA processing can be initiated by internal bubbles, small terminal loops or branched loops followed by dsRNA segments of 15-17 bp. Interestingly, precision and efficiency vary with the processing modes. Despite the various potential structural determinants present in a single a miRNA precursor, DCL1 is mostly guided by a predominant structural region in each precursor in wild-type plants. However, our studies in fiery1, hyl1 and se mutants revealed the existence of cleavage signatures consistent with the recognition of alternative processing determinants. The results provide a general view of the mechanisms underlying the specificity of miRNA biogenesis in plants.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with identical genotypes exhibit great phenotypic variability known as biological noise, which has broad implications. While molecular-level noise has been extensively studied, in-depth analysis of cellular-level noise is challenging. Here, we present a systems-level quantitative and functional analysis of noise in cellular position during embryogenesis, an important phenotype indicating differentiation and morphogenesis. We show that cellular position noise is deterministic, stringently regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The noise level is determined by cell lineage identity and is coupled to developmental properties including embryonic localization, cell contact, and left-right symmetry. Cells follow a concordant low-high-low pattern of noise dynamics, and fate specification triggers a global down-regulation of noise that provide a noise-buffering strategy. Noise is stringently regulated throughout embryogenesis, especially during cell division and cell adhesion and gap junctions function to restrict noise. Collectively, our study reveals system properties and regulatory mechanisms of cellular noise control during development.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic life cycle of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae involves a series of morphogenetic changes, essential for its ability to cause disease. The smo mutation was identified more than twenty-five years ago and affects the shape and development of diverse cell types in M. oryzae, including conidia, appressoria and asci. All attempts to clone the SMO1 gene by map-based cloning and/or complementation, have failed over many years. Here, we report the identification of SMO1 by a combination of bulk segregant analysis and comparative genome analysis. SMO1 encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which regulates Ras signalling during infection-related development. Targeted deletion of SMO1 results in abnormal, non-adherent conidia, impaired in their production of spore tip mucilage. Smo1 mutants also develop smaller appressoria, with a severely reduced capacity to infect rice plants. SMO1 is necessary for organisation of microtubules and for septin-dependent remodelling of the F-actin cytoskeleton at the appressorium pore. Smo1 physically interacts with components of the Ras2 signaling complex, and a range of other signalling and cytoskeletal components, including the four core septins. SMO1 is therefore necessary for regulation of RAS activation required for conidial morphogenesis and septin-mediated plant infection.",

Here, we identified 48 target mRNAs of human Pumilio 1 (PUM1), an evolutionally conserved RBP, by combined analysis of transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilities and the binding of mRNAs to PUM1. Here, we developed an approach to identify mRNA targets of Pumilio 1 (PUM1), an evolutionally conserved RBP. By combined analysis of transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilities and the binding of mRNAs to PUM1, we identified 48 mRNAs that both bound to PUM1 and exhibited PUM1-dependent degradation. Analysis of changes in the abundance of PUM1 and its targets in RNA-seq data indicated that DNA-damaging agents negatively regulated PUM1-mediated mRNA decay. Cells exposed to cisplatin had reduced PUM1 abundance and increased PCNA and UBE2A mRNAs, encoding proteins involved in DNA repair by translesion synthesis (TLS). Cells overexpressing PUM1 exhibited impaired DNA synthesis and TLS and increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin. Thus, our method identified targets of PUM1-mediated decay and revealed that cells respond to DNA damage by inhibiting PUM1-mediated mRNA decay to activate TLS.",

    "abstract": "Assimilation of novel strategies into a consolidated action repertoire is a crucial function for behavioral adaptation and cognitive flexibility. Acetylcholine in the striatum plays a pivotal role in such adaptation and its release has been causally associated with the activity of cholinergic interneurons. Here we show that the midbrain, a previously unknown source of acetylcholine in the striatum, is a major contributor to cholinergic transmission in the striatal complex. Neurons of the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei synapse with striatal cholinergic interneurons and give rise to excitatory responses that, in turn, mediate inhibition of spiny projection neurons. Inhibition of acetylcholine release from midbrain terminals in the striatum impairs action shifting and mimics the effects observed following inhibition of acetylcholine release from striatal cholinergic interneurons. These results suggest the existence of two hierarchically-organized modes of cholinergic transmission in the striatum where cholinergic interneurons are modulated by cholinergic neurons of the midbrain.",
