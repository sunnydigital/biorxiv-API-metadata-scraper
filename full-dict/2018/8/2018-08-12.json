    "abstract": "NK cell responses depend on the balance of signals from inhibitory and activating receptors. However, how the integration of antagonistic signals occurs upon NK cell-target cell interaction is not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that NK cell inhibition via the inhibitory receptor Ly49A is dependent on its relative colocalization at the nanometer scale with the activating receptor NKG2D upon immune synapse (IS) formation. NKG2D and Ly49A signal integration and colocalization was studied using NKG2D-GFP and Ly49A-RFP-expressing primary NK cells, forming ISs with NIH3T3 target cells, with or without expression of single chain trimer (SCT) H2-Dd and an extended form of SCT H2-Dd-CD4 MHC-I molecules. Nanoscale colocalization was assessed by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between NKG2D-GFP and Ly49A-RFP and measured for each synapse. In the presence of their respective cognate ligands, NKG2D and Ly49A colocalize at a nanometer scale leading to NK cell inhibition. However, increasing the size of the Ly49A ligand reduced the nanoscale colocalization with NKG2D consequently impairing Ly49A-mediated inhibition. Thus, our data shows NK cell signal integration is critically dependent on the dimensions of NK cell ligand-receptor pairs by affecting their relative nanometer-scale colocalization at the IS. Together, our results suggest the balance of NK cell signals, and NK cell responses, are determined by the relative nanoscale colocalization of activating and inhibitory receptors in the immune synapse.",

    "abstract": "Control of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation at human mucosal surfaces is critical to reducing the burden of pneumonia and invasive disease, interrupting onward transmission, and in achieving herd protection. We hypothesised that the pattern of pneumococcal-epithelial engagement dictates the inflammatory response to colonisation, and that this epithelial sensing is linked to bacterial clearance. Here we have used nasal curette biopsies from a serotype 6B Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage Model (EHPC) to visualize S. pneumoniae colonisation and relate these interactions to epithelial surface marker expression and transcriptomic profile upregulation. We have used a Detroit 562 cell co-culture model to further understand these processes and develop an integrated epithelial transcriptomic module to interrogate gene expression in the EHPC model. We have shown for the first time that pneumococcal colonisation in humans is characterised by microcolony formation at the epithelial surface, microinvasion, cell junction protein association, epithelial sensing, and both epithelial endocytosis and paracellular transmigration. Comparisons with other clinical strains in vitro has revealed that the degree of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell surface marker expression (ICAM-1 and CD107), cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8 and ICAM-1) and the transcriptomic response. In the context of retained barrier function, epithelial microinvasion is associated with the upregulation of a wide range of epithelial innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes. The prominence of epithelial TLR4R signalling pathways implicates pneumolysin, a key virulence factor, but although pneumolysin gene deletion partially ameliorates the inflammatory transcriptional response in vitro, critical inflammatory pathways persist in association with enhanced epithelial adhesion and microinvasion. Importantly, the pattern of the host-bacterial interaction seen with the 6B strain in vitro is also reflected in the EHPC model, with evidence of microinvasion and a relatively silent epithelial transcriptomic profile that becomes most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance. Together these data suggest that epithelial sensing of the pneumococcus during colonisation in humans is enhanced by microinvasion, resulting in innate epithelial responses that are associated with bacterial clearance.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nO_LIColonisation of the human mucosa by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with microcolony formation, microinvasion, epithelial sensing and an epithelial innate response.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing adherence to the epithelial cell surface, microinvasion of the epithelium may occur by endocytosis and/or lateral migration between cells without necessarily compromising barrier integrity.\\nC_LIO_LIThe pattern of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell response through a range of innate signaling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes.\\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial sensing is triggered by, but not wholly dependent on pneumolysin, a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae.\\nC_LI",

In public health, sequence data is used to reconstruct the evolution of pathogens, anticipate future spread, and target interventions. In clinical settings whole genome sequences identify pathogens at the strain level, can be used to predict phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence, and inform treatment by linking to closely related cases. However, the vast majority of sequence data are only used for specific narrow applications such as typing. Comprehensive analysis of these data could provide detailed insight into outbreak dynamics, but is not routinely done since fast, robust, and interpretable analysis work-flows are not in place.

    "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is a strong predictor of cardiovascular diseases. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase gene (Hmgcr) coding for the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is a crucial regulator of plasma cholesterol levels. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of Hmgcr remains poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of miRNAs in the regulation of Hmgcr expression. Systematic in silico predictions and experimental analyses reveal that miR-27a specifically interacts with the Hmgcr 3-untranslated region in murine and human hepatocytes. Moreover, our data shows that Hmgcr expression is inversely correlated with miR-27a levels in various cultured cell lines, human and rodent tissues. Actinomycin D chase assays and relevant experiments demonstrate that miR-27a regulates Hmgcr by translational attenuation followed by mRNA degradation. Early Growth Response 1 (Egr1) regulates miR-27a expression under basal and cholesterol-modulated conditions. miR-27a augmentation via tail-vein injection of miR-27a mimic in high cholesterol diet-fed Apoe-/- mice shows down-regulation of hepatic Hmgcr and plasma cholesterol levels. Pathway and gene expression analyses show that miR-27a also targets several other genes (apart from Hmgcr) in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Taken together, miR-27a emerges as a key regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis and has therapeutic potential for clinical management of hypercholesterolemia.",

Here, using sequences from 67 MM genomes serially collected from 30 patients together with public datasets, we establish a hierarchy of driver lesions. Point mutations, structural variants and copy number aberrations define at least 7 genomic subgroups of MM, each with distinct sets of co-operating driver mutations. Complex structural events are major drivers of MM, including chromothripsis, chromoplexy and a replication-based mechanism of templated insertions: these typically occur early. Hyperdiploidy also occurs early, with individual chromosomes often gained in more than one chronological epoch of MM evolution, showing a preferred order of acquisition. Positively selected point mutations frequently occur in later phases of disease development, as do structural variants involving MYC. Thus, initiating driver events of MM, drawn from a limited repertoire of structural and numerical chromosomal changes, shape preferred trajectories of subsequent evolution.",

The bacterial acid-resistant chaperone HdeA belongs to a group of \\\"conditionally disordered\\\" protein that is activated via an order-to-disorder transition. However, the mechanism for unfolding-induced activation remains unclear due to the lack of experimental information on the unfolded state conformation and the chaperone-client interactions. Here we use advanced solution NMR methods to characterize the activated state conformation of HdeA under acidic condition and identify the client binding sites. The activated HdeA becomes largely disordered and exposes two essential hydrophobic patches of residues for client interactions. The pH-dependent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) result identifies three acid-sensitive regions that act as structural locks during the activation process, revealing a multi-step activation mechanism of HdeA chaperone function at atomic level. The results highlight the role of protein disorder in chaperone function and the self-inhibitory role of ordered structures under non-stress conditions, offering new insights for further understanding the protein structure-function paradigm.",

    "abstract": "The Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a key process implicated in cancer metastasis and therapy resistance. Recent studies have emphasized that cells can undergo partial EMT to attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype - a cornerstone of tumour aggressiveness and poor prognosis. These cells can have enhanced tumour-initiation potential as compared to purely epithelial or mesenchymal ones, and can integrate the properties of cell-cell adhesion and motility that facilitates collective cell migration leading to clusters of Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) - the prevalent mode of metastasis. Thus, identifying the molecular players that can enable cells to maintain a hybrid E/M phenotype is crucial to curb the metastatic load. Here, using an integrated computational-experimental approach, we show that the transcription factor NRF2 can prevent a complete EMT and instead stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype. Knockdown of NRF2 in hybrid E/M non-small cell lung cancer cells H1975 drove progression to a completely mesenchymal phenotype at molecular and morphological levels. Notably, overexpression of NRF2 enriched for a hybrid E/M phenotype by simultaneously upregulating both E-cadherin and ZEB in RT4 bladder cancer cells. Further, we predict that NRF2 is maximally expressed in hybrid E/M phenotype(s) and demonstrate that this biphasic dynamic arises from the interconnections among NRF2 and the EMT regulatory circuit. Finally, clinical data from multiple datasets suggests a correlation between a hybrid E/M phenotype, high levels of NRF2 and its targets and poor survival, further strengthening the emerging notion that hybrid E/M phenotype(s) may occupy the  metastatic sweet spot.",

Using fiber photometry, we find elevated claustrum activity prior to an expected cue during correct performance on a cognitively demanding five-choice response assay relative to a less-demanding one-choice version of the task. Claustrum activity during reward acquisition is also enhanced when cognitive demand is higher. Furthermore, we use optogenetic inhibition of claustrum prior to the expected cue to demonstrate that claustrum is critical for accurate performance on the five-choice, but not the one-choice, task.

Here, we show that primary human melanocytes, when observed in situ have extensive dendritic branches with dendritic spines similar to neurons. When co-cultured with primary human keratinocytes, they have local Ca2+ transients within these spines and within the dendrites. These are elicited by secreted factors from adjacent keratinocytes. Thus other cell types with dendrites are capable of compartmentalized Ca2+ fluctuations in response to cell-cell communication. Furthermore, our observations within intact human skin suggest a more complex communication network between adjacent melanocytes and keratinocytes, and thus a more complex physiology to skin than previous appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Transient exposures to environmental stresses induce altered physiological states in exposed cells that persist after the stresses have been removed. These states, referred to as cellular memory, can even be passed on to daughter cells and may thus be thought of as embodying a form of epigenetic inheritance. We find that meiotically produced spores in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae possess a state of heightened stress resistance that, following their germination, persists for numerous mitotic generations. As yeast meiotic development is essentially a starvation response that a/alpha diploid cells engage, we sought to model this phenomenon by subjecting haploid cells to starvation conditions. We find also that haploid cells exposed to glucose withdrawal acquire a state of elevated stress resistance that persists after the reintroduction of these cells to glucose-replete media. Following release from lengthy durations of glucose starvation, we confirm that this physiological state of enhanced stress resistance is propagated in descendants of the exposed cells through two mitotic divisions before fading from the population. In both haploid starved cells and diploid produced meiotic spores we show that their cellular memories are not attributable to trehalose, a widely regarded stress protectant that accumulates in these cell types. Moreover, the heritable stress resistant state induced by glucose starvation in haploid cells is independent of the Msn2/4 transcription factors, which are known to program cellular memory induced by exposure of cells to NaCl. Our findings identify new developmentally and nutritionally induced states of cellular memory that exhibit striking degrees of perdurance and mitotic heritability.",

The 12mers are more neurotoxic than the 24mers and undergo self-replication, while the latter propagate to morphologically distinct fibrils with succinct pathological consequences. In order to glean into their functional differences and similarities, we have determined their structures in greater detail by combining molecular dynamic simulations with biophysical measurements. We conjecture that the LFAO are made of A{beta} units in an S-shaped conformation, with the 12mers forming a double-layered hexamer ring (6 x 2) while the structure of 24mers is a double-layered dodecamer ring (12 x 2). A closer inspection of the (6 x 2) and (12 x 2) structures reveals a concentration and pH dependent molecular reorganization in the assembly of 12 to 24mers, that seems to be the underlying mechanism for the observed biophysical and cellular properties of LFAOs.",
