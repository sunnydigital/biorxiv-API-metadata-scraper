    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are an important analytical tool for evaluating community diversity and evolutionary history. In the case of microorganisms, the decreasing cost of sequencing has enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of these types of datasets create complex trees that can be challenging to interpret. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree. Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience or complicated file formats for annotation. Iroki, a user-friendly web interface for tree visualization, addresses these issues by providing automatic customization of large trees based on metadata contained in tab-separated text files. Irokis utility for exploring biological and ecological trends in sequencing data was demonstrated through a variety of microbial ecology applications in which trees with hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes were customized according to extensive collections of metadata. The Iroki web application and documentation are available at https://www.iroki.net or through the VIROME portal (http://virome.dbi.udel.edu).

    "abstract": "Large bone defects cannot heal without intervention and have high complication rates even with the best treatments available. In contrast, bone fractures naturally healing with high success rates by recapitulating the process of bone development through endochondral ossification.1 Endochondral tissue engineering may represent a promising paradigm, but large bone defects are unable to naturally form a callus. We engineered mesenchymal condensations featuring local morphogen presentation (TGF-{beta}1) to mimic the cellular organization and lineage progression of the early limb bud. As mechanical forces are 2,3 critical for proper endochondral ossification during bone morphogenesis2,3 and fracture healing, we hypothesized that mechanical cues would be important for endochondral regeneration.4,5 Here, using fixation plates that modulate ambulatory load transfer through dynamic tuning of axial compliance, we found that in vivo mechanical loading was necessary to restore bone function to large bone defects through endochondral ossification. Endochondral regeneration produced zonal cartilage and primary spongiosa mimetic of the native growth plate. Live human chondrocytes contributed to endochondral regeneration in vivo, while cell devitalization prior to condensation transplantation abrogated bone formation. Mechanical loading induced regeneration comparable to high-dose BMP-2 delivery, but without heterotopic bone formation and with order-of-magnitude greater mechanosensitivity.6-8 In vitro, mechanical loading promoted chondrogenesis, and upregulated pericellular collagen 6 deposition and angiogenic gene expression. Consistently, in vivo mechanical loading regulated cartilage formation and neovascular invasion dependent on load timing. Together, this study represents the first demonstration of the effects of mechanical loading on transplanted cell-mediated bone defect regeneration, and provides a new template for recapitulating developmental programs for tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Antagonistic host-pathogen co-evolution is a determining factor in the outcome of infection and shapes genetic diversity at the population level of both partners. While the molecular function of an increasing number of genes involved in pathogenicity is being uncovered, little is known about the molecular bases and genomic impact of hst-pathogen coevolution and rapid adaptation. Here, we apply a population genomic approach to infer genome-wide patterns of selection among thirteen isolates of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Using whole genome alignments, we characterize intragenic polymorphism, and we apply different test statistics based on the distribution of non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms (pN/pS) and substitutions (dN/dS) to (1) characterise the selection regime acting on each gene, (2) estimate rates of adaptation and (3) identify targets of selection. We correlate our estimates with different genome variables to identify the main determinants of past and ongoing adaptive evolution, as well as purifying and balancing selection. We report a negative relationship between pN/pS and fine-scale recombination rate and a strong positive correlation between the rate of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions ({omega}a) and recombination rate. This result suggests a pervasive role of Hill-Robertson interference even in a species with an exceptionally high recombination rate (60 cM/Mb). Moreover, we report that the genome-wide fraction of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions () is ~ 44%, however in genes encoding determinants of pathogenicity we find a mean value of alpha ~ 68% demonstrating a considerably faster rate of adaptive evolution in this class of genes. We identify 787 candidate genes under balancing selection with an enrichment of genes involved in secondary metabolism and host infection, but not predicted effectors. This suggests that different classes of pathogenicity-related genes evolve according to distinct selection regimes. Overall our study shows that sexual recombination is a main driver of genome evolution in this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Whole Genome Sequencing is increasingly used to identify Mendelian variants in clinical pipelines. These pipelines focus on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and also structural variants, while ignoring more complex repeat sequence variants. We consider the problem of genotyping Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs), composed of inexact tandem duplications of short (6-100bp) repeating units. VNTRs span 3% of the human genome, are frequently present in coding regions, and have been implicated in multiple Mendelian disorders. While existing tools recognize VNTR carrying sequence, genotyping VNTRs (determining repeat unit count and sequence variation) from whole genome sequenced reads remains challenging. We describe a method, adVNTR, that uses Hidden Markov Models to model each VNTR, count repeat units, and detect sequence variation. adVNTR models can be developed for short-read (Illumina) and single molecule (PacBio) whole genome and exome sequencing, and show good results on multiple simulated and real data sets. adVNTR is available at https://github.com/mehrdadbakhtiari/adVNTR",

    "abstract": "The genetic basis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remains better understood and might concern only a small fraction of the genome if the neutral theory were true. We here analyzed published de novo mutations (DNMs) in ASD and controls. We found that DNMs in normal subjects occurred at positions bearing SNPs at least 3.45 fold more frequent than expected from the neutral theory, whereas DNMs in ASD were less frequent relative to those in controls, especially so for common SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.01. Among sites bearing both SNPs and DNMs, DNMs in controls occurred significantly more frequent than DNMs in ASD at reference allele sites bearing C or G nucleotides, indicating depletion of ASD associated DNMs in known regions of hypermutability or less functional constraints such as CpG sites. We also analyzed the nucleotide compositions of DNMs and the parity (1:1 ratio) of pyrimidines and purines. We found that DNMs in ASD showed overall lower AT content than that in controls. Parity violations and AT bias in DNMs occurred at expected frequency based on chance in both ASD and controls. These results show enrichment of DNMs at positions bearing SNP sites and C or G sites in normal subjects and less so in ASD, which is not expected from the neutral model, and indicate that DNMs are on average more deleterious in ASD than in controls.",

    "abstract": "TUDOR-domain containing proteins facilitate PIWI interacting (pi)RNA biogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and other model organisms. In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, a somatically active piRNA pathway generates piRNAs from viral RNA during acute infection with cytoplasmic RNA viruses. Viral piRNA biogenesis requires ping-pong amplification by the PIWI proteins Ago3 and Piwi5. We hypothesized that Tudor proteins are required for viral piRNA production and performed a knockdown screen targeting all Ae. aegypti Tudor genes. Knockdown of several Tudor genes resulted in reduced viral piRNA levels, with silencing of AAEL012437 having the strongest effect. This protein, which we named Veneno, associates directly with Ago3 in an sDMA-dependent manner and localizes in cytoplasmic foci reminiscent of piRNA processing granules of Drosophila. Veneno-interactome analyses reveal a network of co-factors including the orthologs of the Drosophila piRNA pathway components Vasa and Yb, which in turn interacts directly with Piwi5. We propose that Veneno assembles a multi-protein complex for ping-pong dependent piRNA production from exogenous viral RNA.",

However, such approaches may not take full advantage of information contained in neuroimaging data. The present study employs an unsupervised data-driven method to identify spatial patterns of tau-PET distribution, and to compare these patterns to previously published \\\"pathology-driven\\\" ROIs. Tau-PET patterns were identified from a discovery sample comprised of 123 normal controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia from the Swedish BioFINDER cohort, who underwent [18F]AV1451 PET scanning. Associations with cognition were tested in a separate sample of 90 individuals from ADNI. BioFINDER [18F]AV1451 images were entered into a robust voxelwise stable clustering algorithm, which resulted in five clusters. Mean [18F]AV1451 uptake in the data-driven clusters, and in 35 previously published pathology-driven ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models comparing [18F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to several tests of global cognition, adjusting for age, sex and education. Two data-driven ROIs consistently demonstrated the strongest or near-strongest effect sizes across all cognitive tests. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature selection routine resulted in selection of two ROIs (one data-driven, one pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 28% of the variance of a global cognitive composite score. Our findings suggest that [18F]AV1451-PET data naturally clusters into spatial patterns that are biologically meaningful and that may offer advantages as clinical tools.",

Furthermore, we determined the key target of miR-10b was Latent transforming growth factor-{beta} binding protein 1 (LTBP1), which is a regulator of TGF-{beta} signaling. Compatible with a commonly accepted view that TGF-{beta} creates the major growth-inhibitory signal against vascular smooth muscle cells, TGF-{beta} inhibitor treatments abolished anti-proliferative functions of Type-II ECs. Therefore, RGS5/miR-10b/LTBP1/TGF-{beta} axis plays a leading role in quality control of ECs.",

    "abstract": "Positive natural selection can lead to a decrease in genomic diversity at the selected site and at linked sites, producing a characteristic signature of elevated expected haplotype homozygosity. These selective sweeps can be hard or soft. In the case of a hard selective sweep, a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency, whereas multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously in a soft sweep, producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the selected site. Measures of expected haplotype homozygosity have previously been used to detect sweeps in multiple study systems. However, these methods are formulated for phased haplotype data, typically unavailable for nonmodel organisms, and may have reduced power to detect soft sweeps due to their increased genetic diversity relative to hard sweeps. To address these limitations, we applied the H12 and H2/H1 statistics of Garud et al. [2015] to unphased multilocus genotypes, denoting them as G12 and G2/G1. G12 (and the more direct expected homozygosity analogue to H12, denoted G123) has comparable power to H12 for detecting both hard and soft sweeps. G2/G1 can be used to classify hard and soft sweeps analogously to H2/H1, conditional on a genomic region having high G12 or G123 values. The reason for this power is that under random mating, the most frequent haplotypes will yield the most frequent multilocus genotypes. Simulations based on parameters compatible with our recent understanding of human demographic history suggest that expected homozygosity methods are best suited for detecting recent sweeps, and increase in power under recent population expansions. Finally, we find candidates for selective sweeps within the 1000 Genomes CEU, YRI, GIH, and CHB populations, which corroborate and complement existing studies.",

    "abstract": "The infrastructure challenges and costs of next-generation sequencing have been largely overcome, for many sequencing applications, by Oxford Nanopore Technologies portable MinION sequencer. However the question remains open whether MinION-based bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is by itself sufficient for the accurate assessment of phylogenetic and epidemiological relationships between isolates and whether such tasks can be undertaken in resource-limited settings. To investigate this question, we sequenced the genome of an isolate of Rickettsia typhi, an important and neglected cause of fever across much of the tropics and subtropics, for which only three genomic sequences previously existed. We prepared and sequenced libraries on a MinION in Vientiane, Lao PDR using v9.5 chemistry and in parallel we sequenced the same isolate on the Illumina platform in a genomics laboratory in the UK. The MinION sequence reads yielded a single contiguous assembly, in which the addition of Illumina data revealed 226 base-substitution and 5,856 in/del errors. The combined assembly represents the first complete genome sequence of a human R. typhi isolate collected in the last 50 years and differed from the genomes of existing strains collected over a 90-year time period at very few sites, and with no re-arrangements. Filtering based on the known error profile of MinION data improved the accuracy of the Nanopore-only assembly. However, the frequency of false-positive errors remained greater than true sequence divergence from recorded sequences. While Nanopore-only sequencing cannot yet recover phylogenetic signal in R. typhi, such an approach may be applicable for more diverse organisms.",

    "abstract": "Cell-to-cell transfer of virus particles through the virological synapse (VS) is a highly efficient mode of HIV-1 transmission. Formation of the VS, a transient multiform adhesion structure, is mediated through an interaction between the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and the viral receptor CD4 on the surface of infected cell and target cell, respectively. Given that Env, unlike many other viral fusogens, can mediate the merger of membranes at neutral pH, the close encounter of infected and uninfected cells would seem prone to result in cell-cell fusion and thus the formation of syncytia. However, while it is being recognized now that small, T cell-based syncytia are indeed a defining feature of the natural history of HIV-1, the majority of VSs nevertheless resolve without fusion, thus securing continued virus spread. Gag, the main viral structural component, is partially responsible for restraining Env and preventing it from becoming fusogenic before being incorporated into particles. In addition, a few cellular factors, including tetraspanins and ezrin, have also been shown to inhibit Envs activity while this fusogen is still part of the producer cell.\n\nHere, we identify EWI-2, a protein that was previously shown to associate with the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 and also with ezrin, as a host factor that contributes to the inhibition of Env{-}mediated cell-cell fusion. Using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and TZM-bl fusion assays, we show that EWI-2, comparable to tetraspanins, while overall being downregulated upon HIV-1 infection, accumulates at the producer cell side of the VS (i.e. the presynapse), where it contributes to the fusion-preventing activities of the other viral and cellular components.",

We observe mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of events within and between a number of EAC pathways (GATA factors, Core Cell cycle genes, TP53 regulators and the SWI/SNF complex) suggestive of important functional relationships. These driver variants correlate with tumour differentiation, sex and prognosis. Poor prognostic indicators (SMAD4, GATA4) are verified in independent cohorts with significant predictive value. Over 50% of EACs contain sensitising events for CDK4/6 inhibitors which are highly correlated with clinically relevant sensitivity in a panel EAC cell lines and organoids.",

    "abstract": "Variation at the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster is functionally associated with differences in lipid metabolism and is often hypothesized to reflect adaptation to an agricultural diet. Here, we test the evidence for this relationship using both modern and ancient DNA data. We show that almost all the inhabitants of Europe carried the ancestral allele until the derived allele was introduced approximately 8,500 years ago by Early Neolithic farming populations. However, we also show that it was not under strong selection in these populations. We find that this allele, and other proposed agricultural adaptations at LCT/MCM6 and SLC22A4, were not strongly selected until much later, perhaps as late as the Bronze Age. Similarly, increased copy number variation at the salivary amylase gene AMY1 is not linked to the development of agriculture although, in this case, the putative adaptation precedes the agricultural transition. Our analysis shows that selection at the FADS locus was not tightly linked to the initial introduction of agriculture and the Neolithic transition. Further, it suggests that the strongest signals of recent human adaptation in Europe did not coincide with the Neolithic transition but with more recent changes in environment, diet or efficiency of selection due to increases in effective population size.",

    "abstract": "Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and its precursor flavin mononucleotide (FMN) are redox cofactors that are required for the activity of more than hundred human enzymes. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause severe phenotypes, including a lack of energy supply and accumulation of toxic intermediates. Ideally, patients should be diagnosed before they show symptoms so that treatment and/or preventive care can start immediately. This can be achieved by standardized newborn screening tests. However, many of the flavin-related diseases lack appropriate biomarker profiles. Genome-scale metabolic models can aid in biomarker research by predicting altered profiles of potential biomarkers. Unfortunately, current models, including the most recent human metabolic reconstructions Recon and HMR, typically treat enzyme-bound flavins incorrectly as free metabolites. This in turn leads to artificial degrees of freedom in pathways that are strictly coupled. Here, we present a reconstruction of human metabolism with a curated and extended flavoproteome. To illustrate the functional consequences, we show that simulations with the curated model - unlike simulations with earlier Recon versions - correctly predict the metabolic impact of multiple-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase deficiency as well as of systemic flavin-depletion. Moreover, simulations with the new model allowed us to identify a larger number of biomarkers in flavoproteome-related diseases, without loss of accuracy. We conclude that adequate inclusion of cofactors in constraint-based modelling contributes to higher precision in computational predictions.",

Ubiquitin, and sometimes ubiquitin-homology domains, are recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains, including CUE domains. CUE domains are thus generally thought to function exclusively by mediating interactions with ubiquitylated proteins. The chromatin remodeler, SMARCAD1, interacts with KAP1, a transcriptional corepressor. We show that the SMARCAD1-KAP1 interaction is direct and involves the first SMARCAD1 CUE domain (CUE1) and the RBCC domain of KAP1. A structural model of the minimal KAP1 RBCC-SMARCAD1 CUE1 complex based on X-ray crystallography analysis is presented. Remarkably, the CUE1 domain, which resembles a canonical CUE domain, recognizes 2 clusters of exposed hydrophobic residues on KAP1, but these are presented in the context of a coiled-coil domain, not in a structure resembling ubiquitin. Together, these data challenge the well-established dogma that CUE domains exclusively recognize the ubiquitin-fold.",

These steps are typically undertaken using Unix command-line or Python software tools, even when downstream analysis is to be undertaken using R.\\n\\nWe present Rsubread, a Bioconductor software package that provides high-performance alignment and counting functions for RNA-seq reads. Rsubread provides the ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It has no software dependencies other than R itself. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to the popular non-R tools TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq. We also compare to counting functions provided in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We show that Rsubread is faster, uses less memory and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values. The results show that users can adopt the R environment for alignment and quantification without suffering any loss of performance.",

Using trends in the rate of new HIV infections in eastern and southern Africa we assess the current state of the epidemic and evaluate the future prospects for controlling it. If we let an incidence of 1 per 1,000 people represent a control threshold then this has been reached, or will probably be reached by 2020, in eastern Africa and is reachable by 2020 in those southern African countries that do not have particularly strong social and economic ties to South Africa if they continue to scale up their treatment programmes. In South Africa and its immediate neighbours Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland, the prospects are less certain. These countries are unlikely to reach the control threshold by 2020 but with sufficient political will and commitment to  treatment for all could do so by 2030.\\n\\nThere are two important caveats. First, reaching the control threshold still leaves 35 thousand new infections a year. As the lessons of polio remind us, finding the last few, hard to reach cases will demand more focussed strategies. Second, ending AIDS will not end HIV and about 35 million people will have to be kept on ART for the next 30 to 40 years unless and until a cure is discovered. Even if we assume a modest cost of, say, US$100 per person per year for ART treatment and support, this corresponds to a continuing financial commitment of US$3.5 Bn per year although this is substantially less than the approximately US$ 40 Bn per year currently committed to HIV and AIDS.",

It is thus important to assess the safety and nutritional value of wild greens foraged in urban environments.\\n\\nMethodsField observations, soil tests, and nutritional and toxicology tests on plant tissue were conducted for three sites, each roughly 9 square blocks, in disadvantaged neighborhoods in the East San Francisco Bay Area in 2014-2015. The sites included mixed-use areas and areas with high vehicle traffic.\\n\\nResultsEdible wild greens were abundant, even during record droughts. Soil at some survey sites had elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium, but tissue tests suggest that rinsed greens of the tested species are safe to eat. Daily consumption of standard servings comprise less than the EPA reference doses of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals.

Even grown in soils with elevated levels of heavy metals, tested species were safe to eat after rinsing in tap water. This does not mean that all edible greens growing in contaminated soil are safe to eat--tests on more species, in more locations, and over a broader range of soil chemistry are needed to determine what is generally safe and what is not. But it does suggest that wild greens could contribute to nutrition, food security, and sustainability in urban ecosystems.

Differential dispersal may be a key mechanism. We surveyed microbial diversity within a metacommunity of pitchers of the model carnivorous plant Sarracenia purpurea and discovered the yeast Candida pseudoglaebosa as ecologically dominant. Its frequency in the metacommunity increased over the growing season, and it was not replaced by other taxa. We next measured its competitive ability in a manipulative laboratory experiment and tracked its dispersal over time in nature. Despite its dominance, C. pseudoglaebosa is not a superior competitor. Instead, it is a superior disperser: it arrives in pitchers earlier, and disperses into more pitchers, than other taxa. Differential dispersal across the spatially structured metacommunity of individual pitchers emerges as a key driver of the continuous dominance of C. pseudoglaebosa during succession.",

In order to understand fall armyworms year-round, global, potential distribution, we used evidence of the effects of temperature and precipitation on fall armyworm life-history, combined with data on native and African distributions to construct Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Fall armyworm has only invaded areas that have a climate similar to the native distribution, validating the use of climatic SDMs. The strongest climatic limits on fall armyworms year-round distribution are the coldest annual temperature and the amount of rain in the wet season. Much of sub-Saharan Africa can host year-round fall armyworm populations, but the likelihoods of colonising North Africa and seasonal migrations into Europe are hard to predict. South and Southeast Asia and Australia have climate that would permit fall armyworm to invade. Current trade and transportation routes reveal Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand face high threat of fall armyworm invasions originating from Africa.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic subcellular regulation of Protein kinase A (PKA) activity is important for the motile behavior of many cell types, yet the mechanisms governing PKA activity during cell migration remain largely unknown. The motility of SKOV-3 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells has been shown to be dependent on both localized PKA activity and, more recently, on mechanical reciprocity between cellular tension and extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity. Here, we investigated the possibility that PKA is regulated by mechanical signaling during migration. We find that localized PKA activity in migrating cells rapidly decreases upon inhibition of actomyosin contractility (specifically, of myosin ATPase, ROCK (Rho kinase), or MLCK (myosin light chain kinase) activity). Moreover, PKA activity is spatially and temporally correlated with cellular traction forces in migrating cells. Additionally, PKA is rapidly and locally activated by mechanical stretch in an actomyosin contractility-dependent manner. Finally, inhibition of PKA activity inhibits mechanically-guided migration, also known as durotaxis. These observations establish PKA as a locally-regulated effector of cellular mechanotransduction and as a regulator of mechanically-guided cell migration.",

Because of their involvement in the pathogenesis of multiple disease, they are receiving increasing attention. Previous work suggested that epigenetic features might be related to circRNA expression. However, current algorithms for circRNAs prediction neglect these features, leading to constant results across different cells.\\n\\nHere we built a machine learning framework named CIRCScan, to predict expression status and expression levels of circRNAs in various cell lines based on sequence and epigenetic features. Both expression status and expression levels can be accurately predicted by different groups of features. For expression status, the top features were similar in different cells. However, the top features for predicting expression levels were different in different cells. Noteworthy, the importance of H3K79me2 ranked high in predicting both circRNAs expression status and levels across different cells, indicating its important role in regulating circRNAs expression. Further validation experiment in K562 confirmed that knock down of H3K79me2 did result in reduction of circRNA production.\\n\\nOur study offers new insights into the regulation of circRNAs by incorporating epigenetic features in prediction models in different cellular contexts.",

Here we compared metagenomes obtained from a humic bog and a clearwater eutrophic lake, and found a much larger number of genes that might be involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) for iron redox reactions and humic substance (HS) reduction in the bog than in the clearwater lake, consistent with the much higher iron and HS levels in the bog. These genes were particularly rich in the bogs anoxic hypolimnion, and were found in diverse bacterial lineages, some of which are relatives of known iron oxidizers or iron/HS reducers. We hypothesize that HS may be a previously overlooked electron acceptor and EET-enabled redox cycling may be important in pelagic respiration and greenhouse gas budget in humic-rich freshwater lakes.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic bookmarking transcription factors (BFs) maintain the capacity to bind to their targets during mitosis, despite major rearrangements of the chromatin. While they were thought to propagate gene regulatory information through mitosis by statically occupying their DNA targets, it has recently become clear that BFs are highly dynamic in mitotic cells. This represents both a technical and a conceptual challenge to study and understand the function of BFs: first, formaldehyde has been suggested to be unable to efficiently capture these transient interactions, leading to profound contradictions in the literature; second, if BFs are not permanently bound to their targets during mitosis, it becomes unclear how they convey regulatory information to daughter cells. Here, comparing formaldehyde to alternative fixatives we clarify the nature of the chromosomal association of previously proposed BFs in embryonic stem cells: while Esrrb can be considered as a canonical BF that binds at selected regulatory regions in mitosis, Sox2 and Oct4 establish DNA sequence independent interactions with the mitotic chromosomes, either throughout the chromosomal arms (Sox2) or at pericentromeric regions (Oct4). Moreover, we show that ordered nucleosomal arrays are retained during mitosis at Esrrb book-marked sites, whereas regions losing transcription factor binding display a profound loss of order. By maintaining nucleosome positioning during mitosis, Esrrb might ensure the rapid post-mitotic re-establishment of functional regulatory complexes at selected enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that reconciles dynamic mitotic binding with the transmission of gene regulatory information across cell division.",

In this study, we show how biological control against the mealybug Phenacoccus manihoti (Hemiptera) slowed deforestation across Southeast Asia. In Thailand, the newly-arrived mealybug caused an 18% decline in cassava yields over 2009-2010, a shortfall in national production and an escalation in the price of cassava products. This spurred an expansion of cassava cropping in neighboring countries from 713,000 ha in 2009 to >1 million ha by 2011: satellite imagery reveal 388%, 330%, 185% and 608% increases in peak deforestation rates in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam focused in cassava crop expansion areas. Following release of the host-specific natural enemy Anagyrus lopezi (Hymenoptera) in 2010, mealybug outbreaks were reduced, cropping area contracted and associated deforestation slowed by 31-94% in individual countries. When used with due caution and according to current guidelines, biological control offers broad benefits for people and the environment.",

Previous transcriptome analysis of optic glands of Sepiella japonica across four growth stages, expression of a cathepsin D-like segment was found to be significantly different. Based on the complete cDNA sequence of S. japonica, the CTSD gene (also called sjCTSD, GenBank accession no. KY745896.1) was cloned using RACE amplification; this gene is 1389 bp in length and encodes proteins composed of 393 amino acids. Spatio-temporal expression profiles of the sjCTSD gene were determined using qPCR assays, which showed that the expression levels of sjCTSD constantly increased across four growth stages in 9 of 11 tissues that were investigated. In the optic glands, as well as pancreas and liver cells, sjCTSD expression levels sharply increased during the post-spawning phase. To investigate the potential role of the sjCTSD gene in aging progress, we constructed the prokaryotic expression vector of pET28a/sjCTSD. After induced by IPTG, the recombinant protein sjCTSD was obtained in the form of inclusion bodies, with a molecular size of approximately 40.3 kDa, the inclusion body of sjCTSD can be converted to soluble protein through the denaturation and renaturation. The results of functional experiments showed that sjCTSD could degrade bovine hemoglobin under acidic conditions, and inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Vibrio alginolyticus, which was speculated that the increased expression of sjCTSD may help inhibit the invasion of pathogenic bacteria with the immune function of cuttlefish declines during the aging process. To a certain extent, these results indicated the potential functional role of the sjCTSD gene in the aging process of S. japonica. This study provides insights to further understand the roles of lysosomal proteins on anti-aging effects in S. japonica and other cephalopoda species.",

Recently developed algorithms to construct whole genomes from environmental samples have further refined, corrected and revolutionized the tree of life.

This hydrothermal system has been intensively studied previously with regard to geochemistry, chemoautotrophy, microbial isolation, and microbial diversity. Using a shotgun metagenomics approach, we assembled population-level genomes of bacteria and archaea from two pools using DNA that had previously been characterized via 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. We recovered 36 MAGs, 29 of medium to high quality, and placed them in the context of the current microbial tree of life. We highlight MAGs representing previously underrepresented archaeal phyla (Korarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota and Aciduliprofundum) and one potentially new species within the bacterial genus Sulfurihydrogenibium. Putative functions in both pools were compared and are discussed in the context of their diverging geochemistry. This study can be considered complementary to foregoing studies in the same ecosystem as it adds more comprehensive information about phylogenetic diversity and functional potential within this highly selective habitat.",

The histopathological diagnosis of phyllodes tumours is often confused with that of fibroadenomas due to a striking histological resemblance; hence a distinctive biomarker for this tumour type is warranted.\\n\\nMaterial & MethodsFresh human breast tissue was obtained from surgically excised breast phyllodes and fibroadenoma tumours (test, 2 cases each), breast cancer (positive control, 2 cases) and normal breast tissue (negative control, 1 case). Immunohistochemistry was performed for the detection of nerve growth factor (NGF) on frozen sections of the test and control tissues fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, using the indirect streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Sandwich ELISA on tissue homogenates of the same test and control cases was also performed to validate the immunohistochemical findings.\\n\\nResultsA marked difference in NGF expression was detected in phyllodes tumours compared to fibroadenomas. The maximum NGF expression was observed in phyllodes tissue followed by cancer tissue, and the least expression in fibroadenomas (3-5 times less than in phyllodes; comparable with normal breast tissue).\\n\\nConclusionNGF is known for its growth inducing potential in breast cancer, but its secretion by a benign breast tumour is not known in literature. This study reports abundant NGF secretion by breast phyllodes, raising the possibility of its potential role in tumour pathogenesis and progression that can be exploited therapeutically in future. We also propose that NGF may be used as a distinct biomarker of phyllodes tumours, for differentiating them from fibroadenomas during histopathology.",

These data were combined with 34 OCD patients, 22 GD patients, and 39 healthy controls, who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging.\\n\\nResultsThree core dimensions were identified: disinhibition, impulsivity, and compulsivity. Patients scores on these dimensions were continuously distributed with the healthy participants, supporting a continuum model of psychopathology. Across all participants, higher disinhibition correlated with lower bottom-up connectivity in the dorsal circuit and increased bottom-up connectivity in the ventral circuit, and higher compulsivity correlated with reduced bottom-up connectivity in the dorsal circuit. Similar changes in effective connectivity were observed with increasing clinical severity that were not accounted for by phenotypic variation, demonstrating convergence towards behaviourally and clinically relevant changes in brain dynamics.

This allows the user not only to focus on specific systems, but also to study general properties of the structure and evolution of membrane proteins.\\n\\nHighlights-EncoMPASS relates and analyzes known structures of membrane proteins\\n-Structure and sequence similarity is assessed through alignments and topology considerations, not clustering\\n-Symmetry is detected based on CE-Symm and SymD using a multi-step procedure",

    "abstract": "SummaryStudying aneuploidy during organism development has strong limitations, as chronic mitotic perturbations used to generate aneuploidy result in lethality. We developed a genetic tool to induce aneuploidy in an acute and time controlled manner during Drosophila development. This is achieved by reversible depletion of cohesin, a key molecule controlling mitotic fidelity.\\n\\nLarvae challenged with aneuploidy hatch into adults with severe motor defects shortening their lifespan. Neural stem cells, despite being aneuploid, display a delayed stress response and continue proliferating, resulting in the rapid appearance of chromosomal instability, complex array of karyotypes and cellular abnormalities. Notably, when other brain cell-lineages are forced to self-renew, aneuploidy-associated stress response is significantly delayed, indicating that stemness state confers resistance to aneuploidy. Sparing solely the developing brain from induced aneuploidy is sufficient to rescue motor defects and adult lifespan, suggesting that neural tissue is the most ill-equipped to deal with developmental aneuploidy.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIReversible depletion of cohesin results in just a round or two of aberrant cell divisions, generating high levels of aneuploidy.\\nC_LIO_LILarvae challenged with aneuploidy during development hatch into impaired adults.\\nC_LIO_LIFew cell cycles are sufficient for chromosomal instability to emerge from a previously stable aneuploid state.\\nC_LIO_LINeural stemness delays aneuploidy stress response.\\nC_LIO_LIProtecting only the neural tissue from aneuploidy rescues adult abnormalities and lifespan.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Rosa roxbunghii Tratt belongs to the Rosaceae family, and the fruit is flavorful, economic, and highly nutritious, providing health benefits. MYB proteins play key roles in R. roxbunghii fruit development and quality. However, the available genomic and transcriptomic information are extremely deficient. Here, a normalized cDNA library was constructed using five tissues, stem, leaf, flower, young fruit, and mature fruit, with three repetitions, and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. De novo assembly was performed, and 470.66 million clean reads were obtained. In total, 63,727 unigenes, with an average GC content of 42.08%, were determined and 59,358 were annotated. In addition, 9,354 unigenes were assigned the Gene Ontology category, and 20,202 unigenes were assigned to 25 Eukaryotic Ortholog Groups. Additionally, 19,507 unigenes were classified into 140 pathways of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. Using the transcriptome, 18 candidate MYB genes that were significantly expressed in mature fruit, compared with other tissues, were obtained. Among them, 10 R2R3 MYB and 1 R1 MYB were identified. The expression levels of 12 MYB genes randomly selected for qRT-PCR analysis were consistent with the RNA-seq results. A total of 37,545 microsatellites were detected, with an average EST--SSR frequency of 0.59 (37,545/63,727). This transcriptome data will be valuable for identifying genes of interest and studying their expression and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Patients with uncontrolled diabetes are susceptible to implant failure due to impaired bone metabolism. Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that is up-regulated in response to reduced oxygen condition during the bone repair process after fracture or osteotomy, is known to mediate angiogenesis and osteogenesis. However, its function is inhibited under hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of exogenous HIF-1 on bone formation around implants by applying HIF-1 to diabetic mice via a novel PTD-mediated DNA delivery system. Smooth surface implants (1mm in diameter; 2mm in length) were placed in the both femurs of diabetic and normal mice. HIF-1 and placebo gels were injected to implant sites of the right and left femurs, respectively: Normal mouse with HIF-1 gel (NH), Normal mouse with placebo gel (NP), Diabetic mouse with HIF-1 gel (DH), and Diabetic mouse with placebo gel (DP). RNA sequencing was performed 4 days after surgery. Based on RNA sequencing, Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified and HIF-1 target genes were selected. Histologic and histomorphometric results were evaluated 2 weeks after the surgery. The results showed that bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone volume (BV) were significantly greater in the DH group than the DP group (p < 0.05). A total of 216 genes were differentially expressed in DH group compared to DP group. On the other hand, there were 95 DEGs in the case of normal mice. Twenty-one target genes of HIF-1 were identified in diabetic mice through bioinformatic analysis of DEGs. Among the target genes, NOS2, GPNMB, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16 and TRIM63 were manually found to be associated with wound healing-related genes. In conclusion, local administration of HIF-1 via PTD may help bone formation around the implant and induce gene expression more favorable to bone formation in diabetic mice.",

    "abstract": "Studies conducted in time series could be far more informative than those questioning at a specific moment in time. However, when it comes to genomic data, time points are sparse creating the need for a constant search for methods capable of extracting information out of experiments of this kind. We propose a feature selection algorithm embedded in a hidden Markov model applied to gene expression time course data on either single or even multiple biological conditions. For the latter, in a simple case-control study features or genes are selected under the assumption of no change over time for the control samples, while the case group must have at least one change. The proposed model reduces the feature space according to a two-state hidden Markov model. The two states define change/no-change in gene expression. Features are ranked in consonance with three scores: number of changes across time, magnitude of such changes and quality of replicates as a measure of how much they deviate from the mean. An important highlight is that this strategy overcomes the few samples limitation, common in genomic experiments through a process of data transformation and rearrangement. To prove this method, our strategy was applied to three publicly available data sets. Results show that feature domain is reduced to up to 90% leaving only few but relevant features yet with findings consistent to those previously reported. Moreover, our strategy proved to be robust, stable and working on studies where sample size is an issue otherwise. Hence, even with two biological replicates and/or three time points our method proves to work well.",

    "abstract": "Odor information is transmitted from olfactory sensory neurons to principal neurons at the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The intraglomerular neuronal circuit also includes hundreds of GABAergic interneurons referred to as periglomerular (PG) cells. Stimulus selectivity is well correlated among PG cells that are associated with the same glomerulus, consistent with their highly homogeneous sensory inputs. However, much less is known about the temporal aspects of their activity, including the temporal coordination of their odor-evoked responses. As many PG cells within a glomerular module respond to the same stimulus, the extent to which their activity is temporally aligned will affect the temporal profile of their population inhibitory inputs. Using random-access high-speed two-photon microscopy, we recorded the odor-evoked calcium transients of mouse PG cells and compared the onset latency and rise time among neurons putatively associated with the same and different glomeruli. Whereas the overall onset latencies of odor-evoked transients were distributed across a ~150 ms time window, those from cells putatively associated with the same glomerulus were confined to a much narrower window of several tens of milliseconds. This result suggests that onset latency primarily depends on the associated glomerulus. We also observed glomerular specificity in the rise time. The glomerulus-specific temporal pattern of odor-evoked activity implies that the temporal patterns of inhibitory inputs are unique to individual glomerulus-odor pairs, which may contribute to efficient shaping of the temporal pattern of activity in the principal neurons.",

These transcriptional programs have been studied in only a few species, and their function and conservation across algae and plants is currently unknown. We performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of the diurnal cycle of nine members of Archaeplastida, and we observed that, despite large phylogenetic distances and dramatic differences in morphology and lifestyle, diurnal transcriptional programs of these organisms are similar. However, the establishment of multicellularity coincided with the uncoupling of cell division from the diurnal cycle and decreased diurnal control of the expression of the biological pathways. Hence, our study provides evidence for the universality of diurnal gene expression and elucidates its evolutionary history among different photosynthetic eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Are there general biophysical relationships governing the spatial organization of the gut microbiome? Despite growing realization that spatial structure is important for population stability, inter-bacterial competition, and host functions, it is unclear in any animal gut whether such structure is subject to predictive, unifying rules, or if it results from contextual, species-specific behaviors. To explore this, we used light sheet fluorescence microscopy to conduct a high-resolution comparative study of bacterial distribution patterns throughout the entire intestinal volume of live, larval zebrafish. Fluorescently tagged strains of seven bacterial symbionts, representing six different species native to zebrafish, were each separately mono-associated with animals that had been raised initially germ-free. The strains showed large differences in both cohesion--the degree to which they auto-aggregate--and spatial distribution. We uncovered a striking correlation between each strains mean position and its cohesion, whether quantified as the fraction of cells existing as planktonic individuals, the average aggregate size, or the total number of aggregates. Moreover, these correlations held within species as well; aggregates of different sizes localized as predicted from the pan-species observations. Together, our findings indicate that bacteria within the zebrafish intestine are subject to generic processes that organize populations by their cohesive properties. The likely drivers of this relationship, peristaltic fluid flow, tubular anatomy, and bacterial growth and aggregation kinetics, are common throughout animals. We therefore suggest that the framework introduced here, of biophysical links between bacterial cohesion and spatial organization, should be useful for directing explorations in other host-microbe systems, formulating detailed models that can quantitatively map onto experimental data, and developing new tools that manipulate cohesion to engineer microbiome function.",

    "abstract": "For many arthropods, including insects, diapause is the primary mechanism for survival during unfavorable seasons. Although the exogenous signals and endogenous hormones that induce and regulate diapause are well-characterized, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental information is translated into molecular regulators of the diapause pathway. However, short, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are likely involved in generating both the arrested egg follicle development and fat hypertrophy in diapausing females of the Northern house mosquito, Culex pipiens. To determine whether miRNAs might respond to changes in day length and/or regulate diapause pathways, we measured the abundance of candidate miRNAs in diapausing and nondiapausing females of Cx. pipiens across the adult lifespan. Of the selected miRNAs nearly all were more abundant in nondiapausing females relative to diapausing females, but at different times. Specifically, miR-13b-3p, miR-14-3p, miR-277-3p, and miR-305-5p were upregulated in nondiapausing females early in adulthood, while miR-309-3p and miR-375-3p were upregulated later in adult life, and miR-8-3p and miR-275-3p were upregulated both early and late in adult life. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miRNA expression is dynamic, changing across adult lifespan. Further, differential miRNA expression between diapausing and nondiapausing females of Cx. pipiens suggests that this epigenetic mechanism is part of the molecular toolkit regulating diapause.",

    "abstract": "The invasive silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix escaped from southern U.S. aquaculture during the 1970s to spread throughout the Mississippi River basin and steadily moved northward, now reaching the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The silver carp is native to eastern Asia and is a large, prolific filter-feeder that decreases food availability for fisheries. The present study evaluates its population genetic variability and differentiation across the introduced range using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, sequences of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1), and a nuclear gene (ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1). Populations are analyzed from two invasion fronts threatening the Great Lakes (the Illinois River outside Lake Michigan and the Wabash River, leading into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), established areas in the southern and central Mississippi River, and a later Missouri River colonization. Results discern considerable genetic diversity and some significant population differentiation, with greater mtDNA haplotype diversity and unique microsatellite alleles characterizing the southern populations. Invasion fronts significantly differ, diverging from the southern Mississippi River population. About 3% of individuals contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype (primarily the southerly populations and the Wabash River), which may stem from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. Nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not significantly differ from silver carp. MtDNA variation is used in a high-throughput sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes invasive carp species and their population haplotypes (including H. molitrix and H. harmandi) at all life stages, in application to environmental (e)DNA water and plankton samples. We discerned silver and bighead carp eDNA from four bait and pond stores in the Great Lakes watershed, indicating that release from retailers comprises another likely vector. Our findings provide key baseline population genetic data for understanding and tracing the invasions progression, facilitating detection, and evaluating future trajectory and adaptive success.",

The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by our approach allowed E. coli strains to be correctly classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in several E. coli strains.\\n\\nThere are likely many applications beyond microbial profiling for which high-throughput amplicon sequencing of complete genes with single-nucleotide resolution will be of use.",

    "abstract": "The Arg/N-end rule pathway, a mechanism of protein degradation conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in cellular protein quality control, but its role has only been vaguely understood. Through systematic examination of single residue mutants of model misfolded substrates, and global analyses of yeast proteins, we discovered that Ubr1, an E3 ligase of the Arg/N-end rule, degrades organellar proteins that fail to reach their intended subcellular compartments. We determined that recognition by Ubr1 is dependent on location signals that are naturally embedded into the 2nd amino acid residue of the majority of proteins. The N-end rule pathway is thus likely to have been critical to the evolution of endosymbiotic relationships which paved the way for advanced eukaryotic cellular life.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work elucidates a novel role for the N-end Rule Pathway, a protein degradation pathway highly conserved from yeast to humans. We demonstrate that the N-end rule pathway enforces the cellular compartmentalization of ER and mitochondrial proteins by degrading them when they fail to successfully translocate into their intended destinations and thus become mislocalized to the cytosol. This mechanism prevents the accumulation of toxic foreign proteins within the cytosol. Recognition of the displaced proteins is dependent on cellular location signals programmed into the 2nd residue of the target proteins, as well as the tendency for the proteins to misfold in a foreign environment. These findings have significant relevance to research on the mechanisms causing human diseases involving protein misfolding.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTNell2 is an ipsilateral layer-specific axon guidance cue in the visual thalamus and contributes to establishment of the eye-specific retinogeniculate projection by specifically inhibiting contralateral retinal axons.\\n\\nABSTRACTIn mammals with binocular vision, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from each eye project to eye-specific layers in the contralateral and ipsilateral dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Although layer-specific axon guidance cues that discriminate contralateral and ipsilateral RGC axons have long been postulated as a key mechanism for development of the eye-specificretinogeniculate projection, the molecular nature of such cues has remained elusive. Here we show that the extracellular glycoprotein Nell2 (also known as Nel) is expressed in the dorsomedial region of the dLGN, which corresponds to the layer receiving ipsilateral RGC axons. In Nell2 mutant mice, contralateral RGC axons invaded the ipsilateral layer of the dLGN, and ipsilateral axons terminated in partially fragmented patches, forming a mosaic pattern of contralateral and ipsilateral axon termination zones. In vitro, Nell2 exerted inhibitory effects on contralateral, but not ipsilateral, RGC axons. These results provide evidence that Nell2 acts as a layer-specific positional label in the dLGN that discriminates contralateral and ipsilateral RGC axons, and that it plays essential roles in establishment of the eye-specific projection patterns in the retinogeniculate system.",

    "abstract": "Putative gain-of-function mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), resulting in increased kinase activity and cellular toxicity, are a leading genetic cause of Parkinsons disease (PD). Hence, there is strong interest in developing LRRK2 kinase inhibitors as a disease-modifying therapy. Published reports that repeat dosing with two LRRK2 kinase inhibitors (GNE-7915 and GNE-0877) induce histopathological changes in the lung of non-human primates Fuji et al. 2015 (1) raised concerns about potential safety liability of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. In the present study, we sought to determine whether previously observed effects in the lung: (a) represent on-target pharmacology, but with the potential for margin of safety, (b) are reversible upon drug withdrawal, and (c) are associated with pulmonary function deficits. To this end, we evaluated the histopathological effects, toxicokinetics and target inhibition of three structurally diverse LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, GNE-7915 (30 mg/kg, BID, as a positive control), MLi-2 (15 and 50 mg/kg, QD) and PFE-360 (3 and 6 mg/kg, QD) following 2 weeks of dosing in non-human primates. Subsets of animals dosed with GNE-7915 or MLi-2 were evaluated after 2-week dose-free periods. All three LRRK2 kinase inhibitors induced mild cytoplasmic vacuolation of type II pneumocytes, as reported previously, confirming an on-target effect of these compounds. Interestingly, despite lower doses of both PFE-360 and MLi-2 producing nearly complete inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity in the brain as assessed by levels of pS935-LRRK2, histopathological changes in lung were absent in animals treated with low-dose PFE-360 and observed only sporadically in the low-dose MLi-2 group. The lung effect was fully reversible at 2 weeks post-dosing of GNE-7915. In a second study of identical dosing with MLi-2 and GNE-7915, no deficits were observed in a battery of translational pulmonary functional tests. In aggregate, these results do not preclude the development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors for clinical investigation in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Histone variants fine-tune transcription, replication, DNA damage repair, and faithful chromosome segregation. Whether and how nucleosome variants encode unique mechanical properties to their cognate chromatin structures remains elusive. Here, using novel in silico and in vitro nanoindentation methods, extending to in vivo dissections, we report that histone variant nucleosomes are intrinsically more elastic than their canonical counterparts. Furthermore, binding proteins which discriminate between histone variant nucleosomes suppress this innate elasticity and also compact chromatin. Interestingly, when we overexpress the binding proteins in vivo, we also observe increased compaction of chromatin enriched for histone variant nucleosomes, correlating with diminished access. Together, these data suggest a plausible link between innate mechanical properties possessed by histone variant nucleosomes, the adaptability of chromatin states in vivo, and the epigenetic plasticity of the underlying locus.\\n\\nSignificanceNucleosomes are the base unit which organize eukaryotic genomes. Besides the canonical histone, histone variants create unique local chromatin domains that fine-tune transcription, replication, DNA damage repair, and faithful chromosome segregation. We developed computational and single-molecule nanoindentation tools to determine mechanical properties of histone variant nucleosomes. We found that the CENP-A nucleosome variant is more elastic than the canonical H3 nucleosome but becomes stiffer when bound to its partner CENP-C. In addition, CENP-C induces cross-array clustering, creating a chromatin state that less accessible. These data suggest that innate material properties of nucleosomes can influence the ultimate chromatin state, thereby influence biological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Y-family DNA polymerase {eta} (Pol{eta}) regulates genome stability in response to different forms of environmental stress by translesion DNA synthesis. To elucidate the role of Pol{eta} in oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, we deleted or overexpressed the corresponding gene RAD30, and used transcriptome analysis to screen the potential genes associated with RAD30 to respond to DNA damage. Under 2 mM H2O2, deletion of RAD30 resulted in a 2.2-fold decrease in survival and a 2.8-fold increase in DNA damage, whereas overexpression of RAD30 increased survival and decreased DNA damage by 1.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type strain. Transcriptome and phenotypic analysis identified Lsm12 as a main factor involved in oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. Deleting LSM12 caused growth defects while its overexpression enhanced cell growth under 2 mM H2O2. This effect was due to the physical interaction of Lsm12 with the UBZ domain of Pol{eta} to enhance Pol{eta} deubiquitination through Ubp3, and consequently promote Pol{eta} recruitment. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Lsm12 is a novel regulator mediating Pol{eta} deubiquitination to promote its recruitment under oxidative stress. Furthermore, this study provides a potential strategy to maintain the genome stability of industrial strains during fermentation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPol{eta} was shown to be critical for cell growth in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and deletion of its corresponding gene RAD30 caused a severe growth defect under exposure to oxidative stress with 2 mM H2O2.

    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that many developing tissues modify glycolysis to favor lactate synthesis, but how this promotes development is unclear. Using forward and reverse genetics in zebrafish, we show that disrupting the glycolytic gene phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (pgk1) impairs Fgf-dependent development of hair cells and neurons in the otic vesicle and other neurons in the CNS/PNS. Focusing on the otic vesicle, we found that Fgf signaling underperforms in pgk1-/- mutants even when Fgf is transiently overexpressed. Wild-type embryos treated with drugs that block synthesis or secretion of lactate mimic the pgk1-/- phenotype, whereas pgk1-/- mutants are rescued by treatment with exogenous lactate. Lactate treatment of wild-type embryos elevates expression of Etv5b/Erm even when Fgf signaling is blocked. Thus, by raising steady-state levels of Etv5b (a critical effector of the Fgf pathway), lactate renders cells more responsive to dynamic changes in Fgf signaling required by many developing tissues.",

    "abstract": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) has been shown to modulate nociception in animals, but no mGlu5 antagonists have been developed commercially as analgesics. The mGlu5 antagonist fenobam [N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4-oxo-1H-imidazole-2-yl)urea] was originally evaluated for development as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Fenobam is analgesic in numerous mouse pain models, acting exclusively via mGlu5 blockade. Furthermore, fenobam showed no signs of analgesic tolerance with up to two weeks of daily dosing in mice. Analgesic effects of fenobam in humans have not been reported. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate fenobam pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects in humans. We first evaluated single-dose oral fenobam disposition in a parallel-group dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers. A second investigation tested the analgesic effects of fenobam in an established experimental human pain model of cutaneous sensitization utilizing capsaicin cream and heat, in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome measure was the area of hyperalgesia and allodynia around the area applied with heat/capsaicin. Secondary outcome measures included nociception, measured as pain rating on a visual analog scale, heat-pain detection threshold, and effects on cognition and mood. Fenobam plasma exposures showed considerable inter-individual variability, and were not linear with dose. Fenobam reduced sensitization vs placebo at a single time-point (peak plasma concentration); we found no other difference between fenobam and placebo. Our results suggest highly variable fenobam disposition, and minimal analgesic effects at the dose tested. We suggest that future studies testing analgesic effects of mGlu5 blockade are warranted, but such studies should employ molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles.",

We investigated two factors that might explain this discrepancy: partial immunity after natural infection clearance and differential screening coverage according to infection risk. We used four variants of a compartmental model for heterosexual C. trachomatis transmission, parameterized using data from England about sexual behaviour and C. trachomatis testing, diagnosis and prevalence, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for statistical inference. A model in which partial immunity follows natural infection clearance and the proportion of tests done in chlamydia-infected people decreases over time fitted the data best. The model predicts that partial immunity reduced susceptibility to reinfection by 72% (95% Bayesian credible interval 57-86%). The estimated screening rate was 4.6 (2.6-6.5) times higher for infected than for uninfected women in 2000; this decreased to 2.1 (1.4-2.9) in 2011. Other factors not included in the model could have further reduced the expected impact of screening. Future mathematical modelling studies investigating the effects of screening interventions on C. trachomatis transmission should incorporate host immunity and changes over time in the targeting of screening.",

    "abstract": "For most women of reproductive age, assessing menstrual health and fertility typically involves regular visits to a gynecologist or another clinician. While these evaluations provide critical information on an individuals reproductive health status, they typically rely on memory-based self-reports, and the results are rarely, if ever, assessed at the population level. In recent years, mobile apps for menstrual tracking have become very popular, allowing us to evaluate the reliability and tracking frequency of millions of self-observations, thereby providing an unparalleled view, both in detail and scale, on menstrual health and its evolution for large populations. In particular, we were interested in exploring the tracking behavior of the app users and their overall observation patterns in an effort to understand if they were consistent with previous small-scale medical studies. We also investigated whether their precision allowed the detection and estimation of ovulation timing, which is critical for reproductive and menstrual health. Retrospective self-observation data were acquired from two mobile apps dedicated to the application of the sympto-thermal fertility awareness method, resulting in a dataset of more than 30 million days of observations from over 2.7 million cycles. The analysis of the data showed that up to 40% of the cycles in which users were seeking pregnancy had recordings every single day. With a modeling approach using Hidden Markov Models to describe the collected data and estimate ovulation timing, it was found that follicular phases average duration and range were larger than previously reported, with only 24% of ovulations occurring at days 14 to 15, while the luteal phase duration and range were in line with previous reports, although short luteal phases (10 days or less) were more frequently observed (in up to 20% of cycles). The digital epidemiology approach presented here can help to lead to a better understanding of menstrual health and its connection to womens health overall, which has historically been severely understudied.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modelling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.",

Most deaths were attributable to A/H3N2, followed by type B influenza. During periods of A/H1N1 circulation, weekly attributable mortality to this subtype among older people increased rapidly in the first half, but then fell to zero and even negative, suggesting a mortality displacement (harvesting) effect.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCritical care and sepsis remain high priority concerns in children. Observational studies report high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and present mixed results regarding the correlation between vitamin D status and adverse outcomes. Associations between deficiency and mortality, particularly in children with sepsis, remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this uncertainty.\\n\\nMethodsPubMed, OVID and Google Scholar were searched for observational studies in critically ill children. We obtained pooled prevalence estimates for vitamin D deficiency and odds ratios for the association of mortality in critically ill children treated in intensive care units, with subgroup analysis for children with sepsis. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were used to investigate heterogeneity.\\n\\nFindingsForty-eight studies were included. The total sample size was 7,199, with 1,679 (23%) children acting as controls in case-control studies. Of 5,520 critically ill children, 2,664 (48%) were vitamin D deficient (< 50 nmol/L). Results of the random effects model demonstrated a pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency of 54.9% (95% CI 48.0-61.6, I2=95.0%, 95% CI 94.0-95.8, p < 0.0001). In subgroup analysis of children with sepsis (16 studies, 788 total individuals) we observed higher prevalence of deficiency (63.8%, 95% CI 49.9-75.7, I2=90.5%, 95% CI 86.2-93.5%, p < 0.0001). In patients admitted to intensive care for respiratory tract infections (24 studies, 1,683 total individuals), prevalence was 49.9% (95% CI 37.6-62.2; I2 = 93.9%, 95% CI 92.1-95.3, p < 0.0001). Only one identified study assessed vitamin D levels in sepsis and mortality. The meta-regression model with all available variables (year of publication, total study sample size, quality score, study design, country group and clinical setting) explained 37.52% of I2 (F = 5.1119, p = 0.0005) with clinical setting and country groups being significant predictors for prevalence.\\n\\nOur meta-analysis (18 studies, 2,463 total individuals) showed an increased risk of death in vitamin D deficient critically ill children both with the random (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24-2.64, p-value = 0.002) and fixed effects (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.27-2.33, p= 0.0005) models with low heterogeneity (I2 = 25.7%, 95% CI 0.0-58.0, p = 0.153) and low evidence of publication bias (p = 0.084, Eggers test).\\n\\nInterpretationCirculating vitamin D deficiency is common amongst critically ill children, particularly in those with sepsis. Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency in critically ill children is associated with increased mortality. Clinical trials, studies with larger sample sizes and standardized approaches are needed to further assess associations between circulating levels of vitamin D and mortality or other outcomes in the pediatric population.\\n\\nFundingNone\\n\\nRegistrationPROSPERO (CRD42016050638)\\n\\nCopyrightOpen access article under terms of CC BY",

    "abstract": "Background/ObjectiveNon-adherence to recommended medical therapy has been associated with poorer outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The present research investigated the association of medical non-adherence and cannabis use on renal outcomes of SLE.\\n\\nMethodsThis was a prospective 5-year longitudinal outcome study of 276 female SLE patients 30.4% who chronically used medical cannabis and 69.5% who did not. Outcomes were determined at 5 years after enrollment in the study.\\n\\nResultsCannabis use in SLE patients was associated with an increased prevalence of neuropsychiatric SLE (p<0.05), opioid analgesic use (p<0.01), cigarette smoking (p<0.001), and non-adherence to the medical regimen (non-cannabis: 3% non-adherence vs. cannabis use: 95% non-adherence, p<0.001). Within the 5-year period, the cannabis group demonstrated a 53% increase in mortality (p=0.12) and 127% increase in end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (p<0.001). With logistic regression analysis adjusting for SLE disease activity (SLEDAI-2K), cannabis use was an independent predictor of end-stage renal disease: Odds ratio 2.65 (CI 1.32 - 5.32, p<0.01). Adjusting for SLE disease damage (SLICC/ACR-DI), cannabis use remained an independent predictor of end-stage renal disease: Odds ratio 2.0 (CI 1.26 - 6.23, p<0.01). With multivariable analysis adjusting for non-adherence, the effect of cannabis on end-stage renal disease could be largely attributed to an increase in non-adherence to medical therapy.\\n\\nConclusionsNon-adherence to recommended therapy and medical cannabis use are associated with a significant increase in the development of end-stage renal disease in SLE.",

    "abstract": "During 2014 and 2015 the chikungunya virus reached Colombia unleashing an epidemic that spread throughout the whole territory. Concurrently, the Colombian Rheumatology Association was conducting a Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) to establish rheumatic disease prevalence in the country. Chikungunya infected patients were identified within the COPCORD population. The aim of this study was to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics and disability of patients with clinical suspicion of chikungunya infection. To confirm chikungunya infection, ELISA IgM and IgG serology was performed. From the 6528-surveyed people of the COPCORD study, 548 where included in the study because of clinical suspicion of chikungunya virus infection. Of those, 295 were positive for IgG or IgM chikungunya serology with 151 patients fulfilling WHO clinical criteria for chikungunya infection (true positives). Most patients were > 45 years (57.7%), and females (69.7%). Patients with low income and low socio-economic strata had increased risk of chikungunya infection (p = 0.00; OR: 2.36, CI: 1.47-3.77 and p = 0.00; OR: 2.81, CI: 1.90-4.17 respectively). True positive patients were associated with symmetric arthritis (p = 0.00; OR: 22.49, CI: 12.71-39.80) of ankles (p = 0.00; OR: 16.06, CI: 7.57-34.08), hands (p = 0.00; OR: 16.12, CI: 8.25-39.79), feet (p = 0.00; OR: 16.35, CI: 7.41-36.05) and elbows (p = 0.00; OR: 14.00, CI: 3.03-64.70). Most patients developed mild to moderate disability (95.2 to 100%). Our study showed that poverty and low socioeconomic status are associated with increased risk of chikungunya infection. Also, we found two distinctive phenotypes of chikungunya infection; those with positive chikungunya serology and typical clinical symptoms (true positives) and those with positive serology without clinical symptoms (false negatives). Finally, a distinctive clinical picture presented by chikungunya infected patients was found which should be considered as the hallmark for diagnostic clinical criteria.",
