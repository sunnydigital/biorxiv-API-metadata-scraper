    "abstract": "Human DNA varies across geographic regions, with most variation observed so far reflecting distant ancestry differences. Here, we investigate the geographic clustering of genetic variants that influence complex traits and disease risk in a sample of ~450,000 individuals from Great Britain. Out of 30 traits analyzed, 16 show significant geographic clustering at the genetic level after controlling for ancestry, likely reflecting recent migration driven by socio-economic status (SES). Alleles associated with educational attainment (EA) show most clustering, with EA-decreasing alleles clustering in lower SES areas such as coal mining areas. Individuals that leave coal mining areas carry more EA-increasing alleles on average than the rest of Great Britain. In addition, we leveraged the geographic clustering of complex trait variation to further disentangle regional differences in socio-economic and cultural outcomes through genome-wide association studies on publicly available regional measures, namely coal mining, religiousness, 1970/2015 general election outcomes, and Brexit referendum results.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial communities present in environmental waters constitute a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant pathogens that impact human health. For this reason a diverse variety of water environments are being analyzed using metagenomics to uncover public health threats. However, the composition of these communities along the coastal environment of a whole city where sewage and beach waters are mixed, is poorly understood.\\n\\nResultsWe shotgun-sequenced 20 coastal areas from the city of Montevideo (capital of Uruguay) including beach and sewage water samples to characterize bacterial communities and their virulence and antibiotic resistance repertories. We found that sewage and beach environments presented significantly different bacterial communities. Sewage waters harbored a higher prevalence and a more diverse repertory of virulence and antibiotic resistant genes mainly from well-known enterobacteria, including carbapenemases and extended-spectrum betalactamases reported in hospital infections in Montevideo. Additionally, we were able to genotype the presence of both globally-disseminated pathogenic clones as well as emerging antibiotic-resistant bacteria in sewage waters.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study represents the first in using metagenomics to jointly analyze beaches and the sewage system from an entire city, allowing us to characterize antibiotic-resistant pathogens circulating in urban waters. The data generated in this initial study represent a baseline metagenomic exploration to guide future longitudinal (time-wise) studies, whose systematic implementation will provide useful epidemiological information to improve public health surveillance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genus Pantoea forms a complex of more than 25 species, among which several cause diseases of several crop plants, including rice. Notably, strains of Pantoea ananatis and Pantoea stewartii have been found to cause bacterial leaf blight of rice in Togo and Benin, while other authors have observed that Pantoea agglomerans can also cause bacterial leaf blight of rice. The contribution of these and perhaps other species of Pantoea to plant diseases and yield losses of crop plants is currently not well documented, partly due to the lack of efficient diagnostic tools.\\n\\nResultUsing 34 whole genome sequences of the three-major plant-pathogenic Pantoea species, a set of PCR primers that specifically detect each of the three species, P. agglomerans, P. ananatis, and P. stewartii, was designed. A multiplex PCR protocol which can distinguish these three species and also detects members of other Pantoea species was further developed. Upon validation on a set of reference strains, 609 suspected Pantoea strains that were isolated from rice leaves or seeds originating from 11 African countries were screened. In total, 41 P. agglomerans strains from eight countries, 79 P. ananatis strains from nine countries, 269 P. stewartii strains from nine countries and 220 unsolved Pantoea strains from ten countries were identified. The PCR protocol allowed detecting Pantoea bacteria grown in vitro, in planta and in rice seeds. The detection threshold was estimated at 5 ng/mL of total genomic DNA and 1 x 105 CFU/mL of heated cells.\\n\\nConclusionThis new molecular diagnostic tool will help accurately diagnose major plant-pathogenic species of Pantoea. Due to its robustness, specificity, sensitivity, and cost efficiency it will be very useful for plant protection services and for the epidemiological surveillance of these important crop-threatening bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Reflectin proteins are widely distributed in reflective structures in cephalopods, but only in Loliginid squids are they and the sub-wavelength photonic structures they control dynamically tunable, driving changes in skin color for camouflage and communication. The reflectins are block copolymers with repeated canonical domains interspersed with cationic linkers. Neurotransmitter-activated signal transduction culminates in catalytic phosphorylation of the tunable reflectins cationic linkers, with the resulting charge-neutralization overcoming Coulombic repulsion to progressively allow condensation and concommitant assembly to form multimeric spheres of tunable size. Structural transitions of reflectins A1 and A2 were analyzed by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, solution small angle x-ray scattering, circular dichroism, atomic force microscopy, and fluorimetry. We analyzed the assembly behavior of phospho-mimetic, deletion, and other mutants in conjunction with pH-titration as an in vitro surrogate of phosphorylation to discover a predictive relationship between the extent of neutralization of the proteins net charge density and the size of resulting multimeric protein assemblies of narrow polydispersity. Comparison of mutants shows this sensitivity to neutralization resides in the linkers and is spatially distributed along the protein. These results are consistent with the behavior of a charge-stabilized colloidal system, while imaging of large particles, and analysis of sequence composition, suggest that assembly may proceed through a transient liquid-liquid phase separated intermediate. These results offer insights into the basis of reflectin-based tunable biophotonics and open new paths for the design of new reflectin mutants with tunable properties.",

    "abstract": "A neurons longevity is regulated by both extracellular molecular factors and the regulation of its intracellular functions, including mitochondrial activity. It remains poorly understood which extracellular factors promote neuron survival by influencing mitochondrial function. Through zebrafish mutant analysis, we reveal a novel extracellular neuronal survival factor: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-aa (Pappaa). Neurons in pappaa mutant larvae die precociously and exhibit multiple mitochondrial defects, including elevated mitochondrial calcium, membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species production (ROS). In pappaa mutants, neuron loss is exacerbated by stimulation of mitochondrial calcium load or ROS production and suppressed by exposure to a mitochondrial ROS scavenger. As a secreted metalloprotease, Pappaa stimulates local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling; a known regulator of mitochondrial function and neuron survival. In pappaa mutants, neurons show reduced IGF1-receptor activity and neuron loss is attenuated by stimulation of IGF1 signaling. These results suggest Pappaa-IGF1 signaling promotes neuron survival by regulating mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "We proposed a method for segmentation of brain tissues--gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)--using multi-contrast images, including a T1 map and a uniform T1-weighted image, from a magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence at 7 Tesla. The proposed method was evaluated with respect to the processing time and the similarity of the segmented masks of brain tissues with those obtained using FreeSurfer, FSL, and SPM12. The processing time of the proposed method (28 {+/-} 0 s) was significantly shorter than those of FSL and SPM12 (444 {+/-} 4 s and 159 {+/-} 2 s for FSL and SPM12, respectively). In the similarity assessment, the tissue mask of the brain obtained by the proposed method showed higher consistency with those obtained by FSL than with those obtained by SPM12. The proposed method misclassified the subcortical structures and large vessels since it is based on the intensities of multi-contrast images obtained using MP2RAGE, which uses a similar segmentation approach as FSL but is not based on a template image or a parcellated brain atlas, which are used for FreeSurfer and SPM12, respectively. However, the proposed method showed good segmentation in the cerebellum and WM in the medial part of the brain in comparison with the other methods. Thus, because the proposed method using different contrast images of MP2RAGE sequence showed the shortest processing time and similar segmentation ability as the other methods, it may be useful for both neuroimaging research and clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral, structural, and functional neuroimaging have implicated the hippocampus as a critical brain region in PTSD pathogenesis. We conducted a GWAS of hippocampal subfield volumes in a sample of recent military veteran trauma survivors (n=157), including some with PTSD (n=66). Covariates in our analysis included lifetime PTSD diagnosis, sex, intracranial volume, genomic estimates of ancestry, and childhood trauma. Interactions between genetic variants and lifetime PTSD or childhood trauma were interrogated for SNPs with significant main effects. Several genetic associations surpassed correction for multiple testing for several hippocampal subfields, including fimbria, subiculum, cornu ammonis-1(CA1), and hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA). One association replicated in an independent cohort of civilians with PTSD (rs12880795 in TUNAR with L-HATA volume, p=3.43 x 10-7 in the discovery and p=0.0004 in the replication cohort). However, the most significant association in the discovery data set was between rs6906714 in LINC02571 and R-fimbria volume (p=5.99 x10-8, q=0.0056). Interestingly, the effect of rs6906714 on R-fimbria volume increased with childhood trauma (G*E interaction p=0.022). In addition to variants in long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), we identified SNPs associated with hippocampal subfield volume, which are also quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for genes involved in RNA editing of glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs), oxidative stress, and autoimmune disorders. Genomic regions, some with putative regulatory roles, influence the volume of hippocampal subfields. Neuroimaging phenotypes may offer important insight into the genetic architecture and neurobiological pathways relevant to PTSD, as well as in the identification of potential biomarkers and drug targets for PTSD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSEProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radiotherapy is a promising treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with several beta or alpha particle-emitting radionuclide-conjugated small molecules showing efficacy in late stage patients. However, PSMA is also expressed in kidneys and salivary glands where specific uptake causes dose-limiting xerostomia and potential for nephrotoxicity. The PSMA inhibitor 2- (phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA) can prevent kidney uptake in mice, but also blocks tumor uptake, precluding its clinical utility. Selective delivery of 2-PMPA to non-malignant tissues could improve the therapeutic window of PSMA radiotherapy.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGNA tri-alkoxycarbonyloxy alkyl (TrisPOC) prodrug of 2-PMPA, JHU-2545, was synthesized to enhance 2-PMPA delivery to non-malignant tissues. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and imaging experiments were conducted prior to assessment in 3 mCRPC patients receiving PSMA PET and radiotherapy.\n\nRESULTSJHU-2545 resulted in 3- and 53-fold greater exposure of 2-PMPA in rodent salivary glands (18.0 {+/-} 0.97 h*nmol/g) and kidneys (359 {+/-} 4.16 h*nmol/g) versus prostate tumor xenograft (6.79 {+/-} 0.19 h*nmol/g). JHU-2545 also blocked rodent kidneys and salivary glands uptake of the PSMA PET tracers 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-DCFPyL by up to 85% without effect on tumor. In a mCRPC patient, JHU-2545 treatment prior to 68Ga-PSMA-617 administration reduced kidney SUVmax by 76% without effect on metastatic lesions. When administered prior to injection of the beta emitter 177Lu-PSMA-617, JHU-2545 shielded both the salivary glands (72% Gy reduction) and kidneys (45% Gy reduction) without effect on metastases dose.\n\nCONCLUSIONSJHU-2545 pre-treatment raises the cumulative dose limit and improves the safety and efficacy profile of PSMA radiotherapy.\n\nSTATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEProstate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) molecular radiotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but endogenous expression of PSMA in kidneys and salivary glands causes uptake into these organs resulting in dose-limiting toxicities. We describe the discovery of JHU-2545, a PSMA inhibitor prodrug that selectively blocks kidney and salivary gland uptake of PSMA theranostics without altering tumor uptake in both preclinical models and in mCRPC patients. Pretreatment of JHU-2545 thereby improves the safety and efficacy profile of the multiple PSMA radiotherapies in development.",

A proposed design of integral control for synthetic biological systems employs the sequestration of two biochemical controller species. The unbound amount of controller species captures the integral of the error between the current and the desired state of the system. However, implementing integral control inside bacterial cells using sequestration feedback has been challenging due to the controller molecules being degraded and diluted. Furthermore, integral control can only be achieved under stability conditions that not all sequestration feedback networks fulfill. In this work, we give guidelines for ensuring stability and good performance (small steady-state error) in sequestration feedback networks.

Currently, 7.1% of the (sub)continent is under strict conservation categories (I to IV, IUCN), but the spatial distribution of these 1.3 x 106 km2 is poorly understood. We evaluate protected area representativeness, map conservation priorities and assess demographic, productive or geopolitical causes of the existing protection spatial patterns using a random forest method.\\n\\nMethodsWe characterized representativeness by two dimensions: the extent and the equality of protection. The first refers to the fraction of a territory under protection, while the second refers to the spatial distribution of this protection along natural conditions. We characterized natural conditions by 113 biogeographical units (specifically, ecoregions) and a series of limited and significant climatic, topographic and edaphic traits. We analyzed representativeness every ten years since 1960 at national and continental levels. In the physical approach, histograms allowed us to map the degree of conservation priorities. Finally, we ranked the importance of different productive or geopolitical variables driving the observed distributions with a random forest technique.\\n\\nResultsRepresentativeness was variable across countries in spite of its priority in conservation agendas. Brazil, Peru and Argentina underrepresented a significant fraction of their natural diversity, while Bolivia and Venezuela protected their natural diversity equitably under extensive conservation networks. As protected networks increased their extent, so did their equality across countries and within them through time. Mapping revealed as top continental priorities southern temperate, subhumid and fertile lowland environments, and other country- specific needs (e.g., hot, humid plains of Venezuela). Protection extent was generally driven by a low population density and isolation, while other variables -like distance to frontiers, were relevant only locally (e.g., in Argentina).\\n\\nDiscussionOur description of the spatial distribution can help societies and governments to improve the allocation of conservation efforts, being top continental priorities the southern temperate, subhumid and fertile lowland environments. We identify the main limitations that future conservation efforts will face, as protection was generally driven by the opportunities provided by low population density and isolation. From a methodological perspective, the complementary physical approach reveals new properties of protection and provides tools to explore nature representativeness at different spatial, temporal and conceptual levels, complementing the traditional ones based on biodiversity or biogeographical attributes.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering the spatial dynamics of range expansions is a major goal in studies of historical demographic inference, with applications ranging from understanding the evolutionary origins of domesticated crops, epidemiology, invasive species, and understanding specieslevel responses to climate change. Following the surge in advances that make explicit use of the spatial distribution of genetic data from georeferenced SNP variants, we present a novel summary statistic vector, the geographic spectrum of shared alleles (GSSA). Using simulations of twodimensional serial expansion, we find that the information from the GSSA, summarized with Harpendings Raggedness Index (RI), can accurately detect the spatial origins of a range expansion under serial founder models, even with sparse sampling of only ten individuals. When applying to SNP data from two species of the holarctic butterfly genus Lycaeides, the suggested origins of expansion are consistent with hindcasts obtained from ecological niche models (ENMs). These results demonstrate the GSSA to be a useful exploratory tool for generating hypotheses of range expansion with genomewide SNP data. Our simulation experiments suggest high performance even with sampling found in studies of nonmodel organisms (one sampled individual per location, no outgroup information, and only 5,000 SNP loci).",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic alteration that plays a key role in cellular differentiation and gene regulation, and that has been proposed to mediate environmental effects on disease risk. Epigenome-wide association studies have identified and replicated associations between methylation sites and several disease conditions, which could serve as biomarkers in predictive medicine and forensics. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in cellular proportions between the compared groups could complicate interpretation. Reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods have proven useful in correcting epigenomic studies for cellular heterogeneity, but they rely on reference libraries of sorted cells and only predict a limited number of cell populations. Here we leverage >850,000 methylation sites included in the MethylationEPIC array and use elastic net regularized and stability selected regression models to predict the circulating levels of 70 blood cell subsets, measured by standardized flow cytometry in 962 healthy donors of western European descent. We show that our predictions, based on a hundred of methylation sites or lower, are less error-prone than other existing methods, and extend the number of cell types that can be accurately predicted. Application of the same methods to age, smoking consumption and several serological responses to pathogen antigens also provide accurate estimations. Together, our study substantially improves predictions of blood cell composition based on methylation profiles, which will be critical in the emerging field of medical epigenomics.",

    "abstract": "The neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a major enzyme made by neutrophils to generate antimicrobial and immunomodulatory compounds, notably hypochlorous acid (HOCl), amplifying their capacity for destroying pathogens and regulating inflammation. Despite its roles in innate immunity, the importance of MPO in preventing infection is unclear, as individuals with MPO deficiency are asymptomatic with the exception of an increased risk of candidiasis. Dysregulation of MPO activity is also linked with inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis, emphasising a need to understand the roles of the enzyme in greater detail. Consequently, new tools for investigating granular dynamics in vivo can provide useful insights into how MPO localises within neutrophils, aiding understanding of its role in preventing and exacerbating disease. The zebrafish is a powerful model for investigating the immune system in vivo, as it is genetically tractable, and optically transparent.\n\nTo visualise MPO activity within zebrafish neutrophils, we created a genetic construct that expresses human MPO as a fusion protein with a C-terminal fluorescent tag, driven by the neutrophil-specific promoter lyz. After introducing the construct into the zebrafish genome by Tol2 transgenesis, we established the Tg(lyz:Hsa.MPO-mEmerald,cmlc2:EGFP)sh496 line, and confirmed transgene expression in zebrafish neutrophils. We observed localisation of MPO-mEmerald within a subcellular location resembling neutrophil granules, mirroring MPO in human neutrophils. In Spotless (mpxNL144) larvae - which express a non-functional zebrafish myeloperoxidase - the MPO-mEmerald transgene does not disrupt neutrophil migration to sites of infection or inflammation, suggesting that it is a suitable line for the study of neutrophil granule function.\n\nWe present a new transgenic line that can be used to investigate neutrophil granule dynamics in vivo without disrupting neutrophil behaviour, with potential applications in studying processing and maturation of MPO during development.",

    "abstract": "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of steroid hormones regulating plant growth and development. Since BRs do not undergo transport among plant tissues, their metabolism is tightly regulated by transcription factors (TFs) and feedback loops. BAS1 (CYP734A1, formerly CYP72B1) and SOB7 (CYP72C1) are two BR-inactivating cytochrome P450s identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. We previously found that a TF ATAF2 (ANAC081) suppresses BAS1 and SOB7 expression by binding to the Evening Element (EE) and CCA1-binding sites (CBS) on their promoters. Both EE and CBS are known binding targets of the core circadian clock regulatory protein CCA1. Here, we confirm that CCA1 binds the EE and CBS motifs on BAS1 and SOB7 promoters, respectively. Elevated accumulations of BAS1 and SOB7 transcripts in the CCA1 null mutant cca1-1 indicate that CCA1 is a repressor of their expression. When compared to either cca1-1 or the ATAF2 null mutant ataf2-2, the cca1-1 ataf2-2 double mutant shows higher SOB7 transcript accumulations and stronger BR-insensitive phenotype of hypocotyl elongation in white light. CCA1 interacts with ATAF2 at both DNA-protein and protein-protein levels. ATAF2, BAS1 and SOB7 are all circadian-regulated with distinct expression patterns. These results demonstrate that CCA1 and ATAF2 differentially suppress BAS1- and SOB7-mediated BR inactivation.\\n\\nHighlightThe core circadian regulator CCA1 is a direct repressor of brassinosteroid inactivating genes BAS1 and SOB7, and interact with another repressor, ATAF2.

To address this challenge, we have developed Moana, a hierarchical machine learning framework that enables the construction of robust cell type classifiers from heterogeneous scRNA-Seq datasets. To demonstrate Moanas capabilities, we construct cell type classifiers for human immune cells that accurately distinguish between closely related cell types in the presence of experimental perturbations and systematic differences between scRNA-Seq protocols. We show that Moana is generally applicable and scales to datasets with more than ten thousand cells, thus enabling the construction of tissue-specific cell type atlases that can be directly applied to analyze new scRNASeq datasets.

For clinical outcomes analysis, 17,758 adult patients who met two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria at any point during their stay were included.\\n\\nResultsAt severe sepsis onset, the MLA demonstrated an AUROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90, 0.92), which exceeded those of MEWS (0.71, P<001), SOFA (0.74; P<.001), and SIRS (0.62; P<.001). For severe sepsis prediction 48 hours in advance of onset, the MLA achieved an AUROC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.73, 0.80).

Reductions of in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and 30-day readmissions were observed in real-world clinical use of the MLA.

In an analysis of real-world data from nine hospitals across 75,147 patient encounters, use of the machine learning algorithm was associated with a 39.5% reduction in in-hospital mortality, a 32.3% reduction in hospital length of stay, and a 22.7% reduction in 30-day readmission rate.\\n\\nMeaningThe accurate and predictive nature of this algorithm may encourage early recognition of patients trending toward severe sepsis, and therefore improve sepsis related outcomes.\\n\\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIA retrospective study of machine learning severe sepsis prediction from a dataset with 510,497 patient encounters demonstrates high accuracy up to 48 hours prior to onset.\\nC_LIO_LIA multicenter clinical study of real-world data using this machine learning algorithm for severe sepsis alerts achieved reductions of in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and 30-day readmissions.\\nC_LIO_LIThe required presence of an ICD-9 code to classify a patient as severely septic in our retrospective analysis potentially limits our ability to accurately classify all patients.\\nC_LIO_LIOnly adults in US hospitals were included in this study.\\nC_LIO_LIFor the real-world section of the study, we cannot eliminate the possibility that implementation of a sepsis algorithm raised general awareness of sepsis within a hospital, which may lead to higher recognition of septic patients, independent of algorithm performance.\\nC_LI",

In the case of rifampicin resistance in fast-growing bacteria, this cost stems from a reduced transcription rate of the RNA polymerase resulting in slower ribosome biosynthesis. However, this relationship does not apply in the slow-growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where the true mechanism of fitness cost of rifampicin resistance as well as the impact of compensatory evolution remain unknown. Here we show, using global transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of selected M. tuberculosis mutants and clinical strains, that the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis is the result of the physiological burden caused by aberrant gene expression. We further show that the perceived burden can be increased, effectively suppressing the emergence of drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) at multiple sites can collectively influence protein function but the scope of such PTM coding has been challenging to determine. The number of potential combinatorial patterns of PTMs on a single molecule increases exponentially with the number of modification sites and a population of molecules exhibits a distribution of such \\\"modforms\\\". Estimating these \\\"modform distributions\\\" is central to understanding how PTMs influence protein function. Although mass-spectrometry (MS) has made modforms more accessible, we have previously shown that current MS technology cannot recover the modform distribution of heavily modified proteins. However, MS data yield linear equations for modform amounts, which constrain the distribution within a high-dimensional, polyhedral \\\"modform region\\\". Here, we show that linear programming (LP) can efficiently determine a range within which each modform value must lie, thereby approximating the modform region. We use this method on simulated data for mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 with the 7 phosphorylations reported on UniProt, giving a modform region in a 128 dimensional space. The exact dimension of the region is determined by the number of linearly independent equations but its size and shape depend on the data. The average modform range, which is a measure of size, reduces when data from bottom-up (BU) MS, in which proteins are first digested into peptides, is combined with data from top-down (TD) MS, in which whole proteins are analysed. Furthermore, when the modform distribution is structured, as might be expected of real distributions, the modform region for BU and TD combined has a more intricate polyhedral shape and is substantially more constrained than that of a random distribution. These results give the first insights into high-dimensional modform regions and confirm that fast LP methods can be used to analyse them. We discuss the problems of using modform regions with real data, when the actual modform distribution will not be known.",

Intervals from submission to acceptance, acceptance to publication, and submission to publication were calculated in days for each article. Data were compared visually across all journals, and statistically by field (veterinary, medical, high-impact), by impact factor and by publisher (commercial vs society) to identify trends or differences in publication intervals.\\n\\nRESULTSWhen assessed by field, intervals from submission to acceptance (p=0.18), acceptance to publication (p=0.75) and submission to publication (p=0.13) did not differ. Individual journals varied slightly in intervals from submission to acceptance, but varied markedly in intervals from acceptance to publication.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies indicate increased autistic traits in musicians with absolute pitch and a higher incidence of absolute pitch in people with autism. Theoretical accounts connect both of these with shared neural principles of local hyper- and global hypoconnectivity, enhanced perceptual functioning and a detail-focused cognitive style. This is the first study to investigate absolute pitch proficiency, autistic traits and brain correlates in the same study.\\n\\nSample and MethodsGraph theoretical analysis was conducted on resting state (eyes closed and eyes open) EEG connectivity (wPLI, weighted Phase Lag Index) matrices obtained from 31 absolute pitch (AP) and 33 relative pitch (RP) professional musicians. Small Worldness, Global Clustering Coefficient and Average Path length were related to autistic traits, passive (tone identification) and active (pitch adjustment) absolute pitch proficiency and onset of musical training using Welch-two-sample-tests, correlations and general linear models.\\n\\nResultsAnalyses revealed increased Path length (delta 2-4 Hz), reduced Clustering (beta 13-18 Hz), reduced Small-Worldness (gamma 30-60 Hz) and increased autistic traits for AP compared to RP. Only Clustering values (beta 13-18 Hz) were predicted by both AP proficiency and autistic traits. Post-hoc single connection permutation tests among raw wPLI matrices in the beta band (13-18 Hz) revealed widely reduced interhemispheric connectivity between bilateral auditory related electrode positions along with higher connectivity between F7-F8 and F8-P9 for AP. Pitch naming ability and Pitch adjustment ability were predicted by Path length, Clustering, autistic traits and onset of musical training (for pitch adjustment) explaining 44% respectively 38% of variance.\\n\\nConclusionsResults show both shared and distinct neural features between AP and autistic traits. Differences in the beta range were associated with higher autistic traits in the same population. In general, AP musicians exhibit a widely underconnected brain with reduced functional integration and reduced small-world-property during resting state. This might be partly related to autism-specific brain connectivity, while differences in Path length and Small-Worldness reflect other ability-specific influences. This is further evidence for different pathways in the acquisition and development of absolute pitch, likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and their interaction.",

    "abstract": "Massively multiplexed sequencing of RNA in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences. However, in standard experiments, tissues must first be dissociated. Thus, after sequencing, information about the spatial relationships between cells is lost although this knowledge is crucial for understanding cellular and tissue-level function. Recent attempts to overcome this fundamental challenge rely on employing additional in situ gene expression imaging data which can guide spatial mapping of sequenced cells. Here we present a conceptually different approach that allows to reconstruct spatial positions of cells in a variety of tissues without using reference imaging data. We first show for several complex biological systems that distances of single cells in expression space monotonically increase with their physical distances across tissues. We therefore seek to map cells to tissue space such that this principle is optimally preserved, while matching existing imaging data when available. We show that this optimization problem can be cast as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efficiently. We apply our approach successfully to reconstruct the mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium as well as fly and zebrafish embryos. Our results demonstrate a simple spatial expression organization principle and that this principle (or future refined principles) can be used to infer, for individual cells, meaningful spatial position probabilities from the sequencing data alone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvolution of cancer is driven by few somatic mutations that disrupt cellular processes, causing abnormal proliferation and tumor development, while most somatic mutations have no impact on progression. Distinguishing those mutated genes that drive tumorigenesis in a patient is a primary goal in cancer therapy: Knowledge of these genes and the pathways on which they operate can illuminate disease mechanisms and indicate potential therapies and drug targets. Current research focuses mainly on cohort-level driver gene identification, but patient-specific driver gene identification remains a challenge.\n\nMethodsWe developed a new algorithm for patient-specific ranking of driver genes. The algorithm, called PRODIGY, analyzes the expression and mutation profiles of the patient along with data on known pathways and protein-protein interactions. Prodigy quantifies the impact of each mutated gene on every deregulated pathway using the prize collecting Steiner tree model. Mutated genes are ranked by their aggregated impact on all deregulated pathways.\n\nResultsIn testing on five TCGA cancer cohorts spanning >2500 patients and comparison to validated driver genes, Prodigy outperformed extant methods and ranking based on network centrality measures. Our results pinpoint the pleiotropic effect of driver genes and show that Prodigy is capable of identifying even very rare drivers. Hence, Prodigy takes a step further towards personalized medicine and treatment.\n\nAvailabilityThe Prodigy R package is available at: https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/PRODIGY.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundContainer virtualization technologies such as Docker became popular in the bioinformatics domain as they improve portability and reproducibility of software deployment. Along with software packaged in containers, the workflow description standards Common Workflow Language also enabled to perform data analysis on multiple different computing environments with ease. These technologies accelerate the use of on-demand cloud computing platform which can scale out according to the amount of data. However, to optimize the time and the budget on a use of cloud, users need to select a suitable instance type corresponding to the resource requirements of their workflows.\\n\\nResultsWe developed CWL-metrics, a system to collect runtime metrics of Docker containers and workflow metadata to analyze resource requirement of workflows. We demonstrated the analysis by using seven transcriptome quantification workflows on six instance types. The result showed instance type options of lower financial cost and faster execution time with required amount of computational resources.\\n\\nConclusionsThe summary of resource requirements of workflow executions provided by CWL-metrics can help users to optimize the selection of cloud computing instance. The runtime metrics data also accelerate to share workflows among different workflow management frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Detection of genetically distinct subclones and profiling the transcriptomic differences between them is important for studying the evolutionary dynamics of tumors, as well as for accurate prognosis and effective treatment of cancer in the clinic. For the profiling of intra-tumor transcriptional heterogeneity, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now ubiquitously adopted in ongoing and planned cancer studies. Detection of somatic DNA mutations and inference of clonal membership from scRNA-seq, however, is currently unreliable. We propose DENDRO, an analysis method for scRNA-seq data that detects genetically distinct subclones, assigns each single cell to a subclone, and reconstructs the phylogenetic tree describing the tumors evolutionary history. DENDRO utilizes information from single nucleotide mutations in transcribed regions and accounts for technical noise and expression stochasticity at the single cell level. The accuracy of DENDRO was benchmarked on spike-in datasets and on scRNA-seq data with known subpopulation structure. We applied DENDRO to delineate subclonal expansion in a mouse melanoma model in response to immunotherapy, highlighting the role of neoantigens in treatment response. We also applied DENDRO to primary and lymph-node metastasis samples in breast cancer, where the new approach allowed us to better understand the relationship between genetic and transcriptomic intratumor variation.",

    "abstract": "Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a small, non-enveloped tumor virus associated with an aggressive form of skin cancer, the Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). MCPyV infections are highly prevalent in the human population with MCPyV virions being continuously shed from human skin. However, the precise host cell tropism(s) of MCPyV remains unclear: MCPyV is able to replicate within a subset of dermal fibroblasts, but MCPyV DNA has also been detected in a variety of other tissues. However, MCPyV appears different from other polyomaviruses as it requires sulfated polysaccharides such as heparan sulfates and/or chondroitin sulfates for initial attachment. Like other polyomaviruses, MCPyV engages sialic acid as a (co-receptor). To explore the infectious entry process of MCPyV, we analyzed the cell biological determinants of MCPyV entry into A549 cells, a highly transducible lung carcinoma cell line, in comparison to well-studied simian virus 40 and a number of other viruses. Our results indicate that MCPyV enters cells via caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis but not macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis or glycosphingolipid-enriched carriers. The viruses internalized in small endocytic pits that led the virus to endosomes and from there to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar to other polyomaviruses, trafficking required microtubular transport, acidification of endosomes, and a functional redox environment. To our surprise, the virus was found to acquire a membrane envelope within endosomes, a phenomenon not reported for other viruses. Only minor amounts of viruses reached the ER, while the majority was retained in endosomal compartments suggesting that endosome-to-ER trafficking is a bottleneck during infectious entry.\\n\\nImportanceMCPyV is the first polyomavirus directly implicated in the development of an aggressive human cancer, the Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC). Although MCPyV is constantly shed from healthy skin, MCC incidence increases among aging and immunocompromised individuals. To date, the events connecting initial MCPyV infection and subsequent transformation still remain elusive. MCPyV differs from other known polyomaviruses concerning its cell tropism, entry receptor requirements, and infection kinetics. In this study, we examined the cellular requirements for endocytic entry as well as the subcellular localization of incoming virus particles. A thorough understanding of the determinants of the infectious entry pathway and the specific biological niche will benefit prevention of virus-derived cancers such as MCC.",
