    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of fate decisions to form a complete organism comprised of various cell types, epitomising a branching process. A striking example of branching occurs in humans around the time of implantation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of sperm and eggs, and somatic lineages are specified. Due to inaccessibility of human embryos at this stage of development, understanding the mechanisms of PGC specification remains difficult. The integrative modelling of single cell transcriptomics data from embryos and appropriate in vitro models should prove to be a useful resource for investigating this system, provided that the cells can be suitably ordered over a developmental axis. Unfortunately, most methods for inferring cell ordering were not designed with structured (time series) data in mind. Although some probabilistic approaches address these limitations by incorporating prior information about the developmental stage (capture time) of the cell, they do not allow the ordering of cells over processes with more than one terminal cell fate. To investigate the mechanisms of PGC specification, we develop a probabilistic pseudotime approach, branch-recombinant Gaussian process latent variable models (B-RGPLVMs), that use an explicit model of transcriptional branching in individual marker genes, allowing the ordering of cells over developmental trajectories with arbitrary numbers of branches. We use first demonstrate the advantage of our approach over existing pseudotime algorithms and subsequently use it to investigate early human development, as primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells diverge. We identify known master regulators of human PGCs, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate, and identify putative roles for PRC1 and PRC2 in PGC specification. We experimentally validate our predictions using pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK), and demonstrate enhanced competency for PGC fate in vitro, whilst small molecule inhibition of the enzymatic component of PRC1/PRC2 reveals reduced capacity of cells to form PGCs in vitro. Thus, B-RGPLVMs represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.

    "abstract": "Spectral libraries play a central role in the analysis of data-independent-acquisition (DIA) proteomics experiments. A main assumption in current spectral library tools is that a single characteristic intensity pattern (CIP) suffices to describe the fragmentation of a peptide in a particular charge state (peptide charge pair). However, we find that this is often not the case. We carry out a systematic evaluation of spectral variability over public repositories and in-house datasets. We show that spectral variability is widespread and partly occurs under fixed experimental conditions. Using clustering of preprocessed spectra, we derive a limited number of Multiple Characteristic Intensity Patterns (MCIPs) for each peptide charge pair, which allow almost complete coverage of our heterogeneous dataset without affecting the false discovery rate. We show that a MCIP library derived from public repositories performs in most cases similar to a \\\"custom-made\\\" spectral library, which has been acquired under identical experimental conditions as the query spectra. We apply the MCIP approach to a DIA data set and observe a significant increase in peptide recognition. We propose the MCIP approach as an easy-to-implement addition to current spectral library search engines and as a new way to utilize the data stored in spectral repositories.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gut microbiome is associated with wellness and disease in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms by which this variation affects the host are not well understood. A likely mechanism is through changing gene regulation in interfacing host epithelial cells. Here, we treated colonic epithelial cells with live microbiota from five healthy individuals and quantified induced changes in transcriptional regulation and chromatin accessibility in host cells. We identified over 5,000 host genes that change expression, including 588 distinct associations between specific taxa and host genes. The taxa with the strongest influence on gene expression alter the response of genes associated with complex traits. Using ATAC-seq, we show that a subset of these changes in gene expression are likely the result of changes in host chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding induced by exposure to gut microbiota. We then created a manipulated microbial community with titrated doses of Collinsella, demonstrating that both natural and controlled microbiome composition leads to distinct, and predictable, gene expression profiles in host cells. Together, our results suggest that specific microbes play an important role in regulating expression of individual host genes involved in human complex traits. The ability to fine tune the expression of host genes by manipulating the microbiome suggests future therapeutic routes.",

    "abstract": "Several models have been proposed to explain how eukaryotic cells control the length of their cilia and flagella. Here, we investigated this process in the protist Trypanosoma brucei, an excellent system for cells with stable cilia like photoreceptors or spermatozoa. We show that the total amount of intraflagellar transport material (IFT, the machinery responsible for flagellum construction) increases during flagellum elongation, consistent with constant delivery of precursors and the previously reported linear growth. Reducing the IFT frequency by RNAi knockdown of the IFT kinesin motors slows down the elongation rate and results in the assembly of shorter flagella. These keep on elongating after cell division but fail to reach the normal length. This failure is neither due to an absence of precursors nor to a morphogenetic control by the cell body. We propose that the flagellum is locked after cell division, preventing further elongation or shortening. This is supported by the fact that subsequent increase in the IFT rate does not lead to further elongation. The distal tip FLAM8 protein was identified as a marker for the locking event. It is initiated prior cell division, leading to an arrest of elongation in the daughter cell. Here, we propose a new model termed grow-and-lock where the flagellum elongates until a locking event takes place in a timely defined manner hence fixing length. Alteration in the growth rate and/or in the timing of the locking event would lead to the formation of flagella of different lengths.",

    "abstract": "Combining allelic analysis of RNA-Seq data with phased genotypes in family trios provides a powerful method to detect parent-of-origin biases in gene expression. We report findings in 296 family trios from two large studies: 165 lymphoblastoid cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project, and 131 blood samples from the Genome of the Netherlands participants (GoNL). Based on parental haplotypes we identified >2.8 million transcribed heterozygous SNVs phased for parental origin, and developed a robust statistical framework for measuring allelic expression. We identified a total of 45 imprinted genes and one imprinted unannotated transcript, 17 of which have not previously been reported as showing parental expression bias. Multiple novel imprinted transcripts showing incomplete parental expression bias were located adjacent to known strongly imprinted genes. For example, PXDC1, a gene which lies adjacent to the paternally-expressed gene FAM50B, shows a 2:1 paternal expression bias. Other novel imprinted genes had promoter regions that coincide with sites of parentally-biased DNA methylation identified in blood from uniparental disomy (UPD) samples, thus providing independent validation of our results. Using the stranded nature of the RNA-Seq data in LCLs we identified multiple loci with overlapping sense/antisense transcripts, of which one is expressed paternally and the other maternally. Using a sliding window approach, we searched for imprinted expression across the entire genome, identifying a novel imprinted putative lncRNA in 13q21.2. Our methods and data provide a robust and high resolution map of imprinted gene expression in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOf the many genetic mutations known to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, a large proportion cluster upon synaptic proteins. One such family of presynaptic proteins are the neurexins (NRXN), and recent genetic and mouse evidence has suggested a causative role for NRXN2 in generating altered social behaviours. Autism has been conceptualised as a disorder of atypical connectivity, yet how single-gene mutations affect such connectivity remains under-explored. To attempt to address this, we have developed a quantitative analysis of microstructure and structural connectivity leveraging diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) with high-resolution 3D imaging in optically cleared (CLARITY) brain tissue in the same mouse, applied here to the Nrxn2 knockout (KO) model.\n\nMethodsFixed brains of Nrxn2 KO mice underwent DTI using 9.4T MRI, and diffusion properties of socially-relevant brain regions were quantified. The same tissue was then subjected to CLARITY to immunolabel axons and cell bodies, which were also quantified.\n\nResultsDTI revealed decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in apparent diffusion coefficient in the amygdala (including the basolateral nuclei), the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Radial diffusivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex was significantly increased in Nrxn2 KO mice, as were tracts between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using CLARITY, we find significantly altered axonal orientation in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which was unrelated to cell density.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that deleting a single neurexin gene (Nrxn2) induces atypical structural connectivity within socially-relevant brain regions. More generally, our combined within-subject DTI and CLARITY approach presents a new, more sensitive method of revealing hitherto undetectable differences in the autistic brain.",

However, not all motor neurons are equally susceptible. Most of what we know about the surviving motor neurons comes from gene expression profiling, less is known about their functional traits. We found that resistant motor neurons cultured from SOD1 ALS mouse models have enhanced axonal outgrowth and dendritic branching. They also have an increase in the number and size of actin-based structures like growth cones and filopodia. These phenotypes occur in cells cultured from presymptomatic mice and mutant SOD1 models that do not develop ALS, but not in embryonic motor neurons. Enhanced outgrowth and upregulation of filopodia can be induced in wild-type adult cells by expressing mutant SOD1. These results demonstrate that mutant SOD1 can enhance the regenerative capability of ALS resistant motor neurons. Capitalizing on this mechanism could lead to new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Plant specialized metabolism (SM) enzymes produce lineage-specific metabolites with important ecological, evolutionary, and biotechnological implications. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model, we identified distinguishing characteristics of SM and GM (general metabolism, traditionally referred to as primary metabolism) genes through a detailed study of features including duplication pattern, sequence conservation, transcription, protein domain content, and gene network properties. Analysis of multiple sets of benchmark genes revealed that SM genes tend to be tandemly duplicated, co-expressed with their paralogs, narrowly expressed at lower levels, less conserved, and less well connected in gene networks relative to GM genes. Although the values of each of these features significantly differed between SM and GM genes, any single feature was ineffective at predicting SM from GM genes. Using machine learning methods to integrate all features, a well performing prediction model was established with a true positive rate of 0.87 and a true negative rate of 0.71. In addition, 86% of known SM genes not used to create the machine learning model were predicted as SM genes, further demonstrating its accuracy. We also demonstrated that the model could be further improved when we distinguished between SM, GM, and junction genes responsible for reactions shared by SM and GM pathways. Application of the prediction model led to the identification of 1,217 A. thaliana genes with previously unknown functions, providing a global, high-confidence estimate of SM gene content in a plant genome.\\n\\nSignificanceSpecialized metabolites are critical for plant-environment interactions, e.g., attracting pollinators or defending against herbivores, and are important sources of plant-based pharmaceuticals. However, it is unclear what proportion of enzyme-encoding genes play roles in specialized metabolism (SM) as opposed to general metabolism (GM) in any plant species. This is because of the diversity of specialized metabolites and the considerable number of incompletely characterized pathways responsible for their production. In addition, SM gene ancestors frequently played roles in GM. We evaluate features distinguishing SM and GM genes and build a computational model that accurately predicts SM genes. Our predictions provide candidates for experimental studies, and our modeling approach can be applied to other species that produce medicinally or industrially useful compounds.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates play important roles in eukaryotic cells by concentrating molecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. During T cell activation, biomolecular condensates form at the immunological synapse (IS) through multivalency-driven phase separation of the adaptor protein LAT and its binding partners Grb2, Sos1, SLP-76, Nck and WASP. These condensates move radially at the IS, traversing a radially-oriented and then a concentric actin network. To understand the persistent radial movement, we biochemically reconstituted LAT condensates with mobile actomyosin filaments. We found that basic regions of Nck and N-WASP promote strong association and co-movement of LAT condensates with actin. Condensates lacking these components were instead propelled by steric interactions. In cells, LAT condensates lost Nck while traversing the boundary between the two actin networks, and condensates engineered to constitutively bind actin moved aberrantly. We propose that Nck and WASP form a clutch between LAT condensates and actin, and changes in composition enable condensate movement by distinct actin networks in different regions of the IS.",

In some cases, these changes may increase offspring fitness but, in others, they can elevate parental fitness at a cost to the fitness of their offspring. We show that in Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), the circulating glucocorticoid (GC) hormones of pregnant females affect the growth and cooperative behaviour of their offspring. We performed a 3-year experiment in wild meerkats to test the hypothesis that GC-mediated maternal effects reduce the potential for offspring to reproduce directly and therefore cause them to exhibit more cooperative behaviour. Daughters (but not sons) born to mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy grew more slowly early in life and exhibited significantly more of two types of cooperative behaviour (pup rearing and feeding) once they were adults compared to offspring from control mothers. They also had lower measures of GCs as they aged, which could explain the observed increases in cooperative behaviour. Because early life growth is a crucial determinant of fitness in female meerkats, our results indicate that GC-mediated maternal effects may reduce the fitness of offspring, but may elevate parental fitness as a consequence of increasing the cooperative behaviour of their daughters.",

While the role of accessibility in shaping TF-binding landscapes is well recorded, its role in evolutionary divergence of TF binding, which in turn can alter cis-regulatory activities, is not well understood. In this work, we studied the evolution of genome-wide binding landscapes of five major transcription factors (TFs) in the core network of mesoderm specification, between D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and examined its relationship to accessibility and sequence-level changes. We generated chromatin accessibility data from three important stages of embryogenesis in both D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and recorded conservation and divergence patterns. We then used multi-variable models to correlate accessibility and sequence changes to TF binding divergence. We found that accessibility changes can in some cases, e.g., for the master regulator Twist and for earlier developmental stages, more accurately predict binding change than is possible using TF binding motif changes between orthologous enhancers. Accessibility changes also explain a significant portion of the co-divergence of TF pairs. We noted that accessibility and motif changes offer complementary views of the evolution of TF binding, and developed a combined model that captures the evolutionary data much more accurately than either view alone. Finally, we trained machine learning models to predict enhancer activity from TF binding, and used these functional models to argue that motif and accessibility-based predictors of TF binding change can substitute for experimentally measured binding change, for the purpose of predicting evolutionary changes in enhancer activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA folding RNA molecule encounters multiple opportunities to form non-native yet energetically favorable pairings of nucleotide sequences. Given this forbidding free-energy landscape, mechanisms have evolved that contribute to a directed and efficient folding process, including catalytic proteins and error-detecting chaperones. Among structural RNA molecules we make a distinction between \\\"bound\\\" molecules, which are active as part of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and \\\"unbound,\\\" with physiological functions performed without necessarily being bound in RNP complexes. We hypothesized that unbound molecules, lacking the partnering structure of a protein, would be more vulnerable than bound molecules to kinetic traps that compete with native stem structures. We defined an \\\"ambiguity index\\\"--a normalized function of the primary and secondary structure of an individual molecule that measures the number of kinetic traps available to nucleotide sequences that are paired in the native structure, presuming that unbound molecules would have lower indexes. The ambiguity index depends on the purported secondary structure, and was computed under both the comparative (\\\"gold standard\\\") and an equilibrium-based prediction which approximates the minimum free energy (MFE) structure. Arguing that kinetically accessible metastable structures might be more biologically relevant than thermodynamic equilibrium structures, we also hypothesized that MFE-derived ambiguities would be less effective in separating bound and unbound molecules.\\n\\nResultsWe have introduced an intuitive and easily computed function of primary and secondary structures that measures the availability of complementary sequences that could disrupt the formation of native stems on a given molecule--an ambiguity index. Using comparative secondary structures, the ambiguity index is systematically smaller among unbound than bound molecules, as expected. Furthermore, the effect is lost when the presumably more accurate comparative structure is replaced instead by the MFE structure.\\n\\nConclusionsA statistical analysis of the relationship between the primary and secondary structures of non-coding RNA molecules suggests that stem-disrupting kinetic traps are substantially less prevalent in molecules not participating in RNP complexes. In that this distinction is apparent under the comparative but not the MFE secondary structure, the results highlight a possible deficiency in structure predictions when based upon assumptions of thermodynamic equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of environmental DNA,  eDNA, for species detection via metabarcoding is growing rapidly. We present a co-designed lab workflow and bioinformatic pipeline to mitigate the two most important risks of eDNA: sample contamination and taxonomic mis-assignment. These risks arise from the need for PCR amplification to detect the trace amounts of DNA combined with the necessity of using short target regions due to DNA degradation.\n\nFindingsOur high-throughput workflow minimises these risks via a four-step strategy: (1) technical replication with two PCR replicates and two extraction replicates; (2) using multi-markers (12S, 16S, CytB); (3) a  twin-tagging, two-step PCR protocol;(4) use of the probabilistic taxonomic assignment method PROTAX, which can account for incomplete reference databases.\n\nAs annotation errors in the reference sequences can result in taxonomic mis-assignment, we supply a protocol for curating sequence datasets. For some taxonomic groups and some markers, curation resulted in over 50% of sequences being deleted from public reference databases, due to (1) limited overlap between our target amplicon and reference sequences; (2) mislabelling of reference sequences; (3) redundancy.\n\nFinally, we provide a bioinformatic pipeline to process amplicons and conduct PROTAX assignment and tested it on an  invertebrate derived DNA (iDNA) dataset from 1532 leeches from Sabah, Malaysia. Twin-tagging allowed us to detect and exclude sequences with non-matching tags. The smallest DNA fragment (16S) amplified most frequently for all samples, but was less powerful for discriminating at species rank. Using a stringent and lax acceptance criteria we found 162 (stringent) and 190 (lax) vertebrate detections of 95 (stringent) and 109 (lax) leech samples.\n\nConclusionsOur metabarcoding workflow should help research groups increase the robustness of their results and therefore facilitate wider usage of e/iDNA, which is turning into a valuable source of ecological and conservation information on tetrapods.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome is an integral component of many animal species, potentially affecting behaviour, physiology, and other biological properties. Despite this importance, bacterial communities remain vastly understudied in many groups of invertebrates, including mites. Quill mites (Acariformes: Syringophilidae) are a poorly known group of permanent bird ectoparasites that occupy quills of feathers and feed on bird subcutaneous tissue and fluids. Most species have strongly female biased sex ratios and it was hypothesized that this is caused by endosymbiotic bacteria. Their peculiar lifestyle further makes them potential vectors for bird diseases. Previously, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and a high diversity of Wolbachia strains were detected in quill mites via targeted PCR screens. Here, we use an unbiased 16S amplicon sequencing approach to determine other Bacteria that potentially impact quill mite biology.\\n\\nWe performed 16S V4 amplicon sequencing of 126 quill mite individuals from eleven species parasitizing twelve bird species (four families) of passeriform birds. In addition to Wolbachia, we found Spiroplasma as potential symbiont of quill mites. Interestingly, consistently high Spiroplasma titres were only found in individuals of two mite species associated with finches of the genus Cardfuelis, suggesting a history of horizontal transfers of Spiroplasma via the bird host. Furthermore, there was evidence for Spiroplasma negatively affecting Wolbachia titres. We found no evidence for the previously reported Anaplasma in quill mites, but detected the potential pathogens Brucella and Bartonella at low abundances. Other amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) could be assigned to a diverse number of bacterial taxa, including several that were previously isolated from bird skin. We observed a relatively uniform distribution of these ASVs across mite taxa and bird hosts, i.e, there was a lack of host-specificity for most detected ASVs. Further, many frequently found ASVs were assigned to taxa that show a very broad distribution with no strong prior evidence for symbiotic association with animals. We interpret these findings as evidence for a scarcity or lack of resident microbial associates (other than inherited symbionts) in quill mites, or for abundances of these taxa below our detection threshold.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh adiposity is associated with higher risks for a variety of adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of age-adjusted mortality and increased morbidity. This has important implications for the management of healthcare systems, since the endocrinal, cardiometabolic and other changes associated with increased adiposity may be associated with substantial healthcare costs.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied the association between various measures of adiposity and inpatient hospital costs through record linkage between UK Biobank and records of inpatient care in England and Wales. UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study that aimed to recruit men and women aged between 40 and 69 from 2006 to 2010. We applied generalised linear models to cost per person year to estimate the marginal effect and averaged adjusted predicted cost of adiposity on inpatient costs.\\n\\nResultsValid cost and body mass index (BMI) data from 457,689 participants were available for inferential analysis. Some 54.4% of individuals included in the analysis sample had positive inpatient healthcare costs over the period of follow-up. Median hospital costs per person year of follow-up were {pound}89, compared to mean costs of {pound}481. Mean BMI overall was 27.4 kg/m2 (standard deviation 4.8). The marginal effect of a unit increase in BMI was {pound}13.61 (99% confidence interval: {pound}12.60 to {pound}14.63) per person year of follow up. The marginal effect of a standard deviation increase in BMI was {pound}69.20 (99% confidence interval: {pound}64.98 to {pound}73.42). The marginal effect of becoming obese was {pound}136.35 (99% confidence interval: {pound}124.62 to {pound}148.08). Average adjusted predicted inpatient hospital costs increased almost linearly when modelled using continuous measure of adiposity. Sensitivity analysis of different scenarios did not substantially change these conclusions, although there was some evidence of attenuation of the effects of adiposity when controlling for waist-hip ratios, and when individuals who self-reported any pre-existing conditions were excluded from analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsHigher adiposity is associated with higher inpatient hospital costs. Further scrutiny using causal inferential methods is warranted to establish if further public health investments are required to manage the large healthcare costs observationally associated with overweight and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Desmogleins are cadherin family adhesion molecules essential for epidermal integrity. Previous studies have shown that desmogleins associate with lipid rafts, but the significance of this association was not clear. Here, we report that the desmoglein transmembrane domain (TMD) is the primary determinant of raft association. Further, we identify a novel mutation in the DSG1 TMD (G562R) that causes severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome. Molecular modeling predicts that this G to R mutation shortens the DSG1 TMD, and experiments directly demonstrate that this mutation compromises both lipid raft association and desmosome incorporation. Finally, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) indicates that the lipid bilayer within the desmosome is ~10% thicker than adjacent regions of the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that differences in bilayer thickness influence the organization of adhesion molecules within the epithelial plasma membrane, with cadherin TMDs recruited to the desmosome via establishment of a specialized mesoscale lipid raft-like membrane domain.",

    "abstract": "Signal transduction mechanisms and successive regulatory processes alter the lateral mobility of {beta}2-adrenergic receptors ({beta}2AR). In this work we combined modern single particle tracking methods in order to analyze the diffusion dynamics of SNAP-tagged {beta}2AR in HEK wild-type cells and HEK {beta}-arrestin knockout cells before and after agonist stimulation. For analysis of trajectories we first used mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis. Secondly, we applied an advanced variational Bayesian treatment of hidden Markov models (vbSPT) in combination with the recently introduced packing coefficient (Pc), which together provided a detailed model of three discrete diffusive states, state transitioning and spatial confinement. Interesting to note, state switching between S3 (fast-diffusing) and S1 (slow-diffusing) occurred sequentially over an intermediate state S2. After ligand stimulation more SNAP-tagged {beta}2AR in HEK wild-type cells switched occupancy into the slow-diffusing state, whereas less receptors were found in the fast diffusive state. Unexpectedly, all three states showed a fraction of confined receptor mobility that increased under stimulation, but confinement sizes were unaffected. Receptor diffusion characteristics were comparable in HEK {beta}-arrestin knockout cells under basal conditions and only minor but non-significant changes occurred upon stimulation, as expected from the depletion of {beta}-arrestin, an important regulatory protein. The data presented here on the occurrence of different diffusion states, their transitioning and variable spatial confinements clearly indicate that lateral mobility of {beta}2AR is much more complex than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Odorants of behaviorally relevant objects (e.g., food sources) intermingle with those from other sources. Therefore, to sniff out whether an odor source is good or bad - without actually visiting it - animals first need to segregate the odorants from different sources. To do so, animals could use temporal cues, since odorants from one source exhibit correlated fluctuations, while odorants from different sources are less correlated. However, it remains unclear whether animals can rely solely on temporal cues for odor source segregation. Here we show that 1) flies can use a few milliseconds differences in odorant arrival to segregate a target odorant from a binary mixture, 2) segregation does not improve when the target odorant arrives first, and 3) segregation works for odorants with innate, as well as learned valences. These properties of odor segregation parallel those of concurrent sound segregation and figure-ground segregation by onset asynchrony in humans.",

    "abstract": "Biomanufacturing from renewable feedstocks represents a sustainable strategy to offset fossil fuel-based chemical production. One potential biomanufacturing strategy is production of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) from organic feedstocks using either pure cultures or microbiomes. While the set of microbes in a microbiome can often metabolize more diverse organic materials than a single species, and the role of specific species may be known, knowledge of the carbon and energy flow within and between organisms in MCFA producing microbiomes is only starting to emerge. Here, we integrate metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and thermodynamic analyses to predict and characterize the metabolic network of an anaerobic microbiome producing MCFA from organic matter derived from lignocellulosic ethanol fermentation conversion residue. A total of 37 high quality (>80% complete, < 10% contamination) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from the microbiome and metabolic reconstruction of the 10 most abundant MAGs was performed. Metabolic reconstruction combined with metatranscriptomic analysis predicted that organisms affiliated with Lactobacillus and Coriobacteriaceae degraded carbohydrates and fermented sugars to lactate and acetate. Lachnospiraceae and Eubacteriaceae affiliated organisms were predicted to transform these fermentation products to MCFA. Thermodynamic analyses identified conditions in which H2 is expected to be either produced or consumed, suggesting a potential role of H2 partial pressure on MCFA production. From an integrated systems analysis perspective, we propose that MCFA production could be improved if microbiomes are engineered to use homofermentative instead of heterofermentative Lactobacillus, and if MCFA-producing organisms are engineered to preferentially use a thioesterase instead of a CoA transferase as the terminal enzyme in reverse {beta}-oxidation.\\n\\nImportanceMixed communities of microbes play important roles in health, the environment, agriculture, and biotechnology. While tapping the combined activity of organisms within microbiomes may allow the utilization of a wider range of substrate over the use of pure cultures for biomanufacturing, harnessing the metabolism of these mixed cultures remains a major challenge. Here, we predict metabolic functions of bacteria in a microbiome that produces medium-chain fatty acids from a renewable feedstock. Our findings lay the foundation to begin addressing how to engineer and control microbiomes for improved biomanufacturing; to build synthetic mixtures of microbes that produce valuable chemicals from renewable resources; and to better understand microbial communities that contribute to health, agriculture, and the environment.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) provide a non-invasive way to evaluate the intraspecific genetic diversity of aquatic macroorganisms. However, erroneous sequences present in HTS data can result in false positive haplotypes; therefore, reliable strategies are necessary to eliminate such erroneous sequences when evaluating intraspecific genetic diversity using eDNA metabarcoding. In this study, we propose an approach combining denoising using amplicon sequence variant (ASV) method and the removal of haplotypes with low detection rates. A mixture of rearing water of Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) was used as an eDNA sample. In total, nine haplotypes of Ayu mitochondrial D-loop region were contained in the sample and amplified by two-step tailed PCR. The 15 PCR replicates indexed different tags were prepared from the eDNA sample to compare the detection rates between true haplotypes and false positive haplotypes. All PCR replications were sequenced by HTS, and the total number of detected true haplotypes and false positive haplotypes were compared with and without denoising using the two types of ASV methods, Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA2) and UNOISE3. The use of both ASV methods considerably reduced the number of false positive haplotypes. Moreover, all true haplotypes were detected in all 15 PCR, whereas false positive haplotypes had detection rates varying from 1/15 to 15/15. Thus, by removing haplotypes with lower detection rates than 15/15, the number of false positive haplotypes were further reduced. The approach proposed in this study successfully eliminated most of false positive haplotypes in the HTS data obtained from eDNA samples, which allowed us to improve the detection accuracy for evaluating intraspecific genetic diversity using eDNA analysis.",

    "abstract": "In a stochastic process, noise often modifies the picture offered by the mean field dynamics. In particular, when there is an absorbing state, the noise erases a stable fixed point of the mean field equation from the stationary distribution, and turns it into a transient peak. We make a quantitative analysis of this effect for a simple genetic regulatory network with positive feedback, where the proteins become extinct in the presence of stochastic noise, contrary to the prediction of the deterministic rate equation that the protein number converges to a non-zero value. We show that the transient peak appears near the stable fixed point of the rate equation, and the extinction time diverges exponentially as the stochastic noise approaches zero. We also show how the baseline production from the inactive gene ameliorates the effect of the stochastic noise, and interpret the opposite effects of the noise and the baseline production in terms of the position shift of the unstable fixed point. The order of magnitude estimates using biological parameters suggest that for a real gene regulatory network, the stochastic noise is sufficiently small so that not only is the extinction time much larger than biologically relevant time-scales, but also the effect of the baseline production dominates over that of the stochastic noise, leading to the protection from the catastrophic rare event of protein extinction.",

Yra1 overexpression was recently shown to promote accumulation of DNA:RNA hybrids favoring DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cell senescence and telomere shortening, via an unknown mechanism. Yra1 was also identified at an HO-induced DSB and Yra1 depletion causes defects in DSB repair. Previous work from our laboratory showed that Yra1 ubiquitination by Tom1 is important for mRNA export. Interestingly, we found that Yra1 is also ubiquitinated by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases Slx5-Slx8 implicated in the interaction of irreparable DSB with nuclear pores. Here we show that Yra1 binds an HO-induced irreparable DSB. Importantly, a Yra1 mutant lacking the evolutionarily conserved C-box is not recruited to an HO-induced irreparable DSB and becomes lethal under DSB induction in a HO-cut reparable system. Together, the data provide evidence that Yra1 plays a crucial role in DSB repair via homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, while the Yra1 C-box is essential, Yra1 sumoylation and/or ubiquitination are dispensable in this process.",

    "abstract": "QacA is a drug:H+ antiporter (DHA2) with 14 transmembrane helices, that renders antibacterial resistance to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, with homologues in other pathogenic organisms. It is a highly promiscuous antiporter, capable of H+- driven efflux of a wide array of cationic antibacterial compounds and dyes. Our study, using a homology model of QacA, reveals a group of six protonatable residues in its vestibule. Systematic mutagenesis resulted in identification of D34 (TM1), and a cluster of acidic residues in TM13 including E407 and D411 and D323 in TM10, as being crucial for substrate recognition and transport of monovalent and divalent cationic antibacterial compounds. The transport and binding properties of QacA and its mutants were explored using whole cells, inside-out vesicles, substrate-induced H+ release and microscale thermophoresis. We identify two sites, D34 and D411 as vital players in substrate recognition while E407 facilitates substrate efflux as a protonation site. We also observe that E407 plays a moonlighting role as a substrate recognition site for dequalinium transport. These observations rationalize the promiscuity of QacA for diverse substrates. The study unravels the role of acidic residues in QacA with implications for substrate recognition, promiscuity and processive transport in multidrug efflux transporters, related to QacA.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA homology model of QacA with 14 TM helices was used to test the importance of acidic residues within the vestibule.\\nC_LIO_LIMono and Divalent cationic substrate recognition requires two sites D34 (TM1) and D411 (TM13).\\nC_LIO_LIE407 (TM13) is important for protonation driven efflux.\\nC_LIO_LISubstrate recognition of a divalent substrate, dequalinium occurs at E407 instead of D411 providing glimpses into the promiscuity of substrate recognition in QacA.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Animals on islands often exhibit dramatic differences in morphology and behaviour compared to mainland individuals, a phenomenon known as the \\\"island syndrome\\\". These differences are thought to be adaptations to island environments, but the extent to which they have a genetic basis or instead represent plastic responses to environmental extremes is often unknown. Here, we revisit a classic case of island syndrome in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) from British Columbia. We first show that Saturna Island mice and those from neighbouring islands are [~]35% ([~]5g) heavier than mainland mice and diverged approximately 10 thousand years ago. We then established laboratory colonies and find that Saturna Island mice are heavier both because they are longer and have disproportionately more lean mass. These trait differences are maintained in second-generation captive-born mice raised in a common environment. In addition, island-mainland hybrids reveal a maternal genetic effect on body weight. Using behavioural testing in the lab, we also find that wild-caught island mice are less aggressive than mainland mice; however, lab-raised mice born to these founders do not differ in aggression. Together, our results reveal that these mice respond differently to environmental conditions on islands - evolving both heritable changes in a morphological trait and also expressing a plastic phenotypic response in a behavioural trait.",

    "abstract": "Fingerprinting of functional connectomes is an increasingly standard measure of reproducibility in functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomics. In such studies, one attempts to match a subjects first session image with their second, in a blinded fashion, in a group of subjects measured twice. The number or percentage of correct matches is usually reported as a statistic. In this manuscript, we investigate the statistical tests of matching based on exchangeability assumption in the fingerprinting analysis. We show that a nearly universal Poisson(1) approximation applies for different matching schemes. We theoretically investigate the permutation tests and explore the issue that the test is overly sensitive to uninteresting directions in the alternative hypothesis, such as clustering due to familial status or demographics. We perform a numerical study on two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting state datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). These datasets are instructive, as the HCP includes techinical replications of long scans and includes monozygotic and dyzogotic twins as well as non-twin siblings. In contrast, the BLSA study incorporates more typical length resting state scans in a longitudinal study. Finally, a study of single regional connections is performed on the HCP data.",

However, an incomplete index of the plasma membrane channels and their specific contributions that underlie this influx in oocytes and eggs led us to simultaneously knock out the transient receptor potential vanilloid, member 3 (TRPV3) channel and the T-type channel, CaV3.2. Double knockout (dKO) females displayed subfertility and their oocytes and eggs showed significantly diminished Ca2+ store content and oscillations after fertilization compared to controls. We also found that the cell cycle stage during maturation determines the functional expression of channels whereby they show a distinct permeability to certain ions. In total, we demonstrate that TRPV3 and CaV3.2 are required for initiating physiological oscillations and that Ca2+ influx dictates the periodicity of oscillations during fertilization. dKO gametes will be indispensable to identify the complete native channel currents present in mammalian eggs.",

    "abstract": "Hopanoids are abundant membrane lipids found in diverse bacterial lineages, but their physiological roles are not well understood. The ethanol fermenter Zymomonas mobilis features the highest measured concentration of hopanoids, leading to the hypothesis that these lipids can protect against bacterial solvent toxicity. However, the lack of genetic tools for manipulating hopanoid composition in vivo has limited their further functional analysis. Because of polyploidy (> 50 genome copies per cell), we found that disruptions of essential hopanoid biosynthesis (hpn) genes in Z. mobilis act as genetic knockdowns, reliably modulating the abundance of different hopanoid species. Using a set of hpn transposon mutants, we demonstrate that both reduced hopanoid content and modified hopanoid head group composition mediate growth and survival in ethanol. In contrast, the amount of hopanoids, but not their polar group composition, contributes to fitness at low pH. Spectroscopic analysis of model membranes showed that hopanoids protect against several ethanol-driven phase transitions in membrane structure, including lipid interdigitation and bilayer dissolution. We propose that hopanoids act through a combination of hydrophobic and inter-lipid hydrogen bonding interactions to stabilize bacterial membranes against solvent stress.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=196 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/443473v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (57K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@119f9adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5701bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@330bfaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1574d44_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Tasmanian devil is an endangered carnivorous marsupial threatened by devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about the viruses present in devils, and whether any of these are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species.\\n\\nMethodsUsing both metagenomics based on virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (VLP metagenomics), and meta-transcriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterised and compared the faecal viromes of captive and wild Tasmanian devils.\\n\\nResultsA total of 54 devil faecal samples collected from captive (n = 2) and wild (n = 4) populations were processed for virome characterisation using both approaches. We detected many novel, highly divergent viruses, including vertebrate viruses, bacteriophage and other dietary associated plant and insect viruses. In total, 18 new vertebrate viruses, including novel sapelovirus, astroviruses, bocaviruses, papillomaviruses and gammaherpesvirus were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens including rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). Captive devils showed significantly lower levels of viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two methodological approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with meta-transcriptomics mainly identifying RNA viruses, and VLP metagenomics largely identifying DNA viruses.\\n\\nConclusionThis study has greatly expanded our knowledge of eukaryotic viruses in the Tasmanian devil and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. In addition, our results showed that a combination of VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach to virome characterisation than either method alone.",

    "abstract": "Inter-areal synchronization of neuronal oscillations below 100 Hz is ubiquitous in cortical circuitry and thought to regulate neuronal communication. In contrast, faster activities are generally considered to be exclusively local-circuit phenomena. We show with human intracerebral recordings that 100-300 Hz high-gamma activity (HGA) may be synchronized between widely distributed regions. HGA synchronization was not attributable to artefacts or to epileptic pathophysiology. Instead, HGA synchronization exhibited a reliable cortical connectivity and community structures, and a laminar profile opposite to that of lower frequencies. Importantly, HGA synchronization among functional brain systems during non-REM sleep was distinct from that in resting state. Moreover, HGA synchronization was transiently enhanced for correctly inhibited responses in a Go/NoGo task. These findings show that HGA synchronization constitutes a new, functionally significant form of neuronal spike-timing relationships in brain activity. We suggest that HGA synchronization reflects the temporal microstructure of spiking-based neuronal communication per se in cortical circuits.",

We assessed consciousness by testing for command following from time of MRI to hospital discharge, and determined 3-months functional outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). ICH and oedema volumes, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), and midline shift (MLS) were quantified. Presence of blood and oedema in deep brain regions previously implicated in consciousness were assessed. A machine learning approach using logistic regression with elastic net regularization was applied to identify parameters that best predicted consciousness at discharge controlling for confounders.\\n\\nResultsFrom 158 ICH patients that underwent MRI, 66% (N=105) were conscious and 34% (N=53) unconscious at the time of MRI. Almost half of unconscious patients (49%, N= 26) recovered consciousness by ICU discharge. Focal lesions within subcortical structures predicted persistent impairment of consciousness at discharge together with MLS, IVH, and ICH and oedema volumes (AUC 0.74; 95%-CI 0.73-0.75). Caudate nucleus, midbrain peduncle, and pontine tegmentum were implicated as critical structures.

Attention can be sustained at a location, or reoriented in space to allow processing at other locations, critical in an ever-changing environment. Numerous studies have investigated attentional orienting in time and space but little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of attentional reorienting. Here, we explicitly manipulated attentional reorienting using a cueing procedure in a 2-AFC orientation discrimination task. At various delays during the task, we interrogated attentional deployment by flashing two probe stimuli. Then, solving a second-degree equation to estimate the report probability at each probe location, we demonstrated that attention reorients periodically at ~4 Hz (theta) between the two stimulus locations. We further observed that each stimulus location is sampled at ~11 Hz (alpha). Finally, we support our mathematical approach using simulations and show that this method is sufficiently powered making it a valuable tool for studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of attention.",

While plasticity of excitatory projection neurons during associative learning is studied extensively, little is known about the contributions of local interneurons. Using fear conditioning as a model for associative learning, we find that behaviorally relevant, salient stimuli cause learning by tapping into a local microcircuit consisting of precisely connected subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. By employing calcium imaging and optogenetics, we demonstrate that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons in the basolateral amygdala are activated by aversive events and provide an instructive disinhibitory signal for associative learning. Notably, VIP interneuron responses are plastic and shift from the instructive to the predictive cue upon memory formation. We describe a novel form of adaptive disinhibitory gating by VIP interneurons that allows to discriminate unexpected, important from irrelevant information, and might be a general dynamic circuit motif to trigger stimulus-specific learning, thereby ensuring appropriate behavioral adaptations to salient events.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity to external demands is essential for adaptation to dynamic environments, but comes at the cost of increased risk of adverse outcomes when facing poor environmental conditions. Here, we apply a novel methodology to perform genome-wide association analysis of mean and variance in nine key brain features (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, intracranial volume and cortical thickness), integrating genetic and neuroanatomical data from a large lifespan sample (n=25,575 individuals; 8 to 89 years, mean age 51.9 years). We identify genetic loci associated with phenotypic variability in cortical thickness, thalamus, pallidum, and intracranial volumes. The variance-controlling loci included genes with a documented role in brain and mental health and were not associated with the mean anatomical volumes. This proof-of-principle of the hypothesis of a genetic regulation of brain volume variability contributes to establishing the genetic basis of phenotypic variance (i.e., heritability), allows identifying different degrees of brain robustness across individuals, and opens new research avenues in the search for mechanisms controlling brain and mental health.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other primates rely on eye movements to explore visual scenes and to track moving objects. As a result, the image that is projected onto the retina - and propagated throughout the visual cortical hierarchy - is almost constantly changing and makes little sense without taking into account the momentary direction of gaze. How is this achieved in the visual system? Here we show that in primary visual cortex (V1), the earliest stage of cortical vision, neural representations carry an embedded \\\"eye tracker\\\" that signals the direction of gaze associated with each image. Using chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, we recorded the activity of neurons in V1 during tasks requiring fast (exploratory) and slow (pursuit) eye movements. Neurons were stimulated with flickering, full-field luminance noise at all times. As in previous studies 1-4, we observed neurons that were sensitive to gaze direction during fixation, despite comparable stimulation of their receptive fields. We trained a decoder to translate neural activity into metric estimates of (stationary) gaze direction. This decoded signal not only tracked the eye accurately during fixation, but also during fast and slow eye movements, even though the decoder had not been exposed to data from these behavioural states. Moreover, this signal lagged the real eye by approximately the time it took for new visual information to travel from the retina to cortex. Using simulations, we show that this V1 eye position signal could be used to take into account the sensory consequences of eye movements and map the fleeting positions of objects on the retina onto their stable position in the world.",

    "abstract": "Studying and characterising tumour cell migration is critical for understanding disease progression and for assessing drug efficacy. Whilst tumour cell migration occurs fundamentally in 3 spatial dimensions (3D), for practical reasons, most migration studies to date have performed analysis in 2D. Here we imaged live multicellular tumour spheroids with lightsheet fluorescence microscopy to determine cellular migration and invasion in 3D over time (4D). We focused on glioblastoma, which are aggressive brain tumours, where cell invasion into the surrounding normal brain remains a major clinical challenge. We developed a workflow for analysing complex 3D cell movement, taking into account migration within the spheroid as well as invasion into the surrounding matrix. This provided metrics characterising cell motion, which we used to evaluate the efficacy of chemother-apeutics on invasion. These rich datasets open avenues for further studies on drug efficacy, microenvironment composition, as well as collective cell migration and metastatic potential.",

Processes of urbanization, expansion of the agricultural and livestock area, among others, have increased its level of threat. Protecting this palm from extinction is important at an ecological level, given its function as a key species in Andean ecosystems. This work evaluated the diversity and population genetic structure of the wax palm from Quindio in five populations of the Colombian coffee region eco-region (Andean zone) by using ten microsatellite molecular markers. Two groups were identified at genetic diversity level, along with a heterozygote deficiency in all the populations possibly due to cryptic population structure effects mediated by loss of habitat. The five sampling units considered presented a total significant genetic structure, revealing a high degree of reproductive isolation. The results presented here add to the Conservation Plan for this species existing in Colombia.",

    "abstract": "Rare individuals with hypomorphic inactivating mutations in the Huntingtons Disease (HD) gene (HTT), identified by CAG repeat expansion in the eponymous neurodegenerative disorder, exhibit variable abnormalities that imply HTT essential roles during organ development. Here we report phenotypes produced when increasingly severe hypomorphic mutations in Htt, the murine HTT orthologue (in HdhneoQ20, HdhneoQ50, HdhneoQ111 mice), were placed over a null allele (Hdhex4/5). The most severe hypomorphic allele failed to rescue null lethality at gastrulation, while the intermediate alleles yielded perinatal lethality and a variety of fetal abnormalities affecting body size, skin, skeletal and ear formation, and transient defects in hematopoiesis. Comparative molecular analysis of wild-type and Htt-null retinoic acid-differentiated cells revealed gene network dysregulation associated with organ development and proposed polycomb repressive complexes and miRNAs as molecular mediators. Together these findings demonstrate that the HD gene acts both pre- and post-gastrulation and possibly suggest pleiotropic consequences of HTT-lowering therapeutic strategies.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe HTT gene product mutated in Huntingtons Disease (HD) has essential roles during normal organism development, however, still not fully predictable are the functional consequences of its partial inactivation. Our genetic study provides a comprehensive effects description of progressively stronger suppression of Htt gene, the murine HTT counterpart. The most severe Htt reduction leads to embryo lethality, while intermediate Htt dosages yield a variety of developmental abnormalities affecting body size, skin, skeletal and ear formation, and hematopoiesis. Complementing molecular analysis in differentiating cells depleted of a functional Htt gene further elucidates genes networks dysregulated during organ development and proposes chromatin regulators and short non-coding RNAs as key molecular mediators. Together these findings demonstrate that the HD gene acts both at early and later stages of development, thus possibly suggesting long-term consequences associated to the newest HD therapeutic strategies aimed at lowering the HTT gene product.",

    "abstract": "Human Endogenous Retrovirus type K (HERV-K) is the only HERV known to be insertionally polymorphic. It is possible that HERV-Ks contribute to human disease because people differ in both number and genomic location of these retroviruses. Indeed viral transcripts, proteins, and antibody against HERV-K are detected in cancers, auto-immune, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, attempts to link a polymorphic HERV-K with any disease have been frustrated in part because population frequency of HERV-K provirus at each site is lacking and it is challenging to identify closely related elements such as HERV-K from short read sequence data. We present an integrated and computationally robust approach that uses whole genome short read data to determine the occupation status at all sites reported to contain a HERV-K provirus. Our method estimates the proportion of fixed length genomic sequence (k-mers) from whole genome sequence data matching a reference set of k-mers unique to each HERV-K loci and applies mixture model-based clustering to account for low depth sequence data. Our analysis of 1000 Genomes Project Data (KGP) reveals numerous differences among the five KGP super-populations in the frequency of individual and co-occurring HERV-K proviruses; we provide a visualization tool to easily depict the prevalence of any combination of HERV-K among KGP populations. Further, the genome burden of polymorphic HERV-K is variable in humans, with East Asian (EAS) individuals having the fewest integration sites. Our study identifies population-specific sequence variation for several HERV-K proviruses. We expect these resources will advance research on HERV-K contributions to human diseases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman Endogenous Retrovirus type K (HERV-K) is the youngest of retrovirus families in the human genome and is the only group that is polymorphic; a HERV-K can be present in one individual but absent from others. HERV-Ks could contribute to disease risk but establishing a link of a polymorphic HERV-K to a specific disease has been difficult. We develop an easy to use method that reveals the considerable variation existing among global populations in the frequency of individual and co-occurring polymorphic HERV-K, and in the total number of HERV-K that any individual has in their genome. Our study provides a global reference set of HERV-K genomic diversity and tools needed to determine the genomic landscape of HERV-K in any patient population.",

    "abstract": "Myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB) is an interferon-inducible restriction factor of HIV-1 that blocks nuclear import of the viral genome. Evidence suggests that MxB recognizes higher-order interfaces of the HIV capsid lattice, but the mechanistic details of this interaction are not known. Previous studies have mapped the restriction activity of MxB to its N-terminus encompassing a triple arginine motif 11RRR13. Here we demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between the MxB N-terminus and helical assemblies of HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) using highly purified recombinant proteins. We performed thorough mutagenesis to establish the detailed molecular requirements for the CA interaction with MxB. The results map MxB binding to the interface of three CA hexamers, specifically interactions between positively charged MxB N-terminal residues and negatively charged CA residues. Our crystal structures show that the CA mutations affecting MxB interaction and restriction do not alter the conformation of capsid assembly. In addition, 30 microsecond long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complex between the MxB N-terminus and the HIV CA tri-hexamer interface show persistent MxB binding and identify a MxB-binding pocket surrounded by three CA hexamers. These results establish the molecular details of the binding of a lattice-sensing host factor onto HIV capsid, and provide insight into how MxB recognizes HIV capsid for the restriction of HIV-1 infection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe human antiviral protein MxB is a restriction factor that fights HIV infection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that MxB targets the HIV capsid, a protein shell that protects the viral genome. To make the conical shaped capsid, HIV CA proteins are organized into a lattice composed of hexamer and pentamer building blocks, providing many interfaces for host proteins to recognize. Through extensive biochemical and biophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that MxB is targeting the HIV capsid by recognizing the region created at the intersection of three CA hexamers. We are further able to map this interaction to a few CA residues, located in a negatively-charged well at the interface between the three CA hexamers. This work provides detailed residue-level mapping of the targeted capsid interface and how MxB interacts. This information could inspire the development of capsid-targeting therapies for HIV.",

The fluctuations in uterine activity may occur without affecting progress of gestation, however the painful and fashion contractions may be the first threat of miscarriage. While pigs were considered as an referential preclinical model, the computational modelling of spontaneous myoelectrical activity of complex systems of porcine myometrium in peri-fertilization period has been proposed. The higher order statistic, multivariate cumulants and Joint Skewness Band Selection method, have been applied to study the dependence structure of electromyographic (EMG) signal with an effective EMG feature. Than the model of recognition of multivariate, myoelectricaly changes according to crucial stages for successful fertilization and early pregnancy maintenance has been estimated. We found that considering together time and frequency features of EMG signal was extremely non-Gaussian distributed and the higher order multivariate statistics such as cumulants, have to be used to determine the pattern of myoelectrical activity in reproductive tract. We confirmed the expectance that the probabilistic model changes on a daily base. We demonstrated the changes in proposed model at the crucial time points of in peri-fertilization period. We speculate the activity of the middle of uterine horn and the power (minimum and maximum) and pauses between myoelectrical burst features are essential for the functional role of uterine contractility in peri-fertilization period.",

Expression of {delta}-opioid receptors (DORs) correlates with poor prognosis for breast cancer (BCa) patients, but mechanism and genetic/pharmacologic proof of key changes in opioid-triggered cancer biology are lacking. We show that oncogenic STAT3 signaling and E-Cadherin downregulation are triggered by opioid-ligated DORs, promoting metastasis. Human and murine transplanted BCa cells (MDA-MB-231, 4T1) displayed enhanced metastasis upon opioid-induced DOR stimulation, and DOR-antagonist blocked metastasis. Opioid-exposed BCa cells showed enhanced migration, STAT3 activation, down-regulation of E-Cadherin and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. STAT3 knockdown or upstream inhibition through the JAK1/2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib prevented opioid-induced BCa cell metastasis and migration. We conclude that opioids trigger metastasis through oncogenic JAK1/2-STAT3 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Parental effects are an important source of adaptive traits. By contrast, parental effects failing to regulate offspring phenotype to fit current conditions could be deleterious. Although adaptive parental responses to single cues have been identified, we lack an understanding of the reversibility of parental effects across breeding cycles in a fluctuating environment. Social status of parents can occasionally fluctuate and, in turn, influence high-fitness pathways available to offspring. We show that social competition status results in robust parental effects on growth in mice. Dominant males produce faster growing offspring because of status related cues, not genetic associations. The timing, effect-size, and sex-specificity of this paternal effect are modulated by maternal experience. We experimentally demonstrate that status-ascending males produce heavier sons than before, and status-descending males produce lighter sons than before. Paternal status predicts genome-wide transcription in the liver, including transcriptional networks controlling xenobiotic and fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that paternal social status reversibly conditions offspring growth in naturalistic environments.",

    "abstract": "Background: One of the most common copy number variants, the 22q11.2 microdeletion, confers a increased risk for schizophrenia. Since schizophrenia has been associated with an aberrant neural response to repeated stimuli through both reduced adaptation and prediction, we here hypothesized that this may also be the case in nonpsychotic individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion. Methods: We recorded high-density EEG from 19 individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (12-25 years), as well as 27 healthy volunteers with comparable age and sex distribution, while they listened to a sequence of sounds arranged in a roving oddball paradigm. Using posterior probability maps and dynamic causal modelling we tested three different models accounting for repetition dependent changes in cortical responses as well as in effective connectivity; namely an adaptation model, a prediction model, and a model including both adaptation and prediction. Results: Repetition-dependent changes were parametrically modulated by a combination of adaptation and prediction and were apparent in both cortical responses and in the underlying effective connectivity. This effect was reduced in individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion and was negatively correlated with negative symptom severity. Follow-up analysis showed that the reduced effect of the combined adaptation and prediction model seen in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion was driven by reduced adaptation rather than prediction failure. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that adaptation is reduced in individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion, which can be interpreted in light of the framework of predictive coding as a failure to suppress prediction errors.",

    "abstract": "The 2018 NIA-AA research framework proposes a classification system with beta-Amyloid deposition, pathologic Tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN) for the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimers Disease (AD). Data from the ADNI (AD neuroimaging initiative) database can be utilized to identify diagnostic signatures for predicting AD progression, and to determine the utility of this NIA-AA research framework. Profiles of 320 peptides from baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 287 normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects followed over a 3-10 year period were measured via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry. CSF A{beta}42, total-Tau (tTau), phosphorylated-Tau (pTau-181) and hippocampal volume were also measured. From these candidate markers, optimal diagnostic signatures with decision thresholds to separate AD and normal subjects were first identified via unbiased regression and tree-based algorithms. The best performing signature determined via cross-validation was then tested in an independent group of MCI subjects to predict future progression. This multivariate analysis yielded a simple diagnostic signature comprising CSF pTau-181 to A{beta}42 ratio, MRI hippocampal volume and a novel PTPRN peptide, with a decision threshold on each marker. When applied to a separate MCI group at baseline, subjects meeting this signature criteria experience 4.3-fold faster progression to AD compared to a 2.2-fold faster progression using only conventional markers. This novel 4-marker signature represents an advance over the current diagnostics based on widely used marker, and is much easier to use in practice than recently published complex signatures. In addition, this signature reinforces the ATN construct from the 2018 NIA-AA research framework.\\n\\nDisclosuresViswanath Devanarayan is an employee of Charles River Laboratories, and as such owns equity in, receives salary and other compensation from Charles River Laboratories.\\n\\nData collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award number W81XWH-12-2-0012).

Total dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) is associated with numerous adverse effects, including severe microbial dysbiosis and loss of important butyrate producers. We hypothesised that a lack of butyrate produced by the gut microbiota may be compensated by its supplementation in PN mixtures. We tested whether i.v. butyrate administration would (a) positively modulate intestinal defence mechanisms and (b) counteract PN-induced dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomised to chow, PN, and PN supplemented with 9 mM butyrate (PN+But) for 12 days. Antimicrobial peptides, mucins, tight junction proteins and cytokine expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. T-cell subpopulations in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by flow cytometry. Microbiota composition was assessed in caecum content. Butyrate supplementation resulted in increased expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-7, E-cadherin), antimicrobial peptides (Defa 8, Rd5, RegIII{gamma}) and lysozyme in the ileal mucosa. Butyrate partially alleviated PN-induced intestinal barrier impairment and normalised IL-4, IL-10 and IgA mRNA expression. PN administration was associated with an increase in Tregs in MLN, which was normalised by butyrate. Butyrate increased the total number of CD4+ and decreased a relative amount of CD8+ memory T cells in MLN. Lack of enteral nutrition and PN administration led to a shift in caecal microbiota composition. Butyrate did not reverse the altered expression of most taxa but did influence the abundance of some potentially beneficial/ pathogenic genera, which might contribute to its overall beneficial effect.",

    "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastasis remains a difficult clinical challenge. Some success has been achieved by direct administration of therapeutics into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circumventing limitations imposed by the blood brain barrier. Here we investigated continuous infusion versus bolus injection of therapy into the CSF in a preclinical model of human Group 3 medulloblastoma, the molecular subgroup with the highest incidence of leptomeningeal disease. Initial tests of selected Group 3 human medulloblastoma cell lines in culture showed that D283 Med and D425 Med were resistant to cytarabine and methotrexate. D283 Med cells were also resistant to topotecan, whereas 1 M topotecan killed over 99% of D425 Med cells. We therefore introduced D425 Med cells, modified to express firefly luciferase, into the CSF of immunodeficient mice. Mice were then treated with topotecan or saline in five groups: continuous intraventricular (IVT) topotecan via osmotic pump (5.28 g/day), daily bolus IVT topotecan injections with a similar daily dose (6 g/day), systemic intraperitoneal injections of a higher daily dose of topotecan (15 g/day), daily IVT pumped saline and daily intraperitoneal injections of saline. Bioluminescence analyses revealed that both IVT topotecan treatments effectively slowed leptomeningeal tumor growth in the brains, although histological analysis showed that they were associated with localized brain necrosis. In the spines, bolus IVT topotecan showed a trend towards slower tumor growth compared to continuous (pump) IVT topotecan, as measured by bioluminescence. Both continuous and bolus topotecan IVT showed similar survival that was longer compared to other groups. Thus, both direct IVT topotecan CSF delivery methods produced better anti-medulloblastoma effect compared to systemic therapy at the dosages used here.",

However, some patients reverse this hypogonadism resembling the fertile phenotype of Tac2KO and Tacr3KO (encoding NKB receptor, NK3R) mice despite the absence of NKB signaling. Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of NKB signaling, other tachykinins (substance P and neurokinin A [NKA], encoded by Tac1) may take over to preserve fertility. The complete absence of tachykinins in Tac1/Tac2KO mice leads to delayed puberty onset in both sexes and infertility in 80% of females (but not males), in contrast to the 100% fertile phenotype of Tac1KO and Tac2KO mice separately. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NKA controls puberty onset and LH release through NKB-independent mechanisms in the presence of sex steroids and NKB-dependent mechanisms in their absence. In summary, tachykinins interact in a coordinated manner to ensure reproductive success in female mice.",

    "abstract": "Live cell time-lapse microscopy, a widely-used technique to study gene expression and protein dynamics in single cells, relies on segmentation and tracking of individual cells for data generation. The potential of the data that can be extracted from this technique is limited by the inability to accurately segment a large number of cells from such microscopy images and track them over long periods of time. Existing segmentation and tracking algorithms either require additional dyes or markers specific to segmentation or they are highly specific to one imaging condition and cell morphology and/or necessitate manual correction. Here we introduce a fully automated, fast and robust segmentation and tracking algorithm for budding yeast that overcomes these limitations. Full automatization is achieved through a novel automated seeding method, which first generates coarse seeds, then automatically fine-tunes cell boundaries using these seeds and automatically corrects segmentation mistakes. Our algorithm can accurately segment and track individual yeast cells without any specific dye or biomarker. Moreover, we show how existing channels devoted to a biological process of interest can be used to improve the segmentation. The algorithm is versatile in that it accurately segments not only cycling cells with smooth elliptical shapes, but also cells with arbitrary morphologies (e.g. sporulating and pheromone treated cells). In addition, the algorithm is largely independent of the specific imaging method (bright-field/phase) and objective used (40X/63X). We validate our algorithms performance on 9 cases each entailing a different imaging condition, objective magnification and/or cell morphology. Taken together, our algorithm presents a powerful segmentation and tracking tool that can be adapted to numerous budding yeast single-cell studies.",

    "abstract": "The role of mitochondrial calcium-dependent NO synthase in the control of respiration and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, as well as possible involvement of mitochondrial NO synthase/guanylate cyclase/kinase G-signaling system (mtNOS-SS) in the regulation of these processes are not sufficiently studied. In this work, using rat liver mitochondria, we applied specific inhibitors of the enzymes of this signaling system to evaluate its role in the control of respiration and MPTP. The respiration was supported by pyruvate and glutamate or succinate in the presence of hexokinase, glucose and ADP. The results indicate that L-arginine and NO donors SNP and SNAP produce bidirectional concentration-dependent effects on the respiration and MPTP opening evoked by calcium ions or D,L-palmitoylcarnitine. Maximal activation of respiration was observed at 20 {micro}M of L-arginine or SNP. At low concentrations, L-arginine (to 500 {micro}M) and NO donors (to 50 {micro}M) increased the threshold concentrations of calcium and D,L-palmitoylcarnitine required for the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and pore opening. The application of the inhibitors of NO synthase, guanylate cyclase, and kinase G eliminated both effects. These data indicate the involvement of mtNOS-SS in the activation of respiration and deceleration of MPTP opening. At high concentrations, L-arginine and NO donors inhibited the respiration and promoted pore opening, indicating that the inhibition induced by NO excess dominates over the protection caused by mtNOS-SS. These results demonstrate that the functioning of mtNOS-SS might provide a feedforward activation of respiration and a lowering of MPTP sensitivity to calcium and palmitoylcarnitine overload.",

Here, we used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) chemoproteomic platforms to discover that nimbolide reacts with a novel functional cysteine crucial for substrate recognition in the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF114. Nimbolide impairs breast cancer cell proliferation by disrupting RNF114 substrate recognition, leading to inhibition of ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor-suppressor p21, resulting in its rapid stabilization. We further demonstrate that nimbolide can be harnessed to recruit RNF114 as an E3 ligase in targeted protein degradation applications and show that synthetically simpler scaffolds are also capable of accessing this unique reactive site. Our study highlights the utility of ABPP platforms in uncovering unique druggable modalities accessed by natural products for cancer therapy and drug discovery applications.",

In Arabidopsis, little is known about the variation of whole-plant water use (PWU) and whole-plant WUE (TE). To investigate the genetic basis of PWU, we developed a novel proxy trait by combining flowering time and rosette water use to estimate lifetime PWU. We validated its usefulness for large scale screening of mapping populations in a subset of ecotypes. This parameter subsequently facilitated the screening of water-use but also drought tolerance traits in a recombinant inbred line population derived from two Arabidopsis accessions with distinct water use strategies, namely C24 (low PWU) and Col-0 (high PWU). Subsequent quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and validation through near-isogenic lines identified two causal QTLs, which showed that a combination of weak and non-functional alleles of the FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) genes substantially reduced plant water-use without penalising reproductive performance. Drought tolerance traits, stomatal conductance, intrinsic water use efficiency ({delta}13C) and rosette water-use were independent of allelic variation at FRI and FLC, suggesting that flowering is critical in determining life-time plant water use, but not leaf-level traits.",

We have analyzed microridges on zebrafish epidermal cells using confocal and electron microscopy methods including electron tomography, to show that a microridge is formed of a network of F-actin and requires the function of the Arp2/3 complex for its maintenance. During development, microridges begin as F-actin punctae showing signatures of branching and requiring an active Arp2/3 complex. Using inhibitors of actin polymerization and the Arp2/3 complex, we show that microridges organize the surface glycan layer. Our analyses have unraveled the F-actin organization supporting the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved apical projection, which functions in glycan organization.",

We developed an innovative technique that enables the collection of lymph and lymph-circulating tumor cells (LCTCs) en route to the SLN in immunocompetent animal model of breast cancer metastasis. We found that LCTCs and blood circulating tumor cells (BCTCs) as exited the primary tumor shared similar gene and protein expression profiles that were distinct from those of primary tumors and lymph node metastases (LNMs) despite their common parental cell origin. LCTCs but not BCTC exist in clusters, display a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype and cancer stem cell-like properties and constitute extraordinarily efficient metastatic precursors. These results demonstrate that tumor cell metastasizing through the lymphatic are different from those spread by the blood circulation. The contribution of these cells to overall peripheral blood CTC is important in cancer therapy. Whether these two types of cells occur in cancer patients remain to be determined.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe presence of tumor cells in the SLN denotes poor prognosis and worse patient outcomes. We have developed a capability to routinely collect these tumor cells before they reach their first stop, SLN, in their metastatic journey to distant sites. Examination of these cells and their lymph microenvironment revealed that they are molecularly different from their tumor of origin, their LNMs and their counterpart cells in the blood. This is the first time these cells are captured and studied. The approach will provide a new level of information that is highly relevant to our understanding of metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation involves timed gene expression, suggesting that the fine-tuned onset, amplitude, and termination of expression of hundreds of genes is of critical importance to organismal homeostasis. Recent study of post-transcriptional regulation of inflammatory gene expression led to the suggestion of a regulatory role for pre-mRNA splicing. Here, using a hybrid capture approach to purify incompletely spliced, chromatin-associated pre-mRNAs, we use deep sequencing to study pre-mRNA splicing of the NF-kB transcriptome. By freezing transcription and examining subsequent splicing of complete transcripts, we find many introns splice tens to hundreds of times slower than average. In many cases, this is attributable to poor splice donor sequences that are evolutionarily conserved. When these introns were altered by ~2 base pairs to yield stronger splice donors, gene expression levels increased markedly for several genes in the context of a reporter system. We propose that such splice sites represent a regulatory mechanism that determines the timing of production of the mRNAs from certain inflammatory genes and may also limit mRNA expression from these genes. Further work will be needed to understand the roles of this regulation in the inflammatory response. The suggestion of extensive temporal regulation of pre-mRNA splicing as a regulatory process in inflammation raises the question of where else in biology there may be timed processes with a similar underlying cause.",

Here, we demonstrate that proscillaridin, a cardiac glycoside approved for heart failure treatment exhibit anticancer selectivity towards high MYC expressing leukemic cell lines and leukemia stem cells. At a clinically relevant concentration, proscillaridin induced a rapid downregulation of MYC protein level, due to a significant decrease in MYC protein half-life. Proscillaridin treatment induced a downregulation of gene sets involved in MYC pathway, and a concomitant upregulation of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation. Proscillaridin induced a significant loss of lysine acetylation in histone H3 (K9, K14, K18 and K27) and in non-histone proteins such as MYC, MYC target proteins, and a series of histone acetylation regulators. Loss of lysine acetylation correlated with a rapid downregulation of histone acetyltransferase protein levels, involved in histone and MYC acetylation (CBP, P300, GCN5, TIP60, and MOZ), preferentially in MYC overexpressing leukemia as compared to other cancer cells. These results support the repurposing of proscillaridin in MYC overexpressing leukemia and propose a novel strategy to target MYC in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports tend to predict the increase of harmful cyanobacteria in water systems worldwide due to the climatic and environmental changes, which would compromise water quality and public health. Among abiotic changes, the higher salinities are expected to promote the growth of some harmful species such as Planktothrix agardhii, which is known to build up blooms in brackish areas. Since P. agardhii is a common cyanotoxin producer (microcystin-producing), we investigated here the growth and tolerance of this species when exposed in vitro to a range of salinity levels, while assessing its microcystins variation and production in batch cultures during a time-frame experiment of 18 days. The study revealed a salt acclimation of the brackish P. agardhii that still produced microcystins in salty cultures while maintaining its growth ability in low to medium salinities (ranged from 0 to 7.5 g L-1). For higher salinity concentrations (10 to 12.5 g L-1), microcystins were still detected, while significantly lower growth rates were obtained during the exponential growth phase. This suggests that moderate to high salt ranges do not inhibit the microcystins production of P. agardhii at least for several weeks. Finally, the predicted remediation perspectives in a context of environment salinization assumed by environmental policies may be insufficient to eradicate this potential toxic cyanobacteria, especially when this species is already dominant in the waterbodies.",

    "abstract": "Intron retention (IR) has emerged as an important mechanism of gene expression control. Despite this, the factors that control IR events remain poorly understood. We observed consistent IR in one intron of the Irf7 gene and identified Bud13 as an RNA-binding protein that acts at this intron to increase the amount of successful splicing. Deficiency in Bud13 led to increased IR, decreased mature Irf7 transcript and protein levels, and consequently to a dampened type I interferon response. This impairment of Irf7 production in Bud13-deficient cells compromised their ability to withstand VSV infection. Global analysis of Bud13 knockdown and BUD13 cross-linking to RNA revealed a subset of introns that share many characteristics with the one found in Irf7 and are spliced in a Bud13-dependent manner. Deficiency of Bud13 led to decreased mature transcript from genes containing such introns. Thus, by acting as an antagonist to IR, Bud13 facilitates the expression of genes at which IR occurs.",

    "abstract": "Many hermaphroditic flowering plants species possess a genetic self-incompatibility (SI) system that prevents self-fertilization and is typically controlled by a single multiallelic locus, the S-locus. The conditions under which SI can be stably maintained in single isolated populations are well known and depend chiefly on the level of inbreeding depression and the number of SI alleles segregating at the S-locus. However, while both the number of SI alleles and the level of inbreeding depression are potentially affected by population subdivision, the conditions for the maintenance of SI in subdivided populations remain to be studied. In this paper, we combine analytical predictions and two different individual-based simulation models to show that population subdivision can severely compromise the maintenance of SI. Under the conditions we explored, this effect is mainly driven by the decrease of the local diversity of SI alleles rather than by a change in the dynamics of inbreeding depression. We discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of empirical data on the loss of SI in natural populations.\\n\\nData accessibility statementNo data to be archived",

Instead of trying to identify proteins enriched in specific membrane-wrapped structures, we used a selective degradation approach to remove reporters from the cytoplasm or nucleus of C. elegans embryos and mammalian cells. We demonstrate specific labelling of organelles using degron-tagged reporters, including extracellular vesicles, as well as individual neighbouring membranes. These degron-tagged reporters facilitate long-term tracking of released cell debris and cell corpses, even during uptake and phagolysosomal degradation. We further show that degron protection assays can probe the topology of the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane during cell division, giving insight into protein and organelle dynamics. As endogenous and heterologous degrons are used in bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals, degron approaches can enable the specific labelling and tracking of proteins, vesicles, organelles, cell fragments, and cells in many model systems.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is often performed in a shotgun format, in which as many peptide precursors as possible are selected from full or MS1 scans so that their fragment spectra can be recorded in MS2 scans. While achieving great proteome depths, shotgun proteomics cannot guarantee that each precursor will be fragmented in each run. In contrast, targeted proteomics aims to reproducibly and sensitively record a restricted number of precursor/fragment combinations in each run, based on pre-scheduled mass-to-charge and retention time windows. Here we set out to merge these two concepts by a global targeting approach in which an arbitrary number of precursors of interest are detected in real-time, followed by standard fragmentation or advanced peptide-specific analyses. We made use of a fast application programming interface to a quadrupole Orbitrap instrument and real-time recalibration in mass, retention time and intensity dimensions to predict precursor identity. MaxQuant.Live is freely available (www.maxquant.live) and has a graphical user interface to specify many pre-defined data acquisition strategies. Acquisition speed is as fast as with the vendor software and the power of our approach is demonstrated with the acquisition of breakdown curves for hundreds of precursors of interest. We also uncover precursors that are not even visible in MS1 scans, using elution time prediction based on the auto-adjusted retention time alone. Finally, we successfully recognized and targeted more than 25,000 peptides in single LC-MS runs. Global targeting combines the advantages of two classical approaches in MS-based proteomics, while greatly expanding the analytical toolbox.",

    "abstract": "One-dimensional search is an essential step in DNA target recognition. Theoretical studies have suggested that the sequence dependence of one-dimensional diffusion can help resolve the competing demands of fast search and high target affinity, a conflict known as the speed-selectivity paradox. The resolution requires that the diffusion energy landscape is correlated with the underlying specific binding energies. In this work, we report observations of one-dimensional search by QD labeled EcoRI. Our data supports the view that proteins search DNA via rotation coupled sliding over a corrugated energy landscape. We observed that while EcoRI primarily slides along DNA at low salt concentrations, at higher concentrations its diffusion is a combination of sliding and hopping. We also observed long-lived pauses at genomic star sites which differ by a single nucleotide from the target sequence. To reconcile these observations with prior biochemical and structural data, we propose a model of search in which the protein slides over a sequence independent energy landscape during fast search, but rapidly interconverts with a \\\"hemi-specific\\\" binding mode in which a half site is probed. This half site interaction stabilizes the transition to a fully specific mode of binding which can then lead to target recognition.",

Currently little is known about how external directional cues are propagated along the length scale of the whole cell and integrated with its force-generating apparatus to steer migration mechanically. We examine the mechanics of spontaneous cell turning in fish epidermal keratocytes and find that the mechanical asymmetries responsible for turning behavior predominate at the rear of the cell, where there is asymmetric centripetal actin flow. Using experimental perturbations we identify two linked feedback loops connecting myosin II contractility, adhesion strength and actin network flow in turning cells that are sufficient to recreate observed cell shapes and trajectories in a computational model. Surprisingly, asymmetries in actin polymerization at the cell leading edge play only a minor role in the mechanics of cell turning - that is, cells steer from the rear.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIFish keratocytes can migrate with persistent angular velocity, straight or in circles.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry in protrusion at the leading edge is not sufficient to generate persistent turning.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetries in myosin II contraction, actin flow and adhesion at the cell rear cause turns.\\nC_LIO_LIOur new computational model of migration predicts observed cell trajectories.\\nC_LI",

To facilitate intersectional targeting in zebrafish, we have generated more than 50 new Cre lines, and co-registered brain expression images with the Zebrafish Brain Browser, a cellular resolution atlas of 264 transgenic lines.

    "abstract": "Aboveground plant efficiency has improved significantly in recent years, and the improvement has led to a steady increase in global food production. The improvement of belowground plant efficiency has potential to further increase food production. However, belowground plant roots are harder to study, due to inherent challenges presented by root phenotyping. Several tools for identifying root anatomical features in root cross-section images have been proposed. However, the existing tools are not fully automated and require significant human effort to produce accurate results. To address this limitation, we use a fully automated approach, specifically, the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), to identify anatomical traits in root cross-section images. By training Faster R-CNN models on root cross-section images, we can detect objects such as root, stele and late metaxylem, and predict rectangular bounding boxes around such objects. Subsequently, the bounding boxes can be used to estimate the root diameter, stele diameter, late metaxylem number, and average diameter. Experimental evaluation using standard object detection metrics, such as intersection-over-union and mean average precision, has shown that the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice root cross-section images can accurately detect root, stele and late metaxylem objects. Furthermore, the results have shown that the measurements estimated based on predicted bounding boxes have small root mean square error when compared with the corresponding ground truth values, suggesting that Faster R-CNN can be used to accurately detect anatomical features. A webserver for performing root anatomy using the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice images is available at https://rootanatomy.org, together with a link to a GitHub repository that contains a copy of the Faster R-CNN code. The labeled images used for training and evaluating the Faster R-CNN models are also available from the GitHub repository.",

Here we describe the hypothetical molecular anatomy of the lncRNA HOTAIR (HOx Transcript AntIsense RNA) inferred from direct, high-resolution visualization by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in nucleus-like conditions at 37 degrees. Our observations reveal that HOTAIR has a distinct anatomy with a high degree of plasticity. Fast AFM scanning enabled the quantification of this plasticity, and provided visual evidence of physical interactions with genomic DNA segments. Our report provides the first biologically-plausible hypothetical description of the anatomy and intrinsic properties of HOTAIR, and presents a framework for studying the structural biology of lncRNAs.",

The TRPV1 homologues TRPV2 and TRPV3 are also activated by heat, but sensitivity to vanilloids and many other agonists is not conserved among TRPV subfamily members. It was recently discovered that four mutations in TRPV2 are sufficient to render the channel sensitive to the TRPV1-specific vanilloid agonist resiniferatoxin (RTx). Here we show that mutation of six residues in TRPV3 corresponding to the vanilloid site in TRPV1 is sufficient to engineer RTx binding. However, robust activation of TRPV3 by RTx requires facilitation of channel opening by introducing individual mutations in the pore, temperatures > 30{degrees}C, or co-stimulation with another agonist. Our results demonstrate that the energetics of channel activation can determine the apparent sensitivity to a stimulus and suggest that allosteric pathways for activation are conserved in the TRPV family.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by decreased grey matter volume (GMV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), where the latter tends to decline the earliest in aging. Enhanced fitness in aging has been related to preservation of GMV and CBF, and in some cases CVR, although there are contradictory relationships reported between CVR and fitness. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of the complex interplay with fitness and GMV, CBF and CVR, it is necessary to study them concurrently. Here, we aimed to disentangle the interactions between these outcomes in healthy older adults. MRI acquisitions collected anatomical, CBF and CVR information in all participants, as well as VO2,max. Results revealed decreased CVR was associated with increased fitness throughout large areas of the cerebral cortex. Within these regions it was found that lower fitness was associated with higher CBF and a slower hemodynamic response to hypercapnia. Overall, results indicate that the relationship between age, cerebral health and cerebral hemodynamics are complex. Future studies should collect other physiological outcomes in parallel with quantitative imaging, such as measures of carbon dioxide sensitivity and autoregulation, to further understand the intricacy of the effects fitness has on the aging brain, and how this may bias quantitative measures of cerebral health.",

    "abstract": "The vascular organization of the human brain can determine neurological and neurophysiological functions, yet thus far it has not been comprehensively mapped. Aging and diseases such as dementia are known to be associated with changes to the vasculature and normative data could help detect these vascular changes in neuroimaging studies. Furthermore, given the well-known impact of venous vessels on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, information about the common location of veins could help detect biases in existing datasets. In this work, a quantitative atlas of the venous vasculature using quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) acquired with a 0.6 mm isotropic resolution is presented. The Venous Neuroanatomy (VENAT) atlas was created from 5 repeated 7 Tesla MRI measurements in young and healthy volunteers (n = 20, 10 females, mean age = 25.1 {+/-} 2.5 years) using a two-step registration method on 3D segmentations of the venous vasculature. This cerebral vein atlas includes the average vessel location, diameter (mean: 0.84 {+/-} 0.33 mm) and curvature (0.11 {+/-} 0.05 mm-1) from all participants and provides an in vivo measure of the angio-architectonic organization of the human brain and its variability. This atlas can be used as a basis to understand changes in the vasculature during aging and neurodegeneration, as well as vascular and physiological effects in neuroimaging.",
