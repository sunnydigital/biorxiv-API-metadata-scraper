    "abstract": "Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a popular imaging modality for mapping the functional connectivity of the brain. Rs-fMRI is, just like other neuroimaging modalities, subject to a series of technical and subject level biases that change the inferred connectivity pattern. In this work we predicted genetic ancestry from rs-fMRI connectivity data at very high performance (area under the ROC curve of 0.93). Thereby, we demonstrated that genetic ancestry is encoded in the functional connectivity pattern of the brain at rest. Consequently, genetic ancestry constitutes a bias that should be accounted for in the analysis of rs-fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "When collecting large neuroimaging data associated with psychiatric disorders, images must be acquired from multiple sites because of the limited capacity of a single site. However, site differences represent the greatest barrier when acquiring multi-site neuroimaging data. We utilized a traveling-subject dataset in conjunction with a multi-site, multi-disorder dataset to demonstrate that site differences are composed of biological sampling bias and engineering measurement bias. Effects on resting-state functional MRI connectivity because of both bias types were greater than or equal to those because of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, our findings indicated that each site can sample only from among a subpopulation of participants. This result suggests that it is essential to collect large neuroimaging data from as many sites as possible to appropriately estimate the distribution of the grand population. Finally, we developed a novel harmonization method that removed only the measurement bias by using traveling-subject dataset and achieved the reduction of the measurement bias by 29% and the improvement of the signal to noise ratios by 40%.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule (MT) associated protein Tau is instrumental for the regulation of MT assembly and dynamic instability, orchestrating MT-dependent cellular processes. Aberration in Tau post-translational modifications ratio deviation of spliced Tau isoforms 3 or 4 MT binding repeats (3R/4R) have been implicated in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is vital for brain formation and cognitive function. ADNP deficiency in mice causes pathological Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, correlated with impaired cognitive functions. It has been previously shown that the ADNP-derived peptide NAP protects against ADNP deficiency, exhibiting neuroprotection, MT interaction and memory protection. NAP prevents MT degradation by recruitment of Tau and end-binding proteins to MTs and expression of these proteins is required for NAP activity. Clinically, NAP (davunetide, CP201) exhibited efficacy in prodromal Alzheimers disease patients (Tau3R/4R tauopathy) but not in progressive supranuclear palsy (increased Tau4R tauopathy). Here, we examined the potential preferential interaction of NAP with 3R vs. 4R Tau, toward personalized treatment of tauopathies. Affinity-chromatography showed that NAP preferentially interacted with Tau3R protein from rat brain extracts and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay indicated that NAP induced increased recruitment of human Tau3R to MTs under zinc intoxication, in comparison to Tau4R. Furthermore, we showed that NAP interaction with tubulin (MTs) was inhibited by obstruction of Tau-binding sites on MTs, confirming the requirement of Tau-MT interaction for NAP activity. The preferential interaction of NAP with Tau3R may explain clinical efficacy in mixed vs. Tau4R pathologies, and suggest effectiveness in Tau3R neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Aging leads to gray and white matter decline but their causation remains unclear. We explored two broad classes of models of age and dementia risk related brain changes. The first class of models emphasises the importance of gray matter: age and risk-related processes cause neurodegeneration and this causes damage in associated white matter tracts. The second class of models reverses the direction of causation: aging and risk factors cause white matter damage and this leads to gray matter damage. We compared these models with linear mediation analysis and quantitative multi-modal MRI indices (from diffusion, quantitative magnetization transfer and relaxometry imaging) of tissue properties in two limbic structures implicated in age-related memory decline: the hippocampus and the fornix in 166 asymptomatic individuals (aged 38 - 71 years). Aging was associated with apparent glia but not axon density damage in the fornix. Mediation analysis unambiguously supported white matter damage causing gray matter decline; controlling for fornix glia damage, the correlation between age and hippocampal damage disappears, but not vice versa. Fornix and hippocampal tissue loss were both associated with reductions in episodic memory performance. The implications of these findings for neuroglia and neurodegenerative models of aging and late onset dementia are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast, a photosynthetic organelle found in all plant and algae species, originates from an ancient event in which a cyanobacterium was engulfed by a larger eukaryote. Thus, modern chloroplasts still harbor a bacterial-like genome and carry out all stages of gene expression, including mRNA translation by a 70S ribosome. However, the Shine-Dalgarno model, which predominantly regulates translation initiation by base-pairing between the ribosomal RNA and the mRNA in model bacteria genera, was reported to have ambiguous effects on chloroplast gene expression. Here we show that while the Shine-Dalgarno motif is clearly conserved in proteobacterial mRNAs, its general absence from chloroplast mRNAs is observed in cyanobacteria as well, promoting the idea that the evolutionary process of reducing the centrality of the Shine-Dalgarno mechanism began well before plastid endosymbiosis. As plastid ribosomal RNA anti-Shine-Dalgarno elements are highly similar to their bacterial counterparts, these sites alone cannot explain the decline in plastid Shine-Dalgarno generality. However, by computational simulation we show that upstream point mutations modulate the local structure of ribosomal RNA in chloroplasts, creating significantly tighter structures around the anti-Shine-Dalgarno locus, which in-turn reduce the probability of ribosome binding via the Shine-Dalgarno mechanism. To validate our model, we expressed a mCherry gene harboring a Shine-Dalgarno motif in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast. We show that co-expressing it with a 16S ribosomal RNA, modified according to our model, significantly enhances its expression compared to co-expression with an endogenous 16S gene.\\n\\nSignificance statementChloroplasts are fascinating intracellular organelles which have evolved from an ancient cyanobacterium engulfed by a larger eukaryote. Surprisingly, the canonical mechanism regulating bacterial translation initiation - Shine-Dalgarno - has been shown to play a reduced role in chloroplasts. Here, we show that mutations upstream from the anti-Shine-Dalgarno element decrease the probability of spontaneous ribosome binding by modulating the secondary structure of the ribosomal RNA. These mutations constitute a regulatory step which acclimates the Shine-Dalgarno mechanism to the translational regulation regime of chloroplasts. Interestingly, we show that these chloroplast features occur in modern cyanobacteria as well, promoting the idea that they have evolved prior to endosymbiosis.",

    "abstract": "The European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is used extensively in biological and biomedical research yet its microbiome remains poorly characterized. We analyzed the microbiota of the digestive tract, gills, and skin in mariculture-raised S. officinalis using a combination of 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing and fluorescence spectral imaging. Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed a striking organization of bacteria distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. Imaging with specific probes confirmed the identity of these bacteria as Vibrionaceae. This Vibrio was also abundant in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at lower density and in the lumen rather than in a discrete layer; it was present in only trace proportions in tank water and in the microbiome of shrimp that were used as feed for the cuttlefish. These Vibrio were resilient to treatment of animals with the commonly-used antibiotic, enrofloxacin. The gills were colonized by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria, especially Vibrionaceae, are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from eggs in captivity, and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMicrobes can play critical roles in the physiology of their animal hosts, as evidenced in cephalopods by the role of Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri in the light organ of the bobtail squid and the role of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria in the reproductive system and egg defense in a variety of cephalopods. We sampled the cuttlefish microbiome throughout the digestive tract, gills, and skin and found dense colonization of an unexpected site, the esophagus, by a microbe of the genus Vibrio, as well as colonization of gills by Piscirickettsiaceae. We found these associations to be resilient to the treatment of animals with a common antibiotic, enrofloxacin. This finding expands the range of organisms and body sites known to be associated with Vibrio and is of potential significance for understanding host-symbiont associations as well as for understanding and maintaining the health of cephalopods in mariculture.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring, principally because they are sensitive and can provide high resolution community composition data. Despite considerable progress in recent years, eDNA studies examining how different environmental sample types can affect species detectability remain rare. Comparisons of environmental samples are especially important for providing best practice guidance on early detection and subsequent mitigation of non-indigenous species. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding of COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and 18S (nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA) genes to compare community composition between sediment and water samples in artificial coastal sites across the United Kingdom. We first detected markedly different communities and a consistently greater number of distinct operational taxonomic units in sediment compared to water. We then compared our eDNA datasets with previously published rapid assessment biodiversity surveys and found excellent concordance among the different survey techniques. Finally, our eDNA surveys detected many non-indigenous species, including several newly introduced species, highlighting the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for both early detection and temporal / spatial monitoring of non-indigenous species. We conclude that careful consideration on environmental sample type is needed when conducting eDNA surveys, especially for studies assessing community change.",

    "abstract": "Endocannabinoids regulate different aspects of neurodevelopment. In utero exposure to the exogenous psychoactive cannabinoid {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({Delta}9-THC), has been linked with abnormal cortical development in animal models. However, much less is known about the actions of endocannabinoids in human neurons. Here we investigated the effect of the endogenous endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG) and {Delta}9-THC on the development of neuronal morphology and activation of signaling kinases, in cortical glutamatergic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Our data indicate that the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), but not the cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R), GPR55 or TRPV1 receptors, is expressed in young, immature hiPSC-derived cortical neurons. Consistent with previous reports, 2AG and {Delta}9-THC negatively regulated neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, acute exposure to both 2AG and {Delta}9-THC inhibited phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2), whereas {Delta}9-THC also reduced phosphorylation of Akt (aka PKB). Moreover, the CB1R inverse agonist SR 141716A attenuated the negative regulation of neurite outgrowth and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by 2AG and {Delta}9-THC. Taken together, our data suggest that hiPSC-derived cortical neurons express CB1Rs and are responsive to both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids. Thus, hiPSC-neurons may represent a good cellular model for investigating the role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating cellular processes in human neurons.",

Pearson correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R2) and paired t-test were used to evaluate differences between VO2 at AeT and at FATmax and VO2 at AnT and at FATmin, respectively. FATmax and AeT occurred at 42.80 {+/-} 2.68 % of VO2max and 43.02 {+/-} 2.73 % of VO2max, while FATmin and AnT occurred at 53.40 {+/-} 3.65 % of VO2max and 53.38 {+/-} 3.65 % of VO2max, respectively.

However, intravenous administration of MSCs is hampered by cell trapping within the pulmonary capillary networks. Here, we hypothesize that traditional twodimensional (2D) plastic-adherent cell expansion fails to result in appropriate morphorheological properties required for cell-circulation. To address this issue, we adapted a novel method to culture MSCs in non-adherent three-dimensional (3D) spheroids (mesenspheres). The biological properties of mesensphere-cultured MSCs remained identical to conventional 2D cultures. Morpho-rheological analyses revealed a smaller size and lower cell stiffness of mesensphere-derived MSCs compared to plastic-adherent MSCs, measured using real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) and atomic force microscopy, resulting in an increased ability to pass through micro-constrictions in an ex vivo microcirculation assay. This ability was confirmed in vivo by analysis of cell accumulation in various organ capillary networks after intravenous injection of mesensphere-derived MSCs in mouse. Our findings generally identify cellular morpho-rheological properties as attractive targets to improve microcirculation and specifically suggest mesensphere cultures as a promising approach for optimized MSC-based therapies.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate their novel functions in depth. The full-length cDNA sequence of Mn-GEM was 1,018 bp, encoding 258 amino acids. The partial Mn-Rev3 cDNA sequence was 6,832 bp, encoding 1,203 amino acids. Tissue distribution indicated that all of these three genes have higher expression level in testis and androgenic gland, implying their novel functions in male sexual development. In situ hybridization analysis further confirmed the novel roles of these three genes. Rev3 promote the testis development during the whole reproductive cycle, while GEM and ferritin only promote the activation of testis development. Besides, these three genes play essential roles in funicular structure development surrounding the androgenic gland cells, which promote and support the formation of androgenic gland cells. The expression in hepatopancreas cells also suggested their role in immune system in M. nipponense.

Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in a CG dose-dependent manner, and inhibition of ROS by NAC, ROS scavenger, recovered A549 and NCI-H1299 cell viability.\\n\\nConclusionThese results indicate that CG causes apoptosis by activating the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and generating ROS in NSCLC cells. These results suggest that CG can be used as a lung cancer therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of aerosolized influenza virus is used for determining inhalation exposure. Several bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05). Our results demonstrated that the novel polystyrene filter material resulted in the highest concentration of extracted RNA compared to the commonly used polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride, which we speculate may be related to the chemical composition of the filter material (e.g., polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon whereas polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride contain more polar, and thus potentially reactive, carbon-halogen bonds). Air sampling did not have an effect on viral RNA recovery. Using Hanks Balanced Salt Solution with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and Phosphate-buffered saline with the Trizol extraction, resulted in the most viral RNA recovery.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is a well-recognized risk factor in several pulmonary vascular diseases including pulmonary hypertension (PH). Furthermore, hypoxia-associated inflammatory changes enhance the structural and functional changes in the pulmonary artery (PA) of PH patients. Understanding the mechanisms that link hypoxia and inflammation, particularly early in disease, is key to development of novel therapeutic avenues for PH. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an \\\"early\\\" inflammatory mediator thought to be critical in diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and atopic dermatitis. TSLP has canonical effects on the immune system, but can also have non-canonical effects on resident lung cells, e.g. airway smooth muscle. Currently, the expression and role of TSLP in the PA is unknown. We hypothesized that locally-produced TSLP potentiates the effects of hypoxia in PA remodeling and contractility relevant to PH. Experiments in human PA endothelial cells (PAECs) and smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) found PAECs to be a larger source of TSLP which targets PASMCs to enhance intracellular Ca2+ responses to vasoconstrictor agonist as well as cell proliferation, acting via a number of signaling cascades including Stat3 and PI3/Akt. Hypoxia, acting via HIF1, enhanced PAEC production of TSLP, and promoted TSLP effects on PASMCs. Interestingly, TSLP per se enhance HIF1a. Overall, these novel data highlight a role for TSLP in hypoxia effects on the PA, and thus relevance for inflammation in PH.",

    "abstract": "Broiler breeders, the parent stock of meat chicks, are feed-restricte throughout rearing to avoid obesity-related problems in their health and reproductive performance. Broiler breeders often show signs of chronic hunger, lack of satiety and feeding frustration, and the development of alternative feeding strategies has investigated the inclusion of calcium propionate (CaP) as an appetite suppressant. However, the mechanisms involved in the reduction of voluntary feed intake are unknown, but are thought to be due to low palatability, gastrointestinal discomfort, or both. The objective of this experiment was to examine the effect of CaP as an appetite suppressant on the experience of a negative affective state, using a conditioned place preference test. Twenty four broiler breeders were trained to associate the consumption of CaP or a placebo pill with a red or blue place, depending on inherent colour preference. Pullets consumed two pills followed by 20 g feed allotment. The CaP pill contained 160 mg of CaP and the placebo pill had 160 mg of feed. Conditioning lasted for 90 min/pullet/day over 8 consecutive days at 7 and 9 weeks of age, and pullets choice was tested in a T-maze twice on two consecutive days at both 8 and 10 weeks of age. Data were analysed using a linear mixed regression model, with pen nested in the model and age as a repeated measure. Pullets were less likely to choose the place conditioned with the consumption of CaP (P<0.05) and the preference of the placebo linearly increased with training sessions (P<0.05). These results suggest that calcium propionate as an appetite suppressant can induce a negative affective state, with the lower feed intake resulting from a conditioned response to the negative effect of calcium propionate rather than to satiety.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnemia, the worlds most common micro-nutrient deficiency disorder, can affect a person at any time and at all stages of life, although children aged 6 -23 months are particularly at higher risk. If left untreated, it adversely affects the health, cognitive development, school achievement, and work performance. However, littlewas investigated among young children in Sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia. This research aimed to investigate its magnitude and correlates to address the gap and guide design of evidence based intervention.\\n\\nMethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May -June 2016 in rural districts of Wolaita Zone. Multi-stage sampling technique was applied to select 990 mother-child pairs. Socio-demography, health and nutritional characteristics were collected by administering interview type questionnaire to mothers/care-givers. Blood samples were taken to diagnose anemia by using HemoCue device, and status was determined using cut-offs used for children aged 6-59 months. Hemoglobin concentration below 11.0 g/dl was considered anemic. Data were analyzed with Statav 14. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were applied to identify candidate and predictor variables respectively. Statistical significance was determined at p-value < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval.\\n\\nResultsThe mean hemoglobin level of children was 10.44{+/-}1.3g/dl, and 65.7% of them were anemic. Among anemic children, 0.4% were severely anemic (<7.0g/dl), while 28.1% and 37.2% were mildly (10.0-10.9g/dl) and moderately (7.0-9.9g/dl) anemic, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, having maternal age of 35 years and above (AOR=1.96), being government employee (AOR=0.29),being merchant (AOR= 0.43) and  other occupation (AOR=3.17) were correlated with anemia in children in rural Wolaita. Similarly, receiving antihelminthic drugs (AOR= 0.39), being female child (AOR= 1.76), consuming poor dietary diversity (AOR=1.40), and having moderate household food insecurity (AOR=1.72) were associated with anemia in rural Wolaita.\\n\\nConclusionA large majority of children in the rural Wolaita were anemic and the need for proven public health interventions such as food diversification, provision of anti-helminthic drugs and ensuring household food security is crucial. In addition, educating women on nutrition and diet diversification, as well as helping them with alternative sources of income might be interventions in the study area.",

    "abstract": "Very little is known about the muscle regeneration process that follows myonecrosis induced by C. perfringens, the main agent of gas gangrene. This study revealed that, in a murine model of the infection with a sublethal inoculum of C. perfringens, muscle necrosis occurs concomitantly with significant vascular damage, which limits the migration of inflammatory cells. A significant increase in cytokines that promote inflammation explains the presence of inflammatory infiltrate; however, an impaired IFN{gamma} expression, a reduced number of Ml macrophages, a deficient phagocytic activity, and the prolongation of the permanence of inflammatory cells, lead to deficient muscle regeneration. The expression of TGF{beta}1 and the consequent accumulation of collagen in the muscle, likely contribute to the fibrosis observed 30 days after infection. These results provide new information on the pathogenesis of gas gangrene caused by C. perfringens, shed light on the basis of the poor muscle regenerative activity, and may open new perspectives for the development of novel therapies for patients suffering this disease.",

    "abstract": "Bodily states are fundamental to emotions emergence and are believed to constitute the first step in the chain of events that culminate in emotional awareness. Recent works have given fresh support to this view by showing that distinct topographical maps can be derived to describe how basic and more complex emotions are represented in the body. However, it is still unclear whether these bodily maps can also extend to emotions experienced specifically within social interactions and how these representations relate to basic emotions. To address this issue, we used the emBODY tool to obtain high-resolution bodily maps that represent the body activation and deactivation experienced by healthy participants in social scenarios depicting establishment or loss of social bonds. We show that clear patterns of activation/deactivation across the body emerge depending on the valence and on the characteristics of the single social scenarios, but also a common activation of head, chest and limbs across scenarios. Furthermore, we showed that maps related to complex social scenarios are strongly correlated with bodily states experienced in basic emotions, suggesting that the patterns of body activation/deactivation found for social scenarios might represent a combination of different basic emotions these experiences elicit. Our data tackle conscious emotional experiences and show for the first time how  painful social events are felt on the body, providing findings that complement verbal reports and neuroimaging data on social rejection. Furthermore, they show that bodily feelings related to complex social scenarios, despite referring to unified independent emotional states, are also related to bodily correlates of basic emotions.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to mitigate climate change often center on clean technologies such as electric vehicles and solar panels, while the mitigation potential of a quality educational experience is rarely discussed. In this paper, we investigate the long-term impact that an intensive one-year university course had on individual carbon emissions by surveying students at least five years after having taken the course. A majority of course graduates reported pro-environmental decisions (i.e., type of car to buy, food choices) that can be attributed to experiences gained in the course. Furthermore, our carbon footprint analysis demonstrates that for the average course graduate, these decisions reduced their individual carbon emissions by 2.86 tons of CO2 per year. Focus group interviews identify that course graduates have developed a strong personal connection to climate change solutions, and this is realized in their daily behaviors and through their professional careers. The paper discusses in more detail the specific components of the course that are believed to be most impactful, and it shares preliminary outcomes from similar curriculum designs that are being used with K-12 students. Our analysis also demonstrates that if similar education programs were applied at scale, the potential reductions in carbon emissions would be of similar magnitude to other large-scale mitigation strategies such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Midlife obesity is a risk factor of late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) but why this is the case remains unknown. As systemic inflammation is involved in both conditions, one possibility is that obesity-related neuroinflammation may contribute to the development of LOAD. Neuroinflammation is closely linked to white matter myelin loss, and this can be measured in vivo with quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging. Here, we investigated whether differences in obesity measures, i.e., in Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat volume fractions and Body Mass Index (BMI), were associated with reductions in qMT indices of apparent myelin in temporal white matter pathways involved in LOAD (i.e., the fornix, the parahippocampal cingulum and the uncinate fasciculus compared with whole brain and cortico-spinal white matter) in 166 cognitively healthy individuals (38-71 years of age). Obesity-related effects on myelin-sensitive markers were contrasted with differences in apparent axon density from dual-shell diffusion Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI). Differences in WHR and in visceral fat volume fractions were negatively correlated with differences in qMT estimates of apparent myelin and tissue metabolism in the fornix but not with any other microstructural components. These correlations were not explained by demographic (age, sex, education), health (hypertension, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle) or genetic (APOE genotype, family history of dementia) risk factors of LOAD. Furthermore, differences in the ratio of plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were also positively correlated with differences in C-Reactive Protein concentrations, and contributed significantly to the correlations between central obesity and myelin-sensitive metrics in the fornix. These results are consistent with the view that visceral fat-related chronic inflammation may damage white matter myelin in limbic regions, known to be vulnerable to LOAD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The ability to extract accurate morphology of labeled neurons from microscopy images is crucial for mapping brain connectivity and for understanding changes in connectivity that underlie learning and memory formation. There are, however, two problems, specific to optical microscopy imaging of neurons, which make accurate neuron tracing exceedingly challenging: (i) neurites can appear broken due to inhomogeneous labeling and (ii) neurites can appear fused in 3D due to limited resolution. Here, we propose and evaluate several artificial neural network (NN) architectures and conventional image enhancement filters with the aim of solving both problems. To evaluate the effects of filtering, we examine the following four image quality metrics: normalized intensity in the cross-over regions between neurites, radius of neurites, coefficient of variation of intensity along neurites, and local background to neurite intensity ratio. Our results show that NN filters, trained on optimized semi-manual traces of neurites, can significantly outperform conventional filters. In particular, U-Net based filtering can virtually eliminate background intensity, while also reducing radius of neurites by 23% to nearly 1 voxel, decreasing intensity in the cross-over regions between neurites by 22%, and reducing variations in intensity along neurites by 26%. These results suggest that including a NN filtering step, which does not require much extra time or computing power, can be beneficial for neuron tracing projects.",

    "abstract": "Targeted enrichment and sequencing of hundreds of nuclear loci for phylogenetic reconstruction is becoming an important tool for plant systematics and evolution. Annonaceae is a major pantropical plant family with 109 genera and ca. 2450 species, occurring across all major and minor tropical forests of the world. Baits were designed by sequencing the transcriptomes of five species from two of the largest Annonaceae subfamilies. Orthologous loci were identified. The resulting baiting kit was used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships at two different levels using concatenated and gene tree approaches: a family wide Annonaceae analysis sampling 65 genera and a species level analysis of tribe Piptostigmateae sampling 29 species with multiple individuals per species. DNA extraction was undertaken mainly on silicagel dried leaves, with two samples from herbarium dried leaves. Our kit targets 469 exons (364 653 bp of sequence data), successfully capturing sequences from across Annonaceae. Silicagel dried and herbarium DNA worked eaually well. We present for the first time a nuclear gene-based phylogenetic tree at the generic level based on 317 supercontigs. Results mainly confirm previous chloroplast based studies. However, several new relationships are found and discussed. We show significant differences in branch lengths between the two large subfamilies Annonoideae and Malmeoideae. A new tribe, Annickieae, is erected containing a single African genus Annickia. We also reconstructed a well resolved species-level phylogenetic tree of the Piptostigmteae tribe. Our baiting kit is useful for reconstructing well supported phylogenetic relationships within Annonaceae at different taxonomic levels. The nuclear genome is mainly concordant with plastome information with a few exceptions. Moreover, we find that substitution rate heterogeneity between the two subfamilies is also found within the nuclear compartment, and not just plastomes and ribosomal DNA as previously shown. Our results have implications for understanding the biogeography, molecular dating and evolution of Annonaceae.",

We present a new multi-state birth-death model (MSBD) that can estimate lineage-specific birth and death rates. For species phylogenies, this corresponds to estimating lineage-dependent speciation and extinction rates. Contrary to existing models, we do not require a prior hypothesis on a trait driving the rate differences and we allow the same rates to be present in different parts of the phylogeny. Using simulated datasets, we show that the MSBD model can reliably infer the presence of multiple evolutionary regimes, their positions in the tree, and the birth and death rates associated with each. We also present a re-analysis of two empirical datasets and compare the results obtained by MSBD and by the existing software BAMM. The MSBD model is implemented as a package in the Bayesian inference software BEAST2, which allows joint inference of the phylogeny and the model parameters.\\n\\nSignificance statementPhylogenetic trees can inform about the underlying speciation and extinction processes within a species clade. Many different factors, for instance environmental changes or morphological changes, can lead to differences in macroevolutionary dynamics within a clade. We present here a new multi-state birth-death (MSBD) model that can detect these differences and estimate both the position of changes in the tree and the associated macroevolutionary parameters.

    "abstract": "Limited sample sizes can hinder biomedical research and lead to spurious findings. The objective of this work is to present a new method to generate synthetic populations (SPs) from sparse data samples to aid in modeling developments. Matched case-control data (n=180 pairs) defined the limited samples. Cases and controls were considered as two separate limited samples. Synthetic populations were generated for these observed samples using multivariate unconstrained bandwidth kernel density estimations. We included four continuous variables and one categorical variable for each individual. Bandwidth matrices were determined with Differential Evolution (DE) optimization driven by covariance comparisons. Four synthetic samples (n=180) were constructed from their respective SP for comparison purposes. Similarity between the observed samples with equally sized synthetic-samples was compared under the hypothesis that their sample distributions were the same. Distributions were compared with the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) test statistic based on a Kernel Two-Sample Test. To evaluate similarity within a modeling context, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) score distributions and residuals were summarized with the distance to the model in X-space (DModX) as additional comparisons.\\n\\nFour SPs were generated with the optimization procedure. The probability of selecting a replicate when randomly constructing synthetic samples with n=180 was infinitesimally small. The MMD tests indicated that the observed sample distributions were similar to the respective synthetic distributions. For both case and control samples, PCA scores and residuals did not deviate significantly when compared with their respective synthetic samples.\\n\\nThe reasonableness of this SP generation approach was demonstrated. This approach produced synthetic data at the patient level statistically similar to the observed samples, and thus could be used to generate larger-sized simulated data. The methodology coupled kernel density estimation with DE optimization and deployed novel similarity metrics derived from PCA. The use of large-sized synthetic samples may be a way to overcome sparse datasets. To further develop this approach into a research tool for model building purposes, additional evaluation with increased dimensionality is required; moreover, comparisons with other techniques such as bootstrapping and cross-validation will be required for a complete evaluation.",

    "abstract": "PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is often inactivated in cancer and possesses both lipid and protein phosphatase activities. We report the metabolic regulator PDHK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1) is a synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancer and normal cells. The predominant mechanism of PDHK1 regulation and dependency is the PTEN protein phosphatase dephosphorylates NF{kappa};B activating protein (NKAP) and limits NF{kappa}B activation to suppress expression of PDHK1, a NF{kappa}B target gene. Loss of the PTEN protein phosphatase upregulates PDHK1 to drive aerobic glycolysis and induce PDHK1 cellular dependence. PTEN-deficient human tumors harbor increased PDHK1, which is a biomarker of decreased patient survival, establishing clinical relevance. This study uncovers a PTEN-regulated signaling pathway and reveals PDHK1 as a potential target in PTEN-deficient cancers.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe tumor suppressor PTEN is widely inactivated in cancers and tumor syndromes. PTEN antagonizes PI3K/AKT signaling via its lipid phosphatase activity. The modest success of PI3K/AKT inhibition in PTEN-deficient cancer patients provides rationale for identifying other vulnerabilities in PTEN-deficient cancers to improve clinical outcomes. We show that PTEN-deficient cells are uniquely sensitive to PDHK1 inhibition. PTEN and PDHK1 co-suppression reduced colony formation and induced cell death in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. PDHK1 levels were high in PTEN-deficient patient tumors and associated with inferior patient survival, establishing clinical relevance. Our study identifies a PTEN-regulated signaling pathway linking the PTEN protein phosphatase to the metabolic regulator PDHK1 and provides a mechanistic basis for PDHK1 targeting in PTEN-deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin organization plays essential roles in cell identity and functions. Here, we demonstrated by hepatocyte-specific inactivation of the genes encoding the three Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1, {beta} and {gamma}) in mice (HP1-TKO) that these proteins are dispensable for hepatocyte activity and survival. Conversely, the chronic absence of these proteins led to a drastic increased incidence of liver tumor development. Molecular characterization of HP1-TKO hepatocytes revealed that HP1 proteins are required for maintenance of histone marks associated with heterochromatin, and for the appropriate expression of large number of genes involved in liver-specific functions as well as in genes encoding for transcriptional repressors of the KRAB-ZFP family. Moreover, several specific endogenous retrovirus families were upregulated in HP1-TKO hepatocytes, leading to the deregulated expression of genes in their vicinity. Our findings indicate that HP1 proteins act as guardians of liver homeostasis to prevent tumor development through the modulation of multiple chromatin-associated events.",

    "abstract": "Yes-associated Protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator that regulates cell proliferation and survival by binding to a selective set of enhancers for potent target gene activation, but how YAP coordinates these transcriptional responses is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that YAP forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus in response to macromolecular crowding. Formed within seconds of hyperosmotic stress, YAP condensates compartmentalized YAPs DNA binding cofactor TEAD1 along with other YAP-related transcription co-activators, including TAZ, and subsequently induced transcription of YAP-specific proliferation genes. Super-resolution imaging using Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with photoactivated localization microscopy (ATAC-PALM) revealed that YAP nuclear condensates were areas enriched in accessible chromatin domains organized as super-enhancers. Initially devoid of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), the accessible chromatin domains later acquired Pol II, producing newly transcribed RNA. Removal of YAPs intrinsically-disordered transcription activation domain (TAD) prevented YAP condensate formation and diminished downstream YAP signaling. Thus, dynamic changes in genome organization and gene activation during YAP reprogramming is mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation.",

    "abstract": "Discrete morphological data have been widely used to study species evolution, but the use of quantitative (or continuous) morphological characters is less common. Here, we implement a Bayesian method to estimate species divergence times using quantitative characters. Quantitative character evolution is modelled using Brownian diffusion with character correlation and character variation within populations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the population variation (or population \"noise\") and the correlation among characters leads to biased estimates of divergence times and rate, especially if the correlation and population noise are high. We apply our new method to the analysis of quantitative characters (cranium landmarks) and molecular data from carnivoran mammals. Our results show that time estimates are affected by whether the correlations and population noise are accounted for or ignored in the analysis. The estimates are also affected by the type of data analysed, with analyses of morphological characters only, molecular data only, or a combination of both; showing noticeable differences among the time estimates. Rate variation of morphological characters among the carnivoran species appears to be very high, with Bayesian model selection indicating that the independent-rates model fits the morphological data better than the autocorrelated-rates model. We suggest that using morphological continuous characters, together with molecular data, can bring a new perspective to the study of species evolution. Our new model is implemented in the MCMCtree computer program for Bayesian inference of divergence times.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks are a feature of many acute and long-term neurological disorders, including neurodegeneration, following neurotrauma and after stroke. Persistent activation of the DNA damage response in response to double strand breaks contributes to neural dysfunction and pathology as it can force post-mitotic neurons to re-enter the cell cycle leading to senescence or apoptosis. Mature, non-dividing neurons may tolerate low levels of DNA damage, in which case muting the DNA damage response might be neuroprotective. Here, we show that attenuating the DNA damage response by targeting the meiotic recombination 11, Rad50, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 complex, which is involved in double strand break recognition, is neuroprotective in three neurodegeneration models in Drosophila and prevents A{beta}1-42-induced loss of synapses in embryonic hippocampal neurons. Attenuating the DNA damage response after optic nerve injury is also neuroprotective to retinal ganglion cells and promotes dramatic regeneration of their neurites both in vitro and in vivo. Dorsal root ganglion neurons similarly regenerate when the DNA damage response is targeted in vitro and in vivo and this strategy also induces significant restoration of lost function after spinal cord injury. We conclude that muting the DNA damage response in the nervous system is neuroprotective in multiple neurological disorders. Our results point to new therapies to maintain or repair the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of parasitic diseases has been challenging due to the development of drug resistance by parasites, and thus there is need to identify new class of drugs and drug targets. Protein translation is important for survival of plasmodium and the pathway is present in all the life cycle stages of the plasmodium parasite. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases are primary enzymes in protein translation as they catalyse the first reaction where an amino acid is added to the cognate tRNA. Currently, there is limited research on comparative studies of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases as potential drug targets. The aim of this study is to understand differences between plasmodium and human aminoacyl tRNA synthetases through bioinformatics analysis. Plasmodium falciparum, P. fragile, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. knowlesi, P. bergei, P. malariae and human aminoacyl tRNA synthetase sequences were retrieved from UniProt database and grouped into 20 families based on amino acid specificity. Despite functional and structural conservation, multiple sequence analysis, motif discovery, pairwise sequence identity calculations and molecular phylogenetic analysis showed striking differences between parasite and human proteins. Prediction of alternate binding sites revealed potential druggable sites in PfArgRS, PfMetRS and PfProRS at regions that were weakly conserved when compared to the human homologues. These differences provide a basis for further exploration of plasmodium aminoacyl tRNA synthetases as potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Secondary structure is a fundamental feature for both noncoding and messenger RNA. However, our understandings about the secondary structure of mRNA, especially for the coding regions, remain elusive, likely due to translation and the lack of RNA binding proteins that sustain the consensus structure, such as those bind to noncoding RNA. Indeed, mRNA has recently been found to bear pervasive alternative structures, whose overall evolutionary and functional significance remained untested. We hereby approached this problem by estimating folding specificity, the probability that a fragment of RNA folds back to the same partner once re-folded. We showed that folding specificity for mRNA is lower than noncoding RNA, and displays moderate evolutionary conservation between orthologs and between paralogs. More importantly, we found that specific rather than alternative folding is more likely evolutionarily adaptive, since it is more frequently associated with functionally important genes or sites within a gene. Additional analysis in combination with ribosome density suggests the capability of modulating ribosome movement as one potential functional advantage provided by specific folding. Our findings revealed a novel facet of RNA structome with important functional and evolutionary implications, and points to a potential way of disentangling mRNA secondary structures maintained by natural selection from molecular noise.",

    "abstract": "Minimal phenotyping refers to the reliance on the use of a small number of self-report items for disease case identification. This strategy has been applied to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we report that the genotype derived heritability (h2SNP) of depression defined by minimal phenotyping (14%, SE = 0.8%) is lower than strictly defined MDD (26%, SE = 2.2%). This cannot be explained by differences in prevalence between definitions or including cases of lower liability to MDD in minimal phenotyping definitions of depression, but can be explained by misdiagnosis of those without depression or with related conditions as cases of depression. Depression defined by minimal phenotyping is as genetically correlated with strictly defined MDD (rG = 0.81, SE = 0.03) as it is with the personality trait neuroticism (rG = 0.84, SE = 0.05), a trait not defined by the cardinal symptoms of depression. While they both show similar shared genetic liability with neuroticism, a greater proportion of the genome contributes to the minimal phenotyping definitions of depression (80.2%, SE = 0.6%) than to strictly defined MDD (65.8%, SE = 0.6%). We find that GWAS loci identified in minimal phenotyping definitions of depression are not specific to MDD: they also predispose to other psychiatric conditions. Finally, while highly predictive polygenic risk scores can be generated from minimal phenotyping definitions of MDD, the predictive power can be explained entirely by the sample size used to generate the polygenic risk score, rather than specificity for MDD. Our results reveal that genetic analysis of minimal phenotyping definitions of depression identifies non-specific genetic factors shared between MDD and other psychiatric conditions. Reliance on results from minimal phenotyping for MDD may thus bias views of the genetic architecture of MDD and may impede our ability to identify pathways specific to MDD.",

    "abstract": "Making good decisions requires updating beliefs according to new evidence. This is a dynamical process that is prone to biases: in some cases, beliefs become entrenched and resistant to new evidence (leading to primacy effects), while in other cases, beliefs fade over time and rely primarily on later evidence (leading to recency effects). How and why either type of bias dominates in a given context is an important open question. Here, we study this question in classic perceptual decision-making tasks, where, puzzlingly, previous empirical studies differ in the kinds of biases they observe, ranging from primacy to recency, despite seemingly equivalent tasks. We present a new model, based on hierarchical approximate inference and derived from normative principles, that not only explains both primacy and recency effects in existing studies, but also predicts how the type of bias should depend on the statistics of stimuli in a given task. We verify this prediction in a novel visual discrimination task with human observers, finding that each observers temporal bias changed as the result of changing the key stimulus statistics identified by our model. By fitting an extended drift-diffusion model to our data we rule out an alternative explanation for primacy effects due to bounded integration. Taken together, our results resolve a major discrepancy among existing perceptual decision-making studies, and suggest that a key source of bias in human decision-making is approximate hierarchical inference.",

However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation is that they are many-fold more accurate in European ancestry individuals than others. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric genome-wide association study biases. This highlights that--unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations--clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement to European descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in levelling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date.

Here we elucidate previously unexplored aspects of transcription regulation and clinical relevance of DNFA in melanomas. We show that elevated expression of DNFA genes is characteristic of many tumor types and correlates with poor prognosis. Elevated DNFA gene expression depends on transcription factor SREBP1 in multiple melanoma cell lines. SREBP1 predominantly binds to the transcription start sites of DNFA genes, directly regulating transcription via RNA polymerase II recruitment and productive elongation. We find that SREBP1-regulated DNFA represents an intrinsic survival mechanism in melanoma cells, regardless of proliferative state and oncogenic mutation status. Indeed, malignant melanoma cells exhibit elevated DNFA gene expression after pro-survival signaling pathways are blocked (e.g. by the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib). Altogether, these results implicate SREBP1 and DNFA enzymes as enticing therapeutic targets in melanomas.",

    "abstract": "Longevity is influenced by various genetic and environmental factors, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we functionally characterise a new Drosophila small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), named jouvence whose loss of function dramatically reduces lifespan. A transgene containing the genomic region of jouvence rescues the longevity in mutant, while its overexpression in wild-type flies increases lifespan. Jouvence is expressed in epithelial cells of the gut. Targeted expression of jouvence specifically in the enterocytes increases lifespan, indicating that its role in the control of longevity takes place in these cells. A transcriptomic analysis performed from the gut reveals that several genes are either up-or down-regulated in mutant indicating that the snoRNA-jouvence might be involved in transcriptional control. Finally, since snoRNAs are structurally and functionally well conserved throughout evolution, we identified putative jouvence orthologue in mammals including humans, suggesting that its function in longevity might be conserved through evolution.",

    "abstract": "Optical tools for simultaneous perturbation and measurement of neural activity open the possibility of mapping neural function over wide areas of brain tissue. However, spectral overlap of actuators and reporters presents a challenge for their simultaneous use, and optical scattering and out-of-focus fluorescence in tissue degrade resolution. To minimize optical crosstalk, we combined an optimized variant (eTsChR) of the most blue-shifted channelrhodopsin reported to-date with a nuclear-localized red-shifted Ca2+ indicator, H2B-jRGECO1a. To perform wide-area optically sectioned imaging in tissue, we designed a structured illumination technique that uses Hadamard matrices to encode spatial information. By combining these molecular and optical approaches we made wide-area maps, spanning cortex and striatum, of the effects of antiepileptic drugs on neural excitability and on the effects of AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers on functional connectivity. Together, these tools provide a powerful capability for wide-area mapping of neuronal excitability and functional connectivity in acute brain slices.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate Gini coefficients for different sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and to determine how STI control interventions might affect the Gini coefficient over time.\\n\\nMethodsWe used population-based data for sexually experienced women from two British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-2: 1999-2001; Natsal-3: 2010-2012) to calculate Gini coefficients for CT, Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), and human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. We applied bootstrap methods to assess uncertainty and to compare Gini coefficients for different STIs. We then used a mathematical model of STI transmission to study how control interventions affect Gini coefficients.\\n\\nResultsGini coefficients for CT and MG were 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18-0.49) and 0.16 (95% CI: 0.02-0.36), respectively. The relatively small coefficient for MG suggests a longer infectious duration compared with CT. The coefficients for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 ranged from 0.15-0.38. During the decade between Natsal-2 and Natsal-3, the Gini coefficient for CT did not change. The transmission model shows that higher STI treatment rates are expected to reduce prevalence and increase the Gini coefficient of STIs. In contrast, increased condom use reduces STI prevalence but does not affect the Gini coefficient.\\n\\nConclusionsGini coefficients for STIs can help us to understand the distribution of STIs in the population, according to level of sexual activity, and could be used to inform STI prevention and treatment strategies.\\n\\nKey messagesO_LIThe Gini coefficient can be used to describe the distribution of STIs in a population, according to different levels of sexual activity.\\nC_LIO_LIGini coefficients for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 appear to be higher than for Mycoplasma genitalium and HPV 6, 11 and 16.\\nC_LIO_LIMathematical modelling suggests that CT screening interventions should reduce prevalence and increase the Gini coefficient, whilst condom use reduces prevalence without affecting the Gini coefficient.\\nC_LIO_LIChanges in Gini coefficients over time could be used to assess the impact of STI prevention and treatment strategies.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeFor stroke rehabilitation, task-specific training in animal models and human rehabilitation trials is considered important to trigger inherent neuroplasticity, promote motor learning, and functional recovery. Little is known, however, about what constitutes an effective dosage of therapy.\\n\\nMethodsThis is a parallel group, four arm, single blind, phase I, randomized control trial of four dosages of upper extremity therapy delivered in an outpatient setting during the chronic phase after stroke. Participants were randomized into groups that varied in total dosage of therapy (i.e., 0, 15, 30, or 60 hours). Seven hundred and four participants were assessed for eligibility, 50 were eligible to enroll, 45 were randomized, 44 participated and 41 completed the study. Planned primary analyses used linear mixed effects regression to model baseline to post-intervention changes in the Motor Activity Log-Quality of Movement rating (MALQ) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) time score as a function of therapy dosage. A series of hierarchical models were constructed using the MALQ and WMFT.\\n\\nResultsWe observed a significant dose response curve: the greater the dosage of training, the greater the change in MALQ, with the dose by week slope parameter of 0.0045 ({Delta}MAL/hour/week; p = 0.0011; 95% CI = [0.0019; 0.0071]). Over the 3 weeks of therapy, this corresponds to a gain of 0.81 in MALQ for the 60 hour dose.\\n\\nConclusionsFor mild-to-moderately impaired stroke survivors, the dosage of a patient-centered, task specific motor therapy was shown to systematically influence the gain in quality of arm use in the natural environment, but not functional capacity as measured in the laboratory. We highlight the importance of recovery outcomes that capture arm use vs. functional capacity.\\n\\nClinical Trial RegistrationURL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT 01749358",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance (IR) can undermine efforts to control vector species of public health importance. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of resurging diseases in the Americas such as yellow fever and dengue, as well as recently emerging chikungunya and Zika viruses, which have caused unprecedented epidemics in the region. Vector control remains the primary public health intervention to prevent outbreaks of Aedes transmitted diseases. In many high-risk regions, like southern Ecuador, we have limited information on IR in Ae. aegypti. In this study, IR status in Ae. aegypti was measured across four cities in El Oro Province in Ecuador using phenotypic assays and genetic screening for alleles associated with resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. Bottle bioassays showed significant inter-seasonal variation in resistance to deltamethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide commonly used by the Ministry of Health, and alpha cypermethrin, as well as differences in deltamethrin resistance between cities. There was also a significant difference in phenotypic response to the organophosphate, Malathion, between two of the cities during the second sampling season. Genotyping showed moderate to high frequencies of the V1016I and F1534C resistance alleles in all four cites. Frequency of resistance genotypes varied significantly between cities in the first sampling season, and not in the later seasons, suggesting a possible selective response to vector control activity. Overall, resistance levels were highest in Machala, a city where dengue is hyperendemic and where insecticide use has historically been more intense than in the other cities included in the study. Despite statistically significant evidence that resistance alleles conferred phenotypic resistance, there was not precise correspondence between these indicators. We found that 17.6% of F1534C and 45.6% of V1016I mutant mosquitoes were susceptible in the bottle bioassays. This study shows there is spatiotemporal variability in IR in southern Ecuador, and serves as an initial examination of the genotypic and phenotypic indicators of IR in this region, providing important information to guide the vector control interventions by the public health sector.",

    "abstract": "Following numerous genome-wide association studies of disease susceptibility, there is increasing interest in genetic associations with disease prognosis, survival or other subsequent events. Such associations are vulnerable to index event bias, by which selection of subjects according to their disease status creates biased associations if common causes of incidence and prognosis are not accounted for. We propose a novel adjustment for index event bias using the residuals from the regression of genetic effects on prognosis on genetic effects on incidence. Our approach eliminates this bias when direct genetic effects on incidence and prognosis are independent, and otherwise reduces bias in realistic situations. In a study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we resolved a paradoxical association of the strong susceptibility gene MUC5B with increased survival, identifying instead a significant association with decreased survival. In re-analysis of a study of Crohns disease prognosis, four regions remained associated at genome-wide significance albeit with increased P-values.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA relationship between asthma and the risk of having cancer has been identified in several studies. However, these studies have used different methodologies, been primarily cross-sectional in nature, and the results have been contradictory. Population-level analyses are required to determine if a relationship truly exists.\n\nMethodsWe developed a novel machine learning tool to infer associations, Causal Inference using the Composition of Transactions (CICT). Two all payers claim datasets of over two hundred million hospitalization encounters from the US-based Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) were used for discovery and validation. Associations between asthma and neoplasms were discovered in data from the State of Florida. Validation was conducted on eight cohorts of patients with asthma, and seven subtypes of asthma and COPD using datasets from the State of California. Control groups were matched by gender, age, race, and history of tobacco use. Odds ratio analysis with Bonferroni-Holm correction measured the association of asthma and COPD with 26 different benign and malignant neoplasms. ICD9CM codes were used to identify exposures and outcomes.\n\nFindingsCICT identified 17 associations between asthma and the risk of neoplasia in the discovery dataset. In the validation studies, 208 case-control analyses were conducted between subtypes of Asthma (N= 999,370, male= 33%, age= 50) and COPD (N=715,971, male = 50%, age=69) with the corresponding matched control groups (N=8,400,004, male= 42%, age= 47). Allergic asthma was associated with benign neoplasms of the meninges, salivary, pituitary, parathyroid, and thyroid glands (OR:1.52 to 2.52), and malignant neoplasms of the breast, intrahepatic biliary system, hematopoietic, and lymphatic system (OR: 1.45 to 2.05). COPD was associated with malignant neoplasms in the lung, bladder, and hematopoietic systems.\n\nInterpretationThe combined use of machine learning methods for knowledge discovery and epidemiological methods shows that allergic asthma is associated with the development of neoplasia, including in glandular organs, ductal tissues, and hematopoietic systems. Also, our findings differentiate the pattern of neoplasms between allergic asthma and obstructive asthma. This suggests that inflammatory pathways that are active in asthma also contribute to neoplastic transformation in specific organ systems such as secretory organs.\n\nFundingNone\n\nAt a Glance CommentaryOver the past three decades, studies have suggested that asthma could increase the risk of developing cancer, but a consensus has not been reached. The debate persists because the current evidence has been derived using cross-sectional statistical designs, limited datasets, and small cohorts and conflicting results. In addition, the mechanism by which allergic airway inflammation contributes to neoplastic transformation is postulated but not proven.\n\nHere, we present the largest study to date on this association in patients with asthma or COPD. A knowledge discovery method was used for hypothesis generation that, when combined with epidemiological reasoning tools, identified associations between airway disease and neoplasia. The results reveal novel relationships between allergic asthma and benign glandular tumors and confirm the well-known connections between COPD and lung cancer. Further, we identified a novel association between COPD and asthma with hematological malignancies. These findings rectify contradictory results from other studies and demonstrate more specifically that the types of neoplasms associated with asthma compared to COPD that infers mechanistic plausibility.",

    "abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which is thought to have the potential to correct dysbiosis of gut microbiota, has recently been used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To elucidate the extent and principles of microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment, we conducted an interventional prospective cohort study. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohns disease (CD) (Harvey-Bradshaw Index [&ge;] 7, n = 11, and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification, S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples of the participants were collected along with their clinical metadata. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy people were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent natural microbiota shifts during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing.\n\nWe found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as the most contributive factors for prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV)--a mosquito-borne arbovirus-- entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential--short-range dispersal, 2) power-law--long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction--long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe underlying pattern of West Nile virus (WNV) geographic spread across the United States is not completely clear, which is a necessary step for continental or state level mitigation strategies to reduce WNV transmission. We report a network model that explains the geographic spread of WNV in the United States. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that infects many avian species with different movement ranges. From our research, we found that migration patterns and routes play an essential role in the WNV spatial distribution. The virus spreads in all directions at short distances because of local birds and short-distance migratory birds. However, the virus also disperses long distances along the avian migratory routes. Our model is designed to be flexible and therefore can be used to explore spreading patterns of other infectious diseases in other geographic locations.",

However, antibody titers to cell-grown viruses were much lower in all individuals (P>0.05) regardless of vaccination. In unadjusted models, a 2-fold increase in MN titers against egg-A/Hong Kong was not significantly protective against infection (29% reduction; p=0.09), but a similar increase in cell-A/Washington titer (3C.2a2) was protective (60% reduction; p=0.02).

We used rolling forecast cross-validation for lambda optimization in each model, minimizing the maximum absolute error.\\n\\nResultsThe models accurately predicted the number of ILI cases during the 2017/18 ILI epidemic in real time with a mean absolute error of 1.40 (per 10,000 population) and a maximum absolute error of 6.36. The model would also have identified the onset, peak, and end of the epidemic with reasonable accuracy\\n\\nThe number of predictors that were retained in the prediction models was small, ranging from 3 to 5, with a single keyword ( Griep =  Flu) having by far the most weight in all models.\\n\\nDiscussionThis study demonstrates the feasibility of accurate real-time ILI incidence predictions in the Netherlands using internet search query data. Digital ILI monitoring strategies may be useful in countries with poor surveillance systems, or for monitoring emergent diseases, including influenza pandemics. We hope that this transparent and accessible case study inspires and supports further developments in field of digital epidemiology in Europe and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Widespread resistance to antibiotics is among the gravest threats to modern medicine, and controlling the spread of multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae has been given priority status by the World Health Organization. Interventions to reduce transmission within hospital wards may be informed by modifiable patient-level risk factors for becoming colonised, however understanding of factors that influence a patients risk of acquisition is limited. We analyse data from a one year prospective carriage study in a neonatal intensive care unit in Cambodia using Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the daily probability of acquiring multi-drug resistant organisms, while accounting for patient-level time-varying covariates, including interactions between species, and interval-censoring of transmission events. We estimate the baseline daily probability for becoming colonised with third generation cephalosporin resistant (3GC-R) Klebsiella pneumoniae as 0.142 (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.066, 0.27), nearly ten times higher than the daily probability of acquiring 3GC-R Escherichia coli (0.016 [95% CrI 0.0038, 0.049]). Prior colonization with 3GC-R K. pneumoniae was associated with a greatly increased risk of a patient acquiring 3GC-R E. coli (odds ratio [OR] 6.4 [95% CrI 2.8, 20.9]). Breast feeding was associated with a reduced risk of colonization with both 3GC-R K. pneumoniae (OR 0.73 [95% CrI 0.38, 1.5]) and E. coli (OR 0.62 [95% CrI 0.28, 1.6]). The use of an oral probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus) did not show clear evidence of protection against colonization with either 3GC-R K. pneumoniae (OR 0.83 [95% CrI 0.51, 1.3]) or 3GC-R E. coli (OR 1.3 [95% CrI 0.77, 2.1]). Antibiotic consumption within the past 48 hours did not strongly influence the risk of acquiring 3GC-R K. pneumoniae. For 3GC-R E. coli, ceftriaxone showed the strongest effect for increasing the risk of acquisition (OR 2.2 [95% CrI 0.66, 6.2]) and imipenem was associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.31 [95% CrI 0.099, 0.76). Using 317 whole-genome assemblies of K. pneumoniae, we determined putatively related clusters and used a range of models to infer transmission rates. Model comparison strongly favored models with a time-varying force of infection term that increased in proportion with the number of colonized patients, providing evidence of patient-to-patient transmission, including among a cluster of Klebsiella quasipneumoniae. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that K. pneumoniae can be spread person-to-person within ward settings. Subsequent horizontal gene transfer within patients from K. pneumoniae provides the most parsimonious explanation for the strong association between colonization with 3GC-R K. pneumoniae and acquisition of 3GC-R E. coli.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProvision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during conflict settings is rarely attempted and little is known about the expected patterns of mortality. The Central African Republic (CAR) continues to have a low coverage of ART despite an estimated 120,000 people living with HIV and 11,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2013. We present results from a cohort in Zemio, Haut-Mboumou prefecture. This region had the highest prevalence of HIV nationally (14.8% in 2010) and was subject to repeated attacks by armed groups on civilians during the observed period.\\n\\nMethodsConflict from armed groups can impact cohort mortality rates i) directly if HIV patients are victims of armed conflict, or ii) indirectly if population displacement or fear of movement reduces access to ART. Using monthly counts of civilian deaths, injuries and abductions, we estimated the impact of the conflict on patient mortality. We also determine patient-level risk factors for mortality and how this varies with time spent in the cohort. Model-fitting was performed in a Bayesian framework, using generalised-linear models with terms accounting for temporal autocorrelation.\\n\\nResultsPatients were recruited and observed from October 2011 to May 2017. Overall 1631 patients were enrolled, giving 4107 person-years and 148 deaths. Our first model shows that patient mortality did not increase during periods of heightened conflict. The monthly risk (probability) of mortality was markedly higher at the beginning of the program (0.047 in November 2011 [95% credible interval; CrI 0.0078, 0.21]) and had declined greater than ten-fold by the end of the observed period (0.0016 in June 2017 [95% CrI 0.00042, 0.0036]). Our second model shows the risk of mortality for individual patients was highest in the first five months spent in the cohort. Male sex was associated with a higher mortality (odds ratio; OR 1.7 [95% CrI 1.2, 2.8]) along with the severity of opportunistic infections at baseline.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show that chronic conflict did not appear to adversely affect rates of mortality in this cohort, and that mortality was driven predominantly by patient specific risk factors. In areas initiating ART for the first time, particular attention should be focussed on stabilising patients with advanced symptoms.\\n\\nFundingMedecins Sans Frontieres",

I-squared statistics was used to see heterogeneity. Publication bias was checked by Eggers regression test. A meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was employed to estimate the overall prevalence of treatment failure. Subgroup analyses based on the geographical location of the study, age of study population, type of treatment failure, and study design were conducted to see variation in outcomes. The sensitivity analysis was also employed to see whether an outlier result found in the included studies.\\n\\nResultsOverall HIV treatment failure found to be 15.9% (95% CI: 11.6%-20.1%). HIV treatment failure was 10.2% (6.9%-13.6%) using immunological definition, 5.6% (95% CI: 2.9%-8.3%) using virological definition, and 6.3% (4.6%-8.0%) using clinical definition. Poor HAART adherence (AOR= 8.5; 95% CI: 4.1-12.8), severity of illness (as measured by WHO clinical stage III/IV (AOR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.3-2.6), and presence of opportunistic infections (AOR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.4) were significantly associated with HIV treatment failure.\\n\\nConclusionsHIV treatment failure in Ethiopia found to be high and differed by adherence level, severity of illness, and presence of opportunistic infection.

    "abstract": "Accurate stroke lesion segmentation is a critical step in the neuroimaging processing pipeline to assess the relationship between post-stroke brain structure, function, and behavior. While many multimodal segmentation algorithms have been developed for acute stroke neuroimaging, few are effective with only a single T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical MRI. This is a critical gap because most stroke rehabilitation research relies on a single T1w MRI for defining the lesion. Although several attempts to automate the segmentation of chronic lesions on single-channel T1w MRI have been made, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated on a large dataset. Here, we performed an exhaustive review of the literature and identified one semi- and three fully automated approaches for segmentation of chronic stroke lesions using T1w MRI within the last ten years: Clusterize, Automated Lesion Identification, Gaussian naive Bayes lesion detection, and LINDA. We evaluated each method on a large T1w stroke dataset (N=181) using visual and quantitative methods. LINDA was the most computationally expensive approach, but performed best across the three main evaluation metrics (median values: Dice Coefficient=0.50, Hausdorffs Distance=36.34 mm, and Average Symmetric Surface Distance = 4.97 mm), whereas the Gaussian Bayes method had the highest recall/least false negatives (median=0.80). Segmentation accuracy in all automated methods were influenced by size (small: worst) and stroke territory (brainstem, cerebellum: worst) of the lesion. To facilitate reproducible science, we have made our analysis files publicly available online at https://github.com/npnl/elsa. We hope these findings are informative to future development of T1w lesion segmentation algorithms.",
