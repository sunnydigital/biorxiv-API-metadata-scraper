    "abstract": "The ability of animals to perform coordinated movements depends on the precise organization of neural circuits controlling motor function. Motor neurons (MNs), which are key components of these circuits, must project their axons out of the central nervous system and form precise terminal branching patterns at specific muscles in the periphery. By focusing on the Drosophila adult leg neuromuscular system we show that the stereotyped terminal branching of a subset of leg MNs is mediated by interacting transmembrane Ig superfamily (IgSF) proteins DIP- and Dpr10, present in MNs and target muscles, respectively. Importantly, the DIP-/Dpr10 interaction is needed only after MN axons reach the vicinity of their muscle targets. Live imaging of this process suggests that precise terminal branching patterns are gradually established by DIP-/Dpr10-dependent interactions between fine axon filopodia and developing muscles. Further, different leg MNs depend on the DIP- and Dpr10 interaction to varying degrees that correlate with the morphological complexity of the MNs and their muscle targets, suggesting that some MNs depend upon multiple sets of interacting proteins to establish terminal axon branching.",

    "abstract": "TET enzymes are dioxygenases that promote DNA demethylation by oxidizing the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here we report a close correspondence between 5hmC-marked regions, chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity in B cells, and a strong enrichment for consensus binding motifs for basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors at TET-responsive genomic regions. Functionally, Tet2 and Tet3 regulate class switch recombination (CSR) in murine B cells by enhancing expression of Aicda, encoding the cytidine deaminase AID essential for CSR. TET enzymes deposit 5hmC, demethylate and maintain chromatin accessibility at two TET-responsive elements, TetE1 and TetE2, located within a superenhancer in the Aicda locus. Transcriptional profiling identified BATF as the bZIP transcription factor involved in TET-dependent Aicda expression. 5hmC is not deposited at TetE1 in activated Batf-deficient B cells, indicating that BATF recruits TET proteins to the Aicda enhancer. Our data emphasize the importance of TET enzymes for bolstering AID expression, and highlight 5hmC as an epigenetic mark that captures enhancer dynamics during cell activation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCocaine addiction is a major public health problem. Despite decades of intense research, no effective treatments are available. Both preclinical and clinical studies of drug addiction strongly suggest that the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is a viable target for deep brain stimulation (DBS).\\n\\nObjectiveAlthough previous studies have shown that DBS of the NAcc decreases cocaine seeking and reinstatement, the effects of DBS on cocaine intake in cocaine-dependent animals have not yet been investigated.\\n\\nMethodsRats were made cocaine-dependent by allowing them to self-administer cocaine in long-access sessions (6 h, 0.5 mg/kg/infusion). The effects of high-frequency DBS of the NAcc shell on cocaine intake was then studied. Furthermore, cocaine-induced locomotor activity, irritability-like behavior during cocaine abstinence and the levels of the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits 1 and 2 (GluR1/GluA1 and GluR2/GluA2) after DBS were investigated.\\n\\nResultsContrary to our expectations, DBS of the NAcc shell induced a slight increase in both cocaine self-administration and cocaine-induced locomotor activity. In addition, 18 h into cocaine withdrawal, we found that DBS decreased irritability-like behavior. We also found that DBS-induced a robust increase in both cytosolic and synaptosomal levels of GluR1, but not GluR2, specifically in the central nucleus of the amygdala but not in other brain regions.\\n\\nConclusionsThese preclinical results with cocaine-dependent animals do not support high-frequency DBS of the NAcc shell as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of cocaine addiction in active cocaine users. However, the decrease in irritability-like behavior during cocaine abstinence, together with previous findings showing that DBS of the NAcc shell reduces the reinstatement of cocaine seeking in abstinent animals, warrants future investigations of DBS as a treatment for negative emotional states and craving during abstinence.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIHigh-frequency DBS of the NAcc shell for the treatment of cocaine addiction is proposed\\nC_LIO_LIDBS of the NAcc shell does not decrease cocaine intake in cocaine-dependent rats\\nC_LIO_LIDBS increases the level of GluR1 specifically in the central nucleus of the amygdala\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Training related skills in close succession results in interference but the reasons for this interference are not understood. Here we test the hypothesis that interference occurs due to competition of long-term potentiation (LTP): the LTP induced by one task impedes the LTP induced by the other. Human subjects performed two consecutive training sessions on different Gabor orientations. Immediately after the offset of the first training, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to interfere with the LTP processes produced by the first training. We found that cTBS to a control site (vertex) resulted in substantial anterograde interference for the second training. Critically, cTBS to the visual cortex not only disrupted learning on the immediately preceding training, but also released the second training from the anterograde interference. These results provide strong support for the LTP-based theory of interference and suggest the possibility of directly manipulating the competition between different learning periods.",

    "abstract": "The expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract form of ataxin-1 drives disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Although polyQ-ataxin-1 is known to form distinctive intranuclear bodies, the cellular pathways and functions it influences remain poorly understood. Here, we identify direct and proximal partners constituting the interactome of ataxin-1[85Q] in Neuro-2a cells. Pathways analyses indicate a significant enrichment of essential nuclear transporters in the interactome, pointing to disruptions in nuclear transport processes in the presence of polyQ-ataxin-1. Our direct assessments of nuclear transporters and their cargoes reinforce these observations, revealing disrupted trafficking often with relocalisation of transporters and/or cargoes to ataxin-1[85Q] nuclear bodies. Strikingly, the nucleoporin Nup98, dependent on its GLFG repeats, is recruited into polyQ-ataxin-1 nuclear bodies. Our results highlight a disruption of multiple essential nuclear protein trafficking pathways by polyQataxin-1, a key contribution to furthering understanding of pathogenic mechanisms initiated by polyQ tract proteins.",
