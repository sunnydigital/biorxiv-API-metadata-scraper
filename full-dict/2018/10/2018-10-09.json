    "abstract": "We present a new phylogenetic approach SelAC (Selection on Amino acids and Codons), whose substitution rates are based on a nested model linking protein expression to population genetics. Unlike simpler codon models which assume a single substitution matrix for all sites, our model more realistically represents the evolution of protein coding DNA under the assumption of consistent, stabilizing selection using cost-benefit approach. This cost-benefit approach allows us generate a set of 20 optimal amino acid specific matrix families using just a handful of parameters and naturally links the strength of stabilizing selection to protein synthesis levels, which we can estimate. Using a yeast dataset of 100 orthologs for 6 taxa, we find SelAC fits the data much better than popular models by 104-105 AICc units. Our results indicate there is great potential for more accurate inference of phylogenetic trees and branch lengths from already existing data through the use of nested, mechanistic models. Additional parameters estimated by SelAC indicate that a large amount of non-phylogenetic, but biologically meaningful, information can be inferred from exisiting data. For example, SelAC prediction of gene specific protein synthesis rates correlates well with both empirical (r=0.33-0.48) and other theoretical predictions (r=0.45-0.64) for multiple yeast species. SelAC also provides estimates of the optimal amino acid at each site. Finally, because SelAC is a nested approach based on clearly stated biological assumptions, future modifications, such as including shifts in the optimal amino acid sequence within or across lineages, are possible.",

    "abstract": "Model-averaged partial regression coefficients have been criticized for averaging over a set of models with coefficients that have different meanings from model to model. This criticism arises because statisticians since Fisher believe that the meaning of a coefficient in a regression model arises from probabilistic conditioning (P (Y |X)) and that coefficients are mere descriptors of conditional association (or \\\"differences in conditional means\\\"). Because this association parameter is conditional on a specific set of covariates, the parameter for a predictor varies from model to model. The coefficients in many applied regression models, however, take their meaning from causal conditioning (P (Y |do(X))) and these coefficients estimate causal effect parameters (or simply, causal effects or Average Treatment Effects). Causal effect parameters are also differences in conditional expectations, but the event conditioned on is not the set of covariates in a regression model but a hypothetical intervention. Because an effect parameter for a predictor takes its meaning from causal and not probabilistic conditioning, it is the same from model to model, and an averaged coefficient has a straightforward interpretation as an estimate of a causal effect. But, because the effect parameter is the same from model to model, the estimates of the parameter will generally be biased. By contrast, with probabilistic conditioning, the coefficients are consistent estimates of their parameter in every model. Confounding and omitted variable bias, which are central to explanatory modeling, are meaningless in regression modeling as mere description.",

    "abstract": "The existence of population-wide T cell immunity is widely recognized for multiple pathogen-derived immunodominant epitopes, despite the vast diversity and individualized nature of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. We thus hypothesized that population-wide epitope immunogenicity could be probabilistically defined by exploiting public TCR features. To gain a proof-of-concept, here we describe a machine learning framework yielding probabilistic estimates of immunogenicity, termed \\\"immunogenicity scores\\\", by utilizing features designed to mimic thermodynamic interactions between peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and TCR repertoire. Immunogenicity score dynamics among observed and computationally simulated single amino acid mutants delineated the landscape of position- and residue-specific mutational impacts, and even quantitatively estimated escaping potentials of known epitopes with remarkable positional specificity. This study illustrates that the population-wide aspect of adaptive immunity is predictable via non-individualized approach, possibly indicating antigen-guided convergence of human T cell reactivity.",

A particular challenge is the acquisition of opposing states by two copies of the same gene, as it is the case in mammals for Xist at the onset of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). The regulatory principles that lead to stable mono-allelic expression of Xist remain unknown. Here, we uncovered the minimal Xist regulatory network, by combining mathematical modeling and experimental validation of central model predictions. We identified a symmetric toggle switch as the basis for random mono-allelic Xist up-regulation, which reproduces data from several mutant, aneuploid and polyploid murine cell lines with various Xist expression patterns. Moreover, this toggle switch explains the diversity of strategies employed by different species at the onset of XCI. In addition to providing a unifying conceptual framework to explore X-chromosome inactivation across mammals, our study sets the stage for identifying the molecular mechanisms required to initiate random XCI.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol is one of the worlds most abused drugs yet the impacts of chronic ethanol consumption are debated. Ethanol is a prevalent component in the diets of diverse animals and can act as a nutritional source, behavior modulator, and a toxin. The source of ethanol is microbes, which can both produce and degrade ethanol, and the gut microbiome has been associated with differential health outcomes in chronic alcoholism. To disentangle the various and potentially interacting roles of bacteria and ethanol on host health, we developed a model for chronic ethanol ingestion in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which naturally consumes a diet between 0 and 5% ethanol. We took advantage of the tractability of the fly microbiome, which can be experimentally removed to separate the direct and indirect effects of commensal microbes. We found that moderate to heavy ethanol ingestion decreased lifespan and reproduction, without causing inebriation. These effects were more pronounced in flies lacking a microbiome, but could not be explained by simple bacterial degradation of ethanol. However, moderate ethanol ingestion increased reproduction in bacterially-colonized flies, relative to bacteria-free flies. Ethanol decreased intestinal stem cell turnover in bacterially-colonized flies and decreased intestinal barrier failure and increased fat content in all flies, regardless of microbiome status. Analysis of host gene expression finds that ethanol triggers the innate immune response, but only in flies colonized with bacteria. Taken together we show that, chronic ethanol ingestion negatively impacts fly health in a microbiome-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity currently peaks at the equator, decreasing toward the poles. Growing fossil evidence suggest that this hump-shaped latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) has not been persistent through time, with similar species diversity across latitudes flattening out the LDG during past greenhouse periods. This provides a new starting point for LDG research. Most studies assume the processes shaping the LDG have acted constantly through time and seek to understand why diversity accumulated in the Holarctic at lower levels than at the equator, e.g. as the result of limited dispersal, or higher turnover in Holarctic regions. However, fossil investigations suggest that we need to explain when and why diversity was lost at high latitudes to generate the LDG. Unfortunately, diversity lost scenarios in the Holarctic have been repeatedly proposed but not yet clearly demonstrated. Here, we use diversification approaches for both phylogenies and fossils to study the LDG of Testudines, Crocodilia and Lepidosauria. We show the LDG of these groups has varied over time, with high latitudes serving as a source of tropical diversity but suffering disproportionate extinction during transitional periods to cold climate. We outline the  asymmetric gradient of extinction and dispersal (AGED) framework, which contextualizes previous ideas behind the LDG under a time-variable scenario. We suggest the current steep LDG may be explained by the extinction of clades adapted to warmer conditions from the new temperate regions formed in the Neogene, together with the equator-ward dispersal of organisms tracking their own climatic preferences, when tropical biomes became restricted to the equator. Conversely, high rates of speciation and pole-ward dispersals can account for the formation of an ancient flat LDG during the Cretaceous-Paleogene greenhouse period. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of fossils in macroevolutionary studies allows detecting extinction events less detectable in analyses restricted to present-day data only.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundSequencing of amplified genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, have been extensively used to characterize microbial community composition. Recent studies suggested that Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASV) should replace the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), given the arbitrary definition of sequence identity thresholds used to define units. Alignment-free methods are an interesting alternative for the taxonomic classification of the ASVs, preventing the introduction of biases from sequence identity thresholds.\\n\\nResultsHere we present TAG.ME, a novel alignment-independent and amplicon-specific method for taxonomic assignment based on genetic markers. TAG.ME uses a multilevel supervised learning approach to create predictive models based on user-defined genetic marker genes. The predictive method can assign taxonomy to sequenced amplicons efficiently and effectively. We applied our method to assess gut and soil sample classification, and it outperformed alternative approaches, identifying a substantially larger proportion of species. Benchmark tests performed using the RDP database, and Mock communities reinforced the precise classification into deep taxonomic levels.\\n\\nConclusionTAG.ME presents a new approach to assign taxonomy to amplicon sequences accurately. Our classification model, trained with amplicon specific sequences, can address resolution issues not solved by other methods and approaches that use the whole 16S rRNA gene sequence.

    "abstract": "Sensory prediction errors are thought to update memories in motor 1 adaptation, but the role of performance errors is largely unknown. To dissociate these errors, we manipulated visual feedback during fast shooting movements under visuomotor rotation. Participants were instructed to strategically correct for performance errors by shooting to a neighboring target in one of four conditions: following the movement onset, the main target, the neighboring target, both targets, or none of the targets disappeared. Participants in all conditions experienced a drift away from the main target following the strategy. In conditions where the main target was shown, participants often tried to minimize performance errors caused by the drift by generating corrective movements. However, despite differences in performance during adaptation between conditions, memory decay in a delayed washout block was indistinguishable between conditions. Our results thus suggest that, in visuomotor adaptation, sensory predictions errors, but not performance errors, update the slow, temporally stable, component of motor memory.",

    "abstract": "The rapid accumulation of ancient human genomes from various areas and time periods potentially allows the expansion of studies of biodiversity, biogeography, forensics, population history, and epidemiology into past populations. However, most ancient DNA (aDNA) data were generated through microarrays designed for modern-day populations known to misrepresent the population structure. Past studies addressed these problems using ancestry informative markers (AIMs). However, it is unclear whether AIMs derived from contemporary human genomes can capture ancient population structure and whether AIM finding methods are applicable to ancient DNA (aDNA) provided that the high missingness rates in ancient, oftentimes haploid, DNA can also distort the population structure. Here, we define ancient AIMs (aAIMs) and develop a framework to evaluate established and novel AIM-finding methods in identifying the most informative markers. We show that aAIMs identified by a novel principal component analysis (PCA)-based method outperforms all competing methods in classifying ancient individuals into populations and identifying admixed individuals. In some cases, predictions made using the aAIMs were more accurate than those made with a complete marker set. We discuss the features of the ancient Eurasian population structure and strategies to identify aAIMs. This work informs the design of population microarrays and the interpretation of aDNA results.",

We then validated the predictive value of this signature on two MCI cohorts. In ADNI1 (N=235), the presence of the signature predicted progression to dementia over three years with 80.4% positive predictive value, adjusted for a \\\"typical\\\" MCI baseline rate of 33% (95.6% specificity, 55.1% sensitivity).

    "abstract": "Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster is one of the most important African forage grasses in Brazilian beef production. Currently available genetic-genomic resources for this species are restricted mainly due to polyploidy and apomixis. Therefore, crucial genomic-molecular studies such as the construction of genetic maps and the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are very challenging and consequently affect the advancement of molecular breeding. The objectives of this work were to (i) construct an integrated U. decumbens genetic map for a full-sibling progeny using GBS-based markers with allele dosage information, (ii) detect QTLs for spittlebug (Notozulia entreriana) resistance, and (iii) seek putative candidate genes involved in resistance/defense against pathogens. We used the Setaria viridis genome as reference to align GBS reads and selected 4,240 high-quality SNPs markers with allele dosage information. Of these markers, 1,000 were distributed throughout nine homologous groups with a cumulative map length of 1,335.09 cM and an average marker density of 1.33 cM. We detected QTLs for resistance to spittlebug, an important pasture insect pest, that explained between 4.66% and 6.24% of the phenotypic variation. These QTLs are in regions containing putative candidate genes related to resistance/defense against pathogens. Because this is the first genetic map with SNP autotetraploid dosage data and QTL detection in U. decumbens, it will be useful for future evolutionary studies, genome assembly, and other QTL analyses in Urochloa spp. Moreover, the results might facilitate the isolation of spittlebug-related candidate genes and help clarify the mechanism of spittlebug resistance. These approaches will improve selection efficiency and accuracy in U. decumbens molecular breeding and shorten the breeding cycle.",

    "abstract": "Giardia is a common protistan parasite that causes diarrheal disease worldwide. Motile trophozoites colonize the small intestine, attaching to the villi with the ventral disc, a unique and complex microtubule (MT) organelle. Attachment to the host epithelium allows Giardia to resist peristalsis during infection of the host gastrointestinal tract. Despite our emerging view of the complexity of ventral disc architecture, we are still in the very preliminary stages of understanding how specific structural elements contribute to disc stability or generate forces for attachment. The ventral disc is a large, dome-shaped, spiral MT array decorated with microribbon-crossbridge protein complexes (MR-CB) that extend upward into the cytoplasm. To find additional disc-associated proteins (DAPs), we used a modified method for disc biochemical fractionation in high salt followed by shotgun proteomic analyses and validation by GFP-tagging. Using this method in conjunction with an ongoing subcellular localization screen, we identified 54 new DAPs. Of the 87 DAPs confirmed to date, 54 localize only to the disc, and the remainder localize to additional structures including the flagella, basal bodies, or median body. Almost one third of the known DAPs lack any homology to proteins in other eukaryotes and another one third simply contain ankyrin repeat domains. Many DAPs localize to specific structural regions of the disc, including the ventral groove region and disc margin. Lastly, we show that spiral singlet MT array comprising the disc is hyperstable and lacks dynamic instability, and we attribute these unique properties to the presence of both novel DAPs as well conserved MAPs and MIPs that are known to stabilize ciliary doublet and triplet MTs.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction and annotation of volume electron microscopy data sets of brain tissue is challenging, but can reveal invaluable information about neuronal circuits. Significant progress has recently been made in automated neuron reconstruction, as well as automated detection of synapses. However, methods for automating the morphological analysis of nanometer-resolution reconstructions are less established, despite their diverse application possibilities. Here, we introduce cellular morphology neural networks (CMNs), based on multi-view projections sampled from automatically reconstructed cellular fragments of arbitrary size and shape. Using unsupervised training we inferred morphology embeddings (\\\"Neuron2vec\\\") of neuron reconstructions and trained CMNs to identify glia cells in a supervised classification paradigm which was then used to resolve neuron reconstruction errors. Finally, we demonstrate that CMNs can be used to identify subcellular compartments and the cell types of neuron reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "The \\\"apparent motion\\\" illusion is evoked when stationary stimuli are successively flashed in spatially separated positions. It depends on the precise spatial and temporal separations of the stimuli. For large spatiotemporal separation, the long-range apparent motion (lrAM), it remains unclear how the visual system computes unambiguous motion signals. Here we investigated whether intracortical interactions within retinotopic maps could shape a global motion representation at the level of V1 population in response to a lrAM. In fixating monkeys, voltage-sensitive dye imaging revealed the emergence of a spatio-temporal representation of the motion trajectory at the scale of V1 population activity, shaped by systematic backward suppressive waves. We show that these waves are the expected emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the horizontal intra-cortical network. Such non-linearities explain away ambiguous correspondence problems of the stimulus along the motion path, preformating V1 population response for an optimal read-out by downstream areas.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of ion and pH homeostasis of endomembrane organelles is critical for functional protein trafficking, sorting and modification in eukaryotic cells. pH homeostasis is maintained through the activity of vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) pumping protons (H+) into the endomembrane lumen, and counter-action by cation/proton exchangers such as the NHX family of Na+(K+)/H+ exchangers. In plants, disturbing V-ATPase activity at the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) impairs secretory and endocytic trafficking. However, it is unclear if the endosomal NHX-type antiporters NHX5 and NHX6 play functionally similar roles in endomembrane trafficking through maintaining ion and pH homeostasis. Here we show through genetic, pharmacological, and live-cell imaging approaches that double knockout of endosomal isoforms NHX5 and NHX6 results in impairment of endosome motility, protein recycling at the TGN/EE, but not in the secretion of integral membrane proteins. Furthermore, we report that nhx5 nhx6 mutants are partially insensitive to osmotic swelling of TGN/EE induced by the monovalent cation ionophore monensin. Similarly, nhx5 nhx6 cells are unresponsive to late endosomal swelling by the phosphatidylinositol 3/4-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, demonstrating that NHX5 and NHX6 are required for maintaining endosomal cation balance. Lastly, we report that the distal region of the cytosolic tail of NHX6 is required for mediating NHX6 localisation to late endosomes, but does not appear to be essential for NHX6 function.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) consist in combining the information across many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a score reflecting the genetic risk of developing a disease. PRS might have a major impact on public health, possibly allowing for screening campaigns to identify high-genetic risk individuals for a given disease. The \\\"Clumping+Thresholding\\\" (C+T) approach is the most common method to derive PRS. C+T uses only univariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, which makes it fast and easy to use. However, previous work showed that jointly estimating SNP effects for computing PRS has the potential to significantly improve the predictive performance of PRS as compared to C+T.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present an efficient method to jointly estimate SNP effects, allowing for practical application of penalized logistic regression (PLR) on modern datasets including hundreds of thousands of individuals. Moreover, our implementation of PLR directly includes automatic choices for hyper-parameters. The choice of hyper-parameters for a predictive model is very important since it can dramatically impact its predictive performance. As an example, AUC values range from less than 60% to 90% in a model with 30 causal SNPs, depending on the p-value threshold in C+T.\\n\\nWe compare the performance of PLR, C+T and a derivation of random forests using both real and simulated data. PLR consistently achieves higher predictive performance than the two other methods while being as fast as C+T. We find that improvement in predictive performance is more pronounced when there are few effects located in nearby genomic regions with correlated SNPs; for instance, AUC values increase from 83% with the best prediction of C+T to 92.5% with PLR. We confirm these results in a data analysis of a case-control study for celiac disease where PLR and the standard C+T method achieve AUC of 89% and of 82.5%.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that penalized logistic regression can achieve more discriminative polygenic risk scores, while being applicable to large-scale individual-level data thanks to the implementation we provide in the R package bigstatsr.",

    "abstract": "Sensory hypersensitivity is a common and debilitating feature of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). However, how developmental changes in neuronal function ultimately culminate in the network dysfunction that underlies sensory hypersensitivities is not known. To address this, we studied the layer 4 barrel cortex circuit in Fmr1 knockout mice, a critical sensory processing circuit in this mouse model of FXS. By systematically studying cellular and synaptic properties of layer 4 neurons and combining with cellular and network simulations, we explored how the array of phenotypes in Fmr1 knockout produce circuit pathology during development that result in sensory processing dysfunction. We show that many of the cellular and synaptic pathologies in Fmr1 knockout mice are antagonistic, mitigating circuit dysfunction, and hence can be regarded as compensatory to the primary pathology. Despite this compensation, the layer 4 network in the Fmr1 knockout exhibits significant alterations in spike output in response to ascending thalamocortical input that we show results in impaired sensory encoding. We suggest that it is this developmental loss of layer 4 sensory encoding precision that drives subsequent developmental alterations in layer 4 - layer 2/3 connectivity and plasticity observed in the Fmr1 knockout, and is a critical process producing sensory hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The physic-chemistry of biological membranes is at the origin of fundamental cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking, cell adhesion and migration1-3. Because most of intracellular shapes and local demixing of membranes take place in the nanometer scale, AFM becomes an extremely powerful technique to assess the properties of these biological membranes. Porous substrates provide an elegant strategy to avoid the conundrum of placing soft and thin biomembranes on hard substrates for AFM studies, although the surface chemistry make the actual substrates rather challenging setups. Here, we have engineered porous systems on the most widely used substrate in AFM, mica muscovite, with tunable pore sizes from some tens to few hundreds nanometers for biological applications. We show that free-standing bilayers on nano-porous can be obtained by using well-established vesicle spreading methods and that they display equivalent nano-mechanical stability and phsyco-chemical properties to that of membranes on conventional mica supports. By reducing the pore radius < 40 nm and limiting the contribution of membrane tension to the elastic response of free-standing membranes we estimate a bending modulus of 18 kbT and 73 kbT for DOPC and DPPC bilayers, respectively. The quantitative mapping of suspended membranes shows a different mechanical response at the pore rims, which is more pronounced for DPPC and suggest a different lipid ordering. We find that the combination of membrane bending and the different lipid packing at the edges of pores shapes the curvature of free-standing membranes on pores in the range of few tens of nm.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genes comprise exons and introns thus requiring the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNAs to enable protein biosynthesis. U2 and U12 spliceosomes catalyze this step by recognizing motifs on the transcript in order to remove the introns. A process which is dependent on precise definition of exon-intron borders by splice sites, which are consequently highly conserved across species. Only very few combinations of terminal dinucleotides are frequently observed at intron ends, dominated by the canonical GT-AG splice sites on the DNA level.\\n\\nHere we investigate the occurrence of diverse combinations of dinucleotides at predicted splice sites. Analyzing 121 plant genome sequences based on their annotation revealed strong splice site conservation across species, annotation errors, and true biological divergence from canonical splice sites. The frequency of non-canonical splice sites clearly correlates with their divergence from canonical ones indicating either an accumulation of probably neutral mutations, or evolution towards canonical splice sites. Strong conservation across multiple species and non-random accumulation of substitutions in splice sites indicate a functional relevance of non-canonical splice sites. The average composition of splice sites across all investigated species is 98.7% for GT-AG, 1.2% for GC-AG, 0.06% for AT-AC, and 0.09% for minor non-canonical splice sites. RNA-Seq data sets of 35 species were incorporated to validate non-canonical splice site predictions through gaps in sequencing reads alignments and to demonstrate the expression of affected genes. We conclude that bona fide non-canonical splice sites are present and appear to be functionally relevant in most plant genomes, if at low abundance.",

    "abstract": "Automated protein annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO) plays an important role in the biosciences. Evaluation has always been considered central to developing novel annotation methods, but little attention has been paid to the evaluation metrics themselves. Evaluation metrics define how well an annotation method performs and allows for them to be ranked against one another. Unfortunately, most of these metrics were adopted from the machine learning literature without establishing whether they were appropriate for GO annotations.\\n\\nWe propose a novel approach for comparing GO evaluation metrics called Artificial Dilution Series (ADS). Our approach uses existing annotation data to generate a series of annotation sets with different levels of correctness (referred to as their signal level). We calculate the evaluation metric being tested for each annotation set in the series, allowing us to identify whether it can separate different signal levels. Finally, we contrast these results with several false positive annotation sets, which are designed to expose systematic weaknesses in GO assessment.\\n\\nWe compared 37 evaluation metrics for GO annotation using ADS and identified drastic differences between metrics. We show that some metrics struggle to differentiate between different signal levels, while others give erroneously high scores to the false positive data sets. Based on our findings, we provide guidelines on which evaluation metrics perform well with the Gene Ontology and propose improvements to several well-known evaluation metrics. In general, we argue that evaluation metrics should be tested for their performance and we provide software for this purpose (https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/ads/). ADS is applicable to other areas of science where the evaluation of prediction results is non-trivial.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the biosciences, predictive methods are becoming increasingly necessary as novel sequences are generated at an ever-increasing rate. The volume of sequence data necessitates Automated Function Prediction (AFP) as manual curation is often impossible. Unfortunately, selecting the best AFP method is complicated by researchers using different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, many commonly-used metrics can give misleading results. We argue that the use of poor metrics in AFP evaluation is a result of the lack of methods to benchmark the metrics themselves. We propose an approach called Artificial Dilution Series (ADS). ADS uses existing data sets to generate multiple artificial AFP results, where each result has a controlled error rate. We use ADS to understand whether different metrics can distinguish between results with known quantities of error.

Both SOS and ROS promote bacterial mutagenesis, fueling the emergence of resistant mutants during antibiotic treatments.

We used the antioxidant molecule N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to study the contribution of ROS on the SOS response and the mutagenesis mediated by the fluoroquinolone anti-biotic ciprofloxacin (CIP). We show that NAC is able to reduce intracellular ROS levels, as well as the SOS response caused by treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of CIP, without affecting its anti-bacterial activity. This effect reduces anti-bioticinduced mutagenesis to levels comparable to a translesion synthesis DNA-polymerases deficient strain, suggesting that ROS play a major role in SOS-induced mutagenesis. Collectively, our results shed light on the mechanisms underlying antibioticinduced mutagenesis and open the possibility for the use of NAC as adjuvant in antibiotic therapy to hinder the development of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation of cytosine residues across the genome influences how genes and phenotypes are regulated in a wide range of organisms. As such, understanding the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms has become very much a part of mapping genotype to phenotype, a major question in evolutionary biology. Ideally, we would like to manipulate DNA methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale, to help us to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications play in phenotypic expression. Recently, the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; commonly used in the epigenetic treatment of certain cancers), has been deployed to explore the epigenetic regulation of a number of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists, including facultative sex allocation in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. In a recent study, we showed that treatment with 5-aza-dC did not ablate the facultative sex allocation response in Nasonia, but shifted the patterns of sex allocation in a way predicted by genomic conflict theory. This was the first (albeit indirect) experimental evidence for genomic conflict over sex allocation facilitated by DNA methylation. However, that work lacked direct evidence of the effects of 5-aza-dC on DNA methylation, and indeed the effect of the chemical has since been questioned in Nasonia. Here, using whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of more than 4 million CpGs, across more than 11,000 genes, we demonstrate unequivocally that 5-aza-dC disrupts methylation on a large scale across the Nasonia vitripennis genome. We show that the disruption can lead to both hypo- and hyper-methylation, may vary across tissues and time of sampling, and that the effects of 5-aza-dC are context- and sequence specific. We conclude that 5-aza-dC does indeed have the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in evolutionary ecology, whilst many details of its action remain to be discovered.\n\nAuthor SummaryShedding light on the mechanistic basis of phenotypes is a major aim in the field of evolutionary biology. If we understand how phenotypes are controlled at the molecular level, we can begin to understand how evolution has shaped that phenotype and conversely, how genetic architecture may constrain trait evolution. Epigenetic markers (such as DNA methylation) also influence phenotypic expression by regulating how and when genes are expressed. Recently, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a hypomethylating agent used in the treatment of certain cancers, has been used to explore the epigenetic regulation of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists. Previously, we used 5-aza-dC to validate a role for DNA methylation in facultative sex allocation behaviour in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. However, the direct effects of the chemical were not examined at that point and its efficacy in insects was questioned. Here, we demonstrate that 5-aza-dC disrupts DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale in a context- and sequence-specific manner and results in both hypo- and hyper-methylation. Our work demonstrates that 5-aza-dC has the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in phenotypic expression.",

    "abstract": "Understanding hybrid incompatibilities is a fundamental pursuit in evolutionary genetics. In crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and Drosophila simulans males, the interaction of at least three genes is necessary for hybrid male lethality: Hmr mel, Lhr sim, and gfzf sim. All three hybrid incompatibility genes are chromatin associated factors. While HMR and LHR physically bind each other and function together in a single complex, the connection between either of these proteins and gfzf remains mysterious. Here, we investigate the allele specific chromatin binding patterns of gfzf. First, our cytological analyses show that there is little difference in protein localization of GFZF between the two species except at telomeric sequences. In particular, GFZF binds the telomeric retrotransposon repeat arrays, and the differential binding of GFZF at telomeres reflects the rapid changes in sequence composition at telomeres between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Second, we investigate the patterns of GFZF and HMR co-localization and find that the two proteins do not normally co-localize in D. melanogaster. However, in inter-species hybrids, HMR shows extensive mis-localization to GFZF sites, and this altered localization requires the presence of gfzf sim. Third, we find by ChIP-Seq that over-expression of HMR and LHR within species is sufficient to cause HMR to mis-localize to GFZF binding sites, indicating that HMR has a natural low affinity for GFZF sites. Together, these studies provide the first insights into the different properties of gfzf between D. melanogaster and D. simulans as well as a molecular interaction between gfzf and Hmr in the form of altered protein localization.",

    "abstract": "Lagging chromosome is a hallmark of aneuploidy arising from errors in the kinetochore-spindle attachment in animal cells. However, kinetochore components and cellular phenotypes associated with kinetochore dysfunction are much less explored in plants. Here, we carried out a comprehensive characterization of conserved kinetochore components in the moss Physcomitrella patens and uncovered a distinct scenario in plant cells regarding both the localization and cellular impact of the kinetochore proteins. Most surprisingly, knock-down of several kinetochore proteins led to polyploidy, not aneuploidy, through cytokinesis failure in >90% of the cells that exhibited lagging chromosomes for several minutes or longer. The resultant cells, containing two or more nuclei, proceeded to the next cell cycle and eventually developed into polyploid plants. As lagging chromosomes have been observed in various plant species in the wild, our observation raised a possibility that they could be one of the natural pathways to polyploidy in plants.",

Tools have been developed for filtering possible contaminants in the sequencing data of species with known reference genome.

    "abstract": "In a stochastic process, noise often modifies the picture offered by the mean field dynamics. In particular, when there is an absorbing state, the noise erases a stable fixed point of the mean field equation from the stationary distribution, and turns it into a transient peak. We make a quantitative analysis of this effect for a simple genetic regulatory network with positive feedback, where the proteins become extinct in the presence of stochastic noise, contrary to the prediction of the deterministic rate equation that the protein number converges to a non-zero value. We show that the transient peak appears near the stable fixed point of the rate equation, and the extinction time diverges exponentially as the stochastic noise approaches zero. We also show how the baseline production from the inactive gene ameliorates the effect of the stochastic noise, and interpret the opposite effects of the noise and the baseline production in terms of the position shift of the unstable fixed point. The order of magnitude estimates using biological parameters suggest that for a real gene regulatory network, the stochastic noise is sufficiently small so that not only is the extinction time much larger than biologically relevant time-scales, but also the effect of the baseline production dominates over that of the stochastic noise, leading to the protection from the catastrophic rare event of protein extinction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene promoter methylation plays a critical role in a wide range of biological processes, such as transcriptional expression, gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, etc. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing generates a comprehensive profiling of the gene methylation levels but is limited by a high cost. Recent studies have partitioned the genes into landmark genes and target genes and suggested that the landmark gene expression levels capture adequate information to reconstruct the target gene expression levels. Moreover, the methylation level of the promoter is usually negatively correlated with its corresponding gene expression. This result inspired us to propose that the methylation level of the promoters might be adequate to reconstruct the promoter methylation level of target genes, which would eventually reduce the cost of promoter methylation profiling.\\n\\nResultsHere, we developed a deep learning model (D-GPM) to predict the whole-genome promoter methylation level based on the methylation profile of the landmark genes. We benchmarked D-GPM against three machine learning methods, namely, linear regression (LR), regression tree (RT) and support vector machine (SVM), based on two criteria: the mean absolute deviation (MAE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). After profiling the methylation beta value (MBV) dataset from the TCGA, with respect to MAE and PCC, we found that D-GPM outperforms LR by 9.59% and 4.34%, RT by 27.58% and 22.96% and SVM by 6.14% and 3.07% on average, respectively. For the number of better-predicted genes, D-GPM outperforms LR in 92.65% and 91.00%, RT in 95.66% and 98.25% and SVM in 85.49% and 81.56% of the target genes.\\n\\nConclusionsD-GPM acquires the least overall MAE and the highest overall PCC on MBV-te compared to LR, RT, and SVM. For a genewise comparative analysis, D-GPM outperforms LR, RT, and SVM in an overwhelming majority of the target genes, with respect to the MAE and PCC. Most importantly, D-GPM predominates among the other models in predicting a majority of the target genes according to the model distribution of the least MAE and the highest PCC for the target genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFat is the main substance that provides energy to animals. However, the use of fat in twin Hu lambs has not been investigated. Thirty pairs of male twin lambs were examined to investigate the effects of dietary fat on the metabolism of energy and nitrogen, ruminal fermentation, and microbial communities. The twins are randomly allotted to two groups (high fat: HF, normal fat: NF). Two diets of equal protein and different fat levels. The metabolism test was made at 50-60 days of age. Nine pairs of twin lambs are slaughtered randomly, and the rumen fluid is collected at 60 days of age.\\n\\nResultsThe initial body weight (BW) in the HF group did not differ from that of NF group (P > 0.05), but the final BW was tended to higher than that of NF group (0.05 < P < 0.1). The digestive energy (DE), metabolism energy (ME), DE/ME in the HF group tend to be higher than those in the NF group (0.05 < P < 0.1). Ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and the proportion of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) are higher than that in the NF group (P < 0.05). A high throughput sequencing analysis reveals that there were no differences between the two groups in terms of the richness estimates and diversity indices (P > 0.05). The Proteobacteria and Fibrobacteres phyla were higher than that in NF group (P<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrated that high fat diet before weaning can affect the abundance of several groups of rumen bacteria in rumen, such as significantly increasing phyla Proteobacteria and Fibrobacteres, and genera of Succinivibrio, Alloprevotella, and Saccharofermentans, but significantly decreasing genera of Clostridium IV, Dialister, Roseburia, and Butyrivibrio.

Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of single-cells.",

We engineered Drosophila PRPS (dPRPS) alleles that carry patient-derived PRPS missense mutations. Although dPRPS mutant flies develop normally, they have profound defects in autophagy induction and lysosome function. Consequently, dPRPS flies are sensitive to nutrient deprivation as they are unable to break down lipid storage by macroautophagy.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic selection accuracy increases with the use of high SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) coverage. However, such gains in coverage come at high costs, preventing their operational implementation by breeders. Low density panels imputed to higher densities offer a cheaper alternative. Our study is one of the first to explore the imputation in a tree species: black poplar. About 1000 pure-breed Populus nigra trees corresponding to a subsample of the French breeding population were selected and genotyped with a 12K custom Infinium Bead-Chip. Forty-three of those individuals corresponding mostly to nodal trees in the pedigree were fully sequenced (reference), while the remaining majority (target) was imputed from 8K to 1.4 million SNPs using FImpute. Each SNP and individual was evaluated for imputation errors by leave-one-out cross validation in the training sample of 43 sequenced trees. Some summary statistics such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium exact test p-value, quality of sequencing, depth of sequencing per site and per individual, minor allele frequency, marker density ratio or SNP information redundancy were calculated. Principal component and Boruta analyses were used on all these parameters to rank the factors affecting the quality of imputation. Additionally, we characterize the impact of the relatedness between reference population and target population.\\n\\nResultsDuring the imputation process, we used 7,540 SNPs from the chip to impute 1,438,827 SNPs from sequences along the 19 Chromosomes. At the individual level, imputation accuracy was very high with a proportion of SNPs correctly imputed between 0.84 and 0.99. The variation in accuracies was mostly due to differences in relatedness between individuals. At a SNP level, the imputation quality strongly depended on genotyped SNP density and to a lesser extent on the original minor allele frequency. The imputation did not appear to result in an increase of linkage disequilibrium. The genotype densification not only brought a better distribution of markers all along the genome, but also we did not detect any substantial bias in annotation categories.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study shows that it is possible to impute low-density marker panels to whole genome sequence with good accuracy under certain conditions that could be common to many breeding populations.",

    "abstract": "Echoviruses are the main causative agents of aseptic meningitis worldwide and are particularly devastating in the neonatal population, where they are associated with severe hepatitis, neurological disease including meningitis and encephalitis, and even death. Here, we identify the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) as a pan-echovirus receptor. We show that loss of expression of FcRn or its binding partner beta 2 microglubulin ({beta}2M) renders human brain microvascular cells resistant to infection by a panel of echoviruses at the stage of virus attachment and that a blocking antibody to {beta}2M inhibit echovirus infection in cell lines and in primary human fetal intestinal epithelial cells. We also show that expression of human, but not mouse, FcRn renders non-permissive human and mouse cells sensitive to echovirus infection and that the extracellular domain of human FcRn directly binds echoviral particles and neutralizes infection. Lastly, we show that primary cells isolated from mice that express human FcRn are highly susceptible to echovirus infection. Our findings thus identify FcRn as a pan-echovirus receptor, which may explain the enhanced susceptibility of neonates to echovirus infections.\\n\\nSignificanceEchoviruses are associated with aseptic meningitis and induce severe disease, and even death, in neonates and young infants. Here, we identify the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) as a pan-echovirus receptor. FcRn is expressed on the surface of the human placenta, and throughout life in intestinal enterocytes, liver hepatocytes, and in the microvascular endothelial cells that line the blood-brain barrier. This pattern of expression is consistent with the organ sites targeted by echoviruses in humans, with the primary entry site of infection in the intestinal tract and subsequent infection of secondary tissues including the liver and brain. These findings provide important insights into echovirus pathogenesis and may explain the enhanced susceptibility of infants and neonates to echovirus-induced disease.",

We here characterize an immunity pathway providing long-term antiviral protection and define how this pathway discriminates between self and non-self. Mosquitoes use viral RNAs to create viral derived cDNAs (vDNAs) central to the antiviral response. vDNA molecules are acquired through a process of reverse-transcription and recombination directed by endogenous retrotransposons. These vDNAs are thought to integrate in the host genome as endogenous viral elements (EVEs). Sequencing of pre-integrated vDNA revealed that the acquisition process exquisitely distinguishes viral from host RNA, providing one layer of self-nonself discrimination. Importantly, we show EVE-derived piRNAs have antiviral activity and are loaded onto Piwi4 to inhibit virus replication. In a second layer of self-non-self discrimination, Piwi4 preferentially loads EVE-derived piRNAs, discriminating against transposon-targeting piRNAs. Our findings define a fundamental virus-specific immunity pathway in mosquitoes that uses EVEs as a potent and specific antiviral transgenerational mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Commonly used antibiotics exert their effect predominantly on rapidly growing bacterial cells, yet growth dynamics taking place during infection in a complex host environment remain largely unknown. Hence, means to measure in situ bacterial growth rate is essential to predict the outcome of antibacterial treatment. We have recently validated chromosome replication as readout for in situ bacterial growth rate during Escherichia coli infection in the mouse peritonitis model. By the use of two complementary methods (qPCR and fluorescence microscopy) for differential genome origin and terminus copy number quantification, we demonstrated the ability to track bacterial growth rate, both on a population average and on a single-cell level; from one single biological specimen. Here, we asked whether the in situ growth rate could predict antibiotic treatment effect during infection in the same model. Parallel in vitro growth experiments were conducted as proof-of-concept. Our data demonstrate that the activity of commonly used antibiotics Ceftriaxone and Gentamicin correlated with pre-treatment bacterial growth rate; both drugs performing better during rapid growth than during slow growth. Conversely, Ciprofloxacin was less sensitive to bacterial growth rate, both in a homogenous in vitro bacterial population and in a more heterogeneous in vivo bacterial population. The method serves as a platform to test any antibiotics dependency upon active in situ bacterial growth. Improved insight into this relationship in vivo could ultimately prove helpful in evaluating future antibacterial strategies.\\n\\nImportanceMost antibiotics in clinical use exert their effect predominantly on rapidly growing bacterial cells, yet there is a lack of insight into bacterial growth dynamics taking place during infection in vivo. We have applied inexpensive and easily accessible methods for extraction of in situ bacterial growth rate from bacterial chromosome replication during experimental murine infection. This approach not only allows for a better understanding of bacterial growth dynamics taking place during the course of infection, but also serves as a platform to test the activity of different antibiotics as a function of pre-treatment in situ growth rate. The method has the advantage that bacterial growth rate can be probed from a single biological sample, with the potential for extension into clinical use in pre-treatment infected biological specimens. A better understanding of commonly used antibiotics level of dependency upon bacterial growth, combined with measurements of in situ bacterial growth rate in infected clinical specimens, could prove helpful in evaluating future antibacterial treatment regimens.",

Proteostatic defects triggered by >600 NPC1 variants found in the human population inhibit export of NPC1 protein from ER or function in downstream LE/Ly, leading to accumulation of cholesterol and rapid onset neurodegeneration in childhood for most patients. We now show that chemical allosteric inhibitors, such as JG98, targeting the cytosolic Hsp70 chaperone/co-chaperone complex improves the trafficking and stability of NPC1 variants with diverse NPC1 genotypes. By exploiting the knowledge-base of NPC1 variants found in the world-wide patient population using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP), a Gaussian-process based machine learning (ML) approach, we show how the Hsp70 chaperone system alters the spatial covariance (SCV) tolerance of the ER and the SCV set-points for each residue of the NPC1 polypeptide chain differentially to improve trafficking efficiency and post-ER stability for variants distributed across the entire NPC1 polypeptide. The impact of JG98 is supported by the observation that silencing of Hsp70 specific nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) (BCL-anthogene (BAG) family) co-chaperones significantly improve the folding status of NPC1 variants. Together, these studies suggest that targeting the cytosolic Hsp70 system to adjust the SCV tolerance of the proteostasis network can improve recognition of the plasticity of the NPC1 fold found in the disease population for trafficking to the LE/Ly compartments.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no effective therapies for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive and highly metastatic disease. Activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (Mnk1/2) play a critical role in the development, progression and metastasis of TNBC. Herein, we undertook a comprehensive study to evaluate the activity of a first-in-class Mnk1/2 protein degraders, in clinically relevant models of TNBC. These studies enabled us to identify racemic VNLG-152R as the most efficacious Mnk1/2 degrader. By targeting Mnk1/2 protein degradation (activity), VNLG-152R potently inhibited both Mnk-eIF4E and mTORC1 signaling pathways and strongly regulated downstream factors involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines secretion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Most importantly, orally bioavailable VNLG-152R exhibited remarkable antitumor and antimetastatic activities against cell line and patient-derived TNBC xenograft models, with no apparent host toxicity. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that targeting Mnk-eIF4E/mTORC1 signaling with a potent Mnk1/2 degrader, VNLG-152R, is a novel therapeutic strategy that can be developed as monotherapy for effective treatment of patients with primary/metastatic TNBC.",

However, less is known about the role of mitochondria in axon development and maturation. Here we find that in maturing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vivo, axonal mitochondria increase in size, number, and total area throughout development. We demonstrate through multiple approaches in vivo that the mechanism underlying these mitochondrial changes are dependent on eye opening and associated neuronal activity, which can be mimicked by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We report downstream gene and protein expression changes consistent with mitochondrial biogenesis and energetics pathways, and present evidence that the associated transcripts are localized and translated at mitochondria within axons in an activity-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the forebrain is the source of neurogenic stem/precursor cells for adaptive and homeostatic needs throughout the life of most mammals. Here, we report that Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) plays a critical role in the establishment of the V-SVZ at early neonatal stages by controlling the proliferation of distinct subpopulations of stem/precursor cells. Conditional deletion of Sufu in radial glial progenitor cells (RGCs) at E13.5 resulted in a dramatic increase in the proliferation of Sox2+ Type B cells, as well as Gsx2+ ventral forebrain derived transit amplifying precursor cells (TACs). In contrast, we found a significant decrease in Tbr2+ dorsal forebrain derived TACs indicating that innate differences between dorsal and ventral forebrain derived Type B cells influence Sufu function. However, most precursors failed to survive and accumulated in the dorsal V-SVZ, demonstrating that precursors are unable to transition into functional differentiated progenies. These defects were accompanied by reduced Gli3 expression, yet despite reduced Gli3 levels, activation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling did not occur implying that the Sufu-Gli3 regulatory axis may influence other signaling pathways in the neonatal dorsal V-SVZ. These data suggest that Sufu plays a critical role in controlling Gli3 function in the establishment and survival of functional stem/precursor cells in the postnatal dorsal V-SVZ.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTConditional deletion of Sufu cause dramatic expansion of neural stem/precursor cells in the neonatal ventricular-subventricular (SVZ) zone.

    "abstract": "Major depression is a debilitating psychiatric illness that is typically associated with low mood, anhedonia and a range of comorbidities. Depression has a heritable component that has remained difficult to elucidate with current sample sizes due to the polygenic nature of the disorder. To maximise sample size, we meta-analysed data on 807,553 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls) from the three largest genome-wide association studies of depression. We identified 102 independent variants, 269 genes, and 15 gene-sets associated with depression, including both genes and gene-pathways associated with synaptic structure and neurotransmission. Further evidence of the importance of prefrontal brain regions in depression was provided by an enrichment analysis. In an independent replication sample of 1,306,354 individuals (414,055 cases and 892,299 controls), 87 of the 102 associated variants were significant following multiple testing correction. Based on the putative genes associated with depression this work also highlights several potential drug repositioning opportunities. These findings advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of depression and provide several future avenues for understanding aetiology and developing new treatment approaches.",

    "abstract": "Tandem repeats (TRs) can cause disease through their length, sequence motif interruptions, and nucleotide modifications. For many TRs, however, these features are very difficult - if not impossible - to assess, requiring low-throughput and labor-intensive assays. One example is a VNTR in ABCA7 for which we recently discovered that expanded alleles strongly increase risk of Alzheimers disease. Here, we investigated the potential of long-read whole genome sequencing to surmount these challenges, using the high-throughput PromethION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. To overcome the limitations of conventional base calling and alignment, we developed an algorithm to study the TR size and sequence directly on raw PromethION current data.\\n\\nWe report the long-read sequencing of multiple human genomes (n = 11) using only a single sequencing run and flow cell per individual. With the use of fresh DNA extractions, DNA shearing to approximately 20kb and size selection, we obtained an average output of 70 gigabases (Gb) per flow cell, corresponding to a 21x genome coverage, and a maximum yield of 98 Gb (30x genome coverage). All ABCA7 VNTR alleles, including expansions up to 10,000 bases, were spanned by long sequencing reads, validated by Southern blotting. Classical approaches of TR length estimation suffered from low accuracy, low precision, DNA strand effects and/or inability to call pathogenic repeat expansions. In contrast, our novel NanoSatellite algorithm, which circumvents base calling by using dynamic time warping on raw PromethION current data, achieved more than 90% accuracy and high precision (5.6% relative standard deviation) of TR length estimation, and detected all clinically relevant repeat expansions. In addition, we identified alternative TR sequence motifs with high consistency, allowing determination of TR sequence and distinction of VNTR alleles with homozygous length.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we validated the robustness of single-experiment whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, a prerequisite for application of long-read sequencing in the clinic. In addition, we outperformed Southern blotting, enabling improved characterization of the role of expanded ABCA7 VNTR alleles in Alzheimers disease, and opening new opportunities for TR research.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting from a complex interplay between genetics and environment. Impairments in the basic neuronal process of axonal transport have been identified in several ALS models. However, in vivo evidence of early/pre-symptomatic deficiencies in neuronal cargo trafficking remains limited, thus the pathogenic importance of axonal transport to the ALS disease spectrum remains to be fully resolved. We therefore analysed the in vivo dynamics of retrogradely transported, neurotrophin-containing signalling endosomes in motor neuron axons of two new mouse models of ALS that have mutations in different RNA processing genes (Tardbp and Fus). TDP-43M337V mice, which show neuromuscular pathology but no overt motor neuron loss, displayed in vivo perturbations in axonal transport that manifested between 1.5 and 3 months and preceded motor symptom onset. In contrast, signalling endosome transport remained largely unaffected in mutant Fus{Delta}14/+ mice, despite 20% motor neuron loss. These findings indicate that deficiencies in retrograde neurotrophin signalling and axonal transport are not common to all ALS-linked genes, and that there are inherent and mechanistic distinctions in the pathogenesis of ALS caused by mutations in different RNA processing genes.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides are considered to be the cause of neuronal and synaptic cell death in Alzheimers disease (AD) since approximately 100 years. To date, it is assumed that A{beta}-peptides arise from the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, within the APP gene, a nested gene called ALZheimer ASsociated (ALZAS) exists, which includes the entire A{beta}42-sequence and thus may also be the origin of various A{beta}-species. Here, we firstly confirmed expression and the postulated amino acid sequence of ALZAS and revealed the binding of selected monoclonal A{beta}-antibodies to A{beta}- and ALZAS protein. We confirmed the specificity of the anti-ALZAS antibody to ALZAS by protein sequence analysis. This anti-ALZAS antibody detects the same amino acid sequence as the autoantibody found in human blood of AD patients. Since no detailed data are currently available concerning ALZAS expression and the amount, localization and function of ALZAS protein in human cells and tissue, we performed gene (over)expression experiments on transcriptional and translational level. We verified a considerably lower mRNA amount of ALZAS compared to the host gene APP. Nevertheless, ALZAS transcription and translation seems to be heavily regulated in different human tissues and cells. Artificially increased mRNA levels of ALZAS did not led to an enhanced protein amount or considerable increase in cell death. Notably, cell localization of the ALZAS protein showed accordance to endosomes indicating that ALZAS, which contains the whole transmembrane domain of APP, might be a peripheral membrane protein. Since endosome dysfunctions are a characteristic event in early stages of AD and the highest ALZAS-autoantibody levels were already detected in early AD stages, ALZAS might play a crucial role in AD pathology and could possibly be a further diagnostic marker.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells divide and differentiate to form all the specialized cell types in a multicellular organism. In the Arabidopsis root, stem cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state by a less mitotically active population of cells called the Quiescent Center (QC). Determining how the QC regulates the surrounding stem cell initials, or what makes the QC fundamentally different from the actively dividing initials, is important for understanding how stem cell divisions are maintained. Here, we gained insight into the differences between the QC and the Cortex Endodermis Initials (CEI) by studying the mobile transcription factor SHORTROOT (SHR) and its binding partner SCARECROW (SCR). We constructed an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model of SHR and SCR in the QC and CEI which incorporated the stoichiometry of the SHR-SCR complex as well as upstream transcriptional regulation of SHR and SCR. Our model prediction coupled with experimental validation showed that high levels of the SHR-SCR complex is associated with more CEI division but less QC division. Further, our model prediction allowed us to establish the timing of QC and CEI division and propose that SHR repression of QC division depends on the formation of SHR homodimer. Thus, our results support that SHR-SCR protein complex stoichiometry and regulation of SHR transcription modulate the division timing of two different specialized cell types in the root stem cell niche.",

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of HFS on pupil dilation and brain responses elicited by pinprick stimulation delivered in the area of increased pinprick sensitivity. In fourteen healthy volunteers HFS was applied to one of the two forearms. Before and twenty minutes after applying HFS, mechanical pinprick stimuli (64 mN and 96 mN) were delivered to the area surrounding the site at which HFS was applied as well as the contralateral control arm. During pinprick stimulation both the pupil size and electroencephalogram were recorded. HFS induced a clear and comparable increase in pinprick sensitivity for both the 64 and 96 mN stimulation intensity. Both pinprick stimulation intensities elicited a greater pupil dilation response when delivered to the area of increased pinprick sensitivity. However, this greater pupil dilation response was larger for the 64 mN compared to the 96 mN stimulation intensity. A similar pattern was observed for the negative wave of the pinprick-evoked brain potentials (PEPs), however, the increase was not significant for the 96 mN and showed only a trend towards significance for the 64 mN. These results show that there is a correspondence between the increase in pupil dilation and the increase in PEPs, but that pupil size is a more sensitive measure for detecting the effects of central sensitization than PEPs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe D3 receptor (D3R) has emerged as a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of several diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease, and substance use disorders. However, studies investigating the modulatory impact of D3R antagonism on dopamine neurotransmission or the effects drugs of abuse have produced mixed results, in part because D3R-targeted compounds often also interact with D2 receptors (D2R). The purpose of this study was to compare the consequences of selective D2R or D3R antagonism on the behavioral effects of cocaine in mice, and to identify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying their modulatory effects.\\n\\nMethodsWe characterized the effects of selective D2R or D3R antagonism in mice on 1) basal and cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 2) presynaptic dopamine release and clearance in the nucleus accumbens using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry, and 3) dopamine-mediated signaling in D1-expressing and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons using ex vivo electrophysiology.\\n\\nResultsPretreatment with the selective D2R antagonist L-741,626 attenuated, while pretreatment with the selective D3R antagonist PG01037 enhanced, the locomotor-activating effects of acute and repeated cocaine administration. While both antagonists potentiated cocaine-induced increases in presynaptic DA release, D3R blockade uniquely facilitated DA-mediated excitation of D1-expressing medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens.\\n\\nConclusionsSelective D3R antagonism potentiates the behavioral-stimulant effects of cocaine in mice, an effect that is in direct opposition to that produced by selective D2R antagonism or nonselective D2-like receptor antagonists, likely by facilitating D1-mediated excitation in the nucleus accumbens. These findings provide important insights into the neuropharmacological actions of D3R antagonists on mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between the diffusion-weighted MRI signal and the arrangement of white matter fibers is fundamental for accurate voxel-wise reconstruction of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) and subsequent fiber tractography. Spherical deconvolution reconstruction techniques model the diffusion signal as the convolution of the FOD with a response function which represents the signal profile of a single fiber orientation. Thus, given the signal and a fiber response function, the FOD can be estimated in every imaging voxel by deconvolution. However, the selection of the appropriate response function remains relatively un-studied, and requires further validation. In this work, using 3D histologically-defined FODs and the corresponding diffusion signal from three ex vivo squirrel monkey brains, we derive the ground truth response functions. We find that the histologically-derived response functions differ from those conventionally used. Next, we find that response functions statistically vary across brain regions, which suggests that the practice of using the same kernel throughout the brain is not optimal. Additionally, response functions vary significantly across subjects. We show that different kernels lead to different FOD reconstructions, which in turn can lead to different tractography results depending on algorithmic parameters, with large variations in the accuracy of resulting reconstructions. Together, this suggests that there is room for improvement in estimating and understanding the relationship between the diffusion signal and the underlying FOD.",

    "abstract": "Syntax is the engine that allows us to create an infinitude of linguistic expressions, and the construction of syntactic structures, such as noun phrases and verb phrases, is considered a fundamental component of language processing. Nevertheless, insights concerning the neurobiological basis of syntax have remained elusive, in part because it is difficult to isolate syntax from semantic composition. Consequently, many studies of syntax have relied on meaningless artificial stimuli, such as jabberwocky expressions or artificial grammars. However, while pure manipulations of syntax are challenging to design, natural language grammars do have a sparse set of constructions presenting this possibility. Here we examined one such case, English post-nominal adjectives (mountain TALL enough for a strenuous hike), which were contrasted with semantically parallel but structurally simpler noun-adjective sequences in an MEG experiment. We observed a sharp activity increase in the left posterior temporal lobe (PTL) when syntactic composition was more straightforward, approximately 200 ms after adjective onset. The semantic fit between the noun and adjective was also varied, but this affected anterior temporal cortex, consistent with prior work. These findings offer a unique demonstration of the relevance of posterior temporal cortex for syntactic processing in natural language. We also present connectivity evidence that the syntax-related PTL responses were relayed to ipsilateral inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions. The combined results draw an initial picture of the rapid spatio-temporal dynamics of the syntactic and semantic composition network in sentence processing.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system predicts the consequences of motor commands by leaning multiple internal models of external perturbations and of the body. It is not well understood, however, how new internal models are created. Here, we propose a novel computational model of motor adaptation in which a stochastic Bayesian decision-making process determines whether i) a previously updated expert perturbation model is recalled and updated, ii) a novice model is selected and is updated into a new expert, or iii) the \\\"body\\\" model is updated. Results from computer simulations provide insights into various and contradictory experimental data on savings and error-clamp, and predicts qualitative individual differences in adaptation. We verified these predictions in a visuomotor adaptation experiment in which we varied the perturbation amplitudes as well as the amount of noise added to perturbation, and added \\\"trigger\\\" trials in the error-clamp condition. Single trigger trials led to largely qualitatively different behavior and can therefore be used to probe individual differences in memory updates between \\\"one-model\\\" and \\\"two-model\\\" learners. \\\"One-model\\\" learners continuously update the body model, showing no savings during re-adaptation to the perturbation, and gradual decay during error clamp. In contrast, \\\"two-model\\\" learners switch between an updated expert model and the body model, showing large savings during re-adaptation and stochastic lags during error clamp. Our results thus support the view that motor adaptation belongs to the general class of human learning according to which new memories are created when no existing memories can account for discontinuities in sensory data.\\n\\nShort summary/significanceWhen movements are followed by unexpected outcomes, such as following the introduction of a visuomotor or force field perturbation, or the sudden removal of such perturbations, it is unclear whether the central nervous system updates existing memories or creates new memories. Here, we propose a novel model of adaptation, and investigate, via simulation and behavioral experiments, how the amplitude and schedule of the perturbation, as well as the characteristics of the learner, lead to updates of existing memories or creation of new memories. Our results provide insights into a number of puzzling and contradictory experimental data on savings and error-clamp, as well as large qualitative individual differences in adaptation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental organizing principle in the somatosensory and motor systems is somatotopy, where specific body parts are represented separately and adjacently to other body parts, resulting in a body map. Different terminals of the sensorimotor network show varied somatotopic layouts, in which the relative position, distance and overlap between body-part representations differ. Since somatotopy is best characterized in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, these terminals have been the main focus of research on somatotopic remapping following loss of sensory input (e.g. arm amputation). Cortical remapping is generally considered to be driven by the layout of the underlying somatotopy, such that neighboring body-part representations tend to activate the deprived brain region. Here, we challenge the assumption that somatotopic layout restricts remapping, by comparing patterns of remapping in humans born without one hand (hereafter, one-handers, n=26) across multiple terminals of the sensorimotor pathway. We first report that in the cerebellum of one-handers, the deprived hand region represents multiple body parts. Importantly, the representations of some of these body parts do not neighbor the deprived hand region. We further replicate our previous finding, showing a similar pattern of remapping in the deprived hand region of the cerebral cortex in one-handers. Finally, we report preliminary results of a similar remapping pattern in the putamen of one-handers. Since these three sensorimotor terminals (cerebellum, cerebrum, putamen) contain different somatotopic layouts, the parallel remapping they undergo demonstrates that the mere spatial layout of body-part representations may not exclusively dictate remapping in the sensorimotor systems.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhen a hand is missing, the brain region that typically processes information from that hand may instead process information from other body-parts, a phenomenon termed remapping. It is commonly thought that only body-parts whose information is processed in regions neighboring the hand region could \\\"take up\\\" the resources of this now deprived region. Here we demonstrate that information from multiple body-parts is processed in the hand regions of both the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The native brain regions of these body-parts have varying levels of overlap with the hand region across multiple terminals in the sensorimotor hierarchy, and do not necessarily neighbor the hand region. We therefore propose that proximity between brain regions does not limit brain remapping.",
