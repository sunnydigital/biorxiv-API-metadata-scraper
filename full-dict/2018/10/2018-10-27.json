    "abstract": "Predictive models of signaling networks are essential tools for understanding cell population heterogeneity and designing rational interventions in disease. However, using network models to predict signaling dynamics heterogeneity is often challenging due to the extensive variability of signaling parameters across cell populations. Here, we describe a Maximum Entropy-based fRamework for Inference of heterogeneity in Dynamics of sIgAling Networks (MERIDIAN). MERIDIAN allows us to estimate the joint probability distribution over signaling parameters that is consistent with experimentally observed cell-to-cell variability in abundances of network species. We apply the developed approach to investigate the heterogeneity in the signaling network activated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leading to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Using the inferred parameter distribution, we also predict heterogeneity of phosphorylated Akt levels and the distribution of EGF receptor abundance hours after EGF stimulation. We discuss how MERIDIAN can be generalized and applied to problems beyond modeling of heterogeneous signaling dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In group living animals, behavioural interactions with conspecifics strongly modulate an individuals physiological stress response. Stable social relationships may reduce an individuals stress response, which in turn can affect the immune system and health. Ultimately, positive health effects of stable social bonds may contribute to maintain group living. We investigated whether, in cooperatively breeding carrion crows (Corvus corone), the quality of social relationships correlates with coccidian oocyst and nematode eggs excretion. We repeatably collected behavioural data on dyadic social interactions and individual droppings to quantify parasite eggs and oocysts from 36 individuals in a captive population of carrion crows in northern Spain. Individuals with strong social bonds, living with more relatives and in larger groups excreted a significantly smaller proportion of droppings containing coccidian oocysts. The probability to excrete droppings containing nematode eggs was not affected by social factors. The relationship between social interactions and coccidian oocyst excretion is consistent with the idea that high quality social relationships can positively affects individuals health, setting the stage for the evolution of stable social living.",

    "abstract": "Mind wandering represents the human capacity for internally focussed thought, and relies upon the brains default network and its interactions with attentional networks. Studies have characterised mind wandering in healthy people, yet there is limited understanding of how this capacity is affected in clinical populations. This study used a validated thought-sampling task to probe mind wandering capacity in two neurodegenerative disorders: behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD; n=35) and Alzheimers disease (AD; n=24), compared to older controls (n=37). These patient groups were selected due to canonical structural and functional changes across sites of the default and frontoparietal networks, and well-defined impairments in cognitive processes that support mind wandering. Relative to controls, bvFTD patients displayed significantly reduced mind wandering capacity, offset by a significant increase in stimulus-bound thought. In contrast, AD patients demonstrated comparable levels of mind wandering to controls, in the context of a relatively subtle shift towards stimulus-/task-related forms of thought. In the patient groups, mind wandering was associated with grey matter integrity in the hippocampus/parahippocampus, striatum, insula and orbitofrontal cortex. Resting state functional connectivity revealed associations between mind wandering capacity and connectivity within and between regions of the frontoparietal and default networks, with distinct patterns evident in patients vs. controls. These findings support a relationship between altered mind wandering capacity in neurodegenerative disorders, and structural and functional integrity of the default and frontoparietal networks. This study highlights a dimension of cognitive dysfunction not well documented in neurodegenerative disorders, and validates current models of mind wandering in a clinical population.\\n\\nSignificance statementHumans spend much of their waking life engaged in mind wandering. Underlying brain systems supporting this complex ability have been established in healthy individuals, yet it remains unclear how mind wandering is altered in neuropsychiatric populations. We reveal changes in the thought profiles elicited during periods of low cognitive demand in dementia, resulting in reduced mind wandering and an increased propensity towards stimulus-bound thought. These altered thought profiles were associated with structural and functional brain changes in the hippocampus, default and frontoparietal networks; key regions implicated in internal mentation in healthy individuals. Our findings provide a unique clinical validation of current theoretical models of mind wandering, and reveal a dimension of cognitive dysfunction that has received scant attention in dementia.",

Several species are used in the food, biotechnology, and drug industries (e.g., Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium camemberti), while others are dangerous human and plant pathogens (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium digitatum). To infer a robust phylogeny and pinpoint poorly resolved branches and their likely underlying contributors, we used 81 genomes spanning the diversity of Aspergillus and Penicillium to construct a 1,668-gene data matrix. Phylogenies of the nucleotide and amino acid versions of this full data matrix as well as of five additional 834-gene data matrices constructed by subsampling the top 50% of genes according to different criteria associated with strong phylogenetic signal were generated using three different maximum likelihood schemes (i.e., gene-partitioned, unpartitioned, and coalescence). Examination of the topological agreement among these 36 phylogenies and measures of internode certainty identified 12 / 78 (15.4%) bipartitions that were incongruent and pinpoint the likely underlying contributing factors (incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization or introgression, and reconstruction artifacts associated with poor taxon sampling). Relaxed molecular clock analyses suggest that Aspergillaceae likely originated in the lower Cretaceous and the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera in the upper Cretaceous. Our results shed light on the ongoing debate on Aspergillus systematics and taxonomy and provide a robust evolutionary and temporal framework for comparative genomic analyses in Aspergillaceae. More broadly, our approach provides a general template for phylogenomic identification of resolved and contentious branches in densely genome-sequenced lineages across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs in wild populations. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS: individuals have either yellow/orange or white wings. Here we map the genetic basis of the ALHS switch in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find morph-specific specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. These findings characterize a novel mechanism for a female-limited ALHS and show that the switch arises via recruitment of a transcription factor previously known for its function in cell fate determination in pigment cells of the retina.",

Without continued practice the level of skill performance quickly degrades, posing a problem for the timely utilization of skilled motor responses. Here we quantified the recurring development of vocal motor skills and the accompanying changes in synaptic connectivity in the brain of a songbird, while manipulating skill performance by consecutively administrating and withdrawing testosterone. We demonstrate that a songbird with prior singing experience can significantly accelerate the re-acquisition of vocal performance. We further demonstrate that an increase in vocal performance is accompanied by a pronounced synaptic pruning in the forebrain vocal motor area HVC, a reduction that is not reversed when birds stop singing. These results provide evidence that lasting synaptic changes in the motor circuitry are associated with the savings of motor skills, enabling a rapid recovery of motor performance under environmental time constraints.",

    "abstract": "The plasticity of developing tissues relies on the adjustment of cell survival and growth rate to environmental cues. This includes the effect of mechanical cues on cell survival. Accordingly, compaction of an epithelium can lead to cell extrusion and cell death. This process was proposed to contribute to tissue homeostasis but also to facilitate the expansion of pretumoral cells through the compaction and elimination of the neighbouring healthy cells. However we know very little about the pathways than can trigger apoptosis upon tissue deformation and the contribution of compaction driven death to clone expansion was never assessed in vivo. Using the Drosophila pupal notum and a new live sensor of ERK, we show that tissue compaction induces cell elimination through the downregulation of EGFR/ERK pathway and the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Hid. Those results suggest that the sensitivity of EGFR/ERK pathway to mechanics could play a more general role in the fine tuning of cell elimination during morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Secondly, we assessed in vivo the contribution of compaction driven death to pretumoral cell expansion. We found that the activation of the oncogene Ras in clones can also downregulate ERK and activate apoptosis in the neighbouring cells through their compaction, which contributes to Ras clone expansion. The mechanical modulation of EGFR/ERK during growth-mediated competition for space may contribute to tumour progression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMammalian motor circuits display remarkable cellular diversity with hundreds of motor neuron (MN) subtypes innervating hundreds of different muscles. Extensive research on limb muscle-innervating MNs has begun to elucidate the genetic programs that control animal locomotion. In striking contrast, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of axial muscle-innervating MNs, which control breathing and spinal alignment, are poorly studied.\\n\\nMethodsOur previous studies indicated that the function of the Collier/Olf/Ebf (COE) family of transcription factors (TFs) in axial MN development may be conserved from nematodes to simple chordates. Here, we examine the expression pattern of all four mouse COE family members (mEbf1-mEbf4) in spinal MNs and employ genetic approaches in both nematodes and mice to investigate their function in axial MN development.\\n\\nResultsWe report that mEbf1 and mEbf2 are expressed in distinct MN clusters (termed \\\"columns\\\") that innervate different axial muscles. Mouse Ebf1 is expressed in MNs of the hypaxial motor column (HMC), which is necessary for breathing, while mEbf2 is expressed in MNs of the medial motor column (MMC) that control spinal alignment. Our characterization of Ebf2 knock-out mice revealed a requirement for Ebf2 in the differentiation of a subset of MMC MNs, indicating molecular diversity within MMC neurons. Intriguingly, transgenic expression of mEbf1 or mEbf2 can rescue axial MN differentiation and locomotory defects in nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) lacking unc-3, the sole C. elegans ortholog of the COE family, suggesting functional conservation among mEbf1, mEbf2 and nematode UNC-3.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings support the hypothesis that the genetic programs controlling axial MN development are deeply conserved across species, and further advance our understanding of such programs by revealing an essential role for Ebf2 in mouse axial MNs. Because human mutations in COE ortholgs lead to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor developmental delay, our findings may advance our understanding of these human conditions.",

The establishment and maintenance of quiescent NSC pools during development is not understood. Here we show that Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) controls establishment of the quiescent NSC pool during mouse dentate gyrus (DG) development through regulation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Deletion of Sufuin NSCs at the beginning of DG development decreases Shh signaling leading to reduced proliferation of NSCs, resulting in a small quiescent NSC pool in adult mice. We found that putative adult NSCs proliferate and increase their numbers in the first postnatal week and subsequently become quiescent towards the end of the first postnatal week. In the absence of Sufu, postnatal expansion of NSCs is compromised, and NSCs prematurely become quiescent. Thus, Sufu is required for Shh signaling activity ensuring the expansion and proper transition of NSC pools to quiescence during DG development.",

We developed a deep-tissue super-resolution imaging tool suitable for single-molecule localization in intact adult Drosophila brain, and focused on the axonal protein allocation in mushroom body (MB), a central neuronal structure involved in olfactory memory formation. We found that insufficient training suppresses LTM formation by inducing the synthesis of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) proteins within a dorsal paired medial (DPM) neuron, which innervates all axonal lobes of the MB. Surprisingly, using our localization microscopy, we found that these learning-induced proteins are distributed only in a subset of DPM axons in specific sectors along the MB lobes. This neural architecture suggests that sector-specific modulation of neural activity from MB neurons gates consolidation of early transient memory into LTM.",

    "abstract": "Motor proteins are nanoscale machines that convert the energy of ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical motion of walking along cytoskeletal filaments. In doing so, they transport organelles and help maintain sub-cellular organization. We previously developed a DNA origami-based calibration approach to extract protein copy number from super-resolution images. Using this approach, we show here that the retrograde motor protein dynein is mostly present as a single motor in the cytosol, whereas a small population of dynein along the microtubule cytoskeleton forms higher-order multimers organized into nano-sized domains. We further demonstrate, using dynein as a test sample, that the DNA origami-based calibration data we previously generated can be extended to super-resolution images taken under different experimental conditions, enabling the quantification of any GFP-fused protein of interest. Our results have implications for motor coordination during intracellular trafficking as well as for using super-resolution as a quantitative method to determine protein copy number at the nanoscale level.",

    "abstract": "Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most widespread, sexually transmitted pathogens. The infection involves a morphological switch from a free-swimming pyriform trophozoite to an amoeboid cell upon adhesion to host epithelial cells. While details on how the switch is induced and to what proteins of the host surface the parasite adheres remain poorly characterized, several surface proteins of the parasite itself have been identified as potential candidates. Among those are two expanded protein families that harbor domains that share similarity to functionally investigated surface proteins of prokaryotic oral pathogens; these are the BspA proteins of Bacteroidales and Spirochaetales, and the Pmp proteins of Chlamydiales. We sequenced the transcriptomes of five Trichomonads and screened for the presence of BspA and Pmp domain-containing proteins and tested the ability of individual T. vaginalis candidates to mediate adhesion. Here we demonstrate that (i) BspA and Pmp domain-containing proteins are specifically expanded in T. vaginalis in comparison to other Trichomonads, and that (ii) individual proteins of both families have the ability to increase adhesion performance in a non-virulent T. vaginalis strain and Tetratrichomonas gallinarum, a parasite usually known to infect birds but not humans. Our results initiate the functional characterization of these two broadly distributed protein families, whose origin we trace back to the origin of Trichomonads themselves.",
