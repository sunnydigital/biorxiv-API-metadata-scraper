    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a recently re-discovered class of non-coding RNAs functioning as sponge for miRNAs and proteins, affecting RNA splicing and regulating transcription. CircRNAs are generated by \\\"back-splicing\\\", linking covalently 3- and 5-ends of exons. Thus, circRNA levels might be deregulated in conditions associated to altered RNA-splicing. Indeed, increasing evidence indicates their role in human diseases. Specifically, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder caused by expanded CTG-repeats in the DMPK gene, resulting in abnormal mRNA-splicing. In this investigation, circRNAs expressed in DM1 skeletal muscles were identified by analyzing RNA-sequencing data-sets followed by qPCR validation. In muscle biopsies, out of 9 tested, 4 transcripts showed an increased circular fraction: CDYL, HIPK3, RTN4_03 and ZNF609. The circular fraction values correlated positively with skeletal muscle strength and Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curves showed that these four circRNAs allow to distinguish DM1 patients from controls. The identified circRNAs were also detectable in peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMCs) and plasma of DM1 patients, but they were not regulated significantly, indicating a tissue-selectivity of the identified modulations. Finally, increased circular fractions of RTN4_03 and ZNF609 were also observed in differentiated myogenic cell lines derived from DM1 patients.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this proof-of-principle study identified circRNA dysregulation in DM1 patients.",

    "abstract": "Increasing human population size and the concomitant expansion of urbanisation significantly impact natural ecosystems and native fauna globally. Successful conservation management relies on precise information on the factors associated with wildlife population decline, which are challenging to acquire from natural populations.

However, few researchers have conducted large-scale longitudinal studies, with most focussing on narrow taxonomic ranges, suggesting that WRC-associated data remains an underutilised resource, and may provide a fuller understanding of the anthropogenic threats facing native fauna.\\n\\nWe analysed admissions and outcomes data from a WRC in Queensland, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, to determine the major factors driving admissions and morbidity of native animals in a region experiencing rapid and prolonged urban expansion.\\n\\nWe studied 31,626 admissions of 83 different species of native birds, reptiles, amphibians, marsupials and eutherian mammals from 2006 to 2017.

    "abstract": "IntroductionRecent HIV key populations (KP) surveillance studies in South Africa, including female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM), demonstrate the disproportionate burden of HIV they bear compared to the general population. The national response for KP has lagged due to relatively scarce KP data focused narrowly on urban areas. We adopted a participatory data triangulation approach with stakeholders to overcome the challenges of KP program planning in KP data-scarce districts. Here we describe our methodology for achieving consensus on population size estimates (PSE) and treatment cascade indicator estimates derived from FSW and MSM surveillance data and applied across the country.\\n\\nMethodsThe South African National AIDS Council (SANAC) convened the group; technical advisors from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) facilitated; and stakeholders from government, non-government, academic, and KP-led advocacy organizations involved in program implementation and research provided input through three in-person meetings covering four phases of work: surveillance data analysis; cascades data extraction; presentation for feedback; and data extrapolation.\\n\\nResultsTechnical advisors presented eight cascades (three FSW, five MSM) to stakeholders, recommending data-informed extrapolation factors for each population. Stakeholders adopted recommendations by consensus with few adjustments. FSW cascades displayed high awareness of HIV status and steep breakpoints towards ART uptake; MSM cascades displayed less HIV status awareness, but relatively good ART uptake, with metropolitan areas displaying better uptake than rural districts.\\n\\nConclusionThe participatory process enabled KP stakeholders to vet disparate data sources against programmatic experience and recommend consistency in cascades data; participatory triangulation of additional surveillance and program data will follow. The considerable time and resource investments in this process had downstream benefits, including consistency in sub-national HIV implementation plans. We recommend this consensus-based approach as a transparent, consistent, and sound methodology for cascades construction in KP data-scarce environments.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a prevalent but neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic trematodes of the genus Schistosoma, with the primary disease-causing species being S. haematobium, S. mansoni, and S. japonicum. Male-female pairing of schistosomes is necessary for sexual maturity and the production of a large number of eggs, which are primarily responsible for schistosomiasis dissemination and pathology. Here, we used microarray hybridization, bioinformatics, quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization, and gene silencing assays to identify genes that play critical roles in S. japonicum reproduction biology, particularly in vitellarium development, a process that affects male-female pairing, sexual maturation, and subsequent egg production. Microarray hybridization analyses generated a comprehensive set of genes differentially transcribed before and after male-female pairing. Although the transcript profiles of females were similar 16 and 18 days after host infection, marked gene expression changes were observed at 24 days. The 30 most abundantly transcribed genes on day 24 included those associated with vitellarium development. Among these, genes for female-specific 800 (fs800), eggshell precursor protein, and superoxide dismutase (cu-zn-SOD) were substantially upregulated. Our in situ hybridization results in female S. japonicum indicated that cu-zn-SOD mRNA was highest in the ovary and vitellarium, eggshell precursor protein mRNA was expressed in the ovary, ootype, and vitellarium, and Sjfs800 mRNA was observed only in the vitellarium, localized in mature vitelline cells. Knocking down the Sjfs800 gene in female S. japonicum by approximately 60% reduced the number of mature vitelline cells, decreased rates of pairing and oviposition, and decreased the number of eggs produced in each male-female pairing by about 50%. These results indicate that Sjfs800 is essential for vitellarium development and egg production in S. japonicum and suggest that Sjfs800 regulation may provide a novel approach for the prevention or treatment of schistosomiasis.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySchistosomiasis is a common but largely unstudied tropical disease caused by parasitic trematodes of the genus Schistosoma. The eggs of schistosomes are responsible for schistosomiasis transmission and pathology, and the production of these eggs is dependent on the pairing of females and males. In this study, we determined which genes in Schistosoma japonicum females were differentially expressed before and after pairing with males, identifying the 30 most abundantly expressed of these genes. Among these 30 genes, we further characterized those in female S. japonicum that were upregulated after pairing and that were related to reproduction and vitellarium development, a process that affects male-female pairing, sexual maturation, and subsequent egg production. We identified three such genes, S. japonicum female-specific 800 (Sjfs800), eggshell precursor protein, and superoxide dismutase, and confirmed that the mRNAs for these genes were primarily localized in reproductive structures. By using gene silencing techniques to reduce the amount of Sjfs800 mRNA in females by about 60%, we determined that Sjfs800 plays a key role in development of the vitellarium and egg production. This finding suggests that regulation of Sjfs800 may provide a novel approach to reduce egg counts and thus aid in the prevention or treatment of schistosomiasis.",

    "abstract": "Gut-expressed aphid genes, which may be more easily inhibited by RNA interference (RNAi) constructs, are attractive targets for pest control efforts involving transgenic plants. Here we show that expression of cathepsin L, a cysteine protease that functions in aphid guts, can be reduced by expression of an RNAi construct in transgenic tobacco. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by up to 80% adult mortality, reduced fecundity, and delayed nymph production of Myzus persicae (green peach aphids) when cathepsin L expression was reduced by plant-mediated RNAi. Consistent with the function of cathepsin L as a gut protease, M. persicae fed on the RNAi plants had a lower protein content in their bodies and excreted more protein in their honeydew. Larvae of Coccinella septempunctata (seven-spotted ladybugs) grew more slowly on aphids having reduced cathepsin L expression, suggesting that prey insect nutritive value, and not just direct negative effects of the RNAi construct, needs to be considered when producing transgenic plants for RNAi-mediated pest control.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISilencing expression of cathepsin L by RNA interference reduces protein content of Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) bodies.\\nC_LIO_LIHoneydew of aphids with cathepsin L silenced contains elevated protein.\\nC_LIO_LICathepsin L is required for efficient protein uptake from phloem sap.\\nC_LIO_LIAphids with cathepsin L expression silenced have increased mortality and fewer offspring.\\nC_LIO_LICoccinella septempunctata (seven-spotted ladybugs) grow more slowly on aphids with expression of cathepsin L silenced.\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/451211_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ee6d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@853fe8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26c2aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b67e2b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The inherent capacity of somatic cells to switch their phenotypic status in response to damage stimuli in vivo might have a pivotal role in ageing and cancer. However, how the entry-exit mechanisms of phenotype reprogramming are established remains poorly understood. In an attempt to elucidate such mechanisms, we herein introduce a stochastic model of combined epigenetic regulation (ER)-gene regulatory network (GRN) to study the plastic phenotypic behaviours driven by ER heterogeneity. Furthermore, based on the existence of multiple scales, we formulate a method for stochastic model reduction, from which we derive an efficient hybrid simulation scheme that allows us to deal with such complex systems. Our analysis of the coupled system reveals a regime of tristability in which pluripotent stem-like and differentiated steady-states coexist with a third indecisive state. Crucially, ER heterogeneity of differentiation genes is for the most part responsible for conferring abnormal robustness to pluripotent stem-like states. We then formulate epigenetic heterogeneity-based strategies capable of unlocking and facilitating the transit from differentiation-refractory (pluripotent stem-like) to differentiation-primed epistates. The application of the hybrid numerical method validated the likelihood of such switching involving solely kinetic changes in epigenetic factors. Our results suggest that epigenetic heterogeneity regulates the mechanisms and kinetics of phenotypic robustness of cell fate reprogramming. The occurrence of tunable switches capable of modifying the nature of cell fate reprogramming from pathological to physiological might pave the way for new therapeutic strategies to regulate reparative reprogramming in ageing and cancer.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCertain modifications of the structure and functioning of the protein/DNA complex called chromatin can allow adult, fully differentiated cells to adopt a stem cell-like pluripotent state in a purely epigenetic manner, not involving changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Such reprogramming-like phenomena may constitute an innate reparative route through which human tissues respond to injury and could also serve as a novel regenerative strategy in human pathological situations in which tissue or organ repair is impaired. However, it should be noted that in vivo reprogramming would be capable of maintaining tissue homeostasis provided the acquisition of pluripotency features is strictly transient and accompanied by an accurate replenishment of the specific cell types being lost. Crucially, an excessive reprogramming to pluripotency in the absence of controlled re-differentiation would impair the repair or the replacement of damaged cells, thereby promoting pathological alterations of cell fate. A mechanistic understanding of how the degree of chromatin plasticity dictates the reparative versus pathological behaviour of in vivo reprogramming to rejuvenate aged tissues while preventing tumorigenesis is urgently needed, including especially the intrinsic epigenetic heterogeneity of the tissue resident cells being reprogrammed. We here introduce a novel method that mathematically captures how epigenetic heterogeneity is actually the driving force that governs the routes and kinetics to entry into and exit from a pathological pluripotent-like state. Moreover, our approach computationally validates the likelihood of unlocking chronic, unrestrained pluripotent states and drive their differentiation down the correct path by solely manipulating the intensity and direction of few epigenetic control switches. Our approach could inspire new therapeutic approaches based on in vivo cell reprogramming for efficient tissue regeneration and rejuvenation and cancer treatment.",

The clearing methods, reported up to now, require long incubation time or physical/electrical pressure to achieve tissue clearing, which is done by matching the refractive indices of the whole sample and medium to that of the lipid layer. Here we show that phosphoric acid increases the refractive index of the medium and can increase the transparency of formalin-fixed tissue samples rapidly. Immersion of fixed tissues of mice in phosphoric acid solutions increased their transparency within 60 min in the case of 3-mm-thick fixed tissue specimens. While phosphoric acid suppresses bright signals on the boundary of cells in their phase-contrast images, it does not damage the morphology of cell membrane with phospholipid bilayer. The protocol presented herein may contribute to develop better and faster soaking methods for tissue clearing than previously reported protocols.\\n\\nHighlights{blacksquare} Phosphoric acid can reduce light scattering by tissue samples.\\n{blacksquare}Tissue clearing effect of phosphoric acid is fast and needs only 60-min incubation.\\n{blacksquare}Cell membrane was preserved during incubation using phosphoric acid.",

    "abstract": "Lung disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results from dysregulated proteolytic activity, mainly by neutrophil elastase (HNE), in the lung parenchyma. This is the result of a substantial reduction of circulating alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and the presence in the plasma of inactive polymers of AAT. Moreover, some AAT mutants have reduced intrinsic activity toward HNE, as demonstrated for the common Z mutant, as well as for other rarer variants. Here we report the identification and characterisation of the novel AAT reactive centre loop variant Gly349Arg (p.G373R) present in the ExAC database. This AAT variant is secreted at normal levels in cellular models of AATD but shows a severe reduction in anti-HNE activity. Biochemical and molecular dynamics studies suggest it exhibits unfavourable RCL presentation to cognate proteases and compromised insertion of the RCL into {beta}-sheet A. Identification of a fully dysfunctional AAT mutant that does not show a secretory defect underlines the importance of accurate genotyping of patients with pulmonary AATD manifestations regardless of the presence of normal levels of AAT in the circulation. This subtype of disease is reminiscent of dysfunctional phenotypes in antithrombin and C1-inibitor deficiencies so, accordingly, we classify this variant as the first pure functionally-deficient (type II) AATD mutant.",

In this work, we present a minimal stochastic model that qualititatively reproduces observations of polymerization, of formation of dynamic contractile ring that is stable for a long time and of depolymerization shown by FtsZ polymer. We explore different mechanisms for ring breaking and hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is known to regulate the dynamics of other tubulin polymers like microtubules. We find that the presence of the ring allows for an additional mechanism for regulating the dynamics of FtsZ polymers. Ring breaking dynamics in the presence of hydrolysis naturally induce rescue and catastrophe events, irrespective of the mechanism of hydrolysis. Based on our model, we conclude that the Z-ring undergoes random breaking and closing during the process of cell division.",

    "abstract": "In the mature mammalian cochlea, inner hair cells (IHCs) are mainly innervated by afferent fibers that convey sound information to the central nervous system. During postnatal development, however, medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent fibers transiently innervate the IHCs. The MOC-IHC synapse, functional from postnatal day (P)0 to hearing onset (P12), undergoes dramatic changes in the sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh) and in the expression of key postsynaptic proteins. To evaluate whether there are associated changes in the properties of ACh release during this period, we used a cochlear preparation from mice at P4, P6-7 and P9-11 and monitored transmitter release from MOC terminals in voltage-clamped IHCs in the whole-cell configuration. The quantum content increased 5.6x from P4 to P9-11 due to increases in the size and replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles, without changes in their probability of release (Pvesicle) or quantum size. This strengthening in transmission was accompanied by changes in the short-term plasticity (STP) properties, which switched from facilitation at P4 to depression at P9-11. We have previously shown that at P9-11, ACh release is supported by P/Q and N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and negatively regulated by BK potassium channels activated by Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs. We now show that at P4 and P6-7, release is mediated by P/Q-, R- and L-type VGCCs. Interestingly, L-type VGCCs have a dual role: they both support release and fuel BK channels, suggesting that at immature stages the presynaptic proteins involved in release are less compartmentalized.\\n\\nSignificance statementDuring postnatal development prior to the onset of hearing, cochlear IHCs present spontaneous Ca2+ action potentials which release glutamate at the first auditory synapse in the absence of sound stimulation. The IHC Ca2+ action potential frequency pattern, which is crucial for the correct establishment and function of the auditory system, is regulated by the efferent MOC system that transiently innervates IHCs during this period. We show short-term synaptic plasticity properties of the MOC-IHC synapse that tightly shape this critical developmental period.",

    "abstract": "Neighboring sequences of a gene can influence its expression. In the phenomenon known as transcriptional interference, transcription at one region in the genome can repress transcription at a nearby region in cis. Transcriptional interference occurs at a number of eukaryotic loci, including the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Adh is regulated by two promoters, which are distinct in their developmental timing of activation. It has been shown using transgene insertion that when the promoter distal from the Adh start codon is deleted, transcription from the proximal promoter becomes de-regulated. As a result, the Adh proximal promoter, which is normally active only during the early larval stages, becomes abnormally activated in adults. Whether this type of regulation occurs in the endogenous Adh context, however, remains unclear. Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the endogenous Adh locus and found that removal of the distal promoter does also result in the untimely expression of the proximal promoter-driven mRNA isoform in adults, albeit at lower levels than previously reported. Importantly, we show that transcription from the distal promoter is sufficient to repress proximal transcription in larvae and that the degree of this repression depends on the degree of distal promoter activity. Finally, repression of the endogenous Adh proximal promoter is associated with the enrichment of histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), a chromatin mark necessary for transcription-coupled gene repression in yeast. We conclude that the endogenous Adh locus is developmentally regulated by transcriptional interference in a tunable manner.",

    "abstract": "With recent poaching of southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum; SWR) reaching record levels, the need for a robust assurance population is urgent. However, the global captive SWR population is not currently self-sustaining due to the reproductive failure of captive-born females. Dietary phytoestrogens have been proposed to play a role in this phenomenon, and recent work has demonstrated a negative relationship between diet estrogenicity and fertility of captive-born female SWR. To further examine this relationship, we compared gut microbial communities, fecal phytoestrogens, and fertility of SWR to another rhinoceros species-the greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis; GOHR), which consumes a similar diet but exhibits high levels of fertility in captivity. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and mass spectrometry, we identified a species-specific fecal microbiota and three dominant fecal phytoestrogen profiles. These profiles exhibited varying levels of estrogenicity when tested in an in vitro estrogen receptor activation assay for both rhinoceros species, with profiles dominated by the microbial metabolite, equol, stimulating the highest levels of receptor activation. Finally, we found that SWR fertility varies significantly with respect to phytoestrogen profile, but also with the abundance of several bacterial taxa and microbially-derived phytoestrogen metabolites. Taken together, these data suggest that in addition to species differences in estrogen receptor sensitivity to phytoestrogens, reproductive outcomes may be driven by gut microbiotas transformation of dietary phytoestrogens in captive SWR females.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBetween 2008 and 2011 about 40 cases of human cowpox were reported from Germany and France. Infections had been acquired via close contact to infected, young pet rats. Sequencing of the hemagglutinin gene of various cowpox virus (CPXV) isolates resulted in an identical and unique sequence in each case pointing to a common source. In a second CPXV outbreak in cats in a small animal clinic in Germany in 2015, four out of five hospitalized cats showed identical hemagglutinin sequences and thus, a hospital-acquired transmission was assumed.\\n\\nMethodsHomogenates of lesion material from rats, cats and humans were cultivated in cell culture. The genomes of 4 virus isolates, 9 CPXVs from our strain collections and from DNA of 3 paraffin-embedded lesion materials were determined by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). For phylogenetic analyses a MAFFT-alignment was generated. A distance matrix based on concatenated SNPs was calculated and plotted as dendrogram using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) for visualization.\\n\\nResultsAligning of about 200.000 nucleotides of 8 virus isolates associated with the pet rat outbreak revealed complete identity of six genomes, the remainder two genomes differed in as little as 3 SNPs. When comparing this dataset with four already published CPXV genomes also associated with the pet rat outbreak, again a maximum difference of 3 SNPs was found. The outbreak which lasted from 2008 till 2011 was indeed caused by a single strain which has maintained an extremely high level of clonality over 4 years.\\n\\nAligning genomic sequences from 4 cases of feline cowpox revealed 3 identical sequences and one sequence which differed in 65 nucleotides. Although identical hemagglutinin sequences had been obtained from four hospitalized cats, genomic sequencing proved that a hospital-acquired transmission had occurred in only three cats.\\n\\nDiscussionAnalyzing the rather short sequence of the hemagglutinin gene is not sufficient to conduct molecular trace back analyses. Instead, whole genome sequencing is the method of choice which can even be applied to paraffin-embedded specimens.\\n\\nFunding StatementThis publication was supported by the European Virus Archive goes Global (EVAg) project that has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 653316.\\n\\nThis study was also supported in part by the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 643476 (COMPARE).\\n\\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",

We shed light on the assembly rules of a multilayer network formed by frugivory and nectarivory interactions between bats and plants in the Neotropics. Our results suggest that, at a large scale, phylogenetic trade-offs separate species into different layers and modules. At an intermediate scale, the modules are also shaped by geographic trade-offs. And at a small scale, the network shifts to a nested structure within its modules, probably as a consequence of resource breadth processes. Finally, once the topology of the network is shaped, morphological traits related to consuming fruits or nectar determine which species are central or peripheral. Our results help understand how different processes contribute to the assemblage of ecological systems at different scales, resulting in a compound topology.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that make up to 8% of the human genome. Although these elements are mostly fragmented and inactive, many proviruses belonging to the HERV-K (HML-2) family, the only lineage still proliferating in the genome after the human-chimpanzee split, have intact open reading frames, some encoding for accessory genes called np9 and rec that interact with oncogenic pathways. Many studies have established that the transient expression of ERVs are in both stem cells and cancers results in aberrant self-renewal and uncontrolled proliferation.\\n\\nThe wealth of high-quality genomic and transcriptomic Illumina sequence data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that are sequenced from a diversity of different tumour types makes it a valuable resource in cancer research. However, there is currently no universal computational method for inferring expression of specific repetitive elements from RNA-seq data, such as genes encoded by HERV-K (HML-2).\\n\\nThis study presents a novel and a highly specific pipeline that is able to capture and measure transcription of np9 and rec encoded by proviruses that share great sequence similarity, and are transcribed at very low levels. We show by using our novel methodology that np9 and rec are overexpressed in breast cancer, germ cell tumours, skin melanoma, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer compared to non-diseased tissues. We also show that np9 and rec are specifically expressed in the 8 and 16-cell stage in human preimplantation embryos.",

However, the development of insecticide resistance is one of the major challenges for controlling malaria vectors. Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Although a L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of resistance and biochemical studies indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis field populations (Tolay, Asendabo, Chewaka) and two susceptible strains (Sekoru and Mozambique).\\n\\nRESULTSBoth RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3, and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4, were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance, although this did not translate in increased thickness of the procuticle.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONOur transcriptome sequencing of deltamethrin/DDT resistant An. arabiensis populations from Ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance mechanisms and pave the way for further investigation of the role of cuticle composition in resistance.",

Evidence suggests that two T-box transcription factors, tbx5 and tbx15, participate in pLL migration and development. Lateral line migration and deposition defects are observed following tbx5 or tbx15 morpholino knockdown. Additional studies demonstrate that the tbx5 phenotype is partially rescued when tbx15 is also knocked down. pLL defects similar to those of tbx5 are noted following knockdown of camKII-{beta}2, a known downstream target of Tbx5, suggesting a potential mechanistic pathway. Ectopic expression of human CamKII-{partial}C partially rescues the tbx5 phenotype but exacerbates the tbx15 phenotype.

By using genetic and pharmacological tools in vivo, together with image analysis of single embryos and pluripotent cell culture, we have found that Notch is active from the 4-cell stage. Transcriptomic analysis in single morula identified novel Notch targets, such as early naive pluripotency markers or transcriptional repressors such as TLE4.

Spatial information is often conveyed by morphogens, molecules that disperse across receiving cells generating signaling gradients. Cells translate such concentration gradients into space-dependent patterns of gene expression and cellular behavior [1, 2]. But could morphogen gradients also convey developmental time? Here, investigating the developmental role of Hh on a component of the Drosophila visual system, the ocellar retina, we discovered that ocellar cells use the non-linear gradient of Hh as a temporal cue, collectively performing the biological equivalent of a mathematical logarithmic transformation. In this way, a morphogen diffusing from a non-moving source is decoded as a wave of differentiating photoreceptors that travels at constant speed throughout the retinal epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Whereas in eukaryotic cells, the Hsp90s are profusely-studied molecular chaperones controlling protein homeostasis together with Hsp70s, in bacteria, the function of Hsp90 (HtpG) and its collaboration with Hsp70 (DnaK) remains unknown. To uncover physiological processes depending on HtpG and DnaK, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic analyses of insoluble and total protein fractions from unstressed wild type E. coli, and from knockout mutants{Delta} dnaKdnaJ ({Delta}KJ),{Delta} htpG ({Delta}G) and{Delta} dnaKdnaJ{Delta}htpG ({Delta}KJG) and compared their growth rates under heat-stress also with{Delta} dnaKdnaJ{Delta}hslV. Whereas, expectedly, mutant {Delta}G showed no proteomic differences with wild-type, {Delta}KJ expressed more chaperones, proteases and ribosomes and dramatically less metabolic and respiratory enzymes. Unexpectedly, we found that {Delta}KJG showed higher levels of metabolic and respiratory enzymes and both {Delta}KJG and{Delta} dnaKdnaJ{Delta}hslV grew better at 37oC than {Delta}KJ. The results indicate that bacterial Hsp90 mediates the degradation of aggregation-prone Hsp70-Hsp40 substrates, preferably by the HslUV protease.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 are among the most abundant and well-conserved proteins in all realms of life, forming together the core of the cellular proteostasis network. In eukaryotes, Hsp90 functions in collaboration with Hsp70; we studied this collaboration in E. coli, combining genetic studies with label-free quantitative proteomics in which both protein abundance and protein solubility were quantified.

    "abstract": "GABAA receptor potentiators are commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy, but it is not clear whether distinct GABAA receptor subtypes contribute to seizure activity, and whether targeting receptor subtypes will have disproportionate benefit over adverse effects. Here we demonstrate that the 2 / 3 selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) AZD7325 preferentially potentiates hippocampal inhibitory responses at synapses proximal to the soma of CA1 neurons. The effect of AZD7325 on synaptic responses was more prominent in mice on the 129S6/SvEvTac background strain that has been demonstrated to be seizure resistant in the model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/-) and in which the 2 GABAA receptor subunits are higher relative to in the C57BL/6J strain. Consistent with this, treatment of mice with AZD7325 is associated with a higher temperature threshold for hyperthermia-induced seizures in Scn1a+/- mice without apparent sedative effects. Our results in a model system indicate that selective targeting 2 is a potential therapeutic option for Dravet syndrome.",

Two actin regulators, WHAMM and JMY, participate in autophagosome formation, but the signals linking autophagy to actin assembly are poorly understood. We show that, in non-starved cells, cytoplasmic JMY co-localizes with STRAP, a regulator of JMYs nuclear functions, on non-motile vesicles with no associated actin networks. Upon starvation, JMY shifts to motile, LC3-containing membranes that move on actin comet tails. LC3 enhances JMYs de novo actin nucleation activity via a cryptic actin-binding sequence near JMYs N-terminus, and STRAP inhibits JMYs ability to nucleate actin and activate the Arp2/3 complex. Cytoplasmic STRAP negatively regulates autophagy. Finally, we use purified proteins to reconstitute LC3- and JMY-dependent actin network formation on membranes, and inhibition of network formation by STRAP. We conclude that LC3 and STRAP regulate JMYs actin assembly activities in trans during autophagy.\\n\\neTOC BlurbThe actin regulator JMY creates filament networks that move membranes during autophagy.

Exocytosis in mammals requires a Munc18 scaffolding protein, and airway secretory cells express all three Munc18 isoforms. Using conditional airway epithelial deletant mice, we found that Munc18a has the major role in baseline mucin secretion, Munc18b has the major role in stimulated mucin secretion, and Munc18c does not function in mucin secretion. In an allergic asthma model, Munc18b deletion reduced airway mucus occlusion and airflow resistance. In a cystic fibrosis model, Munc18b deletion reduced airway mucus occlusion and emphysema. Munc18b deficiency in the airway epithelium did not result in any abnormalities of lung structure, particle clearance, inflammation, or bacterial infection. Our results show that regulated secretion in a polarized epithelial cell may involve more than one exocytic machine at the apical plasma membrane, and that the protective roles of mucin secretion can be preserved while therapeutically targeting its pathologic roles.",

Kinesin-5 crosslinks and slides anti-parallel microtubules, but it is unclear how these two activities contribute to the first steps in spindle formation. In this study we report that in monopolar spindles, the duplicated spindle poles snap apart in a fast and irreversible step that produces a nascent bipolar spindle. Using mutations in Kinesin-5 that inhibit microtubule sliding, we show crosslinking alone drives the fast, irreversible pole separation. Electron tomography revealed microtubule pairs in monopolar spindles have short overlaps that intersect at high angles and are unsuited for ensemble Kinesin-5 sliding. However, maximal extension of a subset of microtubule pairs approaches the length of nascent bipolar spindles and is consistent with a Kinesin-5 crosslinking driven transition. Finally, stochastic microtubule sliding by Kinesin-5 stabilizes the nascent spindle and sets a stereotyped equilibrium length.",

In Xenopus, depletion of Ccdc11 causes defects in LR patterning, recapitulating the patient phenotype. Upon Ccdc11 depletion, normally monociliated cells of the Left-Right Organizer (LRO) exhibit multiple cilia per cell. Unexpectedly, we found that Ccdc11 is necessary for successful cytokinesis, and the multiciliation observed in Ccdc11-depleted cells was due to failed cytokinesis. Furthermore, CCDC11 depletion alters cell-cell adhesion with reduction in junctional localization of adhesion molecules. The small GTPase RhoA is critical for cytokinesis and cell-cell adhesion. Because the CCDC11 depletion phenotypes are reminiscent of RhoA loss of function, we investigated a possible connection to regulation of RhoA signaling. We demonstrate that CCDC11 is localized to the cytokinetic contractile ring overlapping with RhoA during cytokinesis and regulates total RhoA protein levels. Our results suggest that CCDC11 connects cytokinesis and LR patterning via RhoA regulation, providing a potential mechanism for heterotaxy disease pathogenesis.",

Using a model arginine-rich peptide-RNA system, we predicted and observed that variations in signaling cations exert interaction-dependent effects on RNA LLPS. Changing the ionic environment has opposing effects on the propensity for heterotypic peptide-RNA and homotypic RNA LLPS, which results in a switch between coacervate types. Furthermore, divalent ion variations continuously tune the microenvironments and fluid properties of heterotypic and homotypic droplets.

We developed opt-SNE, an automated toolkit for t-SNE parameter selection that utilizes Kullback-Liebler divergence evaluation in real time to tailor the early exaggeration and overall number of gradient descent iterations in a dataset-specific manner. The precise calibration of early exaggeration together with opt-SNE adjustment of gradient descent learning rate dramatically improves computation time and enables high-quality visualization of large cytometry and transcriptomics datasets, overcoming limitations of analysis tools with hard-coded parameters that often produce poorly resolved or misleading maps of fluorescent and mass cytometry data. In summary, opt-SNE enables superior data resolution in t-SNE space and thereby more accurate data interpretation.",

Using extensive simulations and sequence data from humans, fruit-flies and a fungal pathogen, we demonstrate that iSMC accurately infers recombination maps under a wide range of scenarios - remarkably, even from a single pair of unphased genomes. We exploit this possibility and reconstruct the recombination maps of archaic hominids.

Breeding arsenic tolerant rice varieties that prevent As uptake and its accumulation in the grains is a major mitigation options. However, the genetic control of the trait is complex, involving large number of gene of limited individual effect, and raises the question of the most efficient breeding method. Using data from three years of experiment in a naturally arsenic-reach field, we analysed the performances of the two major breeding methods: conventional, quantitative trait loci based, selection targeting loci involved in arsenic tolerance, and the emerging, genomic selection, predicting genetic values without prior hypotheses on causal relationships between markers and target traits. We showed that once calibrated in a reference population the accuracy of genomic prediction of arsenic content in the grains of the breeding population was rather high, ensuring genetic gains per time unite close to phenotypic selection. Conversely, selection targeting quantitative loci proved to be less robust as, though in agreement with the literature on the genetic bases of arsenic tolerance, few target loci identified in the reference population could be validated in the breeding population.",

How sensory cortices balance these diverse inputs to provide relatively stable, accurate representations of the external world is not well understood. Furthermore, neuromodulation could alter the balance of these inputs in a state- and behavior-dependent manner. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation to directly assay the relative strength of bottom-up (olfactory bulb) and top-down (lateral entorhinal cortex) synaptic inputs to piriform cortex in freely moving rats. Optotrodes in the piriform cortex were used to test the relative strength of these two inputs, in separate animals, with extracellular, monosynaptic evoked potentials. The results suggest a rapid state-dependent shift in the balance of bottom-up and top-down inputs to PCX, with enhancement in the strength of lateral entorhinal cortex synaptic input and stability or depression of olfactory bulb synaptic input during slow-wave sleep compared to waking. The shift is in part due to a state-dependent change in cholinergic tone as assessed with fiber photometry of GCaMP6 fluorescence in basal forebrain ChAT+ neurons, and blockade of the state-dependent synaptic shift with cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation.",

Cutin monomers are formed by the transfer of 16- or 18-carbon fatty acids to glycerol by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) enzymes, which facilitates their transport to the plant surface. Here we address the dual functionality of pathogen-inducible Glycerol phosphate acyltransferase 6 (GPAT6) in controlling pathogen entry and dehydration in leaves. Silencing of Nicotiana benthamiana NbGPAT6a increased leaf susceptibility to the oomycetes Phytophthora infestans and P. palmivora, whereas stable overexpression of NbGPAT6a-GFP rendered leaves more resistant to infection. A loss-of-function mutation of the orthologous gene in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), SlGPAT6, similarly resulted in increased susceptibility of leaves to Phytophthora infection concomitant with altered intracellular infection structure morphology. Conversely, Botrytis cinerea disease symptoms were reduced. Modulation of GPAT6 expression predominantly altered the outer cell wall of leaf epidermal cells. The impaired cell wall-cuticle continuum of tomato gpat6-a mutants resulted in increased water loss and these plants had fewer stomata. Our work highlights a hitherto unknown role for GPAT6-generated cutin monomers in controlling epidermal cell properties that are integral to leaf-microbe interactions and limit dehydration.",
