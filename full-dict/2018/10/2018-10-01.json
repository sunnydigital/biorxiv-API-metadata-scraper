    "abstract": "A quantitative model to genetically interpret the histology in whole microscopy slide images is desirable to guide downstream immuno-histochemistry, genomics, and precision medicine. We constructed a statistical model that predicts whether or not SPOP is mutated in prostate cancer, given only the digital whole slide after standard hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] staining. Using a TCGA cohort of 177 prostate cancer patients where 20 had mutant SPOP, we trained multiple ensembles of residual networks, accurately distinguishing SPOP mutant from SPOP non-mutant patients (test AUROC=0.74, p=0.0007 Fishers Exact Test). We further validated our full metaensemble classifier on an independent test cohort from MSK-IMPACT of 152 patients where 19 had mutant SPOP. Mutants and non-mutants were accurately distinguished despite TCGA slides being frozen sections and MSK-IMPACT slides being formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (AUROC=0.86, p=0.0038). Moreover, we scanned an additional 36 MSK-IMPACT patients having mutant SPOP, trained on this expanded MSK-IMPACT cohort (test AUROC=0.75, p=0.0002), tested on the TCGA cohort (AUROC=0.64, p=0.0306), and again accurately distinguished mutants from non-mutants using the same pipeline. Importantly, our method demonstrates tractable deep learning in this \\\"small data\\\" setting of 20-55 positive examples and quantifies each predictions uncertainty with confidence intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first statistical model to predict a genetic mutation in cancer directly from the patients digitized H&E-stained whole microscopy slide. Moreover, this is the first time quantitative features learned from patient genetics and histology have been used for content-based image retrieval, finding similar patients for a given patient where the histology appears to share the same genetic driver of disease i.e. SPOP mutation (p=0.0241 Kosts Method), and finding similar patients for a given patient that does not have have that driver mutation (p=0.0170 Kosts Method).\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis is the first pipeline predicting gene mutation probability in cancer from digitized H&E-stained microscopy slides. To predict whether or not the speckle-type POZ protein [SPOP] gene is mutated in prostate cancer, the pipeline (i) identifies diagnostically salient slide regions, (ii) identifies the salient region having the dominant tumor, and (iii) trains ensembles of binary classifiers that together predict a confidence interval of mutation probability. Through deep learning on small datasets, this enables automated histologic diagnoses based on probabilities of underlying molecular aberrations and finds histologically similar patients by learned genetic-histologic relationships.\\n\\nConception, Writing: AJS, TJF.

    "abstract": "Age-dependent loss of cardiac tissue homeostasis largely impacts heart performance and contributes significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life. Cellular quality control machinery, such as autophagy/lysosome system, plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiac health and preventing age-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure. However, how aging alters the autophagy/lysosome system to impact cardiac function remains largely unknown. Here using Drosophila heart as a model system, we show that activin signaling, a member of TGF-beta superfamily, negatively regulates cardiac autophagy and cardiac health during aging. We found that cardiac-specific knockdown of Daw, an activin-like protein in Drosophila, increased cardiac autophagy and prevented age-related cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia and bradycardia (slow heart rate). Inhibition of autophagy blocked Daw knockdown-mediated cardioprotection. Consistently, cardiac-specific expression of constitutively activated activin type I receptor Babo disrupted cardiac function at young ages. Intriguingly, the key autophagy regulator, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), was not involved in activin-mediated autophagy. Instead, activin signaling genetically interacted with Rictor, the key subunit of mTORC2, to regulate autophagy and cardiac aging. Knockdown of Daw increased the mRNA expression of Rictor and the phosphorylation of AKT in fly hearts. Finally, cardiac-specific silencing of Daw not only improved cardiac health, but also prolonged lifespan. Thus, our findings highlight an emerging role of activin signaling and mTORC2 in the regulation of autophagy and cardiac aging.",

    "abstract": "Convergent evolution describes the process of different populations acquiring similar phenotypes or genotypes. Complex organisms with large genomes only rarely and only under very strong selection converge to the same genotype. In contrast, independent virus populations with very small genomes often acquire identical mutations. Here we test the hypothesis of whether convergence in early HIV-1 infection is common enough to serve as an indicator for selection. To this end, we measure the number of convergent mutations in a well-studied dataset of full-length HIV-1 env genes sampled from HIV-1 infected individuals during early infection. We compare this data to a neutral model and find an excess of convergent mutations. Convergent mutations are not evenly distributed across the env gene, but more likely to occur in gp41, which suggests that convergent mutations provide a selective advantage and hence are positively selected. In contrast, mutations that are only found in an HIV-1 population of a single individual are significantly affected by purifying selection. Our analysis suggests that comparisons between convergent and private mutations with neutral models allow us to identify positive and negative selection in small viral genomes. Our results also show that selection significantly shapes HIV-1 populations even before the onset of the adaptive immune system.",

    "abstract": "Healthy cortical development depends on precise regulation of transcription and translation. However, the dynamics of how proteins are expressed, function and interact across postnatal human cortical development remain poorly understood. We surveyed the proteomic landscape of 69 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples across seven stages of postnatal life and integrated these data with paired transcriptome data. We detected 911 proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 83 were significantly associated with postnatal age (FDR p < 0.05). Network analysis identified three modules of co-regulated proteins correlated with age, including two modules with increasing expression involved in gliogenesis and NADH-metabolism and one neurogenesis-related module with decreasing expression throughout development. Integration with paired transcriptome data revealed that these age-related protein modules overlapped with RNA modules and displayed collinear developmental trajectories. Importantly, RNA expression profiles that are dynamically regulated throughout cortical development display tighter correlations with their respective translated protein expression compared to those RNA profiles that are not. Moreover, the correspondence between RNA and protein expression significantly decreases as a function of cortical aging, especially for genes involved in myelination and cytoskeleton organization. Finally, we used this data resource to elucidate the functional impact of genetic risk loci for intellectual disability, converging on gliogenesis, myelination and ATP-metabolism modules in the proteome and transcriptome. We share all data in an interactive, searchable companion website. Collectively, our findings reveal dynamic aspects of protein regulation and provide new insights into brain development, maturation and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is assumed that cancers develop upon acquiring a particular number of (epi)mutations in driver genes, but the law governing the kinetics of this process is not known. We have recently shown that the age distribution of incidence for 20 most prevalent cancers of old age is best approximated by the Erlang probability distribution. The Erlang distribution describes the probability of several successive random events occurring by the given time according to the Poisson process, which allows to predict the number of critical driver events.\n\nResultsHere we show that the Erlang distribution is the only classical probability distribution that can adequately model the age distribution of incidence for all studied childhood and young adulthood cancers, in addition to cancers of old age.\n\nConclusionsThis validates the Poisson process as the universal law describing cancer development at any age and the Erlang distribution as a useful tool to predict the number of driver events for any cancer type. The Poisson process signifies the fundamentally random timing of driver events and their constant average rate. As waiting times for the occurrence of the required number of driver events are counted in decades, it suggests that driver mutations accumulate silently in the longest-living dividing cells in the body - the stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Associated stimulus valence affects neural responses at an early processing stage. However, in the field of written language processing, it is unclear whether semantics of a word or low-level visual features affect early neural processing advantages. The current study aimed to investigate the role of semantic content on reward and loss associations. Participants completed a learning session to associate either words (Experiment 1, N=24) or pseudowords (Experiment 2, N=24) with different monetary outcomes (gain-associated, neutral or loss-associated). Gain-associated stimuli were learned fastest. Behavioural and neural response changes based on the associated outcome were further investigated in separate test sessions. Responses were faster towards gain- and loss-associated than neutral stimuli if they were words, but not pseudowords. Early P1 effects of associated outcome occurred for both pseudowords and words. Specifically, loss-association resulted in increased P1 amplitudes to pseudowords, compared to decreased amplitudes to words. Although visual features are likely to explain P1 effects for pseudowords, the inversed effect for words suggests that semantic content affects associative learning, potentially leading to stronger associations.\\n\\nHighlights- Neural mechanisms of gain/loss association to pseudowords and words were investigated\\n- Loss effects can be observed for the P1 component\\n- Words and pseudowords differ in the direction of loss effects\\n- Semantic content may play a role during word association\\n- Low-level visual features may play a role during pseudoword association",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by any region not currently involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.",

    "abstract": "Birds are essential components of most ecosystems and provide many services valued by society. However, many populations have undergone striking declines as habitats have been lost or degraded by human activities. Terrestrial grasslands are vital habitat for birds in the North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), but grassland conversion and fragmentation from agriculture and energy-production activities have destroyed or degraded millions of hectares. Conservation grasslands can provide alternate habitat. In the United States, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest program maintaining conservation grasslands on agricultural lands, but conservation grasslands in the PPR have declined by over 1 million ha since the programs zenith in 2007. We used an ecosystem-services model (InVEST) parameterized for the PPR to quantify grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014 and to assess degradation status of this remaining habitat as influenced by crop and energy (i.e., oil, natural gas, and wind) production. We compared our resultant habitat-quality ratings to grassland-bird abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to confirm that ratings were related to grassland-bird abundance. Of the grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014, about 18% was degraded by nearby crop production, whereas energy production degraded an additional 16%. We further quantified changes in availability of grassland-bird habitat under various land-cover scenarios representing incremental losses (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of CRP grasslands from 2014 levels. Our model identified 1 million ha (9%) of remaining grassland-bird habitat in the PPR that would be lost or degraded if all CRP conservation grasslands were returned to crop production. In addition to direct losses, an economic climate favoring energy and commodity production over conservation has resulted in substantial degradation of remaining grassland-bird habitat across the PPR. Other grassland regions of the world face similar challenges in maintaining avian habitat.",

    "abstract": "Research of the central actions of prolactin is virtually restricted to females, but this hormone has also documented roles in male physiology and behaviour. Here, we provide the first description of the pattern of prolactin-derived signalling in the male mouse brain, employing the immunostaining of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) after exogenous prolactin administration. Next, we explore possible sexually dimorphic differences by comparing pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in prolactin-supplemented males and females. We also assess the role of testosterone in the regulation of central prolactin signalling in males by comparing intact with castrated prolactin-supplemented males.\\n\\nProlactin-supplemented males displayed a widespread pattern of pSTAT5 immunoreactivity, restricted to brain centres showing expression of the prolactin receptor. Immunoreactivity for pSTAT5 was present in several nuclei of the preoptic, anterior and tuberal hypothalamus, as well as in the septofimbrial nucleus or posterodorsal medial amygdala of the telencephalon. Conversely, non-supplemented control males were virtually devoid of pSTAT5-immunoreactivity, suggesting that central prolactin actions in males are limited to situations concurrent with substantial hypophyseal prolactin release (e.g. stress or mating). Furthermore, comparison of prolactin-supplemented males and females revealed a significant, female-biased sexual dimorphism, supporting the view that prolactin has a preeminent role in female physiology and behaviour. Finally, in males, castration significantly reduced pSTAT5 immunoreactivity in some structures, including the paraventricular and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the septofimbrial region, thus indicating a region-specific regulatory role of testosterone over central prolactin signalling.",

    "abstract": "We present a simple model for coherent, spatially correlated chaos in a recurrent neural network. Networks of randomly connected neurons exhibit chaotic fluctuations and have been studied as a model for capturing the temporal variability of cortical activity. The dynamics generated by such networks, however, are spatially uncorrelated and do not generate coherent fluctuations, which are commonly observed across spatial scales of the neocortex. In our model we introduce a structured component of connectivity, in addition to random connections, which effectively embeds a feedforward structure via unidirectional coupling between a pair of orthogonal modes. Local fluctuations driven by the random connectivity are summed by an output mode and drive coherent activity along an input mode. The orthogonality between input and output mode preserves chaotic fluctuations even as coherence develops. In the regime of weak structured connectivity we apply a perturbative approach to solve the dynamic mean-field equations, showing that in this regime coherent fluctuations are driven passively by the chaos of local residual fluctuations. Strikingly, the chaotic dynamics are not subdued even by very strong structured connectivity if we add a row balance constraint on the random connectivity. In this regime the system displays longer time-scales and switching-like activity reminiscent of \\\"Up-Down\\\" states observed in cortical circuits. The level of coherence grows with increasing strength of structured connectivity until the dynamics are almost entirely constrained to a single spatial mode. We describe how in this regime the model achieves intermittent self-tuned criticality in which the coherent component of the dynamics self-adjusts to yield periods of slow chaos. Furthermore, we show how the dynamics depend qualitatively on the particular realization of the connectivity matrix: a complex leading eigenvalue can yield coherent oscillatory chaos while a real leading eigenvalue can yield chaos with broken symmetry. We examine the effects of network-size scaling and show that these results are not finite-size effects. Finally, we show that in the regime of weak structured connectivity, coherent chaos emerges also for a generalized structured connectivity with multiple input-output modes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural activity observed in the neocortex is temporally variable, displaying irregular temporal fluctuations at every accessible level of measurement. Furthermore, these temporal fluctuations are often found to be spatially correlated whether at the scale of local measurements such as membrane potentials and spikes, or global measurements such as EEG and fMRI. A thriving field of study has developed models of recurrent networks which intrinsically generate irregular temporal variability, the paradigmatic example being networks of randomly connected rate neurons which exhibit chaotic dynamics. These models have been examined analytically and numerically in great detail, yet until now the intrinsic variability generated by these networks have been spatially uncorrelated, yielding no large-scale coherent fluctuations. Here we present a simple model of a recurrent network of firing-rate neurons that intrinsically generates spatially correlated activity yielding coherent fluctuations across the entire network. The model incorporates random connections and adds a structured component of connectivity that sums network activity over a spatial \\\"output\\\" mode and projects it back to the network along an orthogonal \\\"input\\\" mode. We show that this form of structured connectivity is a general mechanism for producing coherent chaos.",

Though functional inactivation of the Hippo pathway is common in tumors, mutations in core pathway components are rare. Thus, understanding how tumor cells inactivate Hippo signaling remains a key unresolved question. Here, we identify the kinase STK25 as a novel activator of Hippo signaling. We demonstrate that loss of STK25 promotes YAP/TAZ activation and enhanced cellular proliferation, even under normally growth-suppressive conditions. We reveal that STK25 activates LATS via a previously unobserved mechanism, in which STK25 directly phosphorylates the LATS activation loop. This represents a new paradigm in Hippo activation and distinguishes STK25 from all other identified kinase activators of LATS. STK25 is significantly focally deleted across a wide spectrum of human cancers, suggesting STK25 loss may represent a common mechanism by which tumor cells functionally impair the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway.",

    "abstract": "The cacao tree (Theobroma cacao L.) is a species of great importance because cacao beans are the raw material used in the production of chocolate. However, the economic success of cacao is largely limited by important diseases such as black pod, which is responsible for losses of up to 30-40% of the global cacao harvest. The discovery of resistance genes could extensively reduce these losses. Therefore, the aims of this study were to construct an integrated multipoint genetic map, align polymorphisms against the available cacao genome, and identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance to black pod disease in cacao. The genetic map had a total length of 956.41 cM and included 186 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers distributed among 10 linkage groups. The physical \\\"in silico\\\" map covered more than 200 Mb of the cacao genome. Based on the mixed model predicted means of Phytophthora evaluation, a total of 6 QTLs were detected for Phytophthora palmivora (1 QTL), Phytophthora citrophthora (1 QTL), and Phytophthora capsici (4 QTLs). Approximately 1.77% to 3.29% of the phenotypic variation could be explained by the mapped QTLs. Several SSR marker-flanking regions containing mapped QTLs were located in proximity to disease regions. The greatest number of resistance genes was detected in linkage group 6, which provides strong evidence for a QTL. This joint analysis involving multipoint and mixed-model approaches may provide a potentially promising technique for detecting genes resistant to black pod and could be very useful for future studies in cacao breeding.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial and eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases (RNAPs) cap RNA with the oxidized and reduced forms of the metabolic effector nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NAD+ and NADH, using NAD+ and NADH as non-canonical initiating nucleotides for transcription initiation. Here, we show that mitochondrial RNAPs (mtRNAPs) cap RNA with NAD+ and NADH, and do so more efficiently than nuclear RNAPs. Direct quantitation of NAD+- and NADH-capped RNA demonstrates remarkably high levels of capping in vivo: up to ~60% NAD+ and NADH capping of yeast mitochondrial transcripts, and up to ~10% NAD+ capping of human mitochondrial transcripts. The capping efficiency is determined by promoter sequence at, and upstream of, the transcription start site and, in yeast and human cells, by intracellular NAD+ and NADH levels. Our findings indicate mtRNAPs serve as both sensors and actuators in coupling cellular metabolism to mitochondrial gene expression, sensing NAD+ and NADH levels and adjusting transcriptional outputs accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Humans have remarkable visual long-term memory abilities, capable of storing thousands of objects with significant detail. However, it remains unknown how such memory is utilized during the short-term maintenance of information. Specifically, if people have a previously encoded memory for an item, how does this affect subsequent working memory for that same item? Here, we demonstrate people can quickly and accurately make use of visual long-term memories and therefore maintain less perceptual information actively in working memory. We assessed how much perceptual information is actively maintained in working memory by measuring neural activity during the delay period of a working memory task using electroencephalography. We find that despite maintaining less perceptual information in working memory when long-term memory representations are available, there is no decrement in memory performance. This suggests under certain circumstances people can dynamically disengage working memory maintenance and instead use long-term memories when available. However, this does not mean participants always utilize long-term memory. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced additional perceptual interference into working memory and found participants actively maintained items in working memory even when they had existing long-term memories available. These results clarify the kinds of conditions under which long-term and working memory operate. Specifically, working memory is engaged when new information is encountered or perceptual interference is high. Visual long-term memory may otherwise be rapidly accessed and utilized in lieu of active perceptual maintenance. These data demonstrate the interactions between working memory and long-term memory are more dynamic and fluid than previously thought.",

Recent advances in single-cell profiling allow detailed analysis of embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human, marmoset and mouse embryos by single-cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation correlates with the presence of Polycomb Repressive Complexes in all three species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find that transposable element expression signatures are species-, stage- and lineage-specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain regulators operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates. Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and nonhuman primate blastocysts. Our cross-species analysis demarcates both conserved and primate-specific features of preimplantation development and underscores the molecular adaptability of early mammalian embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe 1.6 Mb 3q29 deletion is associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes, including increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a 20-40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia. However, the phenotypic spectrum of the deletion, particularly with respect to ASD, remains poorly described.\\n\\nMethodsWe ascertained individuals with 3q29 deletion syndrome (3q29Del, \\\"cases\\\", n=93, 58.1% male) and typically developing controls (n=64, 51.6% male) through the 3q29 registry (https://3q29deletion.patientcrossroads.org). Self-report of neuropsychiatric illness was evaluated for 93 cases. Subsets of participants were evaluated with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, n=48 cases, 56 controls), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ, n=33 cases, 46 controls), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ, n=24 cases, 35 controls), and Achenbach Behavior Checklists (n=48 cases, 57 controls).\\n\\nResults3q29Del cases report a higher prevalence of autism diagnoses versus the general population (29.0% vs. 1.47%, p<2.2E-16). Notably, 3q29 deletion confers a greater influence on risk for ASD in females (OR=41.8, p=4.78E-05) than in males (OR=24.6, p=6.06E-09); this is aligned with the reduced male:female bias from 4:1 in the general population to 2:1 in our study sample. Although 71% of cases do not report a diagnosis of ASD, there is evidence of significant social disability (3q29Del SRS T-score=71.8, control SRS T-score=45.9, p=2.16E-13). Cases also report increased frequency of generalized anxiety disorder compared to controls (28.0% vs. 6.2%, p=0.001), which is mirrored by elevated mean scores on the Achenbach DSM-oriented sub-scales (p<0.001). Finally, cases show a distinct constellation of ASD features on the SRS as compared to idiopathic ASD, with substantially elevated Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behaviors, but only mild impairment in Social Motivation.\\n\\nConclusionsOur sample of 3q29Del is significantly enriched for ASD diagnosis, especially among females, and features of autism may be present even when an ASD diagnosis is not reported. Further, the constellation of ASD features in this population is distinct from idiopathic ASD, with substantially less impaired social motivation. Our study implies that ASD evaluation should be the standard of care for individuals with 3q29Del. From a research perspective, the distinct ASD subtype present in 3q29Del is an ideal entry point for expanding understanding of ASD.",

Yet, when studying brain representations, stimuli are generally presented in isolation. Here, we studied the dynamics of human vision using a combination of fast stimulus presentation rates, electroencephalography and multivariate decoding analyses. Using a presentation rate of 5 images per second, we obtained the representational structure of a large number of stimuli, and showed the emerging abstract categorical organisation of this structure. Furthermore, we could separate the temporal dynamics of perceptual processing from higher-level target selection effects. In a second experiment, we used the same paradigm at 20Hz to show that shorter image presentation limits the categorical abstraction of object representations. Our results show that applying multivariate pattern analysis to every image in rapid serial visual processing streams has unprecedented potential for studying the temporal dynamics of the structure of representations in the human visual system.",

Intestinal microbiota composition was determined before intervention (baseline, S1), 2 weeks after a crash diet (S2), and 1 week (S3), 3 months (S4) and 6 months (S5) after surgery.\\n\\nResultsRelative to S1, the microbial diversity index declined at S2 and S3 (p< 0.05), and gradually returned to baseline levels at S5. The crash diet was associated with an increased abundance of Rikenellaceae and decreased abundances of Ruminococcaceae and Streptococcaceae (p< 0.05). After surgery, at S3, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae had decreased (compared to the moment directly after the crash diet), whereas those of Streptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae had increased (p< 0.05). Increased weight loss during the next 6 months was not associated without major changes in microbiota composition. Significant differences between both surgical procedures were not observed at any of the time points.\\n\\nConclusionsIn conclusion, undergoing a crash diet and bariatric surgery were associated with an immediate but temporary decline in the microbial diversity, with immediate and permanent changes in microbiota composition, with no differences between patients undergoing gastric sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-Y gastric bypass surgery.",

    "abstract": "Pathologists are responsible for rapidly providing a diagnosis on critical health issues. Challenging cases benefit from additional opinions of pathologist colleagues. In addition to on-site colleagues, there is an active worldwide community of pathologists on social media for complementary opinions. Such access to pathologists worldwide has the capacity to improve diagnostic accuracy and generate broader consensus on next steps in patient care. From Twitter we curate 13,626 images from 6,351 tweets from 25 pathologists from 13 countries. We supplement the Twitter data with 113,161 images from 1,074,484 PubMed articles. We develop machine learning and deep learning models to (i) accurately identify histopathology stains, (ii) discriminate between tissues, and (iii) differentiate disease states. Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic is 0.805-0.996 for these tasks. We repurpose the disease classifier to search for similar disease states given an image and clinical covariates. We report precision@k=1 = 0.7618{+/-}0.0018 (chance 0.397{+/-}0.004, mean{+/-}stdev). The classifiers find texture and tissue are important clinico-visual features of disease. Deep features trained only on natural images (e.g. cats and dogs) substantially improved search performance, while pathology-specific deep features and cell nuclei features further improved search to a lesser extent. We implement a social media bot (@pathobot on Twitter) to use the trained classifiers to aid pathologists in obtaining real-time feedback on challenging cases. If a social media post containing pathology text and images mentions the bot, the bot generates quantitative predictions of disease state (normal/artifact/infection/injury/nontumor, pre-neoplastic/benign/ low-grade-malignant-potential, or malignant) and lists similar cases across social media and PubMed. Our project has become a globally distributed expert system that facilitates pathological diagnosis and brings expertise to underserved regions or hospitals with less expertise in a particular disease. This is the first pan-tissue pan-disease (i.e. from infection to malignancy) method for prediction and search on social media, and the first pathology study prospectively tested in public on social media. We will share data through pathobotology.org. We expect our project to cultivate a more connected world of physicians and improve patient care worldwide.",

Here we have done an extensive analysis of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) isolated from human subjects with cardiovascular disease (n=119), aged 32-86 years. In aged subjects (>74 years old) over half of CPCs are senescent (p16INK4A, SA-{beta}-gal, DNA damage {gamma}H2AX, telomere length, Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)), unable to replicate, differentiate, regenerate or restore cardiac function following transplantation into the infarcted heart. SASP factors secreted by senescent CPCs renders otherwise healthy CPCs to senescence. Elimination of senescent CPCs using senolytics abrogates the SASP and its debilitative effect in vitro. Global elimination of senescent cells in aged mice (INK-ATTAC or wildtype mice treated with D+Q senolytics) in vivo activates resident CPCs (0.23{+/-}0.06% vs. 0.01{+/-}0.01% vehicle; p<0.05) and increased the number of small, proliferating Ki67-, EdU-positive cardiomyocytes (0.25{+/-}0.07% vs. 0.03{+/-}0.03% vehicle; p<0.05).

This property may be invoked by a physical stimulus (temperature, radiation) or by a chemical ligand, and may occur through mapping of the protein external environment onto a subset of protein conformers. We have stimulated with temperature cycles two partners of an immune complex before and after assembly, and revealed that properties of the external stimulus (period, phase) are also found in the characteristics of the immune complex (i.e. periodic variations in the binding affinity).

Based on our recent report showing a positive correlation between fecal abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and oral tacrolimus dose in kidney transplant patients, we tested whether F. prausnitzii and other gut abundant bacteria are capable of metabolizing tacrolimus. Incubation of F. prausnitzii with tacrolimus led to production of two compounds (the major one named M1), which was not observed upon tacrolimus incubation with hepatic microsomes. Isolation, purification, and structure elucidation using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that M1 is a C-9 keto-reduction product of tacrolimus. Pharmacological activity testing using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated that M1 is 15-fold less potent than tacrolimus as an immunosuppressant. Screening of 22 gut bacteria species revealed that most Clostridiales bacteria are extensive tacrolimus metabolizers. Tacrolimus conversion to M1 was verified in fresh stool samples from two healthy adults. M1 was also detected in the stool samples from kidney transplant recipients who had been taking tacrolimus orally. Together, this study presents gut bacteria metabolism as a previously unrecognized elimination route of tacrolimus, potentially contributing to the low and variable tacrolimus exposure after oral dosing.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is threatening attempts at tuberculosis epidemic control. Molecular diagnostics for drug resistance that rely on the detection of resistance-related mutations could expedite patient care and accelerate progress in TB eradication. We performed minimum inhibitory concentration testing for 12 anti-TB drugs together with Illumina whole genome sequencing on 1452 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. We then used a linear mixed model to evaluate genome wide associations between mutations in MTB genes or noncoding regions and drug resistance, followed by validation of our findings in an independent dataset of 792 patient isolates. Novel associations at 13 genomic loci were confirmed in the validation set, with 2 involving noncoding regions. We found promoter mutations to have smaller average effects on resistance levels than gene body mutations in genes where both can contribute to resistance. Enabled by a quantitative measure of resistance, we estimated the heritability of the resistance phenotype to 11 anti-TB drugs and identify a lower than expected contribution from known resistance genes. We also report the proportion of variation in resistance levels explained by the novel loci identified here. This study highlights the complexity of the genomic mechanisms associated with the MTB resistance phenotype, including the relatively large number of potentially causative or compensatory loci, and emphasizes the contribution of the noncoding portion of the genome.",

    "abstract": "European pit-building antlions (Myrmeleon inconspicuus / Rambur 1842) are studied in their capacity to detect vibrations generated by the locomotion of an ant (Cataglyphis cursor) outside the pit. These locomotions have been recorded by laser velocimetry and copied in detail in their time sequences. The sequences are replicated by micro-controllers digital outputs acting on piezoelectric transducers placed several centimeters outside the peripheries of the pits: their actions on the surface of a sand media create surface waves with particle accelerations that are 3 orders of magnitude less than g, alleviating any possibility of sand avalanche towards the bottom of the pit. Depending on the amplitude of the vibrations, the antlions answer back, generally by sand tossing. One remarkable feature is the time delay from the start of the cue and the aggressive behavior induced by this cue. This time delay is studied versus the cue amplitude. The result of this work is that anlions answer back within minutes to cues with amplitudes between 1 to 2 nanometers at the level of their mechanosensors, and within seconds to these same cues if they are preceded by a sequence of signals at the [A]ngstrom amplitude. This induced aggressive behaviour evidences the sensitivity to vibrations at extremely low level.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen composition of the grape must has an impact on yeast growth and fermentation kinetics as well as on the organoleptic properties of the final product. In some technological processes, such as white wine/rose winemaking, the yeast-assimilable nitrogen content is sometimes insufficient to cover yeast requirements, which can lead to slow or sluggish fermentations. Growth is nevertheless quickly restored upon relief from nutrient starvation, e.g. through the addition of ammonium nitrogen, allowing fermentation completion. The aim of this study was to determine how nitrogen repletion affected the transcriptional response of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strain, in particular within the first hour after nitrogen addition. We found almost 4800 genes induced or repressed, sometimes within minutes after nutrient changes. Some of these responses to nitrogen depended on the TOR pathway, which controls positively ribosomal protein genes, amino acid and purine biosynthesis or amino acid permease genes and negatively stress-response genes, and genes related to the retrograde response (RTG) specific to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). Some unexpected transcriptional responses concerned all the glycolytic genes, the starch and glucose metabolism and citrate cycle-related genes that were down-regulated, as well as genes from the lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "During the first hours of embryogenesis, formation of higher-order heterochromatin coincides with the loss of developmental potential. Here we examine the relationship between these two processes, and we probe the determinants that contribute to their onset. Mutations that disrupt histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferases reveal that the methyltransferase MET-2 helps terminate developmental plasticity, likely through mono- and di- methylation of H3K9 (me1/me2), and promotes heterochromatin formation, likely through H3K9me3. We examine how MET-2 is regulated and find that methylated H3K9 appears gradually and depends on the accumulated time of embryogenesis. H3K9me is independent of zygotic genome activation or cell counting. These data reveal how central events are synchronized during embryogenesis and distinguish distinct roles for different H3K9 methylation states.\\n\\nSummary StatementDuring early embryogenesis, heterochromatin formation and loss of developmental plasticity are coordinately regulated by distinct Histone H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation states, by the methyltransferase MET-2.",

    "abstract": "Fungal diseases of plants are responsible for major losses in agriculture, highlighting the need for rapid and accurate identification of plant pathogens. Disease outcomes are often defined not only by the main pathogen but are influenced by diverse microbial communities known as the microbiome at sites of infection. Here we present the first use of whole genome sequencing from a portable DNA sequencing device as a method for detection of fungal pathogens from wheat (Triticum aestivum). The data revealed that our method is robust and applicable to the diagnosis of fungal diseases including wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici), septoria tritici blotch (caused by Zymoseptoria tritici) and yellow leaf spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici repentis). We also identified a bacterial genus Pseudomonas co-present with Puccinia and Zymoseptoria infections but not Pyrenophora infections. One limitation of the method is the over-representation of redundant wheat genome sequences in the sample. This could be addressed by amplicon-based sequencing approaches in future studies. Our work outlines a new approach for the detection of a broad range of plant pathogens and associated microbes using a portable sequencer, providing the basis for future development of a system for on-site disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Miltefosine is an FDA approved oral drug for treating cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania is a flagellated protozoa, which infects and differentiates in macrophages. Here, we studied the effects of Miltefosine on macrophages lipid homeostasis, autophagy, and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly/activity. Miltefosine treatment conferred multiple effects on macrophage lipid homeostasis leading to increased cholesterol release from cells, increased lipid-raft disruption, decreased phosphatidylserine (PS) flip from the cell-surface, and redistribution of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from the plasma membrane to actin rich regions in the cells. Enhanced basal autophagy, lipophagy and mitophagy was observed in cells treated with Miltefosine vs. control. Miltefosine treated cells showed marked increased in phosphorylation of kinases involved in autophagy induction such as; Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1). The Toll like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway was blunted by Miltefosine treatment, resulting in decreased TLR4 recruitment to cell-surface and ~75% reduction in LPS induced pro-IL-1{beta} mRNA levels. Miltefosine reduced endotoxin-mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and protected the mitochondrial membrane potential. Miltefosine treatment induced mitophagy and dampened NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Collectively, our data shows that Miltefosine induced ABCA1 mediated cholesterol release, induced AMPK phosphorylation and mitophagy, while dampening NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1{beta} release.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAtherosclerosis is driven by cholesterol accumulation and inflammation, and the arterial macrophage is a key cell type in both of these processes. The macrophage characteristics that protect against atherosclerosis include increased cholesterol efflux/reverse cholesterol transport, increased autophagy, and deceased inflammatory cytokine production and signaling. Here, we show that one single orally available compound, Miltefosine, can target multiple macrophage pathways involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Miltefosine activated cholesterol release and autophagy while inhibiting pro IL-1{beta} gene expression and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Miltefosine activated AMPK signaling pathway and mitophagy, leading to reduced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1{beta} release.",

Achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and their maintenance in form of stably transformed transgenes is challenging. We demonstrate here a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial ribonuclease barnase by using efficient temperature-dependent control of protein accumulation in living multicellular organisms. By tuning the levels of the protein, we were able to control the fate of a plant organ in vivo. The on-demand-formation of specialized epidermal cells (trichomes) through manipulating stabilization versus destabilization of barnase is a proof-of-concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool both as a potential novel strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic proteins and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.",

In many of these studies researchers collect longitudinal data with the goal of understanding not just the composition of the microbiome but also the interactions between the different taxa. However, analysis of such data is challenging and very few methods have been developed to reconstruct dynamic models from time series microbiome data.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a computational pipeline that enables the integration of data across individuals for the reconstruction of such models. Our pipeline starts by aligning the data collected for all individuals. The aligned profiles are then used to learn a dynamic Bayesian network which represents causal relationships between taxa and clinical variables. Testing our methods on three longitudinal microbiome data sets we show that our pipeline improve upon prior methods developed for this task. We also discuss the biological insights provided by the models which include several known and novel interactions.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose a computational pipeline for analyzing longitudinal microbiome data. Our results provide evidence that microbiome alignments coupled with dynamic Bayesian networks improve predictive performance over previous methods and enhance our ability to infer biological relationships within the microbiome and between taxa and clinical factors.",

Here we introduce probabilistic cell typing by in situ sequencing (pciSeq), an approach that leverages prior scRNA-seq classification to identify cell types using multiplexed in situ RNA detection. We applied this method to map the inhibitory neurons of hippocampal area CA1, a cell system critical for memory function, for which ground truth is available from extensive prior work identifying the laminar organization of subtly differing cell types. Our method confidently identified 16 interneuron classes, in a spatial arrangement closely matching ground truth.

    "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) are widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, and microbial viruses, and bring about unparalleled levels of sequence variation in target proteins. While DGR variable proteins share low sequence identity, the structures of several such proteins have revealed the C-type lectin (CLec)-fold as a conserved scaffold for accommodating massive sequence variation. This conservation has led to the suggestion that the CLec-fold may be useful in molecular surface display applications. Thermostability is an attractive feature in such applications, and thus we studied the variable protein of a DGR encoded by the thermophile Thermus aquaticus. We report here the 2.8 [A] resolution crystal structure of the variable protein from the T. aquaticus DGR, called TaqVP, and confirm that it has a CLec-fold. Remarkably, its variable region is nearly identical in structure to those of several other CLec-fold DGR variable proteins despite low sequence identity among these. TaqVP was found to be thermostable, which appears to be a property shared by several CLec-fold DGR variable proteins. These results provide impetus for the pursuit of the DGR variable protein CLec-fold in molecular display applications.",

We tested whether: (A) elevated cf DNA in response to three repeated bouts of exhaustive exercise has decreased integrity; (B) each bout of exercise increases luminol enhanced whole blood chemiluminescence (LBCL) as a measure of ROS production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Eleven men performed three treadmill exercise tests to exhaustion separated by 72 hours of resting. Pre- and post-exercise concentrations and integrity of cf nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (cf n-DNA, cf mt-DNA) and resting and fMLP-stimulated LBCL were determined. Each bout increased concentrations of cf n-DNA by more than 10-times which was accompanied by about 2-times elevated post-exercise rLBCL and fMLP-LBCL. Post-exercise cf n-DNA integrity (integrity index, I206/78) decreased after the first (0.59{+/-}0.19 vs. 0.48{+/-}0.18) and second (0.53{+/-}0.14 vs. 0.44{+/-}0.17) bout of exercise.

This proposal has been upheld by data from image analyses, but is yet to be tested at the behavioural level. The present study conducts a traditional contrast sensitivity task for face images of various facial expressions. Findings show that visual contrast thresholds do not differ for different facial expressions We re-conduct analysis of faces effective contrast, using the procedure developed by Hedger, Garner, & Adams (2015), and show that higher effective contrast in fearful face expressions relies on face images first being normalised for RMS contrast. When not normalised for RMS contrast, effective contrast in fear expressions is no different, or sometimes even lower, compared to other expressions. These findings are discussed in relation to the implications of contrast normalisation on the salience of face expressions in behavioural and neurophysiological experiments, and also the extent that natural physical differences between facial stimuli are masked during stimulus standardisation and normalisation.",

First, NSC13062 was validated as a starting compound for the described SAR studies in a variety of cell-based viability assays. Then, a small library of 1,4-naphthoquinines (1,4-NQs) and quinoline-5,8-diones was tested in cell viability assays using pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 cells and normal human hepatocytes. The obtained data allowed us to select a set of both non-toxic compounds that preferentially induced apoptosis in cancer cells and toxic compounds that induced apoptosis in both cancer and normal cells. Anti-cancer activity of the selected non-toxic compounds was confirmed in viability assays using breast cancer HCC1187 cells. Consequently, the two sets of compounds were tested in multiple cell-based and in vitro activity assays to identify key factors responsible for the observed activity. Inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) is a key distinguishing activity between the non-toxic and toxic compounds. Finally, we developed a mathematical model that was able to distinguish these two sets of compounds. The development of this model supports our conclusion that appropriate quantitative SAR (QSAR) models have the potential to be employed to develop anticancer compounds with improved potency while maintaining non-toxicity to normal cells.",

    "abstract": "AimAlthough it is commonly proposed that nutrient cycling can impact plant community diversity, this relationship has not been fully examined in arid and semi-arid zones. Here, we expand on the framework for evaluating the relationship between biodiversity and ecological stoichiometry by scaling up from the level of the community.\\n\\nLocationThe upper reaches of the Tarim River (Northwest China, 80{degrees}10-84{degrees}36E, 0{degrees}25-41{degrees}10N).\\n\\nMethodsWe used multivariate analysis of variance to compare the stoichiometric characteristics and species diversity indices of sampled plant communities. We also measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) content of plants. We then assessed correlations between community stoichiometry and species diversity through structural equation models (SEM) and redundancy analysis (RDA).\\n\\nResultsWe found that the differences between stoichiometric characteristics and community diversity indices were highly significant. The Margalef index was strongly related to C and P content. The Simpsons index and Shannon-Weaner index were most strongly correlated with C content. Pielous index was closely related to C and N contents, and the C:N and C:P ratios were important at driving ecological dominance.\\n\\nMain ConclusionsOur study highlights the importance of ecological stoichiometry in driving community assembly and diversity within a desert ecosystems in northwestern China. The relationship between eclogical stoichiometry in the desert plant community had an effect on species diversity, and it was a good indicator of plant community diversity.",

    "abstract": "A major barrier to curing HIV is the long-lived latent reservoir that supports re-emergence of HIV upon treatment interruption. Targeting this reservoir will require mechanistic insights into the establishment and maintenance of HIV latency. Whether T cell signaling at the time of HIV-1 infection influences productive replication or latency is not fully understood. We used a panel of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with different ligand binding affinities to induce a range of signaling strengths to model differential T cell receptor signaling at the time of HIV-1 infection. Stimulation of T cell lines or primary CD4+ T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors supported HIV-1 infection regardless of affinity for ligand; however, only signaling by the highest affinity receptor facilitated HIV-1 expression. Activation of chimeric antigen receptors that had intermediate and low binding affinities did not support provirus transcription, suggesting that a minimal signal is required for optimal HIV-1 expression. In addition, strong signaling at the time of infection produced a latent population that was readily inducible, whereas latent cells generated in response to weaker signals were not easily reversed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed HIV-1 transcription was limited by transcriptional elongation and that robust signaling decreased the presence of negative elongation factor, a pausing factor, by more than 80%. These studies demonstrate that T cell signaling influences HIV-1 infection and the establishment of different subsets of latently infected cells, which may have implications for targeting the HIV reservoir.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryActivation of CD4+ T cells facilitates HIV-1 infection; however, whether there are minimal signals required for the establishment of infection, replication, and latency has not been explored. To determine how T cell signaling influences HIV-1 infection and the generation of latently infected cells, we used chimeric antigen receptors to create a tunable model. Stronger signals result in robust HIV-1 expression and an inducible latent population. Minimal signals predispose cells towards latent infections that are refractory to reversal. We discovered that repression of HIV-1 transcription immediately after infection is due to RNA polymerase II pausing and inefficient transcription elongation. These studies demonstrate that signaling events influence the course of HIV-1 infection and have implications for cure strategies. They also provide a mechanistic explanation for why a significant portion of the HIV latent reservoir is not responsive to latency reversing agents which function by modifiying chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Macaque RFHV and LCV are close homologs of human KSHV and EBV, respectively. No experimental model of RFHV has been developed due to the lack of a source of culturable infectious virus. Screening of macaques at the Washington National Primate Research Center detected RFHV in saliva of SIV-infected macaques from previous vaccine studies. A pilot experimental infection of two naive juvenile pig-tailed macaques was initiated by inoculation of saliva from SIV-infected pig-tailed and cynomolgus macaque donors, which contained high levels of DNA of the respective species-specific RFHV strain. Both juvenile recipients developed SIV and RFHV infections with RFHV DNA detected transiently in saliva and/or PBMC around week 16 post-infection. One juvenile macaque was infected with the homologous RFHVMn from whole saliva of a pig-tailed donor, which had been inoculated into the cheek pouch. This animal became immunosuppressed, developing simian AIDS and was euthanized 23 weeks after inoculation. The levels of RFHV DNA in saliva and PBMC remained below the level of detection after week 17, showing no reactivation of the RFHVMn infection during the rapid development of AIDS. The other juvenile macaque was infected with the heterologous RFHVMf from i.v. inoculation of purified virions from saliva of a cynomolgus donor. The juvenile recipient remained immunocompetent, developing high levels of persistent anti-RFHV and -SIV antibodies. After the initial presence of RFHVMf DNA in saliva and PBMC decreased to undetectable levels by week 19, all attempts to reactivate the infection through additional inoculations, experimental infection with purified SRV-2 or SIV, or immunosuppressive treatments with cyclosporine or dexamethasone were unsuccessful. An heterologous LCV transmission was also detected in this recipient, characterized by continual high levels of LCVMf DNA from the cynomolgus donor in both saliva and PBMC, coupled with high levels of anti-LCV antibodies. The macaque was sacrificed 209 weeks after the initial inoculation. Low levels of LCVMf DNA were detected in salivary glands, tonsils and other lymphoid organs, while RFHVMf DNA was below the level of detection. These results show successful co-transmission of RFHV and LCV from saliva and demonstrate differential lytic activation of the different gammaherpesvirus lineages due to presumed differences in biology and tropism and control by the host immune system. Although this initial pilot transmission study utilized only two macaques, it provides the first evidence for experimental transmission of the macaque homolog of KSHV, setting the stage for larger transmission studies to examine the differential activation of rhadinovirus and lymphocryptovirus infections and the pathological effects of immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "Accurate representation of subject-specific bone anatomy in lower-limb musculoskeletal models is important for human movement analyses and simulations. Mathematical methods can reconstruct geometric bone models using incomplete imaging of bone by morphing bone model templates, but the validity of these methods has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal imaging requirements for accurate reconstruction of geometric bone models. Complete geometric pelvis and femur models of 14 healthy adults were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging through segmentation. From each complete bone segmentation, three sets of incomplete segmentations (set 1 being the most incomplete) were created to test the effect of imaging incompleteness on reconstruction accuracy. Geometric bone models were reconstructed from complete sets, three incomplete sets, and two motion capture-based methods. Reconstructions from (in)complete sets were generated using statistical shape modelling, followed by host-mesh and local-mesh fitting through the Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Client. Reconstructions from motion capture-based methods used positional data from skin surface markers placed atop anatomic landmarks and estimated joint centre locations as target points for statistical shape modelling and linear scaling. Accuracy was evaluated with distance error (mm) and overlapping volume similarity (%) between complete bone segmentation and reconstructed bone models, and statistically compared using a repeated measure analysis of variance (p<0.05). Motion capture-based methods produced significantly higher distance error than reconstructions from (in)complete sets. Pelvis volume similarity reduced significantly with the level of incompleteness: complete set (92.70{+/-}1.92%), set 3 (85.41{+/-}1.99%), set 2 (81.22{+/-}3.03%), set 1 (62.30{+/-}6.17%), motion capture-based statistical shape modelling (41.18{+/-}9.54%), and motion capture-based linear scaling (26.80{+/-}7.19%). A similar trend was observed for femur volume similarity. Results indicate that imaging two relevant bone regions produces overlapping volume similarity > 80% compared to complete segmented bone models. These findings have implications for improving movement analysis and simulation with subject-specific musculoskeletal models.",

    "abstract": "Cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs) comprise a multipotent population of cells that migrate into the pharyngeal arches of the vertebrate embryo and differentiate into a broad range of derivatives of the craniofacial organs. Consequently, migrating cNCCs are considered as one of the most attractive candidate sources of cells for regenerative medicine. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of cNCCs at different time points after induction by conducting three independent RNA sequencing experiments. We successfully induced cNCC formation from mouse induced pluripotent stem (miPS) cells by culturing them in neural crest inducing media for 14 days. We found that these cNCCs expressed several neural crest specifier genes but were lacking some previously reported specifiers, such as paired box 3 (Pax3), msh homeobox 1 (Msx1), and Forkhead box D3 (FoxD3), which are presumed to be essential for neural crest development in the embryo. Thus, a distinct molecular network may the control gene expression in miPS-derived cNCCs. We also found that c-Myc, ETS proto-oncogene 1, transcription factor (Ets1), and sex determining region Y-box 10 (Sox10) were only detected at 14 days after induction. Therefore, we assume that these genes would be useful markers for migratory cNCCs induced from miPS cells. Eventually, these cNCCs comprised a broad spectrum of protocadherin (Pcdh) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (Adamts) family proteins, which may be crucial in their migration.",

    "abstract": "Parasites are a selective force that shape host community structure and dynamics, but host communities can also influence parasitism. Understanding the dual nature from host-parasite interactions can be facilitated by quantifying the variation in parasite prevalence (i.e. the proportion of infected host individuals in a population) among host species and then comparing that variation to other ecological factors that are known to also shape host communities. Avian haemosporidian parasites (e.g. Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) are abundant and widespread representing an excellent model for the study of host-parasite interactions. Several geographic and environmental factors have been suggested to determine prevalence of avian haemosporidians in bird communities. However, much remains to be known regarding whether host and parasite traits, represented by phylogenetic distances among species and degree of specialization in host-parasite relationships, can influence parasite prevalence. The aims of this study were to analyze factors affecting prevalence in a bird community and to test whether the degree of parasite specialization on their hosts is determined by host traits. Our statistical analyses suggest that prevalence is mainly determined by the interaction between host species and parasite lineages where tolerance and/or susceptibility to parasites plays an essential role. Additionally, we found that although some of the parasite lineages infected a low number of bird species, the species they infected were distantly related and therefore the parasites themselves should not be considered typical host specialists. Prevalence was higher for generalist than for specialist parasites in some, but not all, host species. These results suggest that prevalence mainly results from the interaction between host immune defences and parasite exploitation strategies wherein the result of an association between particular parasite lineages and particular host species is idiosyncratic.",

    "abstract": "We compared the social dynamics of two populations of the live-bearing Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana) that live in adjacent habitats with very different predator regimes: cave mollies that inhabit a low-predation environment inside a sulfidic cave with a low density of predatory water bugs (Belostoma sp.), and mollies that live directly outside the cave (henceforth called \\\"surface\\\" mollies) in a high-predation environment with a high density of fish-eating birds. We filmed the social interactions of marked fish in both environments and analysed their social network dynamics using a Markov model under two different fish densities of 12 and 6 fish per 0.36 m2. As expected, surface mollies spent overall much more time social than cave mollies. This difference in overall social time was a result of surface mollies being less likely to discontinue social contact (once they had a social partner) and being more likely to resume social contact (once alone) than cave mollies. Interestingly surface mollies were also less likely to leave a current social partner than cave mollies. At low density, mollies (in both environments) were expected to show reduced social encounters which should dramatically change their social dynamics. Surface mollies, however, displayed an ability to maintain their social dynamics at low density (primarily by reducing the convex polygon spanned by the group) which was not observed in cave mollies. Despite the fact that we only compared two populations, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for density compensations of social dynamics that have also been observed in other fish species and give an example of how comparisons between the social dynamics of different populations can be made that go beyond conventional network analyses.",

Also, the content of polyphenols extracted from AFL was studied, and their relationship with antioxidant activity was investigated. MEAFL was tested for cytotoxicity on Vero cell line, with reference to IC50, and other non-toxic concentrations of all the extracts. The antiviral activity against HSV1 for all non-toxic concentrations of the extract was determined using plaque reduction assay. It was found that MEAFL showed a reduction of serum hepatic and renal cellular toxicity and cellular lipid peroxidation, as well as enhanced cellular antioxidant. Also, our results revealed that the inhibitory activity of the virus was dose dependent on the polyphenol content of the examined extract. The MIC for the MEAFL extract was determined as well as the EC50 and SI. Calculated SI showed promising value for the MEAFL, and hence can be used as therapeutic medication for HSV1. To study other possible mode of action, Vero cells were treated with the examined extracts before, during, and after virus infection to give an insight on the interference of the extract in each step in the virus life cycle. In conclusion, MEAFL showed a remarkable antioxidant effect against APAP induced organs toxicity. Also, examined extracts exhibited the antiviral activity against HSV1.",

Among each of 11 principles in the iDSI reference case, we translated all reporting standards and methodological specifications into quantifiable yes/no questions and awarded articles one point for each item satisfied. We then separately calculated reporting and methods scores, measured as percent adherence (0%=no adherence, 100%=full adherence). Using the year 2014 as the dissemination period, we conducted a pre-post analysis. Additionally, we conducted an analysis stratified by the 11 principles and examined different scoring strategies and dissemination periods in sensitivity analyses.\\n\\nResultsArticles averaged 74% adherence to reporting standards and 60% adherence to methodological specifications. Adherence to reporting standards increased slightly over time (72% pre-2014 vs. 75% post-2014, p<0.01), but methodological adherence did not significantly improve (59% pre-2014 vs. 60% post-2014, p=0.53).

    "abstract": "1Biological systems have evolved a degree of robustness with respect to perturbations in their environment and this capability is essential for their survival. In applications ranging from therapeutics to conservation, it is important to understand not only the sensitivity of biological systems to changes in their environments, but which features of these systems are necessary to achieve a given outcome. Mathematical models are increasingly employed to understand these mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses of such mathematical models provide insight into the responsiveness of the system when experimental manipulation is difficult. One common approach is to seek the probability distribution of the outputs of the system corresponding to a known distribution of inputs. By contrast, inverse sensitivity analysis determines the probability distribution of model inputs which produces a known distribution of outputs. The computational complexity of the methods used to conduct inverse sensitivity analyses for deterministic systems has limited their application to models with relatively few parameters. Here we describe a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo method we call \\\"Contour Monte Carlo\\\", which can be used to invert systems with a large number of parameters. We demonstrate the utility of this method by inverting a range of frequently-used deterministic models of biological systems, including the logistic growth equation, the Michaelis-Menten equation, and an SIR model of disease transmission with nine input parameters. We argue that the simplicity of our approach means it is amenable to a large class of problems of practical significance and, more generally, provides a probabilistic framework for understanding the inversion of deterministic models.\\n\\n2 Author summaryMathematical models of complex systems are constructed to provide insight into their underlying functioning. Statistical inversion can probe the often unobserved processes underlying biological systems, by proceeding from a given distribution of a models outputs (the aggregate \\\"effects\\\") to a distribution over input parameters (the constituent \\\"causes\\\"). The process of inversion is well-defined for systems involving randomness and can be described by Bayesian inference. The inversion of a deterministic system, however, cannot be performed by the standard Bayesian approach. We develop a conceptual framework that describes the inversion of deterministic systems with fewer outputs than input parameters. Like Bayesian inference, our approach uses probability distributions to describe the uncertainty over inputs and outputs, and requires a prior input distribution to ensure a unique \\\"posterior\\\" probability distribution over inputs. We describe a computational Monte Carlo method that allows efficient sampling from the posterior distribution even as the dimension of the input parameter space grows. This is a two-step process where we first estimate a \\\"contour volume density\\\" associated with each output value which is then used to define a sampling algorithm that yields the requisite input distribution asymptotically. Our approach is simple, broadly applicable and could be widely adopted.",

While no single functional atlas has emerged as the dominant atlas to date, there remains an underlying assumption that such an atlas exists. Using fMRI data from a highly sampled subject as well as two independent replication data sets, we demonstrate that functional atlases reconfigure substantially and in a meaningful manner, according to brain state.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, our understanding of their roles in mammalian physiology remains limited. Here we investigated the physiologic function of the conserved lncRNA Norad in vivo. Deletion of Norad in mice results in genomic instability and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to a dramatic multi-system degenerative phenotype resembling premature aging. Loss of tissue homeostasis in Norad-deficient animals is attributable to augmented activity of PUMILIO proteins, which act as post-transcriptional repressors of target mRNAs to which they bind. Norad is the preferred RNA target of PUMILIO2 (PUM2) in mouse tissues and, upon loss of Norad, PUM2 hyperactively represses key genes required for mitosis and mitochondrial function. Remarkably, enforced Pum2 expression fully phenocopies Norad deletion, resulting in rapid-onset aging-associated phenotypes. These findings provide new insights and open new lines of investigation into the roles of noncoding RNAs and RNA binding proteins in normal physiology and aging.",

    "abstract": "Changes in coloration enable animals to refine their camouflage to match different visual environments. Such plasticity provides ecological benefits and could potentially be exploited to support conservation or stock enhancement efforts. One application could be ensuring that hatchery-reared animals, reared to stock wild populations, are appropriately matched to their environment on release. European lobster (Homarus gammarus) hatcheries aim to restock or enhance local lobster populations by rearing juveniles through their most vulnerable stages, then releasing them into the wild. However, little consideration has been given to their camouflage and the implications of matching individuals to their release site. This study assesses to what extent juvenile lobsters can change coloration to match their background and whether hatchery practices could be altered to enhance lobster camouflage. We test this by switching individuals between black or white backgrounds in the laboratory and monitoring their coloration over time. Our work demonstrates the capacity of juvenile lobsters to change lightness in response to their surroundings. We show that juvenile lobsters are capable of small changes in luminance (perceived lightness) to better match their background over 2-3 weeks. These changes potentially correspond to improved camouflage, based on a model of predator (European pollack, Pollachius pollachius) vision. However, over a longer period (5 weeks), lobsters maintained on either background converged on the same darker coloration, suggesting that lobsters also experience changes in appearance associated with ontogeny. By refining the approaches used here, there is potential for hatcheries to rear lobsters on backgrounds that better match their release site. However, such manipulations should be considered in the context of ontogenetic changes and release timing (which varies between stocking programmes). This study highlights the potential to use colour change in stocking and aquaculture, as well as gaps that could be addressed through further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a complex morphology generated and maintained by membrane-shaping proteins and membrane energy minimization, though not much is known about how it is regulated. The architecture of this intracellular organelle is balanced between large, thin sheets that are densely packed in the perinuclear region and a connected network of branched, elongated tubules that extend throughout the cytoplasm. Sheet formation is known to involve the cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63 (CLIMP-63), though its regulation and the depth of its involvement remain unknown. Here we show that the post-translational modification of CLIMP-63 by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC6 controls the relative distribution of CLIMP-63 between the ER and the plasma membrane. By combining data-driven mathematical modeling, predictions, and experimental validation, we found that the attachment of a medium chain fatty acid, so-called S-palmitoylation, to the unique CLIMP-63 cytoplasmic cysteine residue drastically reduces its turnover rate, and thereby controls its abundance. Light microscopy and focused ion beam electron microcopy further revealed that enhanced CLIMP-63 palmitoylation leads to strong ER-sheet proliferation. Altogether, we show that ZDHHC6-mediated S-palmitoylation regulates the cellular localization of CLIMP-63, the morphology of the ER, and the interconversion of ER structural elements in mammalian cells through its action on the CLIMP-63 protein.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEukaryotic cells subcompartmentalize their various functions into organelles, the shape of each being specific and necessary for its proper role. However, how these shapes are generated and controlled is poorly understood. The endoplasmic reticulum is the largest membrane-bound intracellular compartment, accounting for more than 50% of all cellular membranes. We found that the shape and quantity of its sheet-like structures are controlled by a specific protein, cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63, through the acquisition of a lipid chain attached by an enzyme called ZDHHC6. Thus, by modifying the ZDHHC6 amounts, a cell can control the shape of its ER. The modeling and prediction technique used herein also provides a method for studying the interconnected function of other post-translational modifications in organelles.",

    "abstract": "We examined the pH/T duality of acidic pH and temperature (T) for the growth of grass shoots in order to determine the phenomenological equation of wall properties ( equation of state, EoS) for living plants. By considering non-meristematic growth as a dynamic series of  state transitions (STs) in the extending primary wall, we identified the  critical exponents (read: optimum) for this phenomenon, which exhibit a singular behaviour at a critical temperature, critical pH and critical chemical potential () in the form of four power laws: F{pi}({tau}){propto}|{tau}|{beta}-1, F{tau}({tau}){propto}|{pi}|1-, G({tau}){propto}|{tau}|-2-+2{beta} and G{tau}(){propto}||2-. The power-law exponents  and {beta} are numbers that are independent of pH (or ) and T, which are known as critical exponents, while {pi} and {tau} represent a reduced pH and reduced temperature, respectively. Various scaling predictions were obtained - the convexity relation  + {beta} [&ge;] 2 for practical pH-based analysis and a {beta} {equiv} 2 identity in a  microscopic representation. In the presented scenario, the magnitude that is decisive is the chemical potential of the H+ ions (protons), which force subsequent STs and growth. Furthermore, we observed that the growth rate is generally proportional to the product of the Euler beta functions of T and pH, which are used to determine the hidden content of the Lockhart constant [FE]. It turned out that the evolution equation, when expressed in terms of the same dynamic set of variables, explains either the monotonic growth or periodic extension that is usually observed - like the one detected in pollen tubes - in a unified account. We suggest that cell growth evolves along the path with the least activity, thereby optimising growth under any physiological conditions. The pH dynamics in close-to-natural conditions appears to essentially be responsible for this extreme trajectory, thereby providing a highly nonlinear pH(t), [Formula] transformation. Moreover, the drops in pH that are induced by auxin or fusicoccin, when next converted by the augmented Lockhart equation, are enough to explain a significant fraction of the increase in the growth rate. A self-consistent recurring model is proposed to embrace the inherent complexity of such a biological system, in which several intricate pathways work simultaneously, in order to reconcile the conflicting views of plant cell extension and growth. Eventually, we pose the question: Is the chemical potential of protons a master regulator for tip-growing cells?\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn plant development, sudden changes such as cell expansion or pollen tube oscillations seem to depend on a correlative group of events rather than on slow shifts in the apex. Hence, in order to understand or to control the processes in the extending cell wall, we need to unravel the general principles and constraints that govern growth. The quest for these principles has primarily focused on the molecular, though merely descriptive, level. Here, we show that it is possible to analyse oscillatory state changes computationally without even requiring knowledge about the exact type of transition. Our results suggest that the cell wall properties and growth of plant cells can be accurately and efficiently predicted by a set of physical and chemical variables such as temperature, pressure and the dynamic pH of the growing plant, which build a scaffold for more specific biochemical predictions. In this context, we observed that cell growth evolves along the path the least action, thereby optimising growth under any physiological conditions. The model equations that we propose span the fields of the biological, physical, chemical and Earth sciences. The common denominator that ties the growth factors together is the chemical potential of protons, which is possibly a central core-controlling mechanism that is able to produce a macroscopic outcome, i.e. structurally and temporally organised apical growth.",

Despite extensive biochemical and structural investigations, how their translocation activity is utilized chemo-mechanically in DNA unwinding is poorly understood. We examined DNA unwinding by G40P, a DnaB-family helicase, using a single-molecule fluorescence assay with a single base pair resolution. The high-resolution assay revealed that G40P by itself is a very weak helicase that stalls at barriers as small as a single GC base pair and unwinds DNA with the step size of a single base pair. Single ATP{gamma}S binding could stall unwinding, demonstrating highly coordinated ATP hydrolysis between the six identical subunits. We observed frequent slippage of the helicase, which is fully suppressed by the primase DnaG. We anticipate that these findings allow a better understanding on the fine balance of thermal fluctuation activation and energy derived from hydrolysis.",

A long-standing hypothesis to account for this temporal fate specification process is that NPCs change their differentiation potential over time. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these temporal changes in NPC properties are poorly understood. Here we show that Neurogenin1 and Neurogenin2 (Neurog1/2), two proneural transcription factors expressed in NPCs throughout cortical neurogenesis, specify the identity of one of the first cortical neuron subtypes generated, layer 6 cortico-thalamic neurons (CTNs). We found that Neurog1/2 specify the CTN fate through regulation of the cortical fate determinants Fezf2 and Foxp2 and that this Neurog-induced programme becomes inactive after the period of CTN production. Two independent mechanisms contribute to the arrest of CTN neuron generation at the end of layer 6 neurogenesis, including a reduction in the transcriptional activity of Neurog1/2 and the deposition of epigenetic repressive modifications mediated by Polycomb repressive complexes at the Foxp2 gene. Therefore, the duration of production of a cortical neuron subtype is controlled by multiple locking mechanisms involving both transcriptional and epigenetic processes.",

Early kidney organoids contained a SIX2+ population with a transcriptional profile akin to human nephron progenitors. Lineage-tracing using gene-edited induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines revealed that SIX2-expressing cells contribute to nephron formation but not to the putative collecting duct epithelium. However, Cre-mediated temporal induction of the SIX2+ lineage revealed a declining capacity for these cells to contribute to nephron formation over time. This suggests human kidney organoids, unlike the developing kidney in vivo, lack a nephron progenitor niche capable of both self-renewal and ongoing nephrogenesis.

Subsequent processing stages, accordingly, operate upon an optimized representation of the visual input, the orthographic prediction error, highlighting only the visual information relevant for word identification. We show that this optimized representation is related to orthographic word characteristics, accounts for word recognition behavior, and is processed early in the visual processing stream, i.e., in V4 and before 200 ms after word-onset. Based on these findings, we propose that prior visual-orthographic knowledge is used to optimize the representation of visually presented words, which in turn allows for highly efficient reading processes.",

We traced these lesions and examined resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) connectivity to these lesions and control lesions to find networks that would be disrupted specifically by mania-causing lesions. The results were then used as regions-of-interest to examine rsfMRI connectivity in patients with bipolar disorder (n=16) who underwent imaging longitudinally across states of both mania and euthymia alongside a cohort of healthy participants scanned longitudinally.

    "abstract": "Component analysis is a powerful tool to identify dominant patterns of interactions in multivariate datasets. In the context of fMRI data, methods such as principal component analysis or independent component analysis have been used to identify the brain networks shaping functional connectivity (FC). Importantly, these approaches are static in the sense that they ignore the temporal information contained in fMRI time series. Therefore, the corresponding components provide a static characterization of FC. Building upon recent findings suggesting that FC dynamics encode richer information about brain functional organization, we use a dynamic extension of component analysis to identify dynamic modes (DMs) of fMRI time series. We demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of this approach using resting-state and motor-task fMRI data of 730 healthy subjects of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). In resting-state, dominant DMs have strong resemblance with classical resting-state networks, with an additional temporal characterization of the networks in terms of oscillatory periods and damping times. In motor-task conditions, dominant DMs reveal interactions between several brain areas, including but not limited to the posterior parietal cortex and primary motor areas, that are not found with classical activation maps. Finally, we identify two canonical components linking the temporal properties of the resting-state DMs with 158 behavioral and demographic HCP measures. Altogether, these findings illustrate the benefits of the proposed dynamic component analysis framework, making it a promising tool to characterize the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity.",

    "abstract": "The importance of how brain networks function together to create brain states has become increasingly recognized. Therefore, an investigation of eyes-open resting state dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) of healthy controls (HC) versus that of schizophrenia patients (SP) via both fMRI and a novel MEG pipeline was completed. The fMRI analysis used a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to determine the networks on which the dFNC was based. The MEG analysis utilized a source-space activity estimate (MNE/dSPM) whose result was the input to a spatial ICA, on which the networks of the MEG dFNC was based. We found that dFNC measures reveal significant differences between HC and SP, which depended upon the imaging modality. Consistent with previous findings, a dFNC analysis predicated on fMRI data revealed HC and SP remain in different overall brain states (defined by a k-means clustering of network correlations) for significantly different periods of time, with SP spending less time in a highly-connected state. The MEG dFNC, in contrast, revealed group differences in more global statistics: SP changed between meta-states (k-means cluster states that are allowed to overlap in time) significantly more often and to states which were more different, relative to HC. MEG dFNC also revealed a highly connected state where a significant difference was observed in inter-individual variability, with greater variability among SP. Overall, our results show that fMRI and MEG reveal between-group functional connectivity differences in distinct ways, highlighting the utility of using each of the modalities individually, or potentially a combination of modalities, to better inform our understanding of disorders such as schizophrenia.",

Moreover, we show that these defects are prevented by Parp1 inhibition and/or deletion.

Population imaging reveals three spatially-clustered regions of Purkinje cell activity along the rostrocaudal axis. Complementary single-cell electrophysiological recordings assign these Purkinje cells to one of three functional phenotypes that encode a specific visual, and not motor, signal via complex spikes. In contrast, simple spike output of most Purkinje cells is strongly driven by motor-related tail and eye signals. Interactions between complex and simple spikes show heterogeneous modulation patterns across different Purkinje cells, which become temporally restricted during swimming episodes.

    "abstract": "Drugs that target monoaminergic transmission represent a first-line treatment for major depression. Though a full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie antidepressant efficacy is lacking, evidence supports a role for enhanced excitatory transmission. This can occur through two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. The first involves increased function of excitatory neurons through relatively direct mechanisms such as enhanced dendritic arborization. Another mechanism involves reduced inhibitory function, which occurs with the rapid antidepressant ketamine. Consistent with this, GABAergic interneuron-mediated cortical inhibition is linked to reduced gamma oscillatory power, a rhythm also diminished in depression. Remission of depressive symptoms correlates with restoration of gamma power.\\n\\nDue to strong excitatory input, reliable GABA release and fast firing, PV neurons represent critical pacemakers for synchronous oscillations. PV neurons also represent the predominant GABAergic population enveloped by perineuronal nets (PNNs), lattice-like structures that localize glutamatergic input. Disruption of PNNs enhances lateral diffusion of glutamate receptors, reduces PV excitability, and enhances gamma activity.\\n\\nStudies suggest that monoamine reuptake inhibitors reduce integrity of the PNN. Mechanisms by which these inhibitors reduce PNN integrity, however, remain largely unexplored. A better understanding of these issues might encourage development of therapeutics that best upregulate PNN modulating proteases.\\n\\nWe observe that the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine reduces PNN integrity in murine brain. Moreover, venlafaxine treated mice (30 mg/kg/day) show an increase in carbachol-induced gamma power in hippocampal slices. Studies with mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a protease linked to PNN disruption in other settings, suggest that MMP-9 contributes to venlafaxine-enhanced gamma activity.",

    "abstract": "Short-term plasticity (STP) of the presynaptic terminal maintains a brief history of activity experienced by the synapse that may otherwise remain unseen by the postsynaptic neuron. These synaptic changes are primarily regulated by calcium dynamics in the presynaptic terminal. A rapid increase in intracellular calcium is initiated by the opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels in response to depolarization, the main source of calcium required for vesicle fusion. Separately, electron-microscopic studies of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses reveal the strong presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in all presynaptic terminals. However, the precise role of the ER in modifying STP at the presynaptic terminal remains unexplored. To investigate the contribution of ER in modulating calcium dynamics in small hippocampal boutons, we performed in silico experiments in a physiologically-realistic canonical synaptic geometry based on reconstructions of CA3-CA1 Schaffer collaterals in the rat hippocampus. The model predicts that presynaptic calcium stores are critical in generating the observed paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of normal CA3-CA1 synapses. In control synapses with intact ER, SERCA pumps act as additional calcium buffers, lowering the intrinsic release probability of vesicle release and increasing PPR. In addition, the presence of ER allows ongoing activity to trigger calcium influx from the presynaptic ER via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Intracellular stores and their associated machinery also allows a synapse with a low release probability to operate more reliably due to attenuation of calcium fluctuations. Finally, blocking ER activity in the presynaptic terminal mimics the pathological state of a low facilitating synapse characterized in animal models of Alzheimers disease, and underscores the critical role played by presynaptic stores in normal function.",

    "abstract": "Concussions/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) represent a major public health concern due to persistent behavioral and neurological effects. The mechanisms by which concussions lead to such effects are partly attributable to an hyperacute indiscriminate glutamate release. Cerebral microdialysis studies in rodents reported a peak of extracellular glutamate 10 minutes after injury. Microdialysis has the advantage of being one of the few techniques allowing the quantification of neurotransmitters in vivo and at different time points following injury. In addition to the clear advantages afforded by microdialysis, the Wayne State weight-drop model induces an impact on the skull of a subject unrestrained by the fall of a weight. The latter model allows rapid acceleration and deceleration of the head and torso, an essential feature in human craniocerebral trauma and a factor that is missing from many existing animal concussion models. In the present study, we applied the Wayne State procedure and microdialysis to document, in awake rats, the acute changes in extracellular hippocampal glutamate and GABA levels resulting from concussive trauma. We studied the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region as it contains a high density of glutamatergic terminal and receptors, thus making it vulnerable to excitotoxic insult. Using HPLC, dialysate levels of hippocampal glutamate and GABA were measured in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in 10 min increments for 60 min prior to, during and for 90 min following concussive trauma induced by the Wayne State weight-drop procedure. Sham control animals were treated in the same manner but without receiving the concussive trauma procedure. Our results show that concussive trauma is followed, within 10 min, by a robust, transient 3-fold increase in hippocampal glutamate levels; such changes were not seen in controls. In contrast, GABA levels were unaffected by the concussive trauma procedure. The findings derived from the approach used here are generally consistent with those of previous other studies. They also provide a crucial in vivo validation of the Wayne State procedure as a model with promising translational potential for pre-clinical studies on early therapeutic responses to concussion.",

    "abstract": "The mesial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and the ventral striatum are key nodes of the human mesial fronto-striatal circuit involved in decision-making and executive function and pathological disorders. Here we ask whether deep wide-field repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) influences resting state functional connectivity. In Study 1, we examined functional connectivity using resting state multi-echo and independent components analysis in 154 healthy subjects to characterize default connectivity in the MPFC and mid-cingulate cortex (MCC). In Study 2, we used inhibitory, 1 Hz deep rTMS with the H7-coil targeting MPFC and dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) in a separate group of 20 healthy volunteers and examined pre-and post-TMS functional connectivity using seed-based and independent components analysis. In Study 1, we show that MPFC and MCC have distinct patterns of functional connectivity with MPFC-ventral striatum showing negative, whereas MCC-ventral striatum showing positive functional connectivity. Low-frequency rTMS decreased functional connectivity of MPFC and dACC with the ventral striatum. We further showed enhanced connectivity between MCC and ventral striatum. These findings emphasize how deep inhibitory rTMS using the H7-coil can influence underlying network functional connectivity by decreasing connectivity of the targeted MPFC regions, thus potentially enhancing response inhibition and decreasing drug cue reactivity processes relevant to addictions. The unexpected finding of enhanced default connectivity between MCC and ventral striatum may be related to the decreased influence and connectivity between the MPFC and MCC. These findings are highly relevant to the treatment of disorders relying on the mesioprefrontal-cingulo-striatal circuit.",

    "abstract": "Maternal immune activation (MIA) is consistently associated with elevated risk for multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders in the affected offspring. Converging lines of evidence from humans and animal models suggest a link between MIA and early entry into an atypical neurodevelopmental trajectory characterised by time- and sex-dependent abnormalities in brain structure and function. However to date, no such studies have investigated the brain-wide impact of MIA in the early post-weaning period, a critical and dynamic window of brain development. To address this, we acquired high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images from Wistar rat brains on postnatal day (PD) 21 following exposure to the viral mimetic poly (I:C) or sterile saline on gestational day (GD) 15 using a recently validated protocol. Using a combination of atlas-based segmentation and tensor based morphometry analysis we observed that MIA resulted in a significant increase in the relative volume of the diagonal domain (FDR q<0.1). Additional trend-level volume increases (p<0.05 uncorrected) were also found for the olfactory structures and preoptic area. Although not significant after FDR correction, we found trend-level evidence (p<0.05 uncorrected) for MIA x sex interactions in the volume of the diagonal domain, nucleus accumbens, pineal gland and anterior commissure. In contrast to volume, we found no evidence for microstructural alterations in our DTI dataset at PD21. These data provide new insights into the specific effects of MIA early in development, highlighting in particular, the diagonal domain as a target for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Disseminated infections with the fungal species Cryptococcus neoformans or, less frequently, C. gattii, are a leading cause of mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Central to the virulence of both species is an elaborate polysaccharide capsule that consists predominantly of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). Due to its abundance, GXM is an ideal target for host antibodies, and several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have previously been derived using purified GXM or whole capsular preparations as antigen. In addition to their application in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis, anti-GXM mAbs are invaluable tools for studying capsule structure. In this study, we report the production and characterisation of a novel anti-GXM mAb, Crp127, that unexpectedly reveals a role for GXM remodelling during the process of fungal Titanisation. We show that Crp127 recognises a GXM epitope in an O-acetylation dependent, but xylosylation-independent, manner. The epitope is differentially expressed by the four main serotypes of Cryptococcus neoformans and gattii, is heterogeneously expressed within clonal populations of C. gattii serotype B strains and is typically confined to the central region of the enlarged capsule. Uniquely, however, this epitope redistributes to the capsular surface in Titan cells, a recently recognised subset of giant fungal cells that are produced in the host lung and are critical for successful infection. Crp127 therefore highlights hitherto unexpected features of cryptococcal morphological change and may hold significant therapeutic potential in differentially identifying cryptococcal strains and subtypes.\\n\\nImportanceCryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are the etiological agents of cryptococcosis, an invasive fungal infection responsible for approximately 200,000 deaths each year and 15% of AIDS-related deaths annually. Whilst the main virulence factor for both species is a highly variable polysaccharide capsule, formation of Titan cells also underlies the pathogenesis of C. neoformans. Previous studies have shown that capsule composition differs between yeast and Titan cells, however no clear distinctions in the expression or localisation of specific capsular epitopes have been made. In this study, we characterise a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to a capsular epitope that is differentially distributed throughout the capsules produced by yeast and Titan cells. Whilst this epitope is found within the midzone of yeast capsules, the presentation of this epitope on the surface of Titan cell capsules may represent a way in which these cell types are perceived differently by the immune system.",

    "abstract": "The ability to routinely design functional proteins, in a targeted manner, would have enormous implications for biomedical research and therapeutic development. Computational protein design (CPD) offers the potential to fulfill this need, and though recent years have brought considerable progress in the field, major limitations remain. Current state-of-the-art approaches to CPD aim to capture the determinants of structure from physical principles. While this has led to many successful designs, it does have strong limitations associated with inaccuracies in physical modeling, such that a robust general solution to CPD has yet to be found. Here we propose a fundamentally novel design framework--one based on identifying and applying patterns of sequence-structure compatibility found in known proteins, rather than approximating them from models of inter-atomic interactions. Specifically, we systematically decompose the target structure to be designed into structural building blocks we call TERMs (tertiary motifs) and use rapid structure search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to identify sequence patterns associated with each TERM from known protein structures that contain it. These results are then combined to produce a sequence-level pseudo-energy model that can score any sequence for compatibility with the target structure. This model can then be used to extract the optimal-scoring sequence via combinatorial optimization or otherwise sample the sequence space predicted to be well compatible with folding to the target. Here we carry out extensive computational analyses, showing that our method, which we dub dTERMen (design with TERM energies): 1) produces native-like sequences given native crystallographic or NMR backbones, 2) produces sequence-structure compatibility scores that correlate with thermodynamic stability, and 3) is able to predict experimental success of designed sequences generated with other methods, and 4) designs sequences that are found to fold to the desired target by structure prediction more frequently than sequences designed with an atomistic method. As an experimental validation of dTERMen, we perform a total surface redesign of Red Fluorescent Protein mCherry, marking a total of 64 residues as variable. The single sequence identified as optimal by dTERMen harbors 48 mutations relative to mCherry, but nevertheless folds, is monomeric in solution, exhibits similar stability to chemical denaturation as mCherry, and even preserves the fluorescence property. Our results strongly argue that the PDB is now sufficiently large to enable proteins to be designed by using only examples of structural motifs from unrelated proteins. This is highly significant, given that the structural database will only continue to grow, and signals the possibility of a whole host of novel data-driven CPD methods. Because such methods are likely to have orthogonal strengths relative to existing techniques, they could represent an important step towards removing remaining barriers to robust CPD.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution microscopy has become essential for the study of nanoscale biological processes. This type of imaging often requires the use of specialised image analysis tools to process a large volume of recorded data and extract quantitative information. In recent years, our team has built an open-source image analysis framework for super-resolution microscopy designed to combine high performance and ease of use. We named it NanoJ - a reference to the popular ImageJ software it was de-veloped for. In this paper, we highlight the current capabilities of NanoJ for several essential processing steps: spatio-temporal alignment of raw data (NanoJ-Core), super-resolution image re-construction (NanoJ-SRRF), image quality assessment (NanoJ-SQUIRREL), structural modelling (NanoJ-VirusMapper) and control of the sample environment (NanoJ-Fluidics). We expect to expand NanoJ in the future through the development of new tools designed to improve quantitative data analysis and measure the reliability of fluorescent microscopy studies.",

    "abstract": "Proper positioning of nucleosomes in eukaryotic cells is determined by a complex interplay of factors, including nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, DNA sequence, and active chromatin remodeling. Yet, characteristic features of nucleosome positioning, such as gene-averaged nucleosome patterns, are surprisingly robust across perturbations, conditions, and species. Here, we explore how this robustness arises despite the underlying complexity. We leverage mathematical models to show that a large class of positioning mechanisms merely affects the quantitative characteristics of qualitatively robust positioning patterns. We demonstrate how statistical positioning emerges as an effective description from the complex interplay of different positioning mechanisms, which ultimately only renormalize the model parameter quantifying the effective softness of nucleosomes. This renormalization can be species-specific, rationalizing a puzzling discrepancy between the effective nucleosome softness of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. More generally, we establish a quantitative framework for dissecting the interplay of different nucleosome positioning determinants.",

We validate this system by pairing experimental measurements of nanosphere phantoms with a novel interferometric theory. Applying this system in vitro, we explore changes in higher-order chromatin structure and dynamics that occur due to cellular fixation, stem cell differentiation, and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. Finally, we discover a new phenomenon, cellular paroxysm, a near-instantaneous, synchronous burst of motion that occurs early in the process of UV induced cell death. Given this platforms ability to obtain nanoscale sensitive, millisecond resolved information within live cells without concerns of photobleaching, it has the potential to answer a broad range of critical biological questions about macromolecular behavior in live cells, particularly about the relationship between cellular structure and function.",

    "abstract": "The expression of the transcription factor brachyury (TBXT) is normally restricted to embryonic development and its silencing after mesoderm development is epigenetically regulated. In chordoma, a rare tumour of notochordal differentiation, TBXT acts as a putative oncogene, and we hypothesised that its expression could be controlled through epigenetic inhibition. Screening of five chordoma cell lines revealed that only inhibitors of the histone 3 lysine 27 demethylases KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (Jmjd3) reduce TBXT expression and lead to cell death, findings validated in primary patient-derived culture systems. Pharmacological inhibition of KDM6 demethylases leads to genome-wide increases in repressive H3K27me3 marks, accompanied by significantly reduced TBXT expression, an effect that is phenocopied by the dual genetic inactivation of KDM6A/B using CRISPR/Cas9. Transcriptional profiles in response to a novel KDM6A/B inhibitor, KDOBA67, revealed downregulation of critical genes and transcription factor networks for chordoma survival pathways, whereas upregulated pathways were dominated by stress, cell cycle and pro-apoptotic response pathways.\\n\\nThis study supports previous data showing that the function of TBXT is essential for maintaining notochord cell fate and function and provides further evidence that TBXT is an oncogenic driver in chordoma. Moreover, the data suggest that TBXT can potentially be targeted therapeutically by modulating epigenetic control mechanisms such as H3K27 demethylases.",

Primary chimeric mice successfully regenerated neutrophils, natural killer, T and B cells, irrespective of donor cell genotype. There were no significant differences in total myeloid cell or neutrophil numbers between DPP9-WT and DPP9S729A-reconstituted mice. There were fewer B cells in the DPP9S729A-origin compared to DPP9 WT-origin mice in primary chimeric mice. In secondary chimeric mice, cells of DPP9S729A-origin cells displayed enhanced engraftment compared to WT. However, we observed no differences in myeloid or lymphoid lineage reconstitution between WT and DPP9S729A donors, indicating that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment and self-renewal is not diminished by the absence of DPP9 enzymatic activity. This is the first report on transplantation of bone marrow cells that lack DPP9 enzymatic activity.",

We engineered an optogenetic system using the plant photoreceptor phytochrome B to selectively control the dynamics of ligand binding to the TCR by light. Combining experiments with mathematical modeling we find that the ligand-TCR interaction half-life is the decisive factor for activating downstream TCR signaling, substantiating the KPR hypothesis.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe half-life of the ligand-T cell receptor complex determines T cell activation.",

    "abstract": "Bestrophin (BEST1-4 in humans) channels are ligand gated chloride (Cl-) channels that are activated by calcium (Ca2+). Mutations in BEST1 cause retinal degenerative diseases. Partly because these channels have no sequence or structural similarity to other ion channels, the molecular mechanisms underlying gating are unknown. Here, we present a series of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of chicken BEST1, determined at 3.1 [A] resolution or better, that represent the principal gating states of the channel. Unlike other channels, opening of the pore is due to the repositioning of tethered pore-lining helices within a surrounding protein shell that dramatically widens a \\\"neck\\\" of the pore through a concertina of amino acid rearrangements within the protein core. The neck serves as both the activation and the inactivation gate. The binding of Ca2+ to a cytosolic domain instigates pore opening and the structures reveal that, unlike voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, similar molecular rearrangements are responsible for inactivation and deactivation. A single aperture within the 95 [A]-long opened pore separates the cytosol from the extracellular milieu and controls anion permeability. The studies define the basis for Ca2+-activated Cl- channel function and reveal a new molecular paradigm for gating in ligand-gated ion channels.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is an embryonic malignancy arises out of the neural crest cells of the sympathetic nervous system. It is the most common childhood tumor and well known for its spontaneous regression via the process of differentiation. The induction of differentiation using small molecule modulators such as all trans retinoic acid is one of the treatment strategies to treat the residual disease. In this study, we have reported the effect of kaempferol, a phytoestrogen in inducing differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with kaempferol reduced the proliferation and enhanced apoptosis along with the induction of neuritogenesis. Analysis of the expression of neuron specific markers such as {beta} III tubulin, neuron specific enolase and NRDG1 (N-myc down regulated gene 1) revealed the process of differentiation accompanying kaempferol induced apoptosis. Further analysis on understanding the molecular mechanism of action showed that the activity of kaempferol happened through the activation of the endoribonuclease activity of IRE1 (Inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident transmembrane protein. The in silico docking analysis and biochemical assays using recombinant human IRE1 confirms the binding of kaempferol to the ATP binding site of IRE1 and thereby activating ribonuclease activity. Treatment of cells with the small molecule inhibitor STF083010 which specifically targets and inhibits the endoribonuclease activity of IRE1 showed reduced expression of neuron specific markers and curtailed neuritogenesis. The knock down of IRE1 using plasmid based shRNA lentiviral particles also showed diminished changes in the change in morphology of the cells upon kaempferol treatment. Thus our study suggests that kaempferol induces differentiation of neuroblastoma cells via the IRE1-XBP1 pathway.",

Interestingly, we found knockdown of either VLDLR or SDC2 dramatically reduced collagen production to TGF-{beta}1, suggesting that both proteins might play a novel role in myofibroblast biology and pathogenesis of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

Gene therapy, viral infection and transfection require DNA to traverse the crowded cytoplasm, including a heterogeneous cytoskeleton of filamentous proteins. Given the complexity of cellular crowding, the dynamics of biological molecules can be highly dependent on the spatiotemporal scale probed. We present a powerful platform that spans molecular and cellular scales by coupling single-molecule conformational tracking (SMCT) and selective-plane illumination differential dynamic microscopy (SPIDDM). We elucidate the transport and conformational properties of large DNA, crowded by custom-designed networks of actin and microtubules, to link single-molecule conformations with ensemble DNA transport and cytoskeleton structure. We show that actin crowding leads to DNA compaction and suppression of fluctuations, combined with anomalous subdiffusion and heterogeneous transport, whereas microtubules have much more subdued impact across all scales. Interestingly, in composite networks of both filaments, microtubules primarily govern single-molecule DNA dynamics whereas actin governs ensemble transport.",

    "abstract": "The observation that humans can produce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 has generated enthusiasm about the potential for a bnAb vaccine against HIV-1. Conventional immunization strategies will likely be insufficient for the development of a bnAb HIV vaccine and vaccines to other difficult pathogens, due to the significant immunological hurdles posed, including B cell immunodominance and germinal center (GC) quantity and quality. Using longitudinal lymph node fine needle aspirates, we found that two independent methods of slow delivery immunization of rhesus macaques (RM) resulted in larger GCs, more robust and sustained GC Tfh cell responses, and GC B cells with improved Env-binding, which correlated with the development of ~20 to 30-fold higher titers of tier 2 HIV-1 nAbs. Using a new RM genomic immunoglobulin loci reference sequence, we identified differential IgV gene usage between slow delivery immunized and conventional bolus immunized animals. The most immunodominant IgV gene used by conventionally immunized animals was associated with many GC B cell lineages. Ab mapping of those GC B cell specificities demonstrated targeting of an immunodominant non-neutralizing trimer base epitope, while that response was muted in slow delivery immunized animals. Thus, alternative immunization strategies appear to enhance nAb development by altering GCs and modulating immunodominance of non-neutralizing epitopes.",

Therefore, we characterised 27 FPs in vivo using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model organism.

Using this strategy, we characterised the FPs for brightness, photostability, photochromicity and pH-sensitivity, achieving a comprehensive in vivo characterisation. Many FPs showed different in vivo properties compared to existing in vitro data. Additionally, various FPs were photochromic, which affects readouts due to complex bleaching kinetics. Finally, we codon optimized the best performing FPs for optimal expression in yeast, and found that codon-optimization alters FP characteristics. These FPs improve experimental signal readout, opening new experimental possibilities. Our results may guide future studies in yeast that employ fluorescent proteins.",

    "abstract": "The molecular regulation of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mammals remains poorly understood. Primed mouse embryonic stem cells contain a rare subset of \\\"2C-like\\\" cells that are epigenetically and transcriptionally similar to the two cell embryo and thus represent an ideal system for studying ZGA transcription regulation. Recently, the transcription factor Dux, expressed exclusively in the minor wave of ZGA, was described to activate many downstream ZGA transcripts. However, it remains unknown what upstream maternal factors initiate ZGA either in a Dux dependent or independent manner. Here we performed a candidate-based overexpression screen, identifying, amongst others, Developmental Pluripotency Associated 2 (Dppa2) and 4 (Dppa4) as positive regulators of 2C-like cells and ZGA transcription. In the germ line, promoter DNA demethylation coincides with upregulation of Dppa2 and Dppa4 which remain expressed until E7.5 when their promoters are remethylated. Furthermore, Dppa2 and Dppa4 are also expressed during iPSC reprogramming at the time 2C-like ZGA transcription transiently peaks. Through a combination of overexpression, knockdown, knockout and rescue experiments, together with transcriptional analyses, we show that Dppa2 and Dppa4 directly regulate the 2C-like cell population and associated transcripts, including Dux and the Zscan4 cluster. Importantly, we tease apart the molecular hierarchy in which the 2C-like transcriptional programme is initiated and stabilised. Dppa2 and Dppa4 require Dux to initiate 2C-like ZGA transcription, suggesting they act upstream by directly regulating Dux. Supporting this, ChIP-seq analysis revealed Dppa2 and Dppa4 bind to the Dux promoter and gene body and drive its expression. Zscan4c is also able to induce 2C-like cells in wild type cells, but, in contrast to Dux, can no longer do so in Dppa2/4 double knockout cells, suggesting it may act to stabilise rather than drive the transcriptional network. Our findings suggest a model in which Dppa2/4 binding to the Dux promoter leads to Dux upregulation and activation of the 2C-like transcriptional programme which is subsequently reinforced by Zscan4c.",
