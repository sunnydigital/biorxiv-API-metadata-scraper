    "abstract": "One common method of minimizing errors in large DNA sequence datasets is to drop variable sites with a minor allele frequency below some specified threshold. Though widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical SNP dataset to demonstrate the impacts of minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds on inference of population structure. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behavior is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq has been established as a reliable and accessible technique enabling new types of analyses, such as identifying cell types and studying spatial and temporal gene expression variation and change at single-cell resolution. Recently, single-cell RNA-seq has been applied to developing embryos, which offers great potential for finding and characterising genes controlling the course of development along with their expression patterns. In this study, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to the 16-cell stage of the Ciona embryo, a marine chordate and performed a computational search for cell-specific gene expression patterns. We recovered many known expression patterns from our single-cell RNA-seq data and despite extensive previous screens, we succeeded in finding new cell-specific patterns, which we validated by in situ and single-cell qPCR.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the dynamics of development, in which cells of recognizable types, or pure cell types, transition into other types over time, we propose a method of semi-soft clustering that can classify both pure and intermediate cell types from data on gene expression or protein abundance from individual cells. Called SOUP, for Semi-sOft clUstering with Pure cells, this novel algorithm reveals the clustering structure for both pure cells, which belong to one single cluster, as well as transitional cells with soft memberships. SOUP involves a two-step process: identify the set of pure cells and then estimate a membership matrix. To find pure cells, SOUP uses the special block structure the K cell types form in a similarity matrix, devised by pairwise comparison of the gene expression profiles of individual cells. Once pure cells are identified, they provide the key information from which the membership matrix can be computed. SOUP is applicable to general clustering problems as well, as long as the unrestrictive modeling assumptions hold. The performance of SOUP is documented via extensive simulation studies. Using SOUP to analyze two single cell data sets from brain shows it produce sensible and interpretable results.",

    "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiencies affect a large part of the world population. They are mostly due to the consumption of grains with insufficient content of Fe or Zn. Both de novo uptake by roots and recycling from leaves may provide seeds with nutrients. Autophagy, which is a conserved mechanism for nutrient recycling in eukaryotes, was shown to be involved in nitrogen remobilization to seeds. Here, we have investigated the role of this mechanism in micronutrient translocation to seeds. We found that several Arabidopsis thaliana plants impaired in autophagy display defects in nutrient remobilization to seeds. In atg5-1 mutant, which is completely defective in autophagy, the efficiency of Fe translocation from vegetative organs to seeds was severely decreased even when Fe was provided during seed formation. Combining atg5-1 with sid2 mutation that counteracts premature senescence associated to autophagy deficiency and using 57Fe pulse labeling, we could propose a two-step mechanism in which iron taken up de novo during seed formation is first accumulated in vegetative organs and subsequently remobilized to seeds. Finally, we showed that translocations of zinc and manganese to seeds are also dependent on autophagy. Fine tuning autophagy during seed formation opens therefore new possibilities to improve micronutrient remobilization to seeds.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of plasmids in all prokaryotic phyla and habitats and their ability to transfer between cells marks them as prominent constituents of prokaryotic genomes. Many plasmids are found in their host cell in multiple copies. This leads to an increased mutational supply of plasmid-encoded genes and genetically heterogeneous plasmid genomes. Nonetheless, the segregation of plasmid copies into daughter cells during cell division is considered to occur in the absence of selection on the plasmid alleles. We investigate the implications of random genetic drift of multicopy plasmids during cell division - termed here segregational drift - to plasmid evolution. Performing experimental evolution of low- and high-copy non-mobile plasmids in Escherichia coli, we find that the evolutionary rate of multicopy plasmids does not reflect the increased mutational supply expected according to their copy number. In addition, simulated evolution of multicopy plasmid alleles demonstrates that segregational drift leads to increased loss frequency and extended fixation time of plasmid mutations in comparison to haploid chromosomes. Furthermore, an examination of the experimentally evolved hosts reveals a significant impact of the plasmid type on the host chromosome evolution. Our study demonstrates that segregational drift of multicopy plasmids interferes with the retention and fixation of novel plasmid variants. Depending on the selection pressure on newly emerging variants, plasmid genomes may evolve slower than haploid chromosomes, regardless of their higher mutational supply. We suggest that plasmid copy number is an important determinant of plasmid evolvability due to the manifestation of segregational drift.",

    "abstract": "Searching for a specific visual object requires our brain to compare the items in view with a remembered representation of the sought target to determine whether a target match is present. This comparison is thought to be implemented, in part, via the combination of top-down modulations reflecting target identity with feed-forward visual representations. However, it remains unclear whether top-down signals are integrated at a single locus within the ventral visual pathway (e.g. V4) or at multiple stages (e.g. both V4 and inferotemporal cortex, IT). To investigate, we recorded neural responses in V4 and IT as rhesus monkeys performed a task that required them to identify when a target object appeared across variation in position, size and background context. We found non-visual, task-specific signals in both V4 and IT. To evaluate whether V4 was the only locus for the integration of top-down signals, we evaluated several feed-forward accounts of processing from V4 to IT, including a model in which IT preferentially sampled from the best V4 units and a model that allowed for nonlinear IT computation. IT task-specific modulation was not accounted for by any of these feed-forward descriptions, suggesting that during object search, top-down signals are integrated directly within IT.\\n\\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYTo find specific objects, the brain must integrate top-down, target-specific signals with visual information about objects in view. However, the exact route of this integration in the ventral visual pathway is unclear. In the first study to systematically compare V4 and IT during an invariant object search task, we demonstrate that top-down signals found in IT cannot be described as being inherited from V4, but rather must be integrated directly within IT itself.",

    "abstract": "Human functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data are acquired while participants engage in diverse perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional tasks. Although data are acquired temporally, they are most often treated in a quasi-static manner. Yet, a fuller understanding of the mechanisms that support mental functions necessitates the characterization of dynamic properties. Here, we describe an approach employing a class of recurrent neural networks called reservoir computing, and show the feasibility and potential of using it for the analysis of temporal properties of brain data. We show that reservoirs can be used effectively both for condition classification and for characterizing lower-dimensional \\\"trajectories\\\" of temporal data. Classification accuracy was approximately 90% for short clips of \\\"social interactions\\\" and around 70% for clips extracted from movie segments. Data representations with 12 or fewer dimensions (from an original space with over 300) attained classification accuracy within 5% of the full data. We hypothesize that such low-dimensional trajectories may provide \\\"signatures\\\" that can be associated with tasks and/or mental states. The approach was applied across participants (that is, training in one set of participants, and testing in a separate group), showing that representations generalized well to unseen participants. Taken together, we believe the present approach provides a promising framework to characterize dynamic fMRI information during both tasks and naturalistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plant asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) are expressed as inactive zymogens that perform seed storage protein maturation upon cleavage dependent auto-activation in the low pH environment of storage vacuoles. AEPs have attracted attention for their macrocyclization reactions and have been classified as cleavage or ligation specialists. However, we have recently shown that the ability of AEPs to produce either cyclic or acyclic products can be altered by mutations to the active site region, and that several AEPs are capable of macrocyclization given favorable pH conditions. One AEP extracted from Clitoria ternatea seeds (butelase 1) is classified as a ligase rather than a protease, presenting an opportunity to test for loss of cleavage activity. Here, making recombinant butelase 1 and rescuing an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lacking AEP, we show butelase 1 retains cleavage functions in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo rescue was incomplete, consistent with some trade-off for butelase 1 specialization toward macrocyclization. Its crystal structure showed an active site with only subtle differences from cleaving AEPs, suggesting the many differences in its peptide binding region are the source of its efficient macrocyclization. All considered, it seems either butelase 1 has not fully specialized or a requirement for auto-catalytic cleavage is an evolutionary constraint upon macrocyclizing AEPs.",

We explored the species diversification and biogeographical history of the Nemouridae family in the Japanese Archipelago using mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA markers. We collected 49 species among four genera: Indonemoura, Protonemura, Amphinemura and Nemoura in Japan, China, South Korea and North America. We estimated their divergence times--based on three molecular clock node calibrations--using Bayesian phylogeography approaches. Our results suggested that Japanese Archipelago formation events resulted in diversification events in the middle of the Cretaceous (<120 Ma), speciation in the Paleogene (<50 Ma) and intra-species diversification segregated into eastern and western Japan of the Fossa Magna region at late Neogene (20 Ma). The Indonemoura samples were genetically separated into two clades--that of Mainland China and that of Japan. The Japanese clade clustered with the Nemouridae species from North America, suggesting the possibility of a colonisation event prior to the formation of the Japanese Archipelago. We believe that our results enhanced the understanding both of the origin of the species and of local species distribution in the Japanese Archipelago.",

    "abstract": "Fructose 6-phosphate is an intermediate in the Calvin-Benson cycle and can be acted on by phosphoglucoisomerase to make glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) for starch synthesis. A high concentration of G6P is favorable for starch synthesis but can also stimulate G6P dehydrogenase initiating the glucose-6-phosphate shunt an alternative pathway around the Calvin-Benson cycle. A low concentration of glucose 6-phosphate will limit this futile cycle. In order to understand the biochemical regulation of plastidic glucose 6-phosphate supply and consumption, we characterized biochemical parameters of two key enzymes, phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH). We have found that the plastidic PGI in has a higher Km for G6P compared to that for fructose 6-phosphate. The Km of G6PDH isoform 1 is increased under reducing conditions. The other two isoforms exhibit less redox regulation; isoform 2 is the most inhibited by NADPH. Our results support the conclusion that PGI restricts stromal G6P synthesis limiting futile cycling via G6PDH. It also acts like a one-way valve, allowing carbon to leave the Calvin-Benson cycle but not reenter. We found flexible redox regulation of G6PDH that could regulate the glucose-6-phosphate shunt.\\n\\nHighlightGlucose 6-phosphate stimulates glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a mathematical model describing the potential buildup of high oxytocin concentrations in the maternal circulation during labor in terms of continuous Pitocin infusion rate, half-life and maternal weight. Oxytocin override of the degradation of oxytocin by placental oxytocinase is introduced to model the potential transfer of oxytocin from the maternal circulation across the placenta into the fetal circulation, and from there into the brain of the fetus. The desensitization unit D equal to 1.8E6 (pg-min)/ml is employed to establish a desensitization threshold, and by extension; a down-regulation threshold as a function of oxytocin override concentration and continuous Pitocin infusion time, that could be a factor in the subsequent development of autism among offspring. Epidemiological studies by Duke University (S.G. Gregory, 2013), Yale University (O. Weisman, 2015) and Harvard University (A.S. Oberg, 2016) are discussed regarding Pitocin use and offspring autism development for an explanation of the weak correlations they identified. The findings of the Harvard epidemiological study are re-interpreted regarding Pitocin use, and its conclusion questioned. Further evaluations of the findings of these three epidemiological studies are called for to incorporate medical information on quantity of Pitocin used, continuous Pitocin infusion rate, length of labor and maternal weight to determine if a correlation can be established with offspring autism development above an empirically determined desensitization threshold for Pitocin use.

    "abstract": "Landing maneuvers in flies are complex behaviors that may be conceptually decomposed into a sequence of modular behaviors such as body deceleration, extension of legs, and body rotations which are coordinated to ensure controlled touchdown. The composite nature of these behaviors means that there is variability in the kinematics of landing maneuvers, making it difficult to identify the general rules that govern this behavior. Many previous studies have relied on tethered preparations to study landing behaviors, but tethering constrains some behavioral modules to operate in an open feedback control loop while others remain in closed-loop, thereby inducing experimental artefacts. On the other hand, freely flying insects are hard to precisely control, which may also increase behavioral variability. One approach towards understanding the general rules underlying landing behavior is to determine the common elements of landing kinematics on surfaces that are oriented in different ways. We conducted a series of experiments in which the houseflies, Musca Domestica, were lured to specific visual targets on either vertical or inverted horizontal substrates. These conditions elicited landing behaviors in the flies that could be captured accurately using multiple high-speed video cameras. We filmed the houseflies landing on surfaces oriented along two directions: vertical (vertical landings), and upside down (inverted landings). Our experiments reveal that flies that are able to land feet-first in a controlled manner must satisfy specific criteria, failing which their landing performance is compromised causing their heads to bump into the surface during landing. Flies landing smoothly on both surfaces initiate deceleration at approximately fixed distances from the substrate and in direct proportion to the component of flight velocity normal to the landing surface. The ratio of perpendicular distance to the substrate and velocity at the onset of deceleration was conserved, despite the large differences in the mechanics of the vertical vs. inverted landings. Flies extend their legs independently of distance from the landing surface or their approach velocity normal to the surface, regardless of the orientation of the landing substrate. Together, these results show that the visual initiation of deceleration is robust to orientation of the landing surface, whereas the initiation of leg-extension may be context-dependent and variable which allows flies to land on substrates of various orientations in a versatile manner. These findings may also be of interest to roboticists that are interested in developing flapping robots that can land on surfaces of different orientations.",

    "abstract": "Immune response by T cells is essential for a healthy body against cancer, infection, and pathophysiological alteration. The activation and expansion of T cells can be inhibited by dasatinib, a tyrosine inhibitor, thus improving the outcome of diseases, such as autoimmune disease, graft-versus-host disease, and transplant rejection. The underlying mechanism of inhibition by dasatinib is elusive. Here, we designed and synthesized a CRISPR/Cas9 screening library that includes 6,149 genes. Using the library, we performed dasatinib CRISPR/cas9 screening in Jurkat cell, a T lymphocyte cell. We firstly identified survival essential genes for Jurkat cells. Comparing with other CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, we obtained Jurkat cell specific essential genes. By comparing dasatinib treatment to control, we identified a set of dasatinib targets, which includes known targets: CSK, LCK, ZAP70, and previously unknown targets: ZFP36L2, LRPPRC, CFLAR, PD-1, CD45 et al. Visualizing these target genes on T cell receptor signaling pathway, we found several genes could be inhibited by dasatinib. Furthermore, we introduced a framework, 9-square, to classify genes and found a group of genes that are associated with dasatinib resistance, possibly linking the side effects of dasatinib. These data reveal a set of dasatinib targets and demonstrate the molecular potential functions of dasatinib. Identification of dasatinib targets will broaden our understanding to its molecular mechanism, and thus benefits to clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "The polarized organization of the Drosophila oocyte can be visualized by examining the asymmetric localization of mRNAs, which is supported by networks of polarized microtubules (MTs). In this study, we used the gene forked, the putative Drosophila homologue of espin, to develop a unique genetic reporter for asymmetric oocyte organization. We generated a null allele of the forked gene using the CRISPRCas9 system and found that forked is not required for determining the axes of the Drosophila embryo. However, ectopic expression of a truncated form of GFP-Forked generated a distinct network of asymmetric Forked, which first accumulated at the oocyte posterior and was then restricted to the anterolateral region of the oocyte cortex in mid-oogenesis. This localization pattern resembled that reported for the polarized MTs network. Indeed, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of the polarized organization of the oocyte showed that the filamentous Forked network diffused throughout the entire cortical surface of the oocyte, as would be expected upon perturbation of oocyte polarization. Finally, we demonstrated that Forked associated with Short-stop and Patronin foci, which assemble non-centrosomal microtubule-organizing centers. Our results thus show that clear visualization of asymmetric GFP-Forked network localization can be used as a novel tool for studying oocyte polarity.\\n\\nSummary statementThe novel asymmetric Forked network could be used as a genetic reporter for visualizing and studying oocyte polarity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) was recently introduced to assess the capacity of thalamocortical circuits to engage in complex patterns of causal interactions. While showing high accuracy in detecting consciousness in brain injured patients, PCI depends on elaborate experimental setups and offline processing and has restricted applicability to other types of brain signals beyond transcranial magnetic stimulation and high-density EEG (TMS/hd-EEG) recordings.\n\nObjectiveWe aim to address these limitations by introducing PCIST, a fast method for estimating perturbational complexity of any given brain response signal.\n\nMethodsPCIST is based on dimensionality reduction and state transitions (ST) quantification of evoked potentials. The index was validated on a large dataset of TMS/hd-EEG recordings obtained from 108 healthy subjects and 108 brain injured patients, and tested on sparse intracranial recordings (SEEG) of 9 patients undergoing intra-cerebral single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES).\n\nResultsWhen calculated on TMS/hd-EEG potentials, PCIST performed with the same accuracy as the original PCI, while improving on the previous method by being computed in less than a second and requiring a simpler set-up. In SPES/SEEG signals, the index was able to quantify a systematic reduction of intracerebral complexity during sleep, confirming the occurrence of state-dependent changes in the effective connectivity of thalamocortical circuits, as originally assessed through TMS/hd-EEG.\n\nConclusionsPCIST represents a fundamental advancement towards the implementation of a reliable and fast clinical tool for the bedside assessment of consciousness as well as a general measure to explore the neuronal mechanisms of loss/recovery of brain complexity across scales and models.",

    "abstract": "c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a mitogen activated protein kinase, is activated in ischemia brain injury and plays an important role in cerebral ischemic injury. Emerging studies demonstrated that JNK-IN-8 (a specific JNK inhibitor) regulates traumatic brain injury through controlling neuronal apoptosis and inflammation. However, the role of JNK-IN-8 in ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanisms of JNK-IN-8 involving neuroprotection remain poorly understood. In the present study, male rats were subjected to tMCAO (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion) followed by treatment with JNK-IN-8, and then the modified improved neurological function score (mNSS), the Foot-fault test and the level of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and TNF-) were assessed. We found that JNK-IN-8-treated rats with MCAO exerted a significant improvement in spatial learning as measured by the improved mNSS, and showed sensorimotor functional recovery as measured by the Foot-fault test. JNK-IN-8 also exerted anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by decreased activation of microglia and the decreased expresson of IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF-. Furthermore, JNK-IN-8 suppressed the activation of JNK and subsequent activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling as indicated by the decreased level of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) and p65. These data suggest that JNK-IN-8 suppressed neuroinflammation and improved neurological function by inhibiting JNK/NF-{kappa}B pathway after ischemic brain injury, thus offering a new target for prevention of ischemic brain injury.",

An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, and hybrids of the two species were provided by the insectary of Vestergaard-NMIMR Vector Labs at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (Ghana) and An. arabiensis from Kenya. Samples were first characterised using conventional SINE PCR method, and further assayed using SYBR green, an intercalating fluorescent dye.\\n\\nThe three species and hybrids were clearly differentiated using the melting temperature of the dissociation curves, with derivative peaks at 72 Celsius for An. arabiensis, 75{degrees}C for An. gambiae and 86{degrees}C for An. coluzzii.

This work is the first to describe a SYBR green real time PCR method for the characterization of An. arabiensis, An. gambiae and An. coluzzii and was purposely designed for basic melt-curve analysis (rather than high-resolution melt-curve) to allow it to be used on a wide range of real-time PCR machines.",

    "abstract": "Although well known for its role in apoptosis, the executioner caspase DrICE has a non-apoptotic function that is required for elongation of the epithelial tubes of the Drosophila tracheal system. Here, we show that DrICE acts downstream of the Hippo Network to regulate endocytic trafficking of at least four cell polarity, cell junction and apical extracellular matrix proteins involved in tracheal tube size control: Crumbs, Uninflatable, Kune-Kune and Serpentine. We further show that tracheal cells are competent to undergo apoptosis, even though developmentally-regulated DrICE function rarely kills tracheal cells. Our results reveal a novel developmental role for caspases, a previously unidentified pool of DrICE that colocalizes with Clathrin, and a mechanism by which the Hippo Network controls endocytic trafficking. Given published reports of in vitro regulation of endocytosis by mammalian caspases during apoptosis, we propose that caspase-mediated regulation of endocytic trafficking is an evolutionarily conserved function of caspases that can be deployed during morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Motile cilia, also called flagella, drive cell motility across a broad range of species; some cilia propel prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells like sperm, while cilia on epithelial surfaces create complex fluid patterns e.g. in the brain or lung. For sperm, the picture has emerged that the motile cilium, also called flagellum, is not only a motor, but also a sensor that detects stimuli from the environment, computing the beat pattern according to the sensory input. Thereby, the flagellum of the sperm cell navigates the sperm through a complex environment like the female genital tract. However, we know very little about how environmental signals change the flagellar beat and, thereby, the swimming behaviour of sperm. It has been proposed that distinct signalling domains in the flagellum control the flagellar beat. A detailed analysis has been mainly hampered by the fact that current comprehensive analysis approaches rely on complex microscopy and analysis systems. Thus, knowledge on sperm signalling regulating the flagellar beat is based on custom quantification approaches that are limited to only a few aspects of the flagellar beat, do not resolve the kinetics of the entire flagellum, rely on manual, qualitative descriptions, and are little comparable among each other. Here, we present SpermQ, a ready-to-use and comprehensive analysis software to quantify sperm motility. SpermQ provides a detailed quantification of the flagellar beat based on common time-lapse images acquired by dark-field or epi-fluorescence microscopy, making SpermQ widely applicable. We envision SpermQ becoming a standard tool in flagellar and motile cilia research that allows to readily link studies on individual signalling components in sperm and distinct flagellar beat patterns.",

    "abstract": "Proper neural development in insects depends on the controlled proliferation and differentiation of neural precursors. In holometabolous insects, these processes must be coordinated during larval and pupal development. Recently, protein arginine methylation has come into focus as an important mechanism of controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in mammals. Whether a similar mechanism is at work in insects is unknown. We investigated this possibility by determining the expression pattern of three protein arginine methyltransferase mRNAs (PRMT1, 4 and 5) in the developing brain of bumblebees by in situ hybridisation. We detected expression in neural precursors and neurons in functionally important brain areas throughout development. We found markedly higher expression of PRMT1, but not PRMT4 and PRMT5, in regions of mushroom bodies containing dividing cells during pupal stages at the time of active neurogenesis within this brain area. At later stages of development, PRMT1 expression levels were found to be uniform and did not correlate with actively dividing cells. Our study suggests a role for PRMT1 in regulating neural precursor divisions in the mushroom bodies of bumblebees during the period of neurogenesis.",

Here, we examined the mechanisms of epiblast formation and found that the Hippo pathway transcription factor Tead and its coactivator Yap regulate expression of pluripotency factors. After specification of the inner cell mass, Yap accumulates in the nuclei and activates Tead. Tead activity is required for strong expression of pluripotency factors and is variable in the forming epiblast. Cells showing low Tead activity are eliminated from the epiblast through cell competition. Pluripotency factor expression and Myc control cell competition downstream of Tead activity. Cell competition eliminates unspecified cells and is required for proper organization of the epiblast. These results suggest that induction of pluripotency factors by Tead activity and elimination of unspecified cells via cell competition ensure the production of an epiblast with naive pluripotency.",

Conformational changes of the transmembrane domain (TMD) underlying ion channel activation and desensitization remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the dynamics of the TMD of AMPA-type iGluRs using genetically-encoded unnatural amino acid (UAA) photo-crosslinkers, p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (BzF) and p-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF). We introduced UAAs at sites throughout the TMD of the GluA2 receptor and characterized these mutants in patch-clamp recordings, exposing them to glutamate and UV light. This approach revealed a range of optical effects on the activity of mutant receptors. We found evidence that an interaction between the Pre-M1 and the M4 TMD helix was essential for normal activation and desensitization. Photoactivation at F579AzF, a residue behind the selectivity filter, had extraordinarily broad effects on gating and desensitization. This observation suggests coupling to other parts of the receptor and like in other tetrameric channels, selectivity filter gating.",
