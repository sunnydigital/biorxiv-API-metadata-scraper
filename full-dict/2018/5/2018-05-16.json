    "abstract": "The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) functions as a master circadian pacemaker, integrating environmental input to align physiological and behavioral rhythms to local time cues. Approximately 10% of SCN neurons express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP); however, it is unknown how firing activity of VIP neurons releases VIP to entrain circadian rhythms. To identify physiologically relevant firing patterns, we optically tagged VIP neurons and characterized spontaneous firing over three days. VIP neurons had circadian rhythms in firing rate and exhibited two classes of instantaneous firing activity. We next tested whether physiologically relevant firing affected circadian rhythms through VIP release. We found that VIP neuron stimulation with high, but not low, frequencies shifted gene expression rhythms in vitro through VIP signaling. In vivo, high frequency VIP neuron activation rapidly entrained circadian locomotor rhythms. Thus, increases in VIP neuronal firing frequency release VIP and entrain molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMazuski et al. identified three classes of circadian SCN neurons based on their distinct firing patterns consistent over multiple days\\nC_LIO_LIThere are two distinct classes (tonic and irregular firing) of VIP SCN neurons.\\nC_LIO_LIStimulation of VIP SCN neurons at physiologically relevant frequencies phase shifts whole-SCN circadian rhythms in gene expression through VIP release. These effects are blocked with VIP antagonists.\\nC_LIO_LIFiring of VIP SCN neurons entrains circadian rhythms in locomotor behavior in a frequency and time-of-day dependent manner.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AbstractDifferentiating between ancient and rapidly-evolved clades is critical for understanding impacts of environmental change on biodiversity. Australia possesses many aridity-adapted lineages, the origins of which have been linked by molecular evidence to late Miocene drying. Using dental macrowear and molar crown-height measurements spanning the past 25 million years, we show that the most iconic of Australias terrestrial mammals,  true kangaroos and wallabies (Macropodini), diversified in response to Pliocene grassland emergence. In contrast, low-crowned short-faced kangaroos radiated into browsing niches as the late Cenozoic became more arid, contradicting the view that this was a period of global decline among browsers. Our results link warm intervals with bursts of diversification and undermine arguments attributing Pleistocene megafaunal extinction to aridity-forced dietary change.",

    "abstract": "Background: Monocytes and macrophages are central to atherosclerosis, but how they mark progression of human coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear. We tested whether patients monocyte subtypes paired with their derived macrophage profiles correlate with extent of CAD.\\n\\nMethods: Peripheral blood was collected from 30 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, and patients were categorized as having no significant CAD, single vessel disease, or multivessel disease according to the number of affected coronary arteries. Mononuclear cells were measured for monocyte markers CD14 and CD16 by flow cytometry, and separate monocytes were cultured into macrophages over 7 days and measured for polarization markers CD86 and CD206.\\n\\nResults: At baseline, patients with greater CAD burden were older with higher rates of statin use, whereas all other characteristics were similar across the spectrum of coronary disease. Non-classical (CD14loCD16hi) and all CD16+ monocytes were elevated in patients with single vessel and multivessel disease compared to those without significant CAD (8.6% and 10.5% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.05), whereas regulatory M2 macrophages (CD206+) were decreased in patients with single vessel and multivessel disease (0.34% and 0.34% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.05). An inverse relationship between paired CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages marked CAD severity. CAD was also found to be more tightly associated with CD16+ cells than age or traditional cardiovascular risk factors on multiple regression analysis of these patients.\\n\\nConclusions: CAD extent is correlated directly with CD16+ monocytes and inversely with M2 (CD206+) macrophages, suggesting circulating monocytes may influence downstream polarization of lesional macrophages. These measures of monocyte and macrophage subtypes hold potential as biomarkers in CAD.",

    "abstract": "There are few methods for the assembly of defined protein oligomers and higher order structures that could serve as novel biomaterials. Using fluorescent proteins as a model system, we have engineered novel oligomerization states by combining oppositely supercharged variants. A well-defined, highly symmetrical 16-mer (two stacked, circular octamers) can be formed from alternating charged proteins; higher order structures then form in a hierarchical fashion from this discrete protomer. During SUpercharged PRotein Assembly (SuPrA), electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged variants drives interaction, while shape and patchy physicochemical interactions lead to spatial organization along specific interfaces, ultimately resulting in protein assemblies never before seen in nature.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to the development of numerous bioinformatics tools and pipelines. As these tools vary in their output function and complexity and some are not well-standardized, it is harder to choose a suitable pipeline to identify variants in NGS data. Here, we present NeST (NGS-analysis Toolkit), a modular consensus-based variant calling framework. NeST uses a combination of variant callers to overcome potential biases of an individual method used alone. NeST consists of four modules, that integrate open-source bioinformatics tools, a custom Variant Calling Format (VCF) parser and a summarization utility, that generate high-quality consensus variant calls. NeST was validated using targeted-amplicon deep sequencing data from 245 Plasmodium falciparum isolates to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms conferring drug resistance. The results were verified using Sanger sequencing data for the same dataset in a supporting publication [28]. NeST offers a user-friendly pipeline for variant calling with standardized outputs and minimal computational demands for easy deployment for use with various organisms and applications.",

    "abstract": "Considerable recent evidence indicates that angular gyrus dysfunction does not result in amnesia, but does impair a number of aspects of episodic memory. Patients with parietal lobe lesions have been reported to exhibit a deficit when freely recalling autobiographical events from their pasts, but can remember details of the events when recall is cued by specific questions. In apparent contradiction, inhibitory brain stimulation targeting angular gyrus in healthy volunteers has been found to have no effect on free recall or cued recall of word pairs. The present study sought to resolve this inconsistency by testing free and cued recall of both autobiographical memories and word pair memories in the same healthy participants following continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of angular gyrus and a vertex control location. Angular gyrus cTBS resulted in a selective reduction in the free recall but not cued recall of autobiographical memories, whereas free and cued recall of word pair memories were unaffected. Additionally, participants reported fewer autobiographical episodes as being experienced from a first-person perspective following angular gyrus cTBS. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that a function of angular gyrus within the network of brain regions responsible for episodic recollection is to integrate memory features within an egocentric framework into the kind of first-person perspective representation that enables the subjective experience of remembering events from our personal pasts.",
