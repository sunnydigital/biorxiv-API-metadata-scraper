    "abstract": "The neutral theory has been used as a null model for interpreting nature and produced the Recent Out of Africa model of anatomically modern humans. Recent studies, however, have established that genetic diversities are mostly at maximum saturation levels maintained by selection, therefore challenging the explanatory power of the neutral theory and rendering the present molecular model of human origins untenable. Using improved methods and public data, we have revisited human evolution and found sharing of genetic variations among racial groups to be largely a result of parallel mutations rather than recent common ancestry and admixture as commonly assumed. We derived an age of 1.86-1.92 million years for the first split in modern human populations based on autosomal diversity data. We found evidence of modern Y and mtDNA originating in East Asia and dispersing via hybridization with archaic humans. Analyses of autosomes, Y and mtDNA all suggest that Denisovan and Neanderthal were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures and ancestors of South Asia Negritos and Aboriginal Australians. Verifying our model, we found more ancestry of Southern Chinese from Hunan in Africans relative to other East Asian groups examined. These results suggest multiregional evolution of autosomes and replacements of archaic Y and mtDNA by modern ones originating in East Asia, thereby leading to a coherent account of modern human origins.",

However current implementations are computationally intensive and will not scale up to modern droplet-based single-cell datasets which routinely profile many tens of thousands of cells.\\n\\nResultsWe provide an efficient implementation which allows scaling up this approach to modern single-cell datasets. We also generalize the application of pseudotime inference to cases where there are other sources of variation, such as branching dynamics. We apply our method on microarray, nCounter, RNA-seq, qPCR and droplet-based datasets from different organisms. The model converges an order of magnitude faster compared to existing methods whilst achieving similar levels of estimation accuracy. Further, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by extending the model to higher-dimensional latent spaces that can be used to simultaneously infer pseudotime and other structure such as branching. Thus, the model has the capability of producing meaningful biological insights about cell ordering as well as cell fate regulation.\\n\\nAvailabilitySoftware available at github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOaks are dominant forest tree species widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, where they constitute natural resources of economic, ecological, social and historical value. Hybridization and adaptive introgression have long been thought to be major drivers of their ecological success. Thus, the maintenance of species barriers remains a key question, given the extent of interspecific gene flow. In this study, we scanned the genomes of four European white oak species for reproductive barriers. We identified the ecological and phylogenic relationships of these species and inferred a long-term strict isolation followed by a recent and extensive postglacial contact. Then, we made use of the tremendous genetic variation among these species (31 million SNPs) to identify genomic regions for reproductive isolation. A literature-based functional annotation of the underlying genes highlighted important functions driving the reproductive isolation between these sister species. These functions were consistent with their ecological preferences and included tolerance to biotic and abiotic constraints. This study holds important implications for the renewal of European forests under global warming.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-evoked brain activity is critical because it would provide a way to map task-related brain regions in patients unable to comply with such tasks. A crucial question within this realm is to what extent the execution of a cognitive task affects the intrinsic activity of brain regions not involved in the task. Computational models can be useful to answer this question because they allow us to distinguish task from non-task neural elements while giving us the effects of task execution on non-task regions of interest at the neuroimaging level. The quantification of those effects in a computational model would represent a step towards elucidating the intrinsic versus task-evoked connection. Here we used computational modeling and graph theoretical metrics to quantify changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity due to task execution. We used our Large-Scale Neural Modeling framework to embed a computational model of visual short-term memory into an empirically derived connectome. We simulated a neuroimaging study consisting of ten subjects performing passive fixation (PF), passive viewing (PV) and delay match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. We used the simulated BOLD fMRI time-series to calculate functional connectivity (FC) matrices and used those matrices to compute several graph theoretical measures. After determining that the simulated graph theoretical measures were largely consistent with experiments, we were able to quantify the differences between the graph metrics of the PF condition and those of the PV and DMS conditions. Thus, we show that we can use graph theoretical methods applied to simulated brain networks to aid in the quantification of changes in intrinsic brain functional connectivity during task execution. Our results represent a step towards establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-related brain activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStudies of resting-state conditions are popular in neuroimaging. Participants in resting-state studies are instructed to fixate on a neutral image or to close their eyes. This type of study has advantages over traditional task-based studies, including its ability to allow participation of those with difficulties performing tasks. Further, a resting-state neuroimaging study reveals intrinsic activity of participants brains. However, task-related brain activity may change this intrinsic activity, much as a stone thrown in a lake causes ripples on the waters surface. Can we measure those activity changes? To answer that question, we merged a computational model of visual short-term memory (task regions) with an anatomical model incorporating major connections between brain regions (non-task regions). In a computational model, unlike real data, we know how different regions are connected and which regions are doing the task. First, we simulated neuronal and neuroimaging activity of both task and non-task regions during three conditions: passive fixation (baseline), passive viewing, and visual short-term memory. Then, applying graph theory to the simulated neuroimaging of non-task regions, we computed differences between the baseline and the other conditions. Our results show that we can measure changes in non-task regions due to brain activity changes in task-related regions.",

    "abstract": "The modelling of the electrophysiology of cardiac cells is one of the most mature areas of systems biology. This extended concentration of research effort brings with it new challenges, foremost among which is that of choosing which of these models is most suitable for addressing a particular scientific question. In a previous paper, we presented our initial work in developing an online resource for the characterisation and comparison of electrophysiological cell models in a wide range of experimental scenarios. In that work, we described how we had developed a novel protocol language that allowed us to separate the details of the mathematical model (the majority of cardiac cell models take the form of ordinary differential equations) from the experimental protocol being simulated. We developed a fully-open online repository (which we termed the Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab) which allows users to store and compare the results of applying the same experimental protocol to competing models. In the current paper we describe the most recent and planned extensions of this work, focused on supporting the process of model building from experimental data. We outline the necessary work to develop a machine-readable language to describe the process of inferring parameters from wet lab datasets, and illustrate our approach through a detailed example of fitting a model of the hERG channel using experimental data. We conclude by discussing the future challenges in making further progress in this domain towards our goal of facilitating a fully reproducible approach to the development of cardiac cell models.",

    "abstract": "Cancer care professionals are confronted with interpreting results from multiplexed gene sequencing of patients at hereditary risk for cancer. Assessments for variant classification now require orthogonal data searches, requiring aggregation of multiple lines of evidence from diverse resources. The burden of evidence for each variant to meet thresholds for pathogenicity or actionability now poses a growing challenge for those seeking to counsel patients and families following germline genetic testing. A computational algorithm that automates, provides uniformity and significantly accelerates this interpretive process is needed. The tool described here, Pathogenicity of Mutation Analyzer (PathoMAN) automates germline genomic variant curation from clinical sequencing based on ACMG guidelines. PathoMAN aggregates multiple tracks of genomic, protein and disease specific information from public sources. We compared expert manually curated variant data from studies on (i) prostate cancer (ii) breast cancer and (iii) ClinVar to assess performance. PathoMAN achieves high concordance (83.1% pathogenic, 75.5% benign) and negligible discordance (0.04% pathogenic, 0.9% benign) when contrasted against expert curation. Some loss of resolution (8.6% pathogenic, 23.64% benign) and gain of resolution (6.6% pathogenic, 1.6% benign) was also observed. We highlight the advantages and weaknesses related to the programmable automation of variant classification. We also propose a new nosology for the five ACMG classes to facilitate more accurate reporting to ClinVar. The proposed refinements will enhance utility of ClinVar to allow further automation in cancer genetics. PathoMAN will reduce the manual workload of domain level experts. It provides a substantial advance in rapid classification of genetic variants by generating robust models using a knowledge-base of diverse genetic data https://pathoman.mskcc.org.",

    "abstract": "Many drugs act very rapidly -- they can turn on or off their targets within minutes in a whole animal. What are the acute effects of drug treatment and how does an animal respond to these? We developed a simple assay to measure the acute effects of drugs on C.elegans movement and examined the effects of a range of compounds including neuroactive drugs, toxins, environmental stresses and novel compounds on worm movement over a time period of 3 hours. We find that many treatments show complex acute responses -- a phase of rapid paralysis is followed by one or more recovery phases. The recoveries are not the result of some generic stress response but are specific to the drug e.g. recovery from paralysis due to a neuroactive drug requires neurotransmitter pathways whereas recovery from a metabolic inhibitor requires metabolic changes. Finally, we also find that acute responses can vary greatly across development and that there is extensive and complex natural variation in acute responses. In summary, acute responses are sensitive probes of the ability of biological networks to respond to drug treatment and these responses can reveal the action of unexplored pathways.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDrugs are powerful tools that let us switch on or off key pathways in whole animals and watch the effects. Here we set up a simple assay to measure how drugs affect the movement of the simple nematode C.elegans -- crucially, we look how those responses change over time. We find that worms have complex responses to many different drugs -- they go through clear phases of paralysis and recovery. The recovery from the initial effect of any drug is not due to a generic stress response but is specific to the way each drug acts. We find for example that worms can recover from paralysis driven by one neurotransmitter pathway by activating a different neurotransmitter pathway or from paralysis caused by loss of one metabolic pathway by turning on a second one. These complex responses show how the basic genetic networks that are needed for normal behaviour and function can rewire and respond to the effect of many drugs.\\n\\nImportantly, the responses can vary in many ways -- different aged worms or different individuals can have different responses and capturing how drug responses change over time is critical to dissect this complexity.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome of insects directly or indirectly affects the metabolism, immune status, sensory perception and feeding behavior of its host. Here, we examine the hypothesis that in the Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis, Diptera: Tephritidae), the presence or absence of gut symbionts affects foraging behavior and nutrient ingestion. We offered protein starved flies, symbiotic or aposymbiotic, a choice between diets containing all amino acids or only the non-essential ones. The different diets were presented in a foraging arena as drops that varied in their size and density, creating an imbalanced foraging environment. Suppressing the microbiome resulted in significant changes of the foraging behavior of both male and female flies. Aposymbiotic flies responded faster to the diets offered in experimental arenas, spent more time feeding, ingested more drops of food, and were constrained to feed on time consuming patches (containing small drops of food), when these offered the full complement of amino acids. We discuss these results in the context of previous studies on the effect of the gut microbiome on host behavior, and suggest that these be extended to the life history dimension.\\n\\nImportance and significance of the studyThe gut bacteria of tephritid fruit flies provide nutritional benefits to their hosts, by making essential amino-acids readily available. Foraging for food is risky, as active flies are exposed to predators and incur a considerable investment of time and energy. Therefore, making beneficial compromises between the feeding time and nutrient ingestion is a question of survival for the flies. Our study demonstrates how gut bacteria drive this behavior by allowing symbiotic flies to forage optimally while acquiring essential nutrients. This finding adds a novel step to the nexus connecting the insect gut, its microbiome, the nervous system, chemoreception to individual patterns of foraging.",

Here, we use atomic force microscopy and live cell imaging to elucidate the biophysical forces involved in the establishment of physical asymmetry in Drosophila neural stem cells. We show that the force driving initial apical membrane expansion is provided by hydrostatic pressure, peaking shortly after anaphase onset, and enabled by a relieve of actomyosin contractile tension on the apical cell cortex. The subsequent increase in contractile forces at the cleavage furrow, combined with the relocalization of basally located Myosin results in basal membrane extension and sustained apical expansion. We propose that spatiotemporally controlled actomyosin contractile tension and hydrostatic pressure enables stereotypic biased membrane expansion to generate sibling cell size asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are highly heritable diseases that affect over 3% of individuals worldwide. Genomewide association studies have strongly and repeatedly linked risk for both of these neuropsychiatric diseases to a 100 kb interval in the third intron of the human calcium channel gene CACNA1C. However, the causative mutation is not yet known. We have identified a novel human-specific tandem repeat in this region that is composed of 30 bp units, often repeated hundreds of times. This large tandem repeat is unstable using standard polymerase chain reaction and bacterial cloning techniques, which may have resulted in its incorrect size in the human reference genome. The large 30-mer repeat region is polymorphic in both size and sequence in human populations. Particular sequence variants of the 30-mer are associated with risk status at several flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms in the third intron of CACNA1C that have previously been linked to BD and SCZ. The tandem repeat arrays function as enhancers that increase reporter gene expression in a human neural progenitor cell line. Different human arrays vary in the magnitude of enhancer activity, and the 30-mer arrays associated with increased psychiatric disease risk status have decreased enhancer activity. Changes in the structure and sequence of these arrays likely contribute to changes in CACNA1C function during human evolution, and may modulate neuropsychiatric disease risk in modern human populations.",

So molecular line probe assays (LPAs) for detection of MDR-TB and XDR-TB have been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). We analyzed 96 isolates from Beijing comparing culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) to LPAs detecting rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH), and levofloxacin (LFX), amikacin (AM), capreomycin (CMP), ethambutol (EMB) resistance.

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable evolutionary and metabolic diversity found within the human microbiome, the vast majority of mechanistic studies focus on two phyla: the Bacteroidetes and the Proteobacteria. Generalizable tools for studying the other phyla are urgently needed in order to transition microbiome research from a descriptive to a mechanistic discipline. Here, we focus on the Coriobacteriia class within the Actinobacteria phylum, detected in the distal gut of 90% of adult individuals around the world, which have been associated with both chronic and infectious disease, and play a key role in the metabolism of pharmaceutical, dietary, and endogenous compounds. We established, sequenced, and annotated a strain collection spanning 14 genera, 8 decades, and 3 continents, with a focus on Eggerthella lenta. Genome-wide alignments revealed inconsistencies in the taxonomy of the Coriobacteriia for which amendments have been proposed. Re-sequencing of the E. lenta type strain from multiple culture collections and our laboratory stock allowed us to identify errors in the finished genome and to identify point mutations associated with antibiotic resistance. Analysis of 24 E. lenta genomes revealed an \\\"open\\\" pan-genome suggesting we still have not fully sampled the genetic and metabolic diversity within this bacterial species. Consistent with the requirement for arginine during in vitro growth, the core E. lenta genome included the arginine dihydrolase pathway. Surprisingly, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle was also conserved in E. lenta despite the lack of evidence for carbohydrate utilization. We identified a species-specific marker gene and validated a multiplexed quantitative PCR assay for simultaneous detection of E. lenta and specific genes of interest from stool samples. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of comparative genomics for linking variable genes to strain-specific phenotypes, including antibiotic resistance and drug metabolism. To facilitate the continued functional genomic analysis of the Coriobacteriia, we have deposited the full collection of strains in DSMZ and have written a general software tool (ElenMatchR) that can be readily applied to novel phenotypic traits of interest. Together, these tools provide a first step towards a molecular understanding of the many neglected but clinically-relevant members of the human gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Genes in the APOBEC3 family encode cytidine deaminases that provide a barrier against viral infection and retrotransposition. Of all APOBEC3 genes in humans, APOBEC3H (A3H) is the most polymorphic: some haplotypes encode stable and active A3H proteins, while others are unstable and inactive. Such variation in human A3H affects interactions with the lentiviral antagonist Vif, which counteracts A3H via proteasomal degradation. In order to broaden our understanding of A3H-Vif interactions as well as its evolution in Old World monkeys, we characterized A3H variation within four African green monkey (AGM) subspecies. We found that A3H is highly polymorphic in AGMs and has lost antiviral activity in multiple Old World monkeys. This loss of function was partially related to protein expression levels but was also influenced by amino acid mutations in the N-terminus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the evolution of A3H in the primate lineages leading to AGMs was not driven by Vif. Our work suggests that activity of A3H is evolutionarily dynamic and may have a negative effect on host fitness, resulting in its recurrent loss in primates.\\n\\nImportanceAdaptation of viruses to their hosts is critical for transmission of viruses between different species. Previous studies had identified changes in a protein from the APOBEC3 family that influenced species-specificity of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) in African green monkeys. We studied the evolution of a related protein in the same system, APOBEC3H, which has experienced a loss of function in humans. This evolutionary approach revealed that recurrent loss of APOBEC3H activity has taken place during primate evolution suggesting that APOBEC3H places a fitness cost on hosts. The variability of APOBEC3H activity between different primates highlights the differential selective pressures on the APOBEC3 gene family.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerability to obesity includes eating in response to food cues, which acquire incentive value through conditioning. The conditioning process is largely subserved by dopamine, theorized to encode the discrepancy between expected and actual rewards, known as the reward prediction error (RPE). Ghrelin is a gut-derived homeostatic hormone that triggers hunger and eating. Despite extensive evidence that ghrelin stimulates dopamine, it remains unknown in humans if ghrelin modulates food cue learning. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging that intravenously administered ghrelin increased RPE-related activity in dopamine-responsive areas during food odor conditioning in healthy volunteers. Participants responded faster to food odor-associated cues and perceived them to be more pleasant following ghrelin injection. Ghrelin also increased functional connectivity between hippocampus and ventral striatum. Our work demonstrates that ghrelin promotes the ability of cues to acquire incentive salience, and has implications for the development of vulnerability to obesity.",

    "abstract": "Although people have modified the world around us throughout human history, the  Great Acceleration has seen drivers such as land conversion, exploitation of natural populations, species introductions, pollution and human-induced climate change placing biodiversity under increasing pressure. In this paper we examine 1) how terrestrial species communities have been impacted over the last thousand years of human development and 2) how plausible futures defined by alternative socio-economic scenarios are expected to impact species communities in the future. We use the PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems) database to model impacts of land-use change and human population on local species richness, community abundance, and biodiversity intactness using a mixed-effects modelling structure. Historical impacts are inferred through projection of model results onto maps of historical land use, provided by the land-use harmonization project, and gridded human population density (HYDE 3.1). Future impacts are explored using the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. These scenarios detail five plausible global futures based upon socio-economic factors such as wealth, population, education, technology, and reliance on fossil fuels, and can be combined with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios to consider climate mitigation strategies. We project model results onto the gridded outputs of six SSP/RCP scenario combinations: SSP1/RCP2.6, SSP2/RCP4.5, SSP3/RCP7.0, SSP4/RCP3.4, SSP4/RCP6.0, and SSP5/RCP8.5. Historical trend lines show that most losses in local biodiversity are relatively recent, with 75% of all loss in both abundance-based Biodiversity Intactness Index and species richness occurring post-1800. Stark regional differences emerge in all future scenarios, with biodiversity in African regions undergoing greater losses than Oceania, North America and the European regions. Although climate change is expected to have severe detrimental impacts to biodiversity - which are not quantified in these results - it is important to consider how the climate change mitigation itself may also impact biodiversity. Our results suggest that strong climate change mitigation through biofuel production will detrimentally impact biodiversity: SSP4/RCP3.4 (with high biofuel mitigation) is predicted to see two times the decrease in abundance-based biodiversity intactness and three times the decrease in local species richness between 2015-2100 as is predicted for SSP4/RCP6.0 (with lower levels of mitigation). SSP4/RCP3.4 forecasts the greatest impact to average local species richness of all the SSP/RCP combinations with an average loss of 13% of local species richness projected to have occurred by 2100. SSP3/RCP7.0 - a scenario describing a globally segregated, and economically protectionist future with low climate change mitigation - has the worst impacts on abundance-based biodiversity intactness with an average loss of 26% of intactness by 2100. However, a brighter future is possible; SSP1/RCP2.6 describes a more sustainable future, where human populations are provided for without further jeopardising environmental integrity - in this scenario we project that biodiversity will recover somewhat, with gains in biodiversity intactness and species richness in many regions of the world by 2100.",

    "abstract": "Herpesvirus particles have a complex architecture consisting of an icosahedral capsid that is surrounded by a lipid envelope. Connecting these two components is a layer of tegument that consists of varying amounts of twenty or more proteins. The arrangement of proteins within the tegument cannot easily be assessed and instead is inferred from tegument interactions identified in reductionist models. To better understand the tegument architecture, we have developed an approach to probe capsid-tegument interactions within extracellular viral particles by encoding tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease sites in viral structural proteins, along with distinct fluorescent tags in capsid and tegument components. In this study, TEV sites were engineered within the pUL36 large tegument protein: a critical structural element that is anchored directly on the capsid surface. Purified pseudorabies virus extracellular particles were permeabilized and TEV protease was added to selectively cleave the exposed pUL36 backbone. Interactions with the capsid were assessed in situ by monitoring the fate of the fluorescent signals following cleavage. Although several regions of pUL36 are proposed to bind capsids, pUL36 was found stably anchored to the capsid exclusively at its carboxyl terminus. Two additional tegument proteins, pUL37 and pUS3, were tethered to the capsid via pUL36 whereas the pUL16, pUL47, pUL48, and pUL49 tegument proteins were not stably bound to the capsid.\\n\\nIMPORTANCENeuroinvasive alphaherpesviruses produce diseases of clinical and economic significance in humans and veterinary animals, but are predominantly associated with less serious recurrent disease. Like all viruses, herpesviruses assemble a metastable particle that selectively dismantles during initial infection. This process is made more complex by the presence of a tegument layer that resides between the capsid surface and envelope. Components of the tegument are essential for particle assembly and also serve as critical effectors that promote infection upon entry into cells. How this dynamic network of protein interactions is arranged within virions is largely unknown. We present a molecular approach to dissect the tegument and with it, begin to tease apart the protein interactions that underlie this complex layer of the virion architecture.",

    "abstract": "Fecal pollution at coastal beaches in the Northeast, USA requires management efforts to address public health and economic concerns. Concentrations of fecal-borne bacteria are influenced by different fecal sources, environmental conditions, and ecosystem reservoirs, making their public health significance convoluted. In this study, we sought to delineate the influences of these factors on enterococci concentrations in southern Maine coastal recreational waters. Weekly water samples and water quality measurements were conducted at freshwater, estuarine, and marine beach sites from June through September 2016. Samples were analyzed for total and particle-associated enterococci concentrations, total suspended solids, and microbial source tracking markers for multiple sources. Water, soil, sediment, and marine sediment samples were also subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and SourceTracker analysis to determine the influence from these environmental reservoirs on water sample microbial communities. Enterococci and particle-associated enterococci concentrations were elevated in freshwater, but suspended solids concentrations were relatively similar. Mammal fecal contamination was significantly elevated in the estuary, with human and bird fecal contaminant levels similar between sites. A partial least squares regression model indicated particle-associated enterococci and mammal marker concentrations had the most significant positive relationships with enterococci concentrations across marine, estuary, and freshwater environments. Freshwater microbial communities were significantly influenced by underlying sediment while estuarine/marine beach communities were influenced by freshwater, high tide height, and estuarine sediment. We found elevated enterococci levels are reflective of a combination of increased fecal source input, environmental sources, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for encompassing MST approaches for managing water quality issues.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEnterococci have long been the federal standard in determining water quality at estuarine and marine environments. Although enterococci are highly abundant in the fecal tracts of many animals they are not exclusive to that environment and can persist and grow outside of fecal tracts. This presents a management problem for areas that are largely impaired by non-point source contamination, as fecal sources might not be the root cause of contamination. This study employed different microbial source tracking methods to delineate influences from fecal source input, environmental sources, and environmental conditions to determine which combination of variables are influencing enterococci concentrations in recreational waters at a historically impaired coastal town. Results showed that fecal source input, environmental sources and conditions all play a role in influencing enterococci concentrations. This highlights the need to include an encompassing microbial source tracking approach to assess the effects of all important variables on enterococci concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The in-situ immobilization of heavy metal contamination in soils using stabilizing amendments is a cost-effective remediation technique. However, previous research on mediating cadmium polluted fields using amendments has focused mainly on the absorption and accumulation of cadmium by plants, rather than the response of soil microorganisms to amendments. In our study, five compounds with different pH values and concentrations of carbonate minerals, clay minerals, sulfur, and phosphorous were selected to investigate their effect on the soil microorganisms and metabolic patterns through metagenomic analysis over three months in cadmium-contaminated paddy fields (CCPFs) in southwestern China. The results showed that the pH value of the amendments was the major factor determining the microbial diversity and communities. In weak acidic paddy fields, the appropriate use of an alkaline amendment composed mainly of calcium oxide increased the pH value of the soil, which helped to improve the soil microbial diversity, promote the growth of azotobacter, nitrate-reducing bacteria (such as Pseudomonas), and metabolisms of nitrogen fixation and reduction, which contributing to the decrease of available cadmium in soils. Acid amendments which significantly reduced the soil pH value, had lowest removal rate of available cadmium and showed significant restrictive effects on bacterial and arhaeal diversity and growth. In addition, the effects differed between different alkaline amendments. Alkaline amendment composed of magnesium oxide promoted the growth of Pseudomonas, but also inhibited Nitrosospira and the metabolism of soil nitrogen fixation. In conclusion, when applying amendments to remediate cadmium-contaminated paddy soils, we need to take into account the pH value of the amendment and the content of each component, and ensure the efficiency of amendments while at the same time maintaining a positive effect on soil microorganisms.\\n\\nImportancePrevious research on amendment applications in cadmium-contaminated paddy fields (CCPFs) has mainly focused on the availability of cadmium to plants, the identification of the best functional additive proportion of immobilization remediation, and the absorption and accumulation of heavy metals by plant, etc. However, research on the taxonomic and metabolic patterns of bacteria and archaea in amended soils, especially purple paddy soil, which is typical of the Sichuan area (4.601 million hectares), is insufficient. Secondly, the plough layer of paddy soil would be in a reduction state during the period of irrigation, but be in an oxidation state when fields were in draining and drying periods. The periodical alternation of wetting and drying forms unique physical, chemical, and biological properties, and it is vital to understanding the taxonomic and functional dynamics of microbiomes in amended soils in order to improve the process performance.",

Herein, the hydrogenation derivative (WU-FA-01) of fusidic acid was prepared, and both compounds were examined against a panel of six bacterial strains. In addition, their anti-inflammation properties were evaluated using a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema model. The results of the antimicrobial assay revealed that both WU-FA-00 and WU-FA-01 displayed a high level of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive strains. Moreover, killing kinetic studies were performed, and the results were in accordance with the MIC and MBC results. We also demonstrated that the topical application of WU-FA-00 and WU-FA-01 effectively decreased TPA-induced ear edema in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was associated with the inhibition of TPA-induced up-regulation of pro-inflammation cytokines IL-1{beta}, TNF- and COX-2. WU-FA-01 significantly suppressed the expression levels of p65, I{kappa}B-, and p-I{kappa}B- in the TPA-induced mouse ear model. Overall, our results showed that WU-FA-00 and WU-FA-01 not only had effective antimicrobial activities in vitro, especially to the Gram-positive bacteria, but also possessed strong anti-inflammatory effects in vivo.

    "abstract": "The oncogenic microRNA-155 (miR-155) is the most frequently upregulated miRNA in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cell malignancies and is upregulated in other non-viral lymphomas. Both the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), and B cell transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) are known to activate transcription of the host cell gene from which miR-155 is processed (miR-155HG, BIC). EBNA2 also activates IRF4 transcription indicating that EBV may upregulate miR-155 through direct and indirect mechanisms. The mechanism of transcriptional regulation of IRF4 and miR-155HG by EBNA2 however has not been defined. We demonstrate that EBNA2 can activate IRF4 and miR-155HG expression through specific upstream enhancers that are dependent on the Notch signaling transcription factor RBPJ, a known binding partner of EBNA2. We demonstrate that in addition to activation of the miR-155HG promoter, IRF4 can also activate miR-155HG via the upstream enhancer also targeted by EBNA2. Gene editing to remove the EBNA2- and IRF4-responsive miR-155HG enhancer located 60 kb upstream of miR-155HG led to reduced miR155HG expression in EBV-infected cells. Our data therefore demonstrate that specific RBPJ-dependent enhancers regulate the IRF4-miR-155 expression network and play a key role in the maintenance of miR-155 expression in EBV-infected B cells. These findings provide important insights that will improve our understanding of miR-155 control in B cell malignancies.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is expressed at high level in many human cancers particularly lymphomas. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects human B cells and drives the development of numerous lymphomas. Two EBV-encoded genes (LMP1 and EBNA2) upregulate miR-155 expression and miR-155 expression is required for the growth of EBV-infected B cells. We show that the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 upregulates miR-155 expression by activating an enhancer upstream from the miR-155 host gene (miR-155HG) from which miR-155 is derived. We show that EBNA2 also indirectly activates miR-155 expression through enhancer-mediated activation of IRF4. IRF4 then activates both the miR-155HG promoter and the upstream enhancer, independently of EBNA2. Gene editing to remove the miR-155HG enhancer leads to a reduction in miR-155HG expression. We therefore identify enhancer-mediated activation of miR-155HG as a critical step in promoting B cell growth and a likely driver of lymphoma development.",

    "abstract": "Azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is predominantly associated with increased expression of Cyp51A (lanosterol 14-demethylase), the target enzyme of azole antifungal agents, or with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cyp51A. Although several SNPs that may be linked to low susceptibility in azole-resistant isolates have previously been reported, few studies have been conducted to conclusively demonstrate the contribution of SNPs to decreased azole susceptibility. An A. fumigatus strain was isolated from the sputum of a 74-year-old male receiving long-term voriconazole treatment for chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis. Etest antifungal susceptibility testing showed low susceptibility to voriconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole. Nucleotide sequencing of cyp51A from this isolate revealed the mutations Gly138Ser (GGC[-&gt;]AGC) and Asn248Lys (AAT[-&gt;]AAA) compared with the cyp51A of azole-susceptible isolates. PCR-amplified DNA fragments containing cyp51A with or without the mutations of interest and a hygromycin marker were simultaneously introduced along with the Cas9 protein and in vitro-synthesized single-guide RNA into protoplasts of the azole-resistant/susceptible strains. Etest azole susceptibility testing of recombinant strains showed an increased susceptibility via the replacement of Ser138 by glycine. In contrast, azole susceptibility was slightly decreased when a Ser138 mutation was introduced into the azole-susceptible strain AfS35, indicating that the serine at position 138 of Cyp51A contributes to low susceptibility in the azole-resistant isolate. Genetic recombination, which has been hampered thus far in clinical isolates, can now be achieved using Cas9/CRISPR genome editing. This technique could be useful to investigate the contribution of other SNPs of cyp51A to azole resistance.",

    "abstract": "Collagen is the most abundant secreted protein in vertebrates that persists throughout life without renewal. The unchanging nature of collagen contrasts with observed continued collagen synthesis throughout adulthood and with conventional transcriptional and translational homeostatic mechanisms that replace damaged proteins with new copies. Here we show circadian clock regulation of procollagen transport from ER-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-plasma membrane by sequential rhythmic expression of SEC61, TANGO1, PDE4D and VPS33B. The result is nocturnal procollagen synthesis and daytime collagen fibril assembly in mice. Rhythmic collagen degradation by CTSK maintains collagen homeostasis. This circadian cycle of collagen synthesis, assembly and degradation affects only a pool of newly-synthesized collagen whilst maintaining the persistent collagen network. Disabling the circadian clock causes collagen accumulation and abnormal fibrils in vivo. In conclusion, our study has identified a circadian clock mechanism of protein homeostasis in which a sacrificial pool of collagen is synthesized and removed to maintain tissue function.",

We developed a family of G-protein-coupled receptor activation-based ACh sensors (GACh) with sensitivity, specificity, signal-to-noise ratio, kinetics and photostability suitable for monitoring ACh signals in vitro and in vivo. GACh sensors were validated with transfection, viral and/or transgenic expression in a dozen types of neuronal and non-neuronal cells prepared from several animal species. In all preparations, GACh sensors selectively responded to exogenous and/or endogenous ACh with robust fluorescence signals that were captured by epifluorescent, confocal and/or two-photon microscopy. Moreover, analysis of endogenous ACh release revealed firing pattern-dependent release and restricted volume transmission, resolving two long-standing questions about central cholinergic transmission. Thus, GACh sensors provide a user-friendly, broadly applicable toolbox for monitoring cholinergic transmission underlying diverse biological processes.",

Finally, we provide evidence that pheno-seq identifies morphology-specific genes that are missed by scRNA-seq and inferred single-cell regulatory states without acquiring additional single cell expression profiles.

Here, we use a genetic immortalization method to analyze the development of sensory neuron lineages in the Drosophila olfactory system, from their origin to terminal differentiation. We apply this approach to first define a fate map of all olfactory lineages and refine the model of temporal patterns of lineage divisions. Taking advantage of a selective marker for the lineage that gives rise to Or67d pheromone-sensing neurons and a genome-wide transcription factor RNAi screen, we identify the spatial and temporal requirements for Pointed, an ETS family member, in this developmental pathway. Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and Pointed-depleted olfactory tissue reveals a universal requirement for this factor as a switch-like determinant of fates in these sensory lineages.",

    "abstract": "Several biological functions are carried out via complexes that are formed via multimerization of either a single species (homomers) or multiple species (heteromers). Given functional relevance of these complexes, it is arguably desired to maintain their level at a set point and minimize fluctuations around it. Here we consider two simple models of complex formation - one for homomer and another for heteromer of two species - and analyze how important model parameters affect the noise in complex level. In particular, we study effects of (i) sensitivity of the complex formation rate with respect to constituting species abundance, and (ii) relative stability of the complex as compared with that of the constituents. By employing an approximate moment analysis, we find that for a given steady state level, there is an optimal sensitivity that minimizes noise (quantified by fano-factor; variance/mean) in the complex level. Furthermore, the noise becomes smaller if the complex is less stable than its constituents. Finally, for the heteromer case, our findings show that noise is enhanced if the complex is comparatively more sensitive to one constituent. We briefly discuss implications of our result for general complex formation processes.",

Yet, intrinsic limitations of the technology result in very sparse coverage of CpG sites (around 5% to 20% coverage), effectively limiting the analysis repertoire to a semi-quantitative level. Here we introduce Melissa (MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis), a Bayesian hierarchical method to quantify spatially-varying methylation profiles across genomic regions from single-cell bisulfite sequencing data (scBS-seq). Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic differences and similarities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings, and state-of-the-art imputation performance. An R implementation of Melissa is publicly available at https://github.com/andreaskapou/Melissa.",

    "abstract": "Keratinocytes maintain epidermis integrity and function including physical and antimicrobial barrier through cellular differentiation. This process is predicted to be controlled by calcium ion gradient and nutritional stress. Keratinocytes undergo proteome changes during differentiation, which enhances the intracellular organelle digestion to sustain the stress conditions. However, the molecular mechanism between epidermal differentiation and organelle homeostasis is poorly understood. Here, we used primary neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes to study the link between cellular differentiation, signaling pathways and organelle turnover. Upon addition of calcium chloride (2 mM) to the culture medium, keratinocytes increased their cell size and the expression of differentiation markers. Moreover, differentiated keratinocytes showed enhanced lysosome biogenesis that was dependent on ATF6-arm of UPR signaling but independent of mTOR-MiT/TFE transcription factors. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of mTOR has increased keratinocyte differentiation and relocalized the MiT/TFE TFs to the lysosome membranes, indicating that autophagy activation promotes the epidermal differentiation. Interestingly, differentiation of keratinocytes resulted in dispersal of fragmented Golgi and lysosomes, and the later organelles showed colocalization with Golgi-tethering proteins, suggesting that these lysosomes possibly originated from Golgi, hence named as Golgi-associated lysosomes (GALs). Consistent to this prediction, inhibition of Golgi function using brefeldin A completely abolished the formation of GALs and the keratinocyte differentiation. Thus, ER stress regulates the biogenesis of GALs, which maintains keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Tissue specific gene expression underpins cell type diversity, and arises from the cooperative activities of transcription factors and the chromatin landscape. It has been previously demonstrated that enhancers with specific arrangements of transcription factor binding motifs can bring together commonly and specifically expressed factors in order to stabilize chromatin accessibility and drive spatially restricted reporter expression within different regions of the CNS. However, when reporters were used to analyse the activity of enhancers bound differentially by a common factor in the endoderm and CNS, several examples of non-tissue specific reporter expression were observed. In order to judge whether or not this may have been due to the unregulated chromatin environment of exogenously delivered enhancer reporters, here we have analysed the chromatin landscape of cells from the CNS and endodermal tissues and find that this reflects neighbouring gene expression to a greater degree than transcription factor binding. This work demonstrates that chromatin accessibility plays an essential role in defining enhancer activity in distantly related cell types.",

Previously we overcame this obstacle by imaging the Dot/Icm T4BSS in its native state within intact cells through electron cryotomography. Here we extend our observations by imaging a stabilized mutant that yielded a higher resolution map. We describe for the first time the presence of a well-ordered central channel that opens up into a windowed large (~32 nm wide) secretion chamber with an unusual 13-fold symmetry. We then dissect the complex by matching proteins to densities for many components, including all those with periplasmic domains. The placement of known and predicted structures of individual proteins into the map reveals the architecture of the T4BSS and provides a roadmap for further investigation of this amazing specialized secretion system.",

A report from the tropical southern India (Inamdar et al., 2012), claims a TSD (FMFM) mechanism in this species in which the male/female ratio in embryos oscillates within a range of 3-4{degrees}C. The present study presents results of experiments done in 4 consecutive breeding seasons of C. versicolor belonging to the subtropical/temperate climate of northern region of India. Eggs were grown at different temperatures (at 24.5/28/31.5{degrees}C) or under seminatural conditions. Another set of eggs was exposed to fadrozol, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), or Lithium Chloride (inhibitor of GSK3 enzyme inducing Wnt4-dependent Beta-Catenin). Results confirm our earlier finding that in this subtropical population of C. versicolor, temperature does not regulate gonadal differentiation but AI-induces sex reversal to the male sex (Ganesh and Raman, 1995, Ganesh et al 1999). We also report lack of any effect of Sox9 inhibitor on sexual differentiation which may be due to inadequate quantity or mode of application. Importantly, we report the serendipitous observation that in each year almost all the embryos/hatchlings were of the same sex ( females in 2013, 15, 16 and males in 2014) regardless of the rearing condition and duration of incubation. Obviously, parthenogenesis is not the cause of it. In the absence of an obvious reason to explain this pattern, we surmise that in this north Indian population of C. versicolor, female is the default sex, and certain epigenetic regulators could modulate the sexual differentiation of the individual.",

    "abstract": "Oscillating redox conditions are the norm in tropical soils; driven by an ample supply of reductants, high moisture, microbial oxygen consumption, and finely textured clays that limit diffusion. Yet the net result of variable soil redox regimes on iron-organic matter (Fe-OM) associations in tropical soils owing to changing climate is poorly understood. Using a 44-day redox incubation experiment with humid tropical soils from Puerto Rico, we examined patterns of Fe and C transformation under four redox regimes: static anoxic, flux 4-day (4d oxic, 4d anoxic), flux 8-day (8d oxic, 4d anoxic) and static anoxic. Prolonged anoxia promoted reductive dissolution of Fe-oxides and an increase in short-range ordered (SRO) Fe oxides. Preferential dissolution of this less-crystalline Fe pool was evident immediately following a shift in bulk redox status (oxic to anoxic), and coincided with increased dissolved organic carbon, presumably due to acidification or direct release of OM from dissolving Fe(III) mineral phases. Average nominal oxidation state of water-soluble carbon was lowest under persistent anoxic conditions, suggesting more reduced OC is microbially preserved under reducing conditions. Anoxic soil compounds had high H/C values (similar to lignin-like metabolites) whereas oxic soil compounds had higher O/C values, akin to tannin- and cellulose-like components. Cumulative respiration derived from native soil organic carbon was highest in static oxic soils. These results highlight the volatility of mineral-OM interactions in tropical soils, and suggest that short-term impacts of shifting soil O2 availability control exchanges of C between mineral-sorbed and aqueous pools, implying that the periodicity of low-redox moments may control the fate of C in wet tropical soils.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/312108_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (23K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@add07borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15269bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ca034org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9d793_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Toc Art C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvery biological experiment requires a choice of throughput balanced against physiological relevance. Most primary drugs screens neglect critical parameters such as microenvironmental conditions, cell-cell heterogeneity, and specific readouts of cell fate for the sake of throughput.\n\nMethodsHere we describe a methodology to quantify proliferation and viability of single cells in 3D culture conditions by leveraging automated microscopy and image analysis to facilitate reliable and high-throughput measurements. We detail experimental conditions that can be adjusted to increase either throughput or robustness of the assay, and we provide a stand alone image analysis program for users who wish to implement this 3D drug screening assay in high throughput.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate this approach by evaluating a combination of RAF and MEK inhibitors on melanoma cells, showing that cells cultured in 3D collagen-based matrices are more sensitive than cells grown in 2D culture, and that cell proliferation is much more sensitive than cell viability. We also find that cells grown in 3D cultured spheroids exhibit equivalent sensitivity to single cells grown in 3D collagen, suggesting that for the case of melanoma, a 3D single cell model may be equally effective for drug identification as 3D spheroids models. The single cell resolution of this approach enables stratification of heterogeneous populations of cells into differentially responsive subtypes upon drug treatment, which we demonstrate by determining the effect of RAK/MEK inhibition on melanoma cells co-cultured with fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that spheroids grown from single cells exhibit dramatic heterogeneity to drug response, suggesting that heritable drug resistance can arise stochastically in single cells but be retained by subsequent generations.\n\nConclusionIn summary, image-based analysis renders cell fate detection robust, sensitive, and high-throughput, enabling cell fate evaluation of single cells in more complex microenvironmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The endosome-to-Golgi or endocytic retrograde trafficking pathway is an important post-Golgi recycling route. We made a novel discovery that the retrograde trafficking of cargos is inhibited and stimulated by the absence and presence, respectively, of amino acids (AAs), especially glutamine. By testing components of the AA-stimulated mTORC1 signaling pathway, we demonstrated that SLC38A9, v-ATPase and Ragulator, but not Rag GTPases and mTORC1, are essential for the AA-stimulated trafficking. Arl5, an ARF-like family small GTPase, interacts with Ragulator in an AA-regulated manner and both Arl5 and its effector, the Golgi-associated retrograde protein complex (GARP), are required for the AA-stimulated trafficking. We have therefore identified a mechanistic connection between the nutrient signaling and the retrograde trafficking pathway, whereby SLC38A9 and v-ATPase sense AA-sufficiency and Ragulator functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate Arl5, which, together with GARP, a tethering factor, probably facilitates the endosome-to-Golgi trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementPLK4 binds to microtubules and self assembles into supramolecular assemblies that recruit tubulin and trigger de novo MTOC formation in Xenopus laevis extracts.\\n\\nAbstractThe centrosome is an important microtubule-organizing center (MTOCs) in animal cells and it consists of two barrel-shaped structures (centrioles), surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM), which nucleates microtubules. PCM components form condensates, supramolecular assemblies that concentrate microtubule nucleators. Centrosomes can form close to an existing structure (canonical duplication) or de novo. How centrosomes form de novo is not known. PLK4 is a master driver of centrosome biogenesis, which is critical to recruit several centriole components. Here, we investigate the beginning of centrosome biogenesis, taking advantage of Xenopus egg extracts, where we and others have shown that PLK4 can induce de novo MTOC formation (Eckerdt et al., 2011; Zitouni et al., 2016). Surprisingly, we observe that in vitro, PLK4 can self-assemble into supramolecular assemblies that recruit /{beta}-tubulin. In Xenopus extracts, PLK4 supramolecular assemblies additionally recruit the PLK4 substrate STIL and the microtubule nucleator, {gamma}-tubulin, and form acentriolar MTOCs de novo. The assembly of these robust microtubule asters is independent of dynein, similarly to centrosomes. We suggest a new mechanism of action for PLK4, where it forms a self-organizing catalytic scaffold that recruits centriole components, PCM factors and /{beta}-tubulin, leading to MTOC formation.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages encounter and clear apoptotic cells during normal development and homeostasis, including at numerous sites of pathology. Clearance of apoptotic cells has been intensively studied, but the effects of macrophage-apoptotic cell interactions on macrophage behaviour are poorly understood. Using Drosophila embryos, we have exploited the ease of manipulating cell death and apoptotic cell clearance in this model to identify that the loss of the apoptotic cell clearance receptor Simu leads to perturbation of macrophage migration and inflammatory responses via pathological levels of apoptotic cells. Removal of apoptosis ameliorates these phenotypes, while acute induction of apoptosis phenocopies these defects and reveals that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is not necessary for their anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, Simu is necessary for clearance of necrotic debris and rentention of macrophages at wounds. Thus, Simu is a general detector of damaged self and represents a novel molecular player in controlling resolution of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "-Xenorhabdolysins (Xax) are -pore-forming toxins (-PFT) from pathogenic bacteria that form 1-1.3 MDa large pore complexes to perforate the host cell membrane. PFTs are used by a variety of bacterial pathogens as an offensive or defensive mechanism to attack host cells. Due to the lack of structural information, the molecular mechanism of action of Xax toxins is poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the XaxAB pore complex from Xenorhabdus nematophila at an average resolution of 4.0 [A] and the crystal structures of the soluble monomers of XaxA and XaxB at 2.5 [A] and 3.4 [A], respectively. The structures reveal that XaxA and XaxB are built similarly and appear as heterodimers in the 12-15 subunits containing pore. The structure of the XaxAB pore represents therefore the first structure of a bi-component -PFT. Major conformational changes in XaxB, including the swinging out of an amphipathic helix are responsible for membrane insertion. XaxA acts as an activator and stabilizer for XaxB that forms the actual transmembrane pore. Based on our results, we propose a novel structural model for the mechanism of action of Xax toxins.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory glomerulus is the anatomical and functional unit of the olfactory bulb, defined by convergent input from olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons expressing the same type of odorant receptor (OR). A key marker of mature OSNs is the olfactory marker protein (OMP), whose deletion has been associated with deficits in OSN signal transduction and odor discrimination. Here, we have investigated glomerular odor responses and anatomical architecture in mice in which one or both alleles of OMP were replaced by the fluorescent synaptic activity reporter, synaptopHluorin (OMP+/- and OMP-/- mice, respectively). Functionally heterogeneous glomeruli, that is, ones with micro-domains with distinct odor responses were rare in OMP+/- mice, but occurred frequently in OMP-/- mice. Genetic targeting of single ORs revealed that these micro-domains arise from anomalous co-innervation of individual glomeruli by OSNs expressing different ORs. The glomerular mistargeting of OSNs in the absence of OMP is restricted to a local neighborhood of a few glomerular diameters. Our studies document functional heterogeneity in sensory input within individual glomeruli and uncover its anatomical correlate, revealing an unexpected role for OMP in the formation and refinement of the glomerular olfactory map.",

In particular we use a proprioceptively driven neural control circuit to consider the effects of proprioception, body elasticity and environmental drag on the waveform, frequency and speed of undulations. We find qualitative differences in the frequency-wavelength relationship obtained under extrinsic modulation of the environmental fluid or body elasticity versus intrinsic modulation due to changes in the sensorimotor control.

    "abstract": "Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of brain structure and function through the high resolution and large penetration depth it offers. Investigating neural structures in vivo requires gaining optical access to the brain, which is typically achieved by replacing a part of the skull with one or several layers of cover glass windows. To compensate for the spherical aberrations caused by the presence of these layers of glass, collar-correction objectives are typically used. However, the efficiency of this correction has been shown to depend significantly on the tilt angle between the glass window surface and the optical axis of the imaging system. Here we expand these observations and characterize the effect of the tilt angle on the collected fluorescence signal with thicker windows (double cover glass) and compare these results with an objective devoid of collar-correction. Finally, we present a simple optical alignment device designed to rapidly minimize the tilt angle in vivo and align the optical axis of the microscope perpendicularly to the glass window, thereby significantly improving the imaging quality. The performance of the device is demonstrated in an in vivo setting and a tilt-correction procedure is described, enabling the accurate alignment (<0.2{degrees}) of the cover glass with the imaging plane in only few iterations.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a potential source of new molecules to counter the increase in antimicrobial resistant infections but a better understanding of their properties is required to understand their native function and for effective translation as therapeutics. Details of the mechanism of their interaction with the bacterial plasma membrane are desired since damage or penetration of this structure is considered essential for AMP activity. Relatively modest modifications to AMP primary sequence can induce substantial changes in potency and/or spectrum of activity but, hitherto, have not been predicted to substantially alter the mechanism of interaction with the bacterial plasma membrane. Here we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, circular dichroism, solid-state NMR and patch clamp to investigate the extent to which temporin B and its analogues can be distinguished both in vitro and in silico on the basis of their interactions with model membranes. Enhancing the hydrophobicity of the N-terminus and cationicity of the C-terminus in temporin B improves its membrane activity and potency against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, enhancing the cationicity of the N-terminus abrogates its ability to trigger channel conductance and renders it ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus while nevertheless enhancing its potency against Escherichia coli. Our findings suggest even closely related AMPs may target the same bacterium with fundamentally differing mechanisms of action.",

We study this coupling in undulatory locomotion, with a view to better understanding the relative roles of central and reflex-driven control. We ask how the coupling between neural control and body mechanics is affected by sensory inputs during undulatory locomotion in C. elegans. To address this question, we use a biomechanical simulation framework, within which we separately model feed forward and feedback controlled undulations. We characterize neuromechanical phase lag and locomotion speed using body stiffness as a control parameter. We show that sensory entrainment can suppress neuromechanical phase lag, that would otherwise emerge under centrally generated feed forward control.",
