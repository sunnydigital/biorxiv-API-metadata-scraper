    "abstract": "Transposable elements are emerging as an important source of cis-acting regulatory sequences and epigenetic marks that could influence gene expression. However, few studies have dissected the role of specific transposable element insertions on epigenetic gene regulation. Bari-Jheh is a natural transposon that mediates resistance to oxidative stress by adding cis-regulatory sequences that affect expression of nearby genes. In this work, we integrated publicly available data with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to get a more comprehensive picture of Bari-Jheh molecular effects. We showed that Bari-Jheh was enriched for H3K9me3 in nonstress conditions, and for H3K9me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in oxidative stress conditions, which is consistent with expression changes in adjacent genes. We further showed that under oxidative stress conditions, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 spread to the promoter region of Jheh1 gene. Finally, another insertion of the Bari1 family was associated with increased H3K27me3 in oxidative stress conditions suggesting that Bari1 histone marks are copy-specific. We concluded that besides adding cis-regulatory sequences, Bari-Jheh influences gene expression by affecting the local chromatin state.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction is a useful tool to accelerate genetic gain in selection using DNA marker information. However, this technology usually relies on models that are not designed to accommodate population heterogeneity, which results from differences in marker effects across genetic backgrounds. Previous studies have proposed to cope with population heterogeneity using diverse approaches: (i) either ignoring it, therefore relying on the robustness of standard approaches; (ii) reducing it, by selecting homogenous subsets of individuals in the sample; or (iii) modelling it by using interactive models. In this study we assessed all three possible approaches, applying existing and novel procedures for each of them. All procedures developed are based on deterministic optimizations, can account for heteroscedasticity, and are applicable in contexts of admixed populations. In a case study on a diverse switchgrass sample, we compared the procedures to a control where predictions rely on homogeneous subsamples. Ignoring heterogeneity was often not detrimental, and sometimes beneficial, to prediction accuracy, compared to the control. Reducing heterogeneity did not result in further increases in accuracy. However, in scenarios of limited subsample sizes, a novel procedure, which accounted for redundancy within subsamples, outperformed the existing procedure, which only considered relationships to selection candidates. Modelling heterogeneity resulted in substantial increases in accuracy, in the cases where accounting for population heterogeneity yielded a highly significant improvement in fit. Our study exemplifies advantages and limits of the various approaches that are promising in various contexts of population heterogeneity, e.g. prediction based on historical datasets or dynamic breeding.",

    "abstract": "Decoding sensory stimuli from neural signals can be used to reveal how we sense our physical environment, and is valuable for the design of brain-machine interfaces. However, existing linear techniques for neural decoding may not fully reveal or exploit the fidelity of the neural signal. Here we develop a new approximate Bayesian method for decoding natural images from the spiking activity of populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We sidestep known computational challenges with Bayesian inference by exploiting artificial neural networks developed for computer vision, enabling fast nonlinear decoding that incorporates natural scene statistics implicitly. We use a decoder architecture that first linearly reconstructs an image from RGC spikes, then applies a convolutional autoencoder to enhance the image. The resulting decoder, trained on natural images and simulated neural responses, significantly outperforms linear decoding, as well as simple point-wise nonlinear decoding. These results provide a tool for the assessment and optimization of retinal prosthesis technologies, and reveal that the retina may provide a more accurate representation of the visual scene than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network. The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa.\\n\\nWe report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The relationship between several measures of network centrality and sensitivity to mutation is weak, but point estimates of the correlation between network centrality and mutational variance are positive, with only one exception. There is a marginally significant correlation between core number and mutational heritability. There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites.\\n\\nPositive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between shortest path length and the mutational correlation between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.",

While measuring selection on principal component scores is an apparent solution to this challenge, this approach has been heavily criticized due to difficulties in interpretation and relating PC axes back to the original traits. We describe and illustrate how to transform selection gradients for PC scores back into selection gradients for the original traits, addressing issues of multicollinearity and biological interpretation. We demonstrate this approach with empirical data and examples from the literature, highlighting how selection estimates for PC scores can be interpreted while reducing the consequences of multicollinearity.",

While low migration rates prevent local populations from becoming extinct, high migration rates enhance the risk of global extinction by synchronizing the dynamics of connected populations. Here, we investigate this trade-off using two mutualistic strains of E. coli that exhibit population oscillations when co-cultured. In experiments, as well as in simulations using a mechanistic model, we observe that high migration rates lead to in-phase synchronization whereas intermediate migration rates perturb the oscillations and change their period. Further, our simulations predict, and experiments show, that connected populations subjected to more challenging antibiotic concentrations have the highest probability of survival at intermediate migration rates. Finally, we identify altered population dynamics, rather than recolonization, as the primary cause of extended survival.",

Combining functional imaging and psychophysics, we examined if color from long-range filling-in engages distinct pathways from responses caused by a field of uniform chromaticity. We find that color from filling-in is best classified and best correlated with appearance by two dorsal areas, V3A and V3B/KO. In contrast, a field of uniform chromaticity is best classified by ventral areas hV4 and LO. Dynamic causal modeling revealed feedback modulation from area V3A to areas V1 and LO for filling-in, contrasting with feedback from LO modulating areas V1 and V3A for a matched uniform chromaticity. These results indicate a dorsal stream role in color filling-in via feedback modulation of area V1 coupled with a cross-stream modulation of ventral areas suggesting that local and contextual influences on color appearance engage distinct neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Protein adopts multitude of flexible and rapidly interconverting conformers, many which are governed by specific protein-interaction domains. ApoA1, a key player involved in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) regulation exists in structurally diverse forms with varying degree of cholesterol association, and each state is associated with different functional properties. While disc-shaped HDL and its oligomeric ApoA1 protein components have been the focus of several investigations, structural properties of monomeric ApoA1 are poorly understood. Here, we undertook large-scale structural analysis of ApoA1 in apo and cholesterol-bound forms using tens of independent simulations with total computing time exceeding 50 s. Examination of multiple lipid-free trajectories of monomeric ApoA1 revealed a common conformation, with distinct spatial proximity between N- and C-terminal domains. With incorporation of physiologically known cholesterol concentration ({approx}100 cholesterol molecules) in ApoA1 simulations, the monomeric protein spontaneously formed an open circular topology. Remarkably, these drastic structural perturbations are driven by specific binding site at C-terminal and a novel cholesterol binding site at the N-terminal. We proposed a mechanism of stage-wise opening of ApoA1 and demonstrated that less cholesterol concentration around interaction sites or mutation within N-terminal binding sites does not lead to open bell-shaped topology. The kinetic barriers between open and closed-states also showed an ensemble of loosely packed helix bundle (H1-H7; H4-H7) that posed as a slow-intermediate step. Lastly we performed complementary experiments, including ITC and CD measurements to confirm that structural changes are induced by ligand association and not driven by random hydrophobic effect. Collectively, our study suggests a previously unknown mechanism of cholesterol sequestering by ApoA1 that could directly aid in developing modulators for cholesterol efflux with chronic cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "The accuracy of machine learning tasks critically depends on high quality ground truth data. Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFood security is a growing global concern. Farmers, plant breeders, and geneticists are hastening to address the challenges presented to agriculture by climate change, dwindling arable land, and population growth. Scientists in the field of plant phenomics are using satellite and drone images to understand how crops respond to a changing environment and to combine genetics and environmental measures to maximize crop growth efficiency. However, the terabytes of image data require new computational methods to extract useful information. Machine learning algorithms are effective in recognizing select parts of images, but they require high quality data curated by people to train them, a process that can be laborious and costly. We examined how well crowdsourcing works in providing training data for plant phenomics, specifically, segmenting a corn tassel - the male flower of the corn plant - from the often-cluttered images of a cornfield. We provided images to students, and to Amazon MTurkers, the latter being an on-demand workforce brokered by Amazon.com and paid on a task-by-task basis. We report on best practices in crowdsourcing image labeling for phenomics, and compare the different groups on measures such as fatigue and accuracy over time. We find that crowdsourcing is a good way of generating quality labeled data, rivaling that of experts.",

However, not only do the precise genetic mechanisms specifying neuronal cell types remain obscure, access to these neuronal cell types by transgenic techniques also remains elusive. While most genes are expressed in the brain, the vast majority are expressed in many different kinds of neurons, suggesting that promoters alone are not sufficiently specific to distinguish cell types. However, there are orders of magnitude more distal genetic cis-regulatory elements controlling transcription (i.e. enhancers), so we screened for enhancer activity in microdissected samples of mouse cortical subregions. This identified thousands of novel putative enhancers, many unique to particular cortical subregions.

We focus on producing results detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enabling comparison with future studies. Here we report our examination of intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons. We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell types and layers we sampled, with the most sparse connections in layers 5 and 6. Almost all mouse synapses exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics. Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons; however, exhibited facilitation.

The M83 transgenic mouse is a model of synucleinopathy, which develops severe motor symptoms associated with aggregation of -syn. M83 neonate or adult mice were injected with adeno-associated virus vectors carrying the human {beta}-syn gene (AAV{beta}-syn) or green fluorescent protein gene (AAVGFP) using different injection sites. One or two months later, M83 disease was accelerated or not using brain M83 extracts from mouse (M83) or human (MSA) origins. AAV mediated {beta}-syn overexpression detected by ELISA did not delay the disease onset, regardless of the AAV injection route and of the inoculation of brain extracts. Accordingly, phosphorylated -syn levels detected by ELISA in sick mice were similar after injecting AAV{beta}-syn or AAVGFP. Instead, immunohistochemistry analysis of {beta}-syn indicated the presence of proteinase-K resistant {beta}-syn staining specifically in sick M83 mice inoculated with AAV{beta}-syn.

Community detection identifies candidate modules as hypotheses, which then need to be validated through experiments, such as mutagenesis in a biological laboratory.

Experiments on many large networks show that CRO_SCPCAPANKC_SCPCAP effectively prioritizes communities, yielding a nearly 50-fold improvement in community prioritization.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous spiking of multiple neurons is a key phenomenon in normal brain function and pathologies. Recently, approaches to record spikes from the intact cortical surface using small high-density arrays of microelectrodes have been reported. It remained unaddressed how epicortical spiking relates to intracortical unit activity. We introduce a mesoscale approach using an array of 64 electrodes with intermediate diameter (250 {micro}m) and combined large-coverage epicortical recordings in ferrets with intracortical recordings via laminar probes. Empirical data and modeling strongly suggest that our epicortical electrodes selectively captured synchronized spiking of neurons in the subjacent cortex. As a result, responses to sensory stimulation were more robust and less noisy as compared to intracortical activity, and receptive field properties were well preserved in epicortical recordings. This should promote insights into assembly-coding beyond the informative value of subdural EEG or single-unit spiking, and be advantageous to real-time applications in brain-machine interfacing.\\n\\nSignificance statementElectrocorticography allows chronic, low-noise recordings from the intact cortical surface - a prerequisite for investigations into brain network dynamics and brain-machine interfaces. Novel electrodes can capture spiking activity at the surface, which should boost precision in the spatial - and time domain, compared to conventional EEG-like measurements. To clarify how surface spiking relates to intracortically fired action potentials, we recorded both types of signal simultaneously from sensory cortices in anesthetized ferrets. Results suggest that mesoscale (250 {micro}m) surface electrodes can selectively capture synchronized spiking from nearby cortical columns, which reduces contamination by non-representative, jittering spikes. Given the high relevance of neural synchrony for sensorimotor and cognitive processing, the novel methodology may improve signal decoding in brain-machine interface approaches.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsE.G.L., T.B. and A.K.E. conceptualized the research; E.G.L. and F.P. performed experiments; T.B. and E.G.L. wrote Matlab routines for data analysis; T.B. and E.G.L. analyzed the data; T.S. provided technical resources; T.B., E.G.L. and A.K.E. wrote the manuscript; G.E. administrated the project; A.K.E. acquired funding.",

    "abstract": "1. The animal model is a key tool in quantitative genetics and has been used extensively to estimate fundamental parameters, such as additive genetic variance, heritability, or inbreeding effects. An implicit assumption of animal models is that all founder individuals derive from a single population. This assumption is commonly violated, for instance in cross-bred livestock breeds, when an observed population receive immigrants, or when a meta-population is split into genetically differentiated subpopulations. Ignoring genetic differences among different source populations of founders may lead to biased parameter estimates, in particular for the additive genetic variance.\\n\\n2. To avoid such biases, genetic group models, extensions to the animal model that account for the presence of more than one genetic group, have been proposed. As a key limitation, the method to date only allows that the breeding values differ in their means, but not in their variances among the groups. Methodology previously proposed to account for group-specific variances included terms for segregation variance, which rendered the models infeasibly complex for application to most real study systems.\\n\\n3. Here we explain why segregation variances are often negligible when analyzing the complex polygenic traits that are frequently the focus of evolutionary ecologists and animal breeders. Based on this we suggest an extension of the animal model that permits estimation of group-specific additive genetic variances. This is achieved by employing group-specific relatedness matrices for the breeding value components attributable to different genetic groups. We derive these matrices by decomposing the full relatedness matrix via the generalized Cholesky decomposition, and by scaling the respective matrix components for each group. To this end, we propose a computationally convenient approximation for the matrix component that encodes for the Mendelian sampling variance. Although convenient, this approximation is not critical.\\n\\n4. Simulations and an example from an insular meta-population of house sparrows in Norway with three genetic groups illustrate that the method is successful in estimating group-specific additive genetic variances and that segregation variances are indeed negligible in the empirical example.\\n\\n5. Quantifying differences in additive genetic variance within and among populations is of major biological interest in ecology, evolution, and animal and plant breeding. The proposed method allows to estimate such differences for subpopulations that form a connected meta-population, which may also be useful to study temporal or spatial variation of additive genetic variance.",

    "abstract": "Descriptions of ecological networks typically assume that the same interspecific interactions occur each time a community is observed. This contrasts with the known stochasticity of ecological communities: community composition, species abundances, and link structure all vary in space and time. Moreover, finite sampling generates variation in the set of interactions actually observed. Here we develop the conceptual and analytical tools needed to capture uncertainty in the estimation of pairwise interactions. To define the problem, we identify the different contributions to the uncertainty of an interaction and its implications for the estimation of network properties. We then outline a framework to quantify the uncertainty around each interaction. We illustrate this framework using the most extensively sampled network to date. We found significant uncertainty in estimates for the probability of most pairwise interactions which we could, however, limit with informative priors. Through these efforts, we demonstrate the utility of our approach and the importance of acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in network studies. Most importantly, we stress that networks are best thought of as systems constructed from random variables, the stochastic nature of which must be acknowledged for an accurate representation. Doing so will fundamentally change networks analyses and yield greater realism.",

    "abstract": "Modern next-generation DNA sequencers support multiplex sequencing to improve throughput and decrease costs. This is done by pooling and sequencing samples together in parallel, which are later demultiplexed according to their unique indexes1, 2. When reads are assigned to the wrong index, called index cross-talk, information is leaked between samples3-6. This creates a physical information side-channel, a well known class of vulnerabilities in information security7-10, that may be used to modify downstream results. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of such an attack through the use of a separately indexed library that causes a wild-type human exome to be misclassified as heterozygous at the sickle-cell locus. Simple methods can be used to minimize or detect attempts to modify genetic variants using this side-channel, such as filtering by read quality or finding outliers in read coverage. To further minimize this risk we recommend the use of new library preparation methods that reduce index cross-talk, like unique dual indexes11, 12, whenever samples are sequenced together in important applications. Biotechnology that interfaces molecular and digital information, like DNA sequencers, may have security risks typically associated with information systems, including the side-channel vulnerability described in this study. We encourage the community to consider the security of genomics-information pipelines before they reach mass adoption.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in many cellular processes. Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods.\\n\\nResultsWe extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, recent methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information. The database interface representing our results is accessible from https://rostlab.org/services/ppipair/.

    "abstract": "Nucleobase transporters are important for supplying the cell with purines and/or pyrimidines, for controlling the intracellular pool of nucleotides and for obtaining exogenous nitrogen/carbon sources for the metabolism. Nucleobase transporters are also evaluated as potential targets for antimicrobial therapies, since several pathogenic microorganisms rely on purine/pyrimidine salvage from their hosts. The majority of known nucleobase transporters belong to the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitous NAT/NCS2 protein family. Based on a large-scale phylogenetic analysis that we performed on thousands of prokaryotic proteomes, we have developed a webserver that can detect and distinguish this family of transporters from other homologous families that recognize different substrates. We can further categorize these transporters to certain evolutionary groups with distinct substrate preferences. The webserver scans whole proteomes and graphically displays which proteins are identified as NAT/NCS2, to which evolutionary groups and subgroups they belong to and which conserved motifs they have. For key subgroups and motifs, the server displays annotated information from published crystal-structures and mutational studies pointing to key functional amino acids that may help experts assess the transport capability of the target sequences. The server is 100% accurate in detecting NAT/NCS2 family members. We also used the server to analyze 9109 prokaryotic proteomes and identified Clostridia, Bacilli, {beta}- and {gamma}-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria as the taxa with the largest number of NAT/NCS2 transporters per proteome. An analysis of 120 representative eukaryotic proteomes also demonstrates the servers capability of correctly analyzing this major lineage, with plants emerging as the group with the highest number of NAT/NCS2 members per proteome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe dramatic increase in myotomal muscle mass in post-hatching fish is related to their ability to lastingly produce new muscle fibres, a process termed hyperplasia. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying fish muscle hyperplasia largely remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to characterize intrinsic properties of myogenic cells originating from fish hyperplasic muscle. For this purpose, we compared in situ proliferation, in vitro cell behavior and transcriptomic profile of myogenic precursors originating from hyperplasic muscle of juvenile trout (JT) and from non-hyperplasic muscle of fasted juvenile trout (FJT) and adult trout (AT).\\n\\nResultsFor the first time, we showed that myogenic precursors proliferate in hyperplasic muscle from JT as shown by in vivo BrdU labeling. This proliferative rate was very low in AT and FJT muscle. Transcriptiomic analysis revealed that myogenic cells from FJT and AT displayed close expression profiles with only 64 differentially expressed genes (BH corrected p-val < 0.001). In contrast, 2623 differentially expressed genes were found between myogenic cells from JT and from both FJT and AT. Functional categories related to translation, mitochondrial activity, cell cycle, and myogenic differentiation were inferred from genes up regulated in JT compared to AT and FJT myogenic cells. Conversely, Notch signaling pathway, that signs cell quiescence, was inferred from genes down regulated in JT compared to FJT and AT. In line with our transcriptomic data, in vitro JT myogenic precursors displayed higher proliferation and differentiation capacities than FJT and AT myogenic precursors.\\n\\nConclusionsThe transcriptomic analysis and examination of cell behavior converge to support the view that myogenic cells extracted from hyperplastic muscle of juvenile trout are intrinsically more potent to form myofibres than myogenic cells extracted from non-hyperplasic muscle. The generation of gene expression profiles in myogenic cell extracted from muscle of juvenile trout may yield insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling hyperplasia and provides a useful list of potential molecular markers of hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "O_LIIn addition to their direct trophic effects, some consumers have a positive indirect effect on their resource, due to niche construction. A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Other predators defend their prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, but also ants, beetles, fishes and microbes.\\nC_LIO_LIHere we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two resource-one predator module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources.\\nC_LIO_LIWe consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect of the resource is either non costly, ie resulting from a by-product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the helped resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence.\\nC_LIO_LIWe investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species, and the stability of the community. When niche construction has little or no cost, it leads to higher consumer and helped resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has a strong cost, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Functional validation of candidate genes for adaptation and speciation remains challenging. We here exemplify the utility of a method quantifying individual mRNA transcripts in revealing the molecular basis of divergence in feather pigment synthesis during early-stage speciation in crows. Using a padlock probe assay combined with rolling circle amplification we quantified cell-type specific gene expression in the native, histological context of growing feather follicles. Expression of Tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1), Solute carrier family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2) and Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS) was melanocyte-limited and significantly reduced in follicles from hooded crow explaining the substantially lower melanin content in grey vs. black feathers. The central upstream transcription factor Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) only showed differential expression specific to melanocytes - a feature not captured by bulk RNA-seq. Overall, this study provides insight into the molecular basis of an evolutionary young transition in pigment synthesis, and demonstrates the power of histologically explicit, statistically substantiated single-cell gene expression quantification for functional genetic inference in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation contributes to the diversity and stability of anthocyanins in plants. The process is catalyzed by various glucosyltransferases using different anthocyanidin aglycones and glycosyl donors. An anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-2\\\"-O-glucosyltransferase (3GGT) from purple sweetpotato (cv. Ayamurasaki) served for the catalytic conversion of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside into anthocyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, which is functionally different from the 3GGT ortholog of Arabidopsis. The phylogenetic analysis indicates regioselectivity of 3GGT using UDP-xylose or UDP-glucose as the glycosyl is divergent between Convolvulaceae and Arabidopsis. Homology-based protein modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of Ib3GGT and At3GGT suggested that the Thr-138 of Ib3GGT is a key amino acid residue for UDP-glucose recognition and plays a major role in sugar donor selectivity. The wild type and ugt79b1 mutants of Arabidopsis plants overexpressing Ib3GGT produced the new component cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside. Moreover, Ib3GGT expression was associated with anthocyanin accumulation in different tissues during Ayamurasaki plant development and was regulated by the transcription factor IbMYB1. The localization assay of Ib3GGT showed that further glycosylation occurs in the cytosol and not endoplasmic reticulum. The present study revealed the function of Ib3GGT in further glycosylation of anthocyanins and its Thr-138 is the key amino acid residue for UDP-glucose recognition.",

    "abstract": "When learning new environments, rats often pause at decision points and look back and forth over their possible trajectories as if they were imagining the future outcome of their actions, a behavior termed \\\"Vicarious trial and error\\\" (VTE). As the animal learns the environmental configuration, rats change from deliberative to habitual behavior, and VTE tends to disappear, suggesting a functional relevance in the early stages of learning. Despite the extensive research on spatial navigation, learning and VTE in the rat model, fewer studies have focused on humans. Here, we tested whether head-scanning behaviors that humans typically exhibit during spatial navigation are as predictive of spatial learning as in the rat. Subjects performed a goal-oriented virtual navigation task in a symmetric environment. Spatial learning was assessed through the analysis of trajectories, timings, and head orientations, under habitual and deliberative spatial navigation conditions. As expected, we found that trajectory length and duration decreased with the trial number, implying that subjects learned the spatial configuration of the environment over trials. Interestingly, IdPhi (a standard metric of VTE) also decreased with the trial number, suggesting that humans benefit from the same head-orientation scanning behavior as rats at spatial decision-points. Moreover, IdPhi captured exclusively at the first decision-point of each trial, was correlated with trial trajectory duration and length. Our findings demonstrate that in VTE is a signature of the stage of spatial learning in humans, and can be used to predict performance in navigation tasks with high accuracy.",

To predict a contact, approaches of two types are used: evolutionary coupling analysis (ECA) and supervised learning. ECA uses a large multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of homologue sequences and extract correlation information between residues. Supervised learning uses ECA analysis results as input features and can produce higher accuracy. As described herein, we present a new approach to contact prediction which can both extract correlation information and predict contacts in a supervised manner directly from MSA using a deep neural network (DNN). Using DNN, we can obtain higher accuracy than with earlier ECA methods. Simultaneously, we can weight each sequence in MSA to eliminate noise sequences automatically in a supervised way. It is expected that the combination of our method and other meta-learning methods can provide much higher accuracy of contact prediction.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between biological membranes and disease-associated amyloids are well documented and their prevalence suggests that an inherent affinity exists between these two distinct molecular assemblies. Within the framework of our research project on amyloids and the origins of life, we hypothesized here that such interactions could increase both the sequence and structure space of peptide amyloids in a heterogeneous system and that if cooperative in nature, the interaction could be advantageous to the propagation of these entities in a prebiotic context. Thus, we have investigated the interplay between vesicle-forming fatty acids and amyloidogenic peptides, the respective precursors of lipids and proteins. Individually they are able to form ordered structures under a limited range of conditions with the bilayer of fatty acid vesicles and the cross-{beta} core of amyloids both being repetitive structures that could in principle support a cooperative interaction. Here we report that an 8-residue basic peptide that can form an amphipathic {beta}-strand, that is soluble at neutral pH and that can form amyloids above its pI at pH 11, is also able to cooperatively form novel co-aggregates of diverse structure with and in the context of simple fatty acids at neutral pH. Below the critical vesicle concentration (CVC) the mixtures of fatty acid and peptide yield a flocculent precipitate with an underlying {beta}-structure. Above the CVC, the mixtures yield ribbon or tube-like structures that bear some of the hallmarks of amyloids yet have associated with them a significant amount of fatty acids, likely in a bilayer structure. In the context of the origin of cellular life these results expand the phase space of both peptides and fatty acids while providing a simple yet robust physical connection between two distinct biological entities relevant for life.",

    "abstract": "The genetic architecture of adaptive traits is of key importance to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are polygenic - i.e. result from selection on a large number of genetic loci - but most molecularly characterized traits have a simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory natural selection, a framework that is powerful enough to detect signatures for selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic redundancy among adaptive alleles. We observed convergent phenotypic responses, e.g. fitness, metabolic rate and fat content, and a strong polygenic response (99 selected alleles; mean s=0.061). However, each of these selected alleles increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving replicates. Our results show that natural D. simulans populations harbor a vast reservoir of adaptive variation facilitating rapid evolutionary responses. The observed genetic redundancy potentiates this genotypic variation through multiple genetic pathways leading to phenotypic convergence. This key property of adaptive alleles requires the modification of testing strategies in natural populations beyond the search for convergence on the molecular level.",

For example, in orofacial clefting (OFC), three subtypes - cleft lip (CL), cleft lip and palate (CLP), and cleft palate (CP) have been studied separately and in combination. It is more challenging, however, to dissect the genetic architecture and describe how a given locus may be contributing to distinct subtypes of a trait. We developed a framework for quantifying and interpreting evidence of subtype-specific or shared genetic effects in complex traits. We applied this technique to create a \\\"cleft map\\\" of the association of 30 genetic loci with three OFC subtypes. In addition to new associations, we found loci with subtype-specific effects (e.g., GRHL3 (CP), WNT5A (CLP)), as well as loci associated with two or all three subtypes. We cross-referenced these results with mouse craniofacial gene expression datasets, which identified promising candidate genes. However, we found no strong correlation between OFC subtypes and expression patterns. In aggregate, the cleft map revealed neither subtype-specific nor shared genetic effects operate in isolation in OFC architecture. Our approach can be easily applied to any complex trait with distinct phenotypic subgroups.",

The use of microbes that parasitize or prey on nematodes has been considered as a promising approach for suppressing phytopathogenic nematode populations. However, as effects and persistence of those biological control agents often vary substantially depending on regions, soil characteristics, and agricultural practices, more insights into microbial community processes are required to develop reproducible control of nematode populations. By performing high-throughput sequencing profiling of bacteria and fungi, we examined how root and soil microbiomes differ between benign and nematode-infected plant individuals in a soybean field in Japan. Results indicated that various taxonomic groups of bacteria and fungi occurred preferentially on the soybean individuals infected by root-knot nematodes. Based on a network analysis of potential microbe-microbe associations, we further found that several fungal taxa potentially preying on nematodes [Dactylellina (Orbiliales), Rhizophydium (Rhizophydiales), Clonostachys (Hypocreales), Pochonia (Hypocreales), and Purpureocillium (Hypocreales)] co-occurred in the soybean rhizosphere at a small spatial scale.

Our theory obeys fundamental mathematical limitations on information content inherited from the sensory periphery, identifying redundant codes when there are many more cortical neurons than primary sensory neurons. The theory predicts that if the brain uses its nonlinear population codes optimally, then more informative patterns should be more correlated with choices. More specifically, the theory predicts a simple, easily computed quantitative relationship between fluctuating neural activity and behavioral choices that reveals the decoding efficiency. We analyze recordings from primary visual cortex of monkeys discriminating the distribution from which oriented stimuli were drawn, and find these data are consistent with the hypothesis of near-optimal nonlinear decoding.",

The questions about the origin and the main factor responsible for the present structure of the code are still under a hot debate. Various methodologies have been used to study the features of the code and assess the level of its potential optimality. Here, we introduced a new general approach to evaluate the quality of the genetic code structure. This methodology comes from graph theory and allows us to describe new properties of the genetic code in terms of conductance. This parameter measures the robustness of codon groups against the potential changes in translation of the protein-coding sequences generated by single nucleotide substitutions. We described the genetic code as a partition of an undirected and unweighted graph, which makes the model general and universal. Using this approach, we showed that the structure of the genetic code is a solution to the graph clustering problem. We presented and discussed the structure of the codes that are optimal according to the conductance. Despite the fact that the standard genetic code is far from being optimal according to the conductance, its structure is characterised by many codon groups reaching the minimum conductance for their size. The SGC represents most likely a local minimum in terms of errors occurring in protein-coding sequences and their translation.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceHabitat fragmentation is a significant contributor to the worldwide decline of freshwater ecosystem health, the most pervasive cause of which is culverts. Culverts act as a barrier to fish movement, impacting feeding, predator avoidance, spawning, and community structures. Here we show that a common remediation strategy that involves baffles, is detrimental to the successful passage of small bodied and juvenile fish at high velocities. To remedy this widespread problem, we present a novel remediation design that benefits a range of small-bodied species and juvenile fish at the same high velocities, regardless of morphology or ecological niche. The application of this remediation design may be expanded to any smooth surfaced anthropogenic structure, to improve fish passage and restore ecosystem functionality.\\n\\nAbstractCulverts are a major cause of habitat fragmentation in freshwater ecosystems, are a barrier to fish movement, and are regarded as a significant contributor in the decline of freshwater fish populations globally. To try to address this, various culvert remediation designs have been implemented, including the installation of vertical baffles and the provision of naturalistic (rock) substrates. While remediation strategies generally aim to reduce the velocity of water flowing through the structure, there is often resistance to their use because the resultant reduction in culvert discharge can negatively impact upstream flooding while also resulting in debris clogging and increased culvert maintenance costs. In addition, baffles markedly increase water turbulence that may be detrimental to passage by some fish species or size classes. Here we present some novel remediation designs that exploit the reduced water velocity in boundary layers along the culvert wall to enhance fish passage without significantly compromising discharge capacity. These longitudinal designs produce an expanded reduced velocity zone along the culvert margins that generate minimal turbulence. We show that these novel designs are significantly advantageous to the swimming endurance and traversability for six small-bodied Australian fish species. We also provide data on how and why some culvert baffle designs may impede small-bodied fish passage. This data scales with increasing water velocity, encompassing inter-specific differences in swimming capacity. These results have broad implications for fish community structure and the requirement of juvenile cohort of large-bodied commercially important species where baffles have been implemented to facilitate fish passage.",

    "abstract": "Drug repositioning, i.e. identifying new uses for existing drugs and research compounds, is a cost-effective drug discovery strategy that is continuing to grow in popularity. Prioritizing and identifying drugs capable of being repositioned may improve the productivity and success rate of the drug discovery cycle, especially if the drug has already proven to be safe in humans. In previous work, we have shown that drugs that have been successfully repositioned have different chemical properties than those that have not. Hence, there is an opportunity to use machine learning to prioritize drug-like molecules as candidates for future repositioning studies. We have developed a feature engineering and machine learning that leverages data from publicly available drug discovery resources: RepurposeDB and DrugBank. ChemVec is the chemoinformatics-based feature engineering strategy designed to compile molecular features representing the chemical space of all drug molecules in the study. ChemVec was trained through a variety of supervised classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and an ensemble model combining the three algorithms). Models were created using various combinations of datasets as Connectivity Map based model, DrugBank Approved compounds based model, and DrugBank full set of compounds; of which RandomForest trained using Connectivity Map based data performed the best (AUC=0.674). Briefly, our study represents a novel approach to evaluate a small molecule for drug repositioning opportunity and may further improve discovery of pleiotropic drugs, or those to treat multiple indications.",

    "abstract": "The N-terminal transactivation domain (NTD) of estrogen receptor alpha, a well-known member of the family of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), mediates the receptors transactivation function to regulate gene expression. However, an accurate molecular dissection of NTDs structure-function relationships remains elusive. Here, using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism, and hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, we show that NTD adopts a mostly disordered, unexpectedly compact conformation that undergoes structural expansion upon chemical denaturation. By combining SAXS, hydroxyl radical protein footprinting and computational modeling, we derive the ensemble-structures of the NTD and determine its ensemble-contact map that reveals metastable regional and long-range contacts, including interactions between residues I33 and S118. We show that mutation at S118, a known phosphorylation site, promotes conformational changes and increases coactivator binding. We further demonstrate via fluorine-19 (19F) NMR that mutations near residue I33 alter 19F chemical shifts at residue S118, confirming the proposed I33-S118 contact in the ensemble of structural disorder. These findings extend our understanding of IDPs structure-function relationship, and how specific metastable contacts mediate critical functions of disordered proteins.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA compact disorder is observed for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of estrogen receptor\\nC_LIO_LIMulti-technique modeling elucidates the NTD ensemble structures\\nC_LIO_LIEnsemble-based contact map reveals metastable contacts between I33 and S118\\nC_LIO_LI19F-NMR data validate the proposed I33-S118 contact in the IDP\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Costs of reproduction are assumed to be widespread, and to have a physiological basis, but the mechanisms driving decreased survival and future fecundity remain elusive. Our overall goals were to assess whether physiological variables are related to workload ability or immediate fitness consequences and if they mediate future survival or reproductive success. We investigated individual variation in physiological state at two breeding stages (incubation, chick-rearing) in female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), for first-and second-broods over two years. Specifically, we measured a suite of 13 physiological traits related to aerobic/metabolic capacity, oxidative stress and muscle damage, intermediary metabolism and energy supply, and immune function. We tested for relationships to traits for workload (e.g. nest visit rate) and fitness (current reproduction, survival and future reproduction).\\n\\nThere was little co-variation among the 13 physiological traits, either in incubating or chick-rearing birds. There were some systematic differences in incubation versus chick-rearing physiology. Chick-rearing birds had lower hematocrit and plasma creatine kinase but higher hemoglobin, triglyceride and uric acid levels. Only plasma corticosterone was repeatable between incubation and chick-rearing. We assessed relationships in a univariate manner, and found very few significant relationships between incubation or chick-rearing physiology and measures of workload, current productivity, future fecundity or survival. Variability in ecological context may complicate the relationship between physiology and behavior. Additionally, individuals may regulate different aspects of their physiology independently, making detection of physiological mediators of cost of reproduction difficult. In a companion paper (Cohen et al. submitted) we explore the utility of multivariate analysis (Principal Components Analysis, Mahalanobis distance) of the same data to account for potentially complex physiological integration.",

    "abstract": "Physiological variation is generally thought or supposed to underlie variation in fitness related traits in wild animals, including reproductive effort, reproductive success, and survival. However, physiological markers of individual quality have proven elusive. In this paper and its companion, we use data on 14 physiological parameters measured in 152 observations of 93 individual European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) over 2 years in an attempt to understand how physiological variation relates to variation in current breeding productivity, future fecundity, and survival. The companion paper, focusing on univariate analysis, showed that individual physiological parameters have little relationship with these performance measures. Here, we used more sophisticated statistical approaches in an attempt to extract a multivariate signal from the biomarkers - physiological dysregulation as calculated via statistical distance, and a number of principal components analysis approaches. Broadly speaking, there was a surprising lack of association between physiology and performance: while some physiological summary measures were associated with some performance measures, the associations were not particularly strong or robust given the large number of statistical tests conducted. This implies either that there are relatively few links between physiology and performance, or, more likely, that the complexity of these relationships exceeds our ability to measure and model it, even using state-of-the-art statistical approaches. This is likely particularly true because our population was quite heterogeneous; we nonetheless urge caution regarding the over-interpretation of isolated significant findings in the literature.",

Monogenic deficiency of individual subunits leads to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is characterized by an inability to make reactive oxygen species, leading to severe opportunistic infections and auto-inflammation. However, not all cases of CGD are due to mutations in previously identified subunits. We recently showed that Eros, a novel and highly conserved ER-resident transmembrane protein, is essential for the phagocyte respiratory burst in mice because it is required for expression of gp91phox-p22phox heterodimer, which are the membrane bound components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. We now show that the function of EROS is conserved in human cells and describe a case of CGD secondary to a homozygous EROS mutation that abolishes EROS protein expression. This work demonstrates the fundamental importance of EROS in human immunity and describes a novel cause of CGD.\\n\\nClinical ImplicationsChronic granulomatous disease is caused by an inability to make reactive oxygen species via the phagocyte NADPH oxidase.

Still, the role of surface IgD remains enigmatic even 50 years after its initial discovery. We here examined the in vivo role of surface IgD in human B-cell homeostasis and antibody responses in four individuals with heterozygous nonsense mutations in IGHD. All IGHD heterozygous individuals had normal numbers of B cells and serum immunoglobulins, and did not show signs of immunodeficiency or immune dysregulation. IgD+ and IgD- naive mature B cells were present in equal numbers and showed similar immunophenotypes, except for decreased expression of CD79b in the IgD- subset. Furthermore, both IgD+ and IgD- naive mature B cells had normal replication histories, similar capacities to differentiate into plasma cells upon in vitro stimulation, and Ig switched memory B cells showed similar levels of somatic hypermutations. Thus human B cells lacking IgD expression develop normally and generate immunological memory in vivo, suggesting that surface IgD might function more restricted in regulating of B-cell activation to specific antigenic structures.",

Ten microsatellite regions were used to examine samples from strains obtained from dispensaries in three states. Samples were examined for genetic similarity within strains, and also a possible genetic distinction between Sativa, Indica, or Hybrid types. The analyses revealed genetic inconsistencies within strains. Additionally, although there was strong statistical support dividing the samples into two genetic groups, the groups did not correspond to commonly reported Sativa/Hybrid/Indica types.

BDNF mediates the panicolytic effect induced by antidepressant drugs and produces these effects per se when injected into the dPAG. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors would have panicolytic properties associated with increased BDNF signaling in the dPAG. We observed that the repeated (7 days), but not acute (1day), systemic administration of the NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AMG; 15 mg/kg/day) increased the latency to escape from the open arm of the elevated T-maze (ETM) and inhibited the number of jumps in hypoxia-induced escape reaction in rats, suggesting a panicolytic-like effect. Repeated, but not acute, AMG administration (15mg/kg) also decreased nitrite levels and increased TRKB phosphorylation at residues Y706/7 in the dPAG. Notwithstanding the lack of AMG effect on total BDNF levels in that structure, the microinjection of the TRK antagonist K252a into the dPAG blocked the anti-escape effect of this drug in the ETM. Taken together our data suggest that the inhibition of NO production by AMG increased the levels of pTRKB, which is required for the panicolytic-like effect observed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbnormal macrostructural development of the cerebral cortex has been associated with hypoxia in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Animal studies have suggested that hypoxia results in cortical dysmaturation at the cellular level. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques offer the potential to investigate the relationship between cerebral oxygen delivery and microstructural development of the cortex in newborn infants with CHD.\\n\\nMethodsWe measured macrostructural and microstructural properties of the cortex in 48 newborn infants with complex CHD and 48 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical volume and gyrification index were calculated from high resolution structural MRI. Neurite density and orientation dispersion indices were modelled using high angular resolution diffusion MRI. Cerebral oxygen delivery was estimated in infants with CHD using phase contrast MRI and pre-ductal pulse oximetry. We used tract-based spatial statistics to examine voxel-wise group differences in cortical microstructure.\\n\\nResultsMicrostructural development of the cortex was abnormal in 48 infants with CHD, with regions of increased fractional anisotropy (FA) and reduced orientation dispersion index (ODI) compared to 48 healthy controls, correcting for gestational age at birth and scan (FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons at P<0.05). Regions of reduced cortical ODI in infants with CHD were related to impaired cerebral oxygen delivery (R2=0.637, n=39). Cortical ODI was associated with gyrification index (R2=0.589, P<0.0001, n=48).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study suggests that the primary component of cerebral cortex dysmaturation in CHD is impaired dendritic arborisation, which may underlie abnormal macrostructural findings reported in this population. The degree of impairment was related to cerebral oxygen delivery, supporting the hypothesis that maternal oxygen therapy may be beneficial in this population.",

    "abstract": "Conversation is an important and ubiquitous social behavior. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (autism) without intellectual disability often have normal structural language abilities but deficits in social aspects of communication like pragmatics, prosody, and eye contact. Previous studies of resting state activity suggest that intrinsic connections among neural circuits involved with social processing are disrupted in autism, but to date no neuroimaging study has examined neural activity during the most commonplace yet challenging social task: spontaneous conversation. Here we used functional MRI to scan autistic males (N=19) without intellectual disability and age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (N=20) while they engaged in a total of 193 face-to-face interactions. Participants completed two kinds of tasks: Conversation, which had high social demand, and Repetition, which had low social demand. Autistic individuals showed abnormally increased task-driven inter-regional temporal correlation relative to controls, especially among social processing regions and during high social demand. Furthermore, these increased correlations were associated with parent ratings of participants social impairments. These results were then compared with previously-acquired resting-state data (56 Autism, 62 Control participants). While some inter-regional correlation levels varied by task or rest context, others were strikingly similar across both task and rest, namely increased correlation among the thalamus, dorsal and ventral striatum, somatomotor, temporal and prefrontal cortex in the autistic individuals, relative to the control groups. These results suggest a basic distinction. Autistic cortico-cortical interactions vary by context, tending to increase relative to controls during Task and decrease during Rest. In contrast, striato- and thalamocortical relationships with socially engaged brain regions are increased in both Task and Rest, and may be core to the condition of autism.",

Here, by recording from neurons in the forelimb representation of M1 in postnatal day (P) 8-12 rats, we demonstrate a rapid shift in its sensory responses. At P8-10, M1 neurons respond overwhelmingly to feedback from sleep-related twitches of the forelimb, but the same neurons do not respond to wake-related movements. By P12, M1 neurons suddenly respond to wake movements, a transition that results from opening the sensory gate in the external cuneate nucleus. Also at P12, few M1 neurons respond to twitches, but the full complement of twitch-related feedback observed at P8 can be unmasked through local disinhibition. Finally, through P12, M1 sensory responses originate in the deep thalamorecipient layers, not primary somatosensory cortex. These findings demonstrate that M1 initially establishes a sensory framework upon which its later-emerging role in motor control is built.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough several studies have provided insights into the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the majority of them has unknown function. Recent evidence has shown the importance of both lncR-NAs and chromatin interactions in transcriptional regulation. Although network-based methods, mainly exploiting gene-lncRNA co-expression, have been applied to characterize lncRNA of unknown function by means of  guilt-by-association strategies, no method exists which combines co-expression analysis with 3D chromatin interaction data.\\n\\nResultsTo better understand the function of chromatin interactions in the context of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation, we have developed a multi-step graph analysis approach to examine the RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET chromatin interaction network in the K562 human cell line. We have annotated the network with gene and lncRNA coordinates, and chromatin states from the ENCODE project. We used centrality measures, as well as an adaptation of our previously developed Markov State Models (MSM) clustering method, to gain a better understanding of lncRNAs in transcriptional regulation. The novelty of our approach resides into the detection of fuzzy regulatory modules based on network properties and their optimization based on co-expression analysis between genes and gene-lncRNA pairs. This results in our method returning more bona fide regulatory modules than other state-of-the art approaches for clustering on graphs.\\n\\nConclusionsInterestingly, we find that lncRNA network hubs tend to be significantly enriched in disease association, positional conservation and enhancer-like functions. We validated regulatory functions for well known lncRNAs, such as MALAT1 and the enhancer-like lncRNA FALEC. In addition, by investigating the modular structure of bigger components we show that we can propose regulatory functional mechanisms for uncharacterized lncRNAs, such FLJ37453, RP11442N24 B.1 and LINC00910.",

    "abstract": "Aromatic interactions make an important contribution to protein structure, function, folding and have attracted intense study. Earlier studies on a recombinant xylanase from Bacillus sp. NG-27 (RBSX), which has the ubiquitous (beta/alpha)8-triosephosphate isomerase barrel fold showed that three aromatic residues to alanine substitutions, in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, significantly decreased the stability of the enzyme. Of these mutations, F4A mutation decreased the stability of the enzyme by [~]4 degree C, whereas W6A mutation and Y343A mutation remarkably decreased the stability of the enzyme by [~]10 degree C. On the other hand, the F4W mutation did not affect the thermal stability of RBSX. We provide here a network perspective of aromatic-aromatic interactions in terms of aromatic clique community and long-range association. Our study reveals that disruption of long-range k-clique aromatic interaction cluster holding the N- and C-terminal regions are associated with the decreased stability of the enzyme. The present work reiterates as well as expands on those findings concerning the role of interactions between the N- and C-terminus in protein stability. Furthermore, comparative analyses of crystal structures of homologous pairs of proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms emphasize the prevalence of long-range k-clique communities of aromatic interaction that may be playing an important role and highlights an additional source of stability in thermophilic proteins. The design principle based on clustering of long-range aromatic residues in the form of aromatic-clique and clique community may be effectively applied to enhance the stability of enzymes for biotechnological applications.\\n\\nDatabaseThe coordinates o fF4A, F4W, W6A, and Y343A are deposited in the PDB database under the accession numbers 5EFF, 5E58, 5EFD, and 5EBA respectively.\\n\\nAbbreviationsBSX, xylanase from Bacilllus sp.

    "abstract": "Humans have evolved the ability to walk very efficiently. Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. 10 healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and on an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed 6-8 trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT-speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 215% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24+/-0.14 m/sec) was 5.1% faster (p>0.05) than the speed that minimized COT (1.18 m/sec) but on rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.06+/-0.07 m/sec) was 6.2% slower (p>0.05) than the COT minimum speed (1.13 m/sec). This suggests that the objective function when walking on rough terrain includes additional factors such as stability.\\n\\nSummary statement: On rough terrain, humans do not choose their walking speed based on metabolic energy minimization alone.",

    "abstract": "House mice (Mus musculus) have dispersed to nearly every major landmass around the globe as a result of human activity. They are a highly successful invasive species, but their presence can be devastating for native ecosystems. This is particularly true on small offshore islands where mouse populations may grow unchecked by predators. Here we use genome-wide SNP genotypes to examine ancestry and population structure on two islands of ecological interest - Southeast Farallon Island, near San Francisco, CA; and Floreana Island in the Galapagos - in the context of a total cohort of 520 mice with diverse geographic origins, as a first step towards genetically-based eradication campaigns. We show that Farallon and Floreana mice, like those from previously-studied islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, are of admixed European ancestry. We find that these populations are on average more inbred than mainland ones and passed through a strong colonization bottleneck with little subsequent genetic exchange. Finally we show that rodenticide resistance alleles present in parts of Europe are absent from all island populations studied. Our results add nuance to previous studies of island populations based on mitochondrial sequences or small numbers of microsatellites and will be useful for future eradication and monitoring efforts.",

    "abstract": "Thermosipho species inhabit thermal environments such as marine hydrothermal vents, petroleum reservoirs and terrestrial hot springs. A 16S rRNA phylogeny of available Thermosipho spp. sequences suggested habitat specialists adapted to living in hydrothermal vents only, and habitat generalists inhabiting oil reservoirs, hydrothermal vents and hotsprings. Comparative genomics of 15 Thermosipho genomes separated them into three distinct species with different habitat distributions: the widely distributed T. africanus and the more specialized, T. melanesiensis and T. affectus. Moreover, the species can be differentiated on the basis of genome size, genome content and immune system composition. For instance, the T. africanus genomes are largest and contained the most carbohydrate metabolism genes, which could explain why these isolates were obtained from ecologically more divergent habitats. Nonetheless, all the Thermosipho genomes, like other Thermotogae genomes, show evidence of genome streamlining. Genome size differences between the species could further be correlated to differences in defense capacities against foreign DNA, which influence recombination via HGT. The smallest genomes are found in T. affectus that contain both CRISPR-cas Type I and III systems, but no RM system genes. We suggest that this has caused these genomes to be almost devoid of mobile elements, contrasting the two other species genomes that contain a higher abundance of mobile elements combined with different immune system configurations. Taken together, the comparative genomic analyses of Thermosipho spp. revealed genetic variation allowing habitat differentiation within the genus as well as differentiation with respect to invading mobile DNA.",

    "abstract": "Dyscalculia, a specific learning disability that impacts arithmetical skills, has previously been associated to a deficit in the precision of the system that estimates the approximate number of objects in visual scenes (the so called  number sense system). However, because in tasks involving numerosity comparisons dyscalculics judgements appears disproportionally affected by continuous quantitative dimensions (such as the size of the items), an alternative view linked dyscalculia to a domain-general difficulty in inhibiting task-irrelevant responses.\\n\\nTo arbitrate between these views, we evaluated the degree of reciprocal interference between numerical and non-numerical quantitative dimensions in adult dyscalculics and matched controls. We used a novel stimulus set orthogonally varying in mean item size and numerosity, putting particular attention into matching both features perceptual discriminability. Participants compared those stimuli based on each of the two dimensions. While control subjects showed no significant size interference when judging numerosity, dyscalculics numerosity judgments were strongly biased by the unattended size dimension. Importantly however, both groups showed the same degree of interference from number when judging mean size. Moreover, only the ability to discard the irrelevant size information when comparing numerosity (but not the reverse) significantly predicted calculation ability across subjects.\\n\\nOverall, our results show that numerosity discrimination is less prone to interference than discrimination of another quantitative feature (mean item size) when the perceptual discriminability of these features is matched, as here in control subjects. By quantifying, for the first time, dyscalculic subjects degree of interference on another orthogonal dimension of the same stimuli, we are able to exclude a domain-general inhibition deficit as explanation for their poor / biased numerical judgement. We suggest that enhanced reliance on non-numerical cues during numerosity discrimination can represent a strategy to cope with a less precise number sense.",

    "abstract": "While a large number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed from the genome of higher eukaryotes, systematic prediction of their functionality has been challenging due to the lack of conserved sequence motifs or structures. Assuming that lncRNAs function as large ribonucleoprotein complexes and thus are easily crosslinked to proteins upon UV irradiation, we performed RNA-Seq analyses of RNAs recovered from the aqueous phase after UV irradiation and phenol-chloroform extraction (UPA-Seq). As expected, the numbers of UPA-Seq reads mapped to known functional lncRNAs were remarkably reduced upon UV irradiation. Comparison with ENCODE eCLIP data revealed that lncRNAs that exhibited greater decreases upon UV irradiation preferentially associated with proteins containing prion-like domains (PrLDs). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed the nuclear localization of novel functional lncRNA candidates, including one that accumulated at the site of transcription. We propose that UPA-Seq provides a useful tool for the selection of lncRNA candidates to be analyzed in depth in subsequent functional studies.",

We describe a knock-in mouse model for the R51Q mutation in sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) that exhibits osteopetrosis and related symptoms of patients of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis linked to this mutation. Osteopetrosis arises in homozygous R51Q SNX10 mice due to a unique combination of reduced numbers of osteoclasts that are non-functional. Fusion of mutant monocytes is deregulated and occurs rapidly and continuously to form giant, non-functional osteoclasts. Mutant osteoclasts mature quickly and survive poorly in vitro, possibly accounting for their scarcity in vivo. These cells also exhibit impaired ruffled borders, which are required for bone resorption, providing an additional basis for the osteopetrotic phenotype. More broadly, we propose that the maximal size of osteoclasts is actively determined by a genetically-regulated, cell-autonomous mechanism that limits precursor cell fusion, and for which SNX10 is required.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic homolog pairing involves associations between homologous DNA regions scattered along the length of a chromosome. When homologs associate, they tend to do so by a processive zippering processive, which apparently results from avidity effects. Using a computational model, we show that this avidity-driven processive zippering reduces the selectivity of pairing. When active random forces are applied to telomeres, this drop in selectivity is eliminated in a force-dependent manner. Further simulations suggest that active telomere forces are engaged in a tug-of-war against zippering, which can be interpreted as a Brownian ratchet with a stall force that depends on the dissociation constant of pairing. When perfectly homologous regions of high affinity compete with homeologous regions of lower affinity, the affinity difference can be amplified through this tug of war effect provided the telomere force acts in a range that is strong enough to oppose zippering of homeologs while still permitting zippering of correct homologs. The degree of unzippering depends on the radius of the nucleus, such that complete unzippering of homeologous regions can only take place if the nucleus is large enough to pull the two chromosomes completely apart. A picture of meiotic pairing thus emerges that is fundamentally mechanical in nature, possibly explaining the purpose of active telomere forces, increased nuclear diameter, and the presence of \\\"Maverick\\\" chromosomes in meiosis.",

    "abstract": "The first terms of the Wright-Fisher (WF) site frequency spectrum that follow the coalescent approximation are determined precisely, with a view to understanding the accuracy of the coalescent approximation for large samples. The perturbing terms show that the probability of a single mutant in the sample (singleton probability) is elevated in WF but the rest of the frequency spectrum is lowered. A part of the perturbation can be attributed to a mismatch in rates of merger between WF and the coalescent. The rest of it can be attributed to the difference in the way WF and the coalescent partition children between parents. In particular, the number of children of a parent is approximately Poisson under WF and approximately geometric under the coalescent. Whereas the mismatch in rates raises the probability of singletons under WF, its offspring distribution being approximately Poisson lowers it. The two effects are of opposite sense everywhere except at the tail of the frequency spectrum. The WF frequency spectrum begins to depart from that of the coalescent only for sample sizes that are comparable to the population size. These conclusions are confirmed by a separate analysis that assumes the sample size n to be equal to the population size N. Partly thanks to the canceling effects, the total variation distance of WF minus coalescent is 0.12/ log N for a population sized sample with n = N, which is only 1% for N = 2 x 104.",

    "abstract": "A popular method for peptide quantification relies on isobaric labeling such as tandem mass tags (TMT) which enables multiplexed proteome analyses. Quantification is achieved by reporter ions generated by fragmentation in a tandem mass spectrometer. However, with higher degrees of multiplexing, the smaller mass differences between the reporter ions increase the mass resolving power requirements. This contrasts with faster peptide sequencing capabilities enabled by lowered mass resolution on Orbitrap instruments. It is therefore important to determine the mass resolution limits for highly multiplexed quantification when maximizing proteome depth. Here we defined the lower boundaries for resolving TMT reporter ions with 0.0063 Da mass differences using an ultra-high-field Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We found the optimal method depends on the relative ratio between closely spaced reporter ions and that 64 ms transient acquisition time provided sufficient resolving power for separating TMT reporter ions with absolute ratio changes up to 16-fold. Furthermore, a 32 ms transient processed with phase-constrained spectrum deconvolution provides >50% more identifications with >99% quantified, but with a slight loss in quantification precision and accuracy. These findings should guide decisions on what Orbitrap resolution settings to use in future proteomics experiments relying on TMT reporter ion quantification with identical integer masses.",

Here, we experimentally showed that intraspecific variation manipulated in a freshwater fish (the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus) led to ecological and transgenerational carry-over effects that were as strong as those of varying temperature by 2{degrees}C. Specifically, variation in fish body mass, growth rate and activity altered the size and abundance of prey, which ultimately affected traits and survival of the next fish generation. Temperature variation modulated other ecosystem functions (e.g. litter decomposition) that were also associated to transgenerational carry-over effects. Our results demonstrate that shifting genotypes or phenotypes in wild populations can have substantial and persistent consequences on ecosystems with a similar intensity than climatic variation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLiving organisms are constantly exposed to toxic xenobiotics and have therefore evolved protective responses. In mammals, the liver and kidney play central roles in protecting the organism from xenobiotics, and are at high risk of xenobiotic-induced injury. Liver and kidney damage by drugs and industrial toxins have been extensively studied from both classical histopathologic and biochemical perspectives.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe introduce a machine learning approach for the analysis of toxicological response. Unsupervised characterization of physiological and histological changes in a large toxicogenomic dataset revealed nine discrete toxin-induced disease states. Transcriptome analysis showed that some of the machine-identified disease states correspond to known pathology, and to known effects of certain toxin classes, but others were novel. Analysis of dynamics revealed transitions between disease states at constant toxin exposure, mostly in the direction of decreased pathology, which implies induction of tolerance. Tolerance correlated with induction of known xenobiotic defense genes and novel decreased ferroptosis sensitivity biomarkers. These data reinforce emerging evidence that ferroptosis drives organ pathology, and suggest that its downreagulation may promote tolerance and recovery. Lastly, mechanism of body weight decrease, a known primary marker for toxicity, was investigated. Combined analysis of food consumption, body weight, and molecular biomarkers indicated that organ disease states promote cachexia by whole-body signaling through Gdf15 and Igf1, suggesting strategies for therapeutic intervention that may be broadly relevant to human disease.\\n\\nConclusionsApplication of machine learning to systematic data collection of physiology, histopathology, transcriptome reveals multiple disease states, tolerance mechanisms and organ to whole-body communication.",

    "abstract": "MotivationApproximately 8% of the human genome is derived from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). In recent years, an increasing number of human diseases have been found to be associated with ERVs. However, it remains challenging to accurately detect the full spectrum of polymorphic (unfixed) ERVs using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.\\n\\nResultsWe designed a new tool, ERVcaller, to detect and genotype transposable element (TE) insertions, including ERVs, in the human genome. We evaluated ERVcaller using both simulated and real benchmark whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets. By comparing with existing tools, ERVcaller consistently obtained both the highest sensitivity and precision for detecting simulated ERV and other TE insertions derived from real polymorphic TE sequences. For the WGS data from the 1000 Genomes Project, ERVcaller detected the largest number of TE insertions per sample based on consensus TE loci. By analyzing the experimentally verified TE insertions, ERVcaller had 94.0% TE detection sensitivity and 96.6% genotyping accuracy. PCR and Sanger sequencing in a small sample set verified 86.7% of examined insertion statuses and 100% of examined genotypes. In conclusion, ERVcaller is capable of detecting and genotyping TE insertions using WGS data with both high sensitivity and precision. This tool can be applied broadly to other species.\\n\\nAvailabilitywww.uvm.edu/genomics/software/ERVcaller.html\\n\\nContactdawei.li@uvm.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic cytoskeletal network is responsible for cell shape changes and cell division. The actin-based motor protein myosin II drives the remodeling of a highly disordered actin-based network and enables the network to perform mechanical work such as contraction, migration and adhesion. Myosin II forms bipolar filaments that self-associate via their tail domains. Such myosin minifilaments generate both extensile and compressive forces that pull and push actin filaments, depending on the relative position of myosin and actin filaments in the network. However, it remains unclear how the mechanical properties of myosin II that rely on the energy of ATP hydrolysis spontaneously contract the disordered actin network. Here, we used a minimal in vitro reconstituted experimental system consisting of actin, myosin, and a cross-linking protein, to gain insights into the molecular mechanism by which myosin minifilaments organize disordered actin networks into contractile states. We found that contracted cluster size and time required for the onset of network contraction decreased as ATP concentration decreased. Contraction velocity was negatively correlated with ATP concentrations. Reduction of ATP concentration caused fragmentation of actin filaments by myosin minifilament. We also found that gelsolin, a Ca2+-regulated actin filament-severing protein, induced contraction of a mechanically stable network, implying that fragmentations of actin filaments in the network weaken the intra-network connectivity and trigger contraction. Our findings reveal that the disordered actin network contraction can be controlled by fragmentation of actin filaments, highlighting the molecular mechanism underlying the myosin motor-severing activities, other than the sliding tensile and compressive stress in the disordered actin network.",

    "abstract": "Soil microbes are drivers of global ecosystem functionality and are continuously subjected to external perturbations. It is fundamental for ecologists and environmental scientists to understand and further predict the microbes responses to these perturbations. A major and ubiquitous perturbation is the addition of chemical nutrients, including fertilizers and animal urine, to soil. Recent biogeographical studies suggest that soil nutrient stoichiometry (i.e., nutritional balance) determines microbial community structure and its functions with regard to material circulation. Given this information, here, we show that soil nutrient stoichiometry, or the bioavailable C:P ratio, determines the impact of nutrient addition on the soils microbial communities. We sampled two soils with similar carbon and nitrogen concentrations but with a 20-fold difference in phosphorus bioavailability. Soil microcosms with carbon and nitrogen amendments were constructed for both the soils. The phosphorus-depleted soil received prolonged effect from carbon and nitrogen amendments: the phosphatase activity gradually increased over a 24-day incubation period and the microbial community structure did not present recovery to its initial state. In contrast, in the other soil, both phosphatase activity and microbial community structure gradually returned to those of the control samples. Phosphorus depletion mitigated carbon and nitrogen intake; therefore, the effects of carbon and nitrogen amendment lasted longer. Our results demonstrate that nutritional stoichiometry is a strong predictor of microbial community dynamics in response to trophic perturbation, particularly when considering the length of time the trait of perturbation persists in the soil.",

    "abstract": "When females mate with multiple partners in a reproductive cycle, the relative number of competing sperm from rival males is often the most critical factor in determining paternity. Gamete production is directly related to testis size in most species, and is associated with both mating behavior within a system and perceived risk of competition. Peromyscus maniculatus is naturally promiscuous and males invest significantly more in sperm production than males of P. polionotus, their monogamous sister-species. Here we show that the relatively larger testes in P. maniculatus are retained, even after decades of enforced monogamy in captivity. While these results suggest that differences in sperm production between species with divergent evolutionary histories can be maintained, we also show that the early rearing environment of males can strongly influence their testis size as adults. Using a second-generation hybrid population to increase variation in testis size, we show that males reared in litters with more brothers develop larger testes as adults. Importantly, this difference in testis size is also associated with increased fertility. Together, our findings suggest that sperm production may be both broadly shaped by natural selection over evolutionary timescales and also finely tuned during early development.",

    "abstract": "Most Dasypyrum villosum resources are highly resistant to wheat powdery mildew that carries Pm21 alleles. However, in the previous studies, four D. villosum lines (DvSus-1 [~] DvSus-4) and two wheat-D. villosum addition lines (DA6V#1 and DA6V#3) were reported to be susceptible to powdery mildew. In the present study, the characteristics of non-functional Pm21 alleles in the above resources were analyzed after Sanger sequencing. The results showed that loss-of-functions of Pm21 alleles Pm21-NF1 [~] Pm21-NF3 isolated from DvSus-1, DvSus-2/DvSus-3 and DvSus-4 were caused by two potential point mutations, a 1-bp deletion and a 1281-bp insertion, respectively. The non-functional Pm21 alleles in DA6V#1 and DA6V#3 were same to that in DvSus-4 and DvSus-2/DvSus-3, respectively, indicating that the susceptibilities of the two wheat genetic stocks came from their D. villosum donors. The origins of non-functional Pm21 alleles were also investigated in this study. Except the target variants involved, the sequences of Pm21-NF2 and Pm21-NF3 were identical to that of Pm21-F2 and Pm21-F3 in the resistant D. villosum lines DvRes-2 and DvRes-3, derived from the accessions GRA961 and GRA1114, respectively. It was suggested that the non-functional alleles Pm21-NF2 and Pm21-NF3 originated from the wild-type alleles Pm21-F2 and Pm21-F3. In summary, this study gives an insight into the sequence characteristics of non-functional Pm21 alleles and their origins in natural population of D. villosum.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of de novo and ultra-rare genetic variants in severe and moderate intellectual disability (ID) has been extensively studied whereas the genetic architecture of mild ID has been less well characterized. To elucidate the genetic background of milder ID we studied a regional cohort of 442 ID patients enriched for mild ID (>50%) from a population isolate of Finland. We analyzed rare variants using exome sequencing and CNV genotyping and common variants using common variant polygenic risk scores. As controls we used a Finnish collection of exome sequenced (n=11311) and GWAS chip genotyped (n=11699) individuals.\\n\\nWe show that rare damaging variants in genes known to be associated with cognitive defects are observed more often in severe (27%) than in mild ID (13%) patients (p-value: 7.0e-4). We further observed a significant enrichment of protein truncating variants in loss-of-function intolerant genes, as well as damaging missense variants in genes not yet associated with cognitive defects (OR: 2.1, p-value: 3e-8). For the first time to our knowledge, we show that a common variant polygenic load significantly contributes to all severity forms of ID. The heritability explained was the highest for educational attainment (EDU) in mild ID explaining 2.2% of the heritability on liability scale. For more severe ID it was lower at 0.6%. Finally, we identified a homozygote variant in the CRADD gene to be a cause of a specific syndrome with ID and pachygyria. The frequency of this variant is 50x higher in the Finnish population than in non-Finnish Europeans, demonstrating the benefits of utilizing population isolates in rare variant analysis of diseases under negative selection.",

Recent research suggests that osmotic stress is also associated with various innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we present the surprising finding that osmolality tightly controls the expression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) in human macrophages. CAMP expression is strongly upregulated under hyperosmotic conditions and downregulated under hypoosmotic conditions. We also provide evidence that this osmolality-mediated antimicrobial response is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Finally, Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation inhibits osmolality-mediated expression of CAMP in human macrophages, suggesting that this osmolality-dependent regulation of CAMP is more relevant under homeostatic conditions, rather than during acute infections.

Unlike viruses with stereotyped shapes, influenza produces virions with significant morphological variability even within clonal populations.

Here we address these questions by developing live strains of influenza A virus amenable to rapid compositional characterization through quantitative, site-specific labeling of viral proteins. Using these strains, we find that influenza A produces virions with broad variations in size and composition from even single infected cells. The virus leverages this phenotypic variability to survive environmental challenges including temperature changes and anti-virals. Complimenting genetic adaptations that act over larger populations and longer times, this  low fidelity assembly of influenza A virus allows small populations to survive environments that fluctuate over individual replication cycles.",

However, technical challenges in quantifying LC integrity have hindered the study of LC-cognition associations in humans. Using high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, we found that individual differences in learning and memory were positively associated with LC integrity across a variety of memory tasks in younger (n = 66), and older adults (n = 228). Moreover, we observed functionally relevant age differences confined to rostral LC. Older adults with a more youth-like rostral LC also showed higher memory performance.
