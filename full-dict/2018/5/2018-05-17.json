    "abstract": "Glioblastomas, lethal primary brain tumors, are known for their heterogeneity and invasiveness. A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Further, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. We harness the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80% reliable. While further validation must be done, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.",

    "abstract": "Cells possess remarkable control of the folding and entanglement topology of long and flexible chromosomal DNA molecules. It is thought that structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes play a crucial role in this, by organizing long DNAs into series of loops. Recent experimental data suggest that SMC complexes are able to translocate on DNA, as well as pull out lengths of DNA via a \\\"loop extrusion\\\" process. We describe a Brownian loop-capture-ratchet model for translocation and loop extrusion based on known structural, catalytic, and DNA-binding properties of the Bacillus subtilis SMC complex. Our model provides an example of a new class of molecular motor where large conformational fluctuations of the motor  track - in this case DNA - are involved in the basic translocation process. Quantitative analysis of our model leads to a series of predictions for the motor properties of SMC complexes, most strikingly a strong dependence of SMC translocation velocity on tension in the DNA track that it is moving along, with \\\"stalling\\\" occuring at subpiconewton tensions. A closely related hallmark of the loop-capture mechanism is a strong dependence of translocation step size on DNA tension. We also discuss how the same mechanism might be used by other structurally related SMC complexes (E. coli MukBEF and eukaryote condensin, cohesin and SMC5/6) to organize genomic DNA.",

    "abstract": "The land-sparing/land-sharing debate remains an oversimplified framework to evaluate landscape management strategies that aim to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation. Still, biodiversity-yield curves, on which the framework has relied, provide valuable qualitative information on biodiversitys sensitivity to agricultural practices, and much research has studied this relationship. But the potential effect of landscape configuration on biodiversitys response to intensification has rarely been considered; besides, studies have often taken yield as an indicator of agricultural management and have generalized conclusions from studying particular taxonomic groups. In this work we adapt a metacommunity model to analyze factors that shape biodiversitys response to agricultural intensification while addressing some of the simplifications of the land-sparing/land-sharing dichotomy. In particular, we study species richness decline in landscapes encompassing a combined gradient in matrix quality and configurational heterogeneity of habitat patches, and considering community dynamics. We found that species richness along an intensification gradient shifts from following a robust response to presenting an abrupt decline, as landscape heterogeneity increases, as stricter survival thresholds are applied to species or as habitat area is reduced. Our work highlights the interdependent effects of heterogeneity, habitat availability and matrix quality on biodiversity and contributes to a nuanced understanding of ecological and landscape factors that enable a robust response of biodiversity in the face of spatiotemporal perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several in vitro oral biofilm growth systems can reliably construct oral microbiome communities in culture, yet their stability and reproducibility through time has not been well characterized. Long-term in vitro growth of natural biofilms would enable use of these biofilms in both in vitro and in vivo studies that require complex microbial communities with minimal variation over a period of time. Understanding biofilm community dynamics in continuous culture, and whether they maintain distinct signatures of health and disease, is necessary to determine the reliability and applicability of such models to broader studies. To this end, we performed next-generation sequencing on biofilms grown from healthy and disease-site subgingival plaque for 80 days to assess stability and reliability of continuous oral biofilm growth.\\n\\nResults: Biofilms were grown from subgingival plaque collected from periodontitis-affected sites and healthy individuals for ten eight-day long generations, using hydroxyapatite disks. The bacterial community in each generation was determined using Human Oral Microbe Identification by Next-Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS) technology, and analyzed in QIIME. Profiles were steady through the ten generations, as determined by species abundance and prevalence, Spearmans correlation coefficient, and Faiths phylogenetic distance, with slight variation predominantly in low abundance species. Community profiles were distinct between healthy and disease site-derived biofilms as demonstrated by weighted UniFrac distance throughout the ten generations. Differentially abundant species between healthy and disease site-derived biofilms were consistent throughout the generations.\\n\\nConclusions: Healthy and disease site-derived biofilms can reliably maintain consistent communities through ten generations of in vitro growth. These communities maintain signatures of health and disease and of individual donors despite culture in identical environments. This subgingival oral biofilm growth and perpetuation model may prove useful to studies involving oral infection or cell stimulation, or those measuring microbial interactions, which require the same biofilms over a period of time.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella spp. is a high-risk bacterial pathogen that is monitored in imported animal-derived feedstuffs. Serratia fonticola is the bacterial species most frequently confused with Salmonella spp. in traditional identification methods based on biochemical characteristics, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and thus unsuitable for daily inspection and quarantine work. In this study, we established a duplex real-time qPCR method with invA-and gyrB-specific primers and probes corresponding to Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola. The method could simultaneously detect both pathogens in imported feedstuffs, with a minimum limit of detection for Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola of 197 copies/L and 145 copies/L, respectively (correlation coefficient R2 = 0.999 in both cases). The amplification efficiency for Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola was 98.346% and 96.49%, respectively. Detection of clinical samples was consistent with method GB/T 13091-2002, and all 20 artificially contaminated imported feed samples were positively identified. Thus, the developed duplex real-time qPCR assay displays high specificity and sensitivity, and can be used for the rapid and accurate detection of genomic DNA from Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola within hours. This represents a significant improvement in the efficiency of detection of both pathogens in imported feedstuffs.\\n\\nImportanceImported feedstuffs must be tested for pathogenic Salmonella species that represent a biological hazard. Various non-Salmonella colony-forming species belong to Enterobacteriaceae, and Serratia fonticola forms colonies of similar color and morphology to Salmonella spp., leading to confusion in daily quarantine tests. Traditional methods based on biochemical and serological characteristics are cumbersome and labor-intensive, and unable to fully support current quarantine testing demands. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a rapid and accurate method for the effective identification of these pathogens. The duplex real-time qPCR method established herein can rapidly identify Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola, and has great potential for application to feed safety and prevention of exterior pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (A.s.s) is a major pathogen affecting fisheries worldwide. It is a well-known member of the pigmented Aeromonas species, which produces melanin at [&le;] 22 {degrees}C. However, melanogenesis decreases as the culture temperature increases and is completely suppressed at 30-35 {degrees}C while bacterial growth is not affected. The mechanism and biological significance of this temperature-dependent melanogenesis are not clear. Heterologous expression of an A.s.s. 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HppD), the most crucial enzyme in the HGA-melanin synthesis pathway, results in thermosensitive pigmentation in Escherichia coli, suggesting that HppD plays a key role in this process. In the current study, we demonstrated that the extreme thermolability of HppD is responsible for the temperature-dependent melanization of A.s.s. Substitutions in three residues, Ser18, Pro103, or Leu119 of HppD from A.s.s increases the thermolability of this enzyme and results in temperature-independent melanogenesis. Moreover, replacing the corresponding residues of HppD from Aeromonas media strain WS, which forms pigment independent of temperature, with those of A.s.s HppD leads to thermosensitive melanogenesis. Structural analysis suggested that mutations at these sites, especially at position P103, can strengthen the secondary structure of HppD and greatly improve its thermal stability. In addition, we found that HppD sequences of all A.s.s isolates are identical and that two of the three residues are completely conserved within A.s.s isolates, which clearly distinguishes these from other Aeromonas strains. We suggest that this property represents an adaptive strategy to the psychrophilic lifestyle of A.s.s.\\n\\nImportanceAeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (A.s.s) is the causative agent of furunculosis, a bacterial septicemia of cold water fish of the Salmonidae family. As it has a well-defined host range, A.s.s has become an ideal model to investigate the co-evolution of host and pathogen. For many pathogens, melanin production is associated with virulence. Although other species of Aeromonas can produce melanin, A.s.s is the only member of this genus that has been reported to exhibit temperature-dependent melanization. Here we demonstrate that thermosensitive melanogenesis in A.s.s strains is due to the thermolability of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HppD). The strictly conserved hppD sequences among A.s.s and the exclusive thermosensitive pigmentation of these strains might provide insight into the role of melanin in the adaptation to a particular host, and offer a novel molecular marker to readily differentiate A.s.s strains from other A. salmonicida subspecies and Aeromonas species.",

    "abstract": "Tomato wilt disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL) is a worldwide destructive disease of tomato. As exploring gene expression and function approaches constitute an initial point for investigating pathogen-host interaction, we performed RNA-seq and sRNA-seq analysis to unravel regulated genes and miRNAs in tomato infected by FOL. Differentially expressed (DE) protein coding gene and miRNA gene profiles upon inoculation with FOL were presented at twenty-four hours post-inoculation including four treatments. Total of more than 182.6 million and 132.2 million high quality clean reads were obtained by RNA-seq and sRNA-seq, respectively. A large overlap was found in DE mRNAs between susceptible cultivar Moneymaker and resistant cultivar Motelle. All Gene Ontology terms were mainly classified into catalytic activity, metabolic process and binding. Combining with qRT-PCR, five disease resistance genes, Solyc01g095630, Solyc03g059080, Solyc00g174340, Solyc11g071750 and Solyc05g050350, were verified to involved in the disease resistance in the resistant cultivar Motelle treated with FOL. Northern blot analysis further confirmed the results from sRNA-Seq and demonstrated that several miRNAs including Sly-miR477-5p, sly-miR167a, novel_mir_675, novel_mir_504 and novel_mir_762 conferred FOL infection. Our data resulted that pathogen resistant genes/miRNAs may play a critical role with the benefit of a coordinated machinery in prompting the response in prompting FOL response in tomato, which offered us with a future direction and surely help in generating models of mediated resistance responses with assessment of genomic gene expression patterns.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biocatalysis in organic solvents such as ionic liquids (ILs) is attractive for making fuels and chemicals from complex substrates including lignocellulosic biomass. However, low IL concentrations of 0.5-1.0 % (v/v) can drastically inhibit microbial activity. In this study, we engineered an exceptionally robust oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, YlCW001, by adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). The mutant YlWC001 shows robust growth in up to 18% (v/v) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]), which makes it the most IL-tolerant microorganism published to our knowledge. Remarkably, YlCW001 exhibits broad tolerance in most commonly used hydrophilic ILs beyond [EMIM][OAc]. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that ILs significantly damage cell wall and/or membrane of wildtype Y. lipolytica with observed cavities, dents, and wrinkles while YlCW001 maintains healthy morphology even in high concentrations of ILs up to 18% (v/v). By performing comprehensive metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics to elucidate this unique phenotype, we discovered that both wildtype Y. lipolytica and YlCW001 reconfigured membrane composition (e.g., glycerophospholipids and sterols) and cell wall structure (e.g., chitin) under IL-stressful environments. By probing the steroid pathway at transcriptomic, enzymatic, and metabolic levels, we validated that sterols (i.e., ergosterol) are a key component of the cell membrane that enables Y. lipolytica to resist IL-responsive membrane damage and hence tolerate high IL concentrations. This study provides a better understanding of exceptional robustness of Y. lipolytica that can be potentially harnessed as a microbial manufacturing platform for production of fuels and chemicals in organic solvents.",

In this study, we investigated under-ice diversity and metabolism of Verrucomicrobia in seasonally ice-covered lakes in temperate and boreal regions of Quebec, Canada using 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Verrucomicrobia, particularly the V1, V3 and V4 subdivisions, were abundant during ice-covered periods. A diversity of Verrucomicrobia genomes were reconstructed from Quebec lake metagenomes. Several genomes were associated with the ice-covered period and were represented in winter metatranscriptomes, supporting the notion that Verrucomicrobia are metabolically active under ice. Verrucomicrobia transcriptome analysis revealed a range of metabolisms potentially occurring under ice, including carbohydrate degradation, glycolate utilization, scavenging of chlorophyll degradation products, and urea use. Genes for aerobic sulfur and hydrogen oxidation were expressed, suggesting chemolithotrophy may be an adaptation to conditions where labile carbon may be limited. The expression of genes for flagella biosynthesis and chemotaxis was detected, suggesting Verrucomicrobia may be actively sensing and responding to winter nutrient pulses, such as phytoplankton blooms. These results increase our understanding on the diversity and metabolic processes occurring under ice in northern lakes ecosystems.",

In this study we investigate if low-cost consumer-grade EEG in combination with machine learning techniques can offer a reliable screening tool to improve diagnosis rates.\\n\\nWe acquired brain signals in people with epilepsy (N=163) and healthy controls (N=138) in two difficult-to-reach areas in rural Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria. Five minutes of fourteen channel resting-state EEG data were acquired with a portable, low-cost consumer-grade EEG recording headset. EEG channel time-series were divided in four-second artifact-free epochs and transformed into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma wavelet frequencies. Summary measures such as the mean, standard deviation, minimal value and maximal value of the epoch signal fluctuations were used to train a random forest classifier. Epilepsy diagnosis based on at least three months seizure calendar data was used as the gold standard diagnosis. To prevent too optimistic classification the trained model was evaluated with EEG data from subjects not used in the training. In addition, we tested a classification model trained on Nigeria data against data from people in Guinea-Bissau and vice versa. The most contributing data features in the EEG were found in the beta and theta frequencies in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria, respectively. Within-country model performance was good with area under the receiver-operating curves of 0.85 and 0.78 ({+/-} 0.02 standard errors) in unseen data in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria, respectively. Across-country performance was moderate (0.62 and 0.64 {+/-} 0.02).\\n\\nOur data suggests that a combination of low cost electroencephalography and machine learning techniques may facilitate diagnostic screening for epilepsy in the most remote areas of the world.",

    "abstract": "Environmental temperature fluctuation has great impact on the formation of bacterial biofilm, while little information is available for assessing the influence of sharp temperature shifts on the fate of pre-formed biofilm. In this study, experimental evidence is firstly explored on the response of Vibrio parahaemolyticus pre-formed biofilm under cold shock (4 {degrees}C and 10 {degrees}C). Surprisingly, biofilm biomass of V. parahaemolyticus significantly increased during the period of cold shock as revealed by crystal violet staining. Polysaccharides and proteins contents in extracellular polymeric substances were gradually enhanced after cold shocks and exhibited high consistency. RT-qPCR demonstrated the expression of flagella and virulence-related genes were up-regulated. Most of QS and T3SS genes were slightly up-regulated, and three T3SS genes (vcrD1, vcrD2{beta} and vopD1) were down-regulated. Furthermore, the biofilm structure of V parahaemolyticus have been analyzed by Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which sharply changed under cold shocks. The correlation analysis further displayed the significant correlation (P < 0.01) among biofilm structure parameters, and weak correlation (P < 0.05) between biofilm related genes and biofilm structure parameters. In conclusion, our results novel discovered that V. parahaemolyticus biofilm related genes were actively expressed and biofilm biomass was continuously increased, biofilm structure was tremendously changed after cold shock. This study underscored the risk that biofilm cells had the ability to adapt to low temperature shift.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are widespread in natural environments, especially on the surface of food and medical biomaterials, which threaten human safety from persistent infections. Previous studies simply focused on biofilm formation of microorganisms under steady state, however, the actual environment frequently fluctuated. V. parahaemolyticus is a widely distributed foodborne pathogen, temperature play a great role in its survival. Researchers generally assume that cold environment can restrain biofilm formation and bacterial activity. This study explored the effects of V. parahaemolyticus biofilm upon a shift from 37 {degrees}C to 4 {degrees}C or 10 {degrees}C from two aspects. On the one hand, the changes of biofilm biomass and EPS contents, the expression of biofilm related genes directly described that pre-formed bacterial biofilm could not be controlled efficiently in cold environment. On the other hand, the CLSM images revealed biofilm morphological structure change, the correlation analysis showed inner relationship among biofilm structure parameters and biofilm related genes. These results suggested that cold shock fail to restrain pre-formed bacterial biofilm, therefore be a potential risk in nature environment.",
