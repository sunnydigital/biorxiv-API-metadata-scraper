    "abstract": "Central Nervous System (CNS) organogenesis is a complex process that obeys precise architectural rules. The impact that nervous system architecture may have on its functionality remains, however, relatively unexplored. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the development of the Drosophila embryonic Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC). VNC morphogenesis requires the tight control of Jun kinase (JNK) signaling, exerted in part via a negative feedback loop mediated by the dual specificity phosphatase Puckered, in a subset of pioneer neurons. Here we show that the JNK pathway autonomously regulates neuronal electrophysiological properties without affecting synaptic vesicle transport. Manipulating, during early embryogenesis, JNK signaling activity in pioneer neurons, directly influences their function as  organizers of VNC architecture and, moreover, uncovers a role in the coordination of the embryonic motor circuitry that is required for hatching. Together, our data reveal critical links, mediated by the control of the JNK signaling cascade by Puckered, between the structural organization of the VNC and its functional optimization.",

    "abstract": "The use of single-cell transcriptomics has become a major approach to delineate cell subpopulations and the transitions between them. While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis (SoptSC), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. SoptSC then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of SoptSC to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions are better when they take uncertainty into account. Uncertainty arises not only from the properties of sensory input but also from cognitive sources, such as different levels of attention. However, it is unknown whether humans appropriately adjust for such cognitive sources of uncertainty during perceptual decision making. Here we show that human categorization and confidence decisions take into account uncertainty related to attention. We manipulated uncertainty in an orientation categorization task from trial to trial using only an attentional cue. The categorization task was designed to disambiguate decision rules that did or did not depend on attention. Using formal model comparison to evaluate decision behavior, we found that category and confidence decision boundaries shifted as a function of attention in an approximately Bayesian fashion. This means that the observers attentional state on each trial contributed probabilistically to the decision computation. This responsiveness of an observers decisions to attention-dependent uncertainty should improve perceptual decisions in natural vision, in which attention is unevenly distributed across a scene.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic Connectivity Networks, patterns of correlated activity emerging from \\\"resting-state\\\" Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent time series, are increasingly being associated to cognitive, clinical, and behavioral aspects, and compared with the pattern of activity elicited by specific tasks. We study the reconfiguration of the brain networks between task and resting-state conditions by a machine learning approach, to highlight the Intrinsic Connectivity Networks (ICNs) which are more affected by the change of network configurations in task vs. rest. We use a large cohort of publicly available data in both resting and task-based fMRI paradigms; by trying a battery of different supervised classifiers relying only on task-based measurements, we show that the highest accuracy is reached with a simple neural network of one hidden layer. In addition, when testing the fitted model on resting state measurements, such architecture yields a performance close to 90% for areas connected to the task performed, which mainly involve the visual and sensorimotor cortex, whilst a relevant decrease of the performance is observed in the other ICNs. On one hand, our results confirm the correspondence of ICNs in both paradigms (task and resting) thus opening a window for future clinical applications to subjects whose participation in a required task cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand it is shown that brain areas not involved in the task display different connectivity patterns in the two paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus infection induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular signalling pathway composed of three branches, triggered by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to high ER load. We have used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate holistically the transcriptional and translational response to cellular infection by murine hepatitis virus (MHV), often used as a model for the Betacoronavirus genus to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 also belongs. We found the UPR to be amongst the most significantly up-regulated pathways in response to MHV infection. To confirm and extend these observations, we show experimentally the induction of all three branches of the UPR in both MHV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Over-expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 or S proteins alone is itself sufficient to induce the UPR. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of the UPR greatly reduced the replication of both MHV and SARS-CoV-2, revealing the importance of this pathway for successful coronavirus replication. This was particularly striking when both IRE1 and ATF6 branches of the UPR were inhibited, reducing SARS-CoV-2 virion release [~]1,000-fold. Together, these data highlight the UPR as a promising antiviral target to combat coronavirus infection.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in over 100 million cases since the end of 2019. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without any special treatment. However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems like chronic respiratory disease are more likely to develop a serious illness. So far, more than 2 million people have died of COVID-19. Unfortunately, there is no specific medication for this viral disease.\n\nIn order to produce viral proteins and to replicate their genetic information, all coronaviruses use a cellular structure known as the endoplasmic reticulum or ER. However, the massive production and modification of viral proteins stresses the ER and this activates a compensatory cellular response that tries to reduce ER protein levels. This is termed the unfolded protein response or UPR. We believe that coronaviruses take advantage of the activation of the UPR to enhance their replication.\n\nThe UPR is also activated in some types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and UPR inhibitor drugs have been developed to tackle these diseases. In this work, we have tested some of these compounds in human lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that virus production was reduced 1000-fold in human lung cells.",

    "abstract": "Background Sunlight has been hypothesized to play a role in variation in cardiovascular disease according to geographic latitude. Objectives To evaluate the plausibility of sunlight as a factor in populations average cholesterol and blood pressure Methods We analyzed World Health Organization data including 180 or more countries age-standardized average cholesterol, age-standardized mean systolic blood pressure (BP), and age-standardized prevalence of raised BP, by geographic latitude, over decades. We also performed analysis by ultraviolet B light (UVB) exposure. Results Mean cholesterol increases with the distance of a country from the Equator. This relationship has changed very little since 1980. Similarly, in 1975, mean systolic BP and prevalence of raised BP were higher in countries farther from the Equator. However, the relationship between latitude and BP has changed dramatically; by 2015, the opposite pattern was observed in women. Countries average UVB exposure has a stable relationship with cholesterol over recent decades, but a changing relationship with BP. Conclusions Since sunlight exposure in a country is relatively fixed and its relationship with BP has changed dramatically in recent decades, countries average sunlight exposure is an unlikely explanation for contemporary country-level variation in BP. However, our findings are consistent with a putative effect of sunlight on countries average cholesterol, as well as a no longer detectable effect on BP decades ago. A parsimonious potential explanation for the relationship between light and cholesterol is that 7-dehydrocholesterol can be converted to cholesterol, or in the presence of ultraviolet light, can instead be converted to vitamin D.",

While DNA, ANA and HNA pools proved inert, naive RNA and AtNA pools displayed diverse modes of intermolecular recombination in eutectic ice phases. Recombination appears linked to the vicinal ring cis-diol shared by RNA and AtNA. Thus, the chemical configuration that renders both susceptible to hydrolysis also enables substantial spontaneous intrapool recombination in the absence of activation chemistry with a concomitant increase in the compositional and structural complexity of recombined pools.",

    "abstract": "Terminal differentiation generates the specialized features and functions that allow postmitotic cells to acquire their distinguishing characteristics. This process is thought to be controlled by transcription factors called \\\"terminal selectors\\\" that directly activate a set of downstream effector genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans the differentiation of both the mechanosensory touch receptor neurons (TRNs) and the multidendritic nociceptor FLP neurons utilize the terminal selectors UNC-86 and MEC-3. The FLP neurons fail to activate TRN genes, however, because a complex of two transcriptional repressors (EGL-44/EGL-46) prevents their expression. Here we show that the ZEB family transcriptional factor ZAG-1 promotes TRN differentiation not by activating TRN genes but by preventing the expression of EGL-44/EGL-46. Since EGL-44/EGL-46 also inhibits the production of ZAG-1, these proteins form a bistable, negative feedback loop that regulates the choice between the two neuronal fates.\\n\\nSummary statementTranscriptional repressors regulate binary fate choices through reciprocal inhibition during terminal neuronal differentiation.

Conditional deletion of PKM{zeta} within the nucleus accumbens recapitulated the increase in cocaine taking and seeking seen in the constitutive knockout mice, but only in male animals. Site-specific knockdown of PKM{zeta} in the nucleus accumbens had no effect on cocaine or natural reward behaviors in female mice. Taken together these results indicate that PKM{zeta} may act to dampen addictive phenotypes. Furthermore, these results indicate that PKM{zeta} is playing divergent roles in reward seeking in males and females.",

    "abstract": "Although microbial communities are associated with many aspects of human, environmental, plant, and animal health, there exists no cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and genes present in such communities. While deep whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing provides the highest-level of taxonomic and functional resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale studies. The prevailing alternative, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S), often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic and functional microbiome analysis. To address this technology gap, we evaluated the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S sequencing for large human microbiome studies. We describe a library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S. We analyzed multiple real and simulated biological data sets, including two novel human stool samples with ultra-deep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow shotgun recovers accurate species-level taxonomic and functional profiles of the human microbiome. We recognize and discuss some of the inherent limitations of shallow shotgun sequencing, and note that 16S sequencing remains a valuable and important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments. Although deep WGS remains the gold standard for high-resolution microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers consider shallow shotgun sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S for large-scale human microbiome research studies.",

Here, we use Micro-C XL to map chromatin contacts at single-nucleosome resolution genome-wide to elucidate mechanisms and functions of condensed chromatin in quiescent S. cerevisiae cells. We describe previously uncharacterized chromatin domains on the order of 10-60 kilobases that in quiescent cells are formed by condensin-mediated chromatin loops. Conditional depletion of condensin prevents chromatin condensation during quiescence entry and leads to widespread transcriptional de-repression. We further demonstrate that condensin-dependent chromatin compaction is conserved in quiescent human fibroblasts.

Here we show that different mechanisms regulate the length and diameter of the murine trachea. First, we found that trachea development progresses via elongation and expansion processes. In the first stage, synchronized radial polarization of smooth muscle (SM) progenitor cells with inward Golgi-apparatus displacement regulates tube elongation, controlled by mesenchymal Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling. This radial polarization directs SM progenitor cell migration toward the epithelium, and the resulting subepithelial morphogenesis supports tube elongation to the anteroposterior axis. This radial polarization also regulates esophageal elongation. Subsequently, cartilage development helps expand the tube diameter, which drives epithelial cell reshaping to determine the optimal lumen shape for efficient respiration. These findings suggest a strategy in which straight-organ tubulogenesis is driven by subepithelial cell polarization and ring cartilage development.",
