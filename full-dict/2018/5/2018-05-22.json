    "abstract": "Most neurons in the brain transmit information digitally using sequences of spikes that trigger release of synaptic vesicles of fixed size. The first stages of vision and hearing are distinct in operating with analogue signals, but it is unclear how these are recoded for synaptic transmission. By imaging the release of glutamate in live zebrafish, we demonstrate how ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells transmit analogue visual signals by changes in both the rate and amplitude of synaptic events. Higher contrasts released glutamate packets composed of more vesicles and coding by amplitude often continued after rate coding had saturated. Glutamate packets equivalent to five vesicles transmitted four times as many bits of information per vesicle compared to independent release events. By discretizing analogue signals into sequences of numbers ranging up to eleven, ribbon synapses increase the dynamic range, temporal precision and efficiency with which visual information is transmitted.",

    "abstract": "The brain demands constant supply of glucose-derived energy for cell metabolism and survival, and brain hypoglycemia may compromise synaptic functions. The brainstem nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) is an integrative center for autonomic counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia, and recent evidences have demonstrated that NTS neurons can also sense fluctuations in glucose levels in the extracellular milieu. Glucose-sensing neurons rely on glucose metabolism to respond to changes in glucose availability, but the ionic mechanisms underlying the low-glucose sensitivity are not well elucidated in NTS neurons. Therefore, this work aimed to investigate the effect of low extracellular glucose (0.5 mM) on the electrophysiological properties of NTS neurons of rats, by whole-cell patch-clamp. We showed that in NTS neurons maintained in 5 mM extracellular glucose, low glucose induces a depolarization in most neurons, which was correlated with membrane potential, decreased with depolarization. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels contribute to the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) of NTS neurons, and blockage of KATP channels produced depolarization of the membrane and occludes the effect of low glucose, thus acting as modulators of low-glucose sensing in NTS neurons. However, this effect is caused by depolarization, since membrane hyperpolarization after KATP blockage restores the effect of low glucose. Additionally, we demonstrated that the incubation of NTS neurons in high glucose (10 mM) prior to recordings leads to more depolarized RMP in these neurons, what contributes to increase the number of neurons unresponsive to a low-glucose challenge, possibly via depolarization by inhibition of KATP channels following increased amounts of high glucose-derived intracellular ATP. We conclude that NTS neurons depolarize the membrane in response to the application of a low-glucose solution, but this effect is occluded by membrane depolarization triggered by KATP blockage. This suggests a homeostatic regulation of the membrane potential by glucose.",

    "abstract": "Biosurveillance \\\"systematically collects and analyzes data for the purpose of detecting cases of disease, [and] outbreaks of disease.\\\" (Wagner, Moore and Aryel, 2006) This typically involves using a set of known sources of epidemiological data, instead of opportunistically using the data sources which become available over time. This work attempts to partially remedy that limitation by using an easily adapted generative Bayesian econometric model to allow incorporation of novel data sources. This is done by building a generative model of the information sources, then using Bayesian Markov-chain Monte-Carlo to find the relationships between data and actual caseloads to use in an epidemiological model 1. While the application presented is limited to three data sources for a single disease (influenza), the methodology is potentially widely applicable, and enables rapid incorporation of a variety of sources and source types.",
