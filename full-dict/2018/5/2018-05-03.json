Here, we introduce the computational framework PINES (Phenotype-Informed Noncoding Element Scoring) which predicts the functional impact of noncoding variants by integrating epigenetic annotations in a phenotype-dependent manner. A unique feature of PINES is that analyses may be customized towards genomic annotations from cell types of the highest relevance given the phenotype of interest.

Therefore, microbiota data have a hierarchical structure where samples are nested under one or several variables representing host-specific factors, often spanning multiple levels of biological organization. Current statistical methods do not accommodate this hierarchical data structure, and therefore cannot explicitly account for the effect of the host in structuring the microbiota. We introduce a novel extension of joint species distribution models which can straightforwardly accommodate and discern between effects such as host phylogeny and traits, recorded covariates like diet and collection site, among other ecological processes. Our proposed methodology includes powerful yet familiar outputs seen in community ecology overall, including: (i) model-based ordination to visualize and quantify the main patterns in the data; (ii) variance partitioning to asses how influential the included host-specific factors are in structuring the microbiota; and (iii) co-occurrence networks to visualize microbe-to-microbe associations.",

    "abstract": "Modern phylodynamic methods interpret an inferred phylogenetic tree as a partial transmission chain providing information about the dynamic process of transmission and removal (where removal may be due to recovery, death or behaviour change). Birth-death and coalescent processes have been introduced to model the stochastic dynamics of epidemic spread under common epidemiological models such as the SIS and SIR models, and are successfully used to infer phylogenetic trees together with transmission (birth) and removal (death) rates. These methods either integrate analytically over past incidence and prevalence to infer rate parameters, and thus cannot explicitly infer past incidence or prevalence, or allow such inference only in the coalescent limit of large population size. Here we introduce a particle filtering framework to explicitly infer prevalence and incidence trajectories along with phylogenies and epidemiological model parameters from genomic sequences and case count data in a manner consistent with the underlying birth-death model. After demonstrating the accuracy of this method on simulated data, we use it to assess the prevalence through time of the early 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.",

In this paper, we develop expressions for the distribution and expectation of the number of p-th cousins in a sample from a population of size N under two diploid Wright-Fisher models. We also develop simple asymptotic expressions for large values of N. For example, the expected proportion of individuals with at least one p-th cousin in a sample of K individuals, for a diploid dioecious Wright-Fisher model, is approximately 1 - e-(22p-1)K/N. Our results show that a substantial fraction of individuals in the sample will have at least a second cousin if the sampling fraction (K/N) is on the order of 10-2. This confirms that, for large cohort samples, relatedness among individuals cannot easily be ignored.",

    "abstract": "Studies of resting state functional MRI (rs-fRMI) are increasingly focused on \\\"dynamics\\\", or on those properties of brain activation that manifest and vary on timescales shorter than the scans full duration. This shift in focus has led to a flurry of interest in developing hypothesis testing frameworks and null models applicable to the dynamical setting. Thus far however, these efforts have been weakened by a number of crucial shortcomings that are outlined and discussed in this short paper. We focus here on aspects of recently proposed null models that, we argue, are poorly formulated relative to the hypotheses they are designed to test, i.e. their potential role in separating functionally relevant BOLD signal dynamics from noise or intermittent background and maintenance type processes is limited by factors that are fundamental rather than merely quantitative or parametric. In this short position paper, we emphasize that (1) serious care must be exercised in building null models for rs-fMRI dynamics from distributionally stationary univariate or multivariate timeseries, i.e. timeseries whose values are each independently drawn from one pre-specified probability distribution; and (2) measures such as kurtosis that quantify over-concentration of observed values in the far tails of some reference distribution may not be particularly suitable for capturing signal features most plausibly contributing to functionally relevant brain dynamics. Other metrics targeted, for example, at capturing the epochal temporal variation that contributes heavily to dynamic functional connectivity estimates and is and often taken as a signature of brain responsiveness to stimuli or experimental tasks, could play a more scientifically clarifying role. As we learn more about the phenomenon of functionally relevant brain dynamics and its imaging correlates, scientifically meaningful null hypotheses and well-tuned null models will naturally emerge. We also revisit the important concept of distributional stationarity, discuss how it manifests within realizations versus across multiple realizations, and provide guidance on the benefits and limitations of employing this type of stationarity in modeling the absence or functionally relevant temporal dynamics in resting state fMRI. We hope that the discussions herein are useful, and promote thoughtful consideration of these important issues.",

But it is unclear how such learning is related to the prefrontal cor-texs role in short-term memory. Here we asked if the encoding of short-term memory in prefrontal cortex was used by rats learning decision rules in a Y-maze task. We found that a similar pattern of neural ensemble activity was selectively recalled after reinforcement for a correct decision. This reinforcement-selective recall only reliably occurred immediately before the abrupt behavioural transitions indicating successful learning of the current rule, and faded quickly thereafter. We could simultaneously decode multiple, retrospective task events from the ensemble activity, suggesting the recalled ensemble activity had multiplexed encoding of prior events. Our results suggest that successful trial-and-error learning is dependent on reinforcement tagging the relevant features of the environment to maintain in prefrontal cortex short-term memory.",

    "abstract": "A spate of recent work demonstrates that humans seek to avoid the expenditure of cognitive effort, much like physical effort or economic resources. Less is clear, however, about the circumstances dictating how and when people decide to expend cognitive effort. Here we adopt a popular theory of opportunity costs and response vigor and to elucidate this question. This account, grounded in Reinforcement Learning, formalizes a trade-off between two costs: the harder work assumed necessary to emit faster actions and the opportunity cost inherent in acting more slowly (i.e., the delay that results to the next reward and subsequent rewards). Recent work reveals that the opportunity cost of time--operationalized as the average reward rate per unit time, theorized to be signaled by tonic dopamine levels, modulates the speed with which a person responds in a simple discrimination tasks. We extend this framework to cognitive effort in a diverse range of cognitive tasks, for which 1) the amount of cognitive effort demanded from the task varies from trial to trial and 2) the putative expenditure of cognitive effort holds measureable consequences in terms of accuracy and response time. In the domains of cognitive control, perceptual decision-making, and task-switching, we found that subjects tuned their level of effort exertion in accordance with the experienced average reward rate: when the opportunity cost of time was high, subjects made more errors and responded more quickly, which we interpret as a withdrawal of cognitive effort. That is, expenditure of cognitive effort appeared to be modulated by the opportunity cost of time. Further, and consistent with our account, the strength of this modulation was predicted by individual differences in efficacy of cognitive control. Taken together, our results elucidate the circumstances dictating how and when people expend cognitive effort.",

    "abstract": "The Full Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) is challenging to fit to behavioural data. Precision of the fits are usually poor for some if not all parameters, and computationally expensive to obtain. Moreover, inference at the trial level for each and every parameters, threshold included, has so far been considered as impossible. Most approaches rely on strong assumptions about the model structure, such as selection of the parameters that are subject to trial-to-trial variability or prior distribution of these parameters, that usually lack precise mathematical or empirical justifications. The fact that, in most versions of the DDM, the sequence of participants choices are considered as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), has been mainly overlooked so far. Our contribution to the field is threefold: first, we introduce Variational Bayes as a method to fit the full DDM. Second, we relax the i.i.d. assumption, and propose a data-driven algorithm based on a Recurrent Auto-Encoder, that estimates the local posterior probability of the DDM parameters at each trial based on the sequence of parameters and data preceding the data. Finally, we show that inference at the trial level can be achieved efficiently for each and every parameter of the DDM, threshold included. This data-driven approach is highly generic and self-contained, in the sense that no external input (e.g. regressors or physiological measure) is necessary to fit the data. Using simulations and real-world examples, we show that this method outperforms by several order of magnitude the i.i.d.-based ones, either Markov Chain Monte Carlo or i.i.d.-VB.",

    "abstract": "Accurate species delimitation is essential to properly assess biodiversity, but also for management and conservation purposes. Yet, it is not always trivial to accurately define species boundaries in closely related species due to incomplete lineage sorting. Additional difficulties may be caused by hybridization, now evidenced as a frequent phenomenon. The brittle star cryptic species complex Ophioderma longicauda encompasses six mitochondrial lineages, including broadcast spawners and internal brooders, yet the actual species boundaries are unknown. Here, we combined three methods to delimit species in the Ophioderma longicauda complex and to infer its divergence history: i) unsupervised species discovery based on multilocus genotypes; ii) divergence time estimation using the multi-species coalescent; iii) divergence scenario testing (including gene flow) using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods. 30 sequence markers (transcriptome-based, mitochondrial or non-coding) for 89 O. longicauda and outgroup individuals were used. First, multivariate analyses revealed six genetic clusters, which globally corresponded to the mitochondrial lineages, yet with many exceptions, suggesting ancient hybridization events and challenging traditional mitochondrial barcoding approaches. Second, multi-species coalescent-based analyses confirmed the occurrence of six species and provided divergence time estimates, but the sole use of this method failed to accurately delimit species, highlighting the power of multilocus genotype clustering to delimit recently diverged species. Finally, Approximate Bayesian Computation showed that the most likely scenario involves hybridization between brooders and broadcasters. Our study shows that despite strong incomplete lineage sorting and past hybridization, accurate species delimitation in Ophioderma was possible using a combination of complementary methods. We propose that these methods, especially multilocus genotype clustering, may be useful to resolve other complex speciation histories.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMultivariate analysis was used for species delimitation\\nC_LIO_LISix Ophioderma species were delimited using nuclear and mitochondrial data\\nC_LIO_LIOphioderma speciation history is complex and included hybridization\\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial and nuclear histories differed, challenging barcoding approaches\\nC_LIO_LIWe propose that using multilocus genotypes can resolve complex speciation histories\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/240218_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (39K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13071d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180ebd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbfe96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74c35_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Because species traits often reflect shared evolutionary history, many researchers have advocated for a \\\"phylogenetic gambit\\\": maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD) should indirectly capture FD. For the first time, we empirically test this gambit using data from >15,000 vertebrate species and ecologically-relevant traits. Maximizing PD results in an average gain of 18% of FD relative to random choice. However, this average gain hides the fact that in over 1/3 of the comparisons, maximum PD sets contain less FD than randomly chosen sets of species.

    "abstract": "The topology of a reaction network can have a significant influence on the networks dynamical properties. Such influences can include constraints on network flows and concentration changes or more insidiously result in the emergence of feedback loops. These effects are due entirely to mass constraints imposed by the network configuration and are important considerations before any dynamical analysis is made. Most established simulation software tools usually carry out some kind of structural analysis of a network before any attempt is made at dynamic simulation. In this paper we describe a portable software library, libStructural, that can carry out a variety of popular structural analyses that includes conservation analysis, flux dependency analysis and enumerating elementary modes. The library employs robust algorithms that allow it to be used on large networks with more than a two thousand nodes. The library accepts either a raw or fully labeled stoichiometry matrix or models written in SBML format. The software is written in standard C/C++ and comes with documentation and a test suite. The software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and can be compiled easily on any Linux operating system. A language binding for Python is also available through the pip package manager making it trivial to install on any standard Python distribution. As a second example, we also create a new libStructural plugin for PathwayDesigner that allows solutions to be viewed graphically.

We find a surprisingly simple and intuitive analytical approximation for the establishment probabilities in a symmetric two-deme model under the assumption of weak (positive) selection. This is the first analytical closed-form approximation for arbitrary migration rate to appear in the literature. We find that the establishment probability lies between the weak and the strong migration limits if we condition the origin of the mutation to the deme where it is advantageous. This is not the case when we condition the mutation to first occur in a deme where it is disadvantageous. In this case we find that an intermediate migration rate maximizes the probability of establishment. We extend our results to the cases of multiple demes, two demes with asymmetric rates of gene flow, and asymmetric carrying capacities. The latter case allows us to illustrate how density regulation can affect establishment probabilities. Finally we use our results to investigate the role of gene flow on the rate of local adaptation and identify cases in which intermediate amounts of gene flow facilitate the rate of local adaptation as compared to two populations without gene flow.",

Our findings suggest there are little understood incentives against disclosure in the peer-reviewed literature on scientific instruments; constituting an underappreciated threat to scientific standards of trustworthiness and transparency. We believe that a public debate and subsequent editorial policy action are urgently required.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans displays complex regulation of natural genetic competence. Competence development in S. mutans is controlled by a peptide derived from ComS (XIP); which along with the cytosolic regulator ComR controls the expression of the alternative sigma factor comX, the master regulator of competence development. Recently, a gene embedded within the coding region of comX was discovered and designated xrpA (comX regulatory peptide A). XrpA was found to be an antagonist of ComX, but the mechanism was not established. In this study, we reveal through both genomic and proteomic techniques that XrpA is the first describe negative regulator of ComRS systems in streptococci. Transcriptomic and promoter activity assays in the {Delta}xrpA strain revealed an up-regulation of genes controlled by both the ComR- and ComX-regulons. An in vivo protein crosslinking and in vitro fluorescent polarization assays confirmed that the N-terminal region of XrpA were found to be sufficient in inhibiting ComR-XIP complex binding to ECom-box located within the comX promoter. This inhibitory activity was sufficient for decreases in PcomX activity, transformability and ComX accumulation. XrpA serving as a modulator of ComRS activity ultimately results in changes to subpopulation behaviors and cell fate during competence activation.\\n\\nABBREVIATED SUMMARYStreptococcus mutans displays complex regulation of natural genetic competence, highlighted by a novel gene, xrpA, embedded within the coding region for the master regulator ComX. We show that XrpA modulates ComRS-dependent activation of comX expression, resulting in changes to sub-population behaviors, including cell lysis. XrpA is the first described inhibitor of a ComRS system and, because it is unique to S. mutans it may be targetable to prevent diseases caused by this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Our confidence in a choice and the evidence pertaining to a choice appear to be inseparable. An emerging computational consensus is, however, that the brain should maintain separate estimates of these quantities for adaptive behavioural control. Here we devised a psychophysical task to decouple confidence in a perceptual decision from both the reliability of sensory evidence and the relation of such evidence with respect to a choice boundary. Using human fMRI, we found that an area in medial prefrontal cortex (perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, pgACC) tracked expected performance, an aggregate signature of decision confidence, whereas neural areas previously proposed to encode decision confidence instead tracked sensory reliability (posterior parietal cortex and ventral striatum) or boundary distance (pre-supplementary motor area). Supporting that information encoded by pgACC is central to a subjective sense of decision confidence, we show that pgACC activity does not simply co-vary with expected performance but is also linked to within-subject and between-subject variation in explicit confidence estimates. Our study is consistent with the proposal that the brain maintains choice-dependent and choice-independent estimates of certainty, and sheds light on why dysfunctional confidence often emerges following prefrontal lesions and/or degeneration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent computational models propose that our sense of confidence in a choice reflects an estimate of the probability that the choice is correct. However, it has proven difficult to experimentally separate decision confidence from its component parts, such as our certainty about perceptual evidence or choice requirements. Here we devised a task to dissociate these quantities and isolate a distinct encoding of decision confidence in the medial prefrontal cortex of the human brain. We show that activity in this area not only tracks expected performance on a task but is also related to both within-subject and between-subject variation in a subjective sense of confidence. Our study illuminates why dysfunctional confidence often emerges following damage to prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting polygenic overlap between ADHD and both literacy- and language-related impairments is challenging as genetic confounding can bias associations. Here, we investigate evidence for links between polygenic ADHD risk and multiple literacy- and language-related abilities (LRAs), assessed in UK children (N[&le;]5,919), conditional on genetic effects shared with educational attainment (EA). Genome-wide summary statistics on clinical ADHD and years-of-schooling were obtained from large consortia (N[&le;]326,041). ADHD-polygenic scores (ADHD-PGS) were inversely associated with LRAs in ALSPAC, most consistently with reading-related abilities, and explained [&le;]1.6% phenotypic variation. Polygenic links were then dissected into both genetic effects shared with and independent of EA using multivariable regressions (MVR), analogous to Mendelian Randomization approaches accounting for mediating effects. Conditional on EA, polygenic ADHD risk remained associated with multiple literacy-related skills, phonemic awareness and verbal intelligence, but not language-related skills such as listening comprehension and non-word repetition. Pooled reading performance showed the strongest overlap with ADHD independent of EA. Using conservative ADHD-instruments (P-threshold<5x10-8) this corresponded to a 0.35 decrease in Z-scores per log-odds in ADHD-liability (P=9.2x10-5). Using subthreshold ADHD-instruments (P-threshold<0.0015), these associations had lower magnitude, but higher predictive accuracy, with a 0.03 decrease in Z-scores (P=1.4x10-6). Polygenic ADHD-effects shared with EA were of equal strength and at least equal magnitude compared to those independent of EA, for all LRAs studied, and only detectable using subthreshold instruments. Thus, ADHD-related polygenic links are highly susceptible to genetic confounding, concealing an ADHD-specific association profile that primarily involves reading-related impairments, but few language-related problems.",

    "abstract": "Perceived object color and material properties help us to select and interact with objects. Because there is no simple mapping between the pattern of an objects image on the retina and its physical reflectance, our perception of color and material are made more useful through sophisticated visual computations. A long-standing goal in vision science is to describe how these computations work, particularly as they act to stabilize perceived color and material against variation in scene factors extrinsic to object surface properties, such as the illumination. If we take seriously the notion that perceived color and material are useful because they help guide behavior in natural tasks, then we need experimental that measure and models that describe how they are used in such tasks. To this end, we have developed selection-based methods and accompanying perceptual models for studying perceived object color and material. This focused review highlights key aspects of our work. It includes a discussion of future directions and challenges, as well as an outline of a computational observer model that incorporates early, known, stages of visual processing and that clarifies how early vision shapes selection performance.",

However, empirical studies suggest that some synonymous mutations can have phenotypic consequences. Here we show that in contrast to the current dogma, natural selection on gene-specific codon usage bias is common across Eukaryota. Furthermore, by using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we demonstrate that specific combinations of rare codons contribute to the spatial and sex-related regulation of some protein-coding genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Together, these data indicate that natural selection can shape gene-specific codon usage bias, which therefore, represents an overlooked genomic feature that is likely to play an important role in the spatial and temporal regulation of gene functions. Hence, the broadly accepted dogma that synonymous mutations are in general functionally neutral should be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Automated classification methods for disease diagnosis are currently in the limelight, especially for imaging data. Classification does not fully meet a clinicians needs, however: in order to combine the results of multiple tests and decide on a course of treatment, a clinician needs the likelihood of a given health condition rather than binary classification yielded by such methods. We illustrate how likelihoods can be derived step by step from first principles and approximations, and how they can be assessed and selected, using fMRI data from a publicly available data set containing schizophrenic and healthy control subjects, as a working example. We start from the basic assumption of partial exchangeability, and then the notion of sufficient statistics and the \\\"method of translation\\\" (Edgeworth, 1898) combined with conjugate priors. This method can be used to construct a likelihood that can be used to compare different data-reduction algorithms. Despite the simplifications and possibly unrealistic assumptions used to illustrate the method, we obtain classification results comparable to previous, more realistic studies about schizophrenia, whilst yielding likelihoods that can naturally be combined with the results of other diagnostic tests.",

Metabolomics is a powerful tool that can be used to screen for potential biomarkers, exogenous toxicants, and metabolic network changes associated with disease states. Here, we used high-resolution metabolomics to compare over 10,000 plasma metabolic features from older adults with and without PD in an untargeted approach. We performed a network analysis that demonstrates that the presence of the PD drug levodopa influences variation observed between PD and control patients. Metabolome wide association studies and discrimination analysis identified significant differentiation in the metabolomics profile of older adults with and without PD. Notably, 15 metabolic features (ten of which we putatively identified) differed between PD and control adults with p < 0.05 and a corrected false discovery rate less than 20%. Furthermore, 13 metabolic networks were identified to be functionally different between PD and non-PD patients. Lastly, the dopaminergic toxic intermediate DOPAL differed between PD and non-PD populations, which supports the dopaminergic sequestration model of PD. These individual metabolites and metabolic networks have been implicated in past PD pathogenesis models, including the beta-carboline harmalol and the glycosphingolipid metabolism pathway including the ganglioside GM2. We recommend that future studies take into account the confounding effects of levodopa in metabolomic analyses of disease versus control patients, and encourage validation of several promising metabolic markers of PD.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria anchor to their host cells through their adhesive pili, which must resist the large mechanical stresses induced by the host as it attempts to dislodge the pathogens. The pili of Gram-positive bacteria are constructed as a single polypeptide made of hundreds of pilin repeats, which contain intramolecular isopeptide bonds strategically located in the structure to prevent their unfolding under force, protecting the pilus from degradation by extant proteases and oxygen radicals. Here, we demonstrate the design of a short peptide that blocks the formation of the isopeptide bond present in the pilin Spy0128 from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, resulting in mechanically labile pilin domains. We use a combination of protein engineering and AFM force spectroscopy to demonstrate that the peptide blocks the formation of the native isopeptide bond and compromises the mechanics of the domain. While an intact Spy0128 is inextensible at any force, peptide-modified Spy0128 pilins readily unfold at very low forces, marking the abrogation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond as well as the absence of a stable pilin fold. We propose that isopeptide-blocking peptides could be further developed as a novel type of highly-specific anti-adhesive antibiotics to treat Gram-positive pathogens.\\n\\nSignificanceAt the onset of an infection, Gram-positive bacteria adhere to host cells through their pili, filamentous structures built by hundreds of repeats of pilin proteins. These proteins can withstand large mechanical challenges without unfolding, remaining anchored to the host and resisting cleavage by proteases and oxygen radicals present in the targeted tissues. The key structural component that gives pilins mechanical resilience are internal isopeptide bonds, strategically placed so that pilins become inextensible structures. We target this bond by designing a blocking peptide that interferes with its formation during folding. We demonstrate that peptide-modified pilins lack mechanical stability and extend at low forces. We propose this strategy as a rational design of mechanical antibiotics, targeting the Achilles Heel of bacterial adhesion.",

Their signature in the hippocampal extracellular field potential (EFP) can be decomposed into a {approx} 100 ms long sharp wave superimposed by {approx} 200 Hz ripple oscillations. How ripple oscillations are generated is currently not well understood. A promising model for the genesis of ripple oscillations is based on recurrent interneuronal networks (INT-INT). According to this hypothesis, the INT-INT network in CA1 receives a burst of excitation from CA3 that generates the sharp wave, and recurrent inhibition leads to an ultrafast synchronization of the CA1 network causing the ripple oscillations; fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV+BCs) may constitute the ripple-generating interneuronal network. PV+BCs are also coupled by gap junctions (GJs) but the function of GJs for ripple oscillations has not been quantified. Using simulations of CA1 hippocampal networks of PV+BCs, we show that GJs promote synchrony and increase the neuronal firing rate of the interneuronal ensemble, while the ripple frequency is only affected mildly. The promoting effect of GJs on ripple oscillations depends on fast GJ transmission ([lsim] 0.5 ms), which requires proximal gap junction coupling ([lsim] 100 m from soma).",

In an attempt to solve this issue, we applied our recently developed algorithm, eTumorMetastasis, which constructs predictive models, on exome sequencing data to ER+ breast (n=755) cancer patients. Gene signatures derived from the genes containing functionally germline genetic variants significantly distinguished recurred and non-recurred patients in two ER+ breast cancer independent cohorts (n=200 and 295, P=1.4x10-3). Furthermore, we found that recurred patients possessed a higher rate of germline genetic variants. In addition, the inherited germline variants from these gene signatures were predominately enriched in T cell function, antigen presentation and cytokine interactions, likely impairing the adaptive and innate immune response thus favoring a pro-tumorigenic environment. Hence, germline genomic information could be used for developing non-invasive genomic tests for predicting patients outcomes (or drug response) in breast cancer, other cancer types and even other complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for the understanding of nuclear architecture and its relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer. However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes, presents challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wide analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We used robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we computed geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compared over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieved accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.",

    "abstract": "Migration and contraction of activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) are essential factors for cirrhosis formation and development. It has been demonstrated that blebbistatin, a nonmuscle myosin II (NMMII) inhibitor, can inhibit the migration and contraction of HSC, whereas the main cell signaling pathway is still unknown. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway may be involved in many cells migration and contraction, whether NMMII and mTOR have any crosslinks draw our attention. In the currently study, we used LV-RNAi to specifically attenuate mTOR and NMMII in rat HSC. We aimed to examine the effect of mTOR LV-RNAi on the migration and contraction of HSC and explore the crosslink between mTOR cell signal and NMMII. Using real-time PCR and western blot, we found that mTOR and the downstream factors including S6K and 4EBP1 all up-regulated with the activation of HSC, mTOR and NMMII LV-RNAi was transfected into activated HSC using lipofectamine 2000. The levels of mRNA and proteins were also examined using real-time PCR and western blot respectively. The expression of mTOR can be down-regulated by NMMII LV-RNAi significantly, as well as the expression of S6K, 4EBP1, -SMA and collagen I, but the level of AKT was up-regulated. Then we used Transwell system and collagen lattices to examine the NMMII and mTOR LV-RNAi efficiency on HSC migration and contraction, as we hypothesized, both of the LV-RNAi could inhibit HSC migration and contraction significantly. These results indicated that nonmuscle myosin II shRNA inhibit migration and contraction in rat hepatic stellate cells through the regulation of mTOR/S6K/4EBP1 signaling pathway",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of chronic, biofilm-based lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Sputum from patients with CF has been shown to contain oxic and hypoxic subzones as well as millimolar concentrations of lactate. Here, we describe the physiological roles and expression patterns of P. aeruginosa lactate dehydrogenases in the contexts of different growth regimes. P. aeruginosa produces four enzymes annotated as lactate dehydrogenases, three of which are known to contribute to anaerobic or aerobic metabolism in liquid cultures. These three are LdhA, which reduces pyruvate to D-lactate during anaerobic survival, and LldE and LldD, which oxidize D-lactate and L-lactate, respectively, during aerobic growth. We demonstrate that the fourth enzyme, LldA, performs redundant L-lactate oxidation during growth in aerobic cultures in both a defined MOPS-based medium and synthetic CF sputum medium. However, LldA differs from LldD in that its expression is induced specifically by the L-enantiomer of lactate. We also show that all four enzymes perform functions in colony biofilms that are similar to their functions in liquid cultures. Finally, we provide evidence that the enzymes LdhA and LldE have the potential to support metabolic cross-feeding in biofilms, where LdhA can catalyze the production of D-lactate in the anaerobic zone that is then used as a substrate in the aerobic zone. Together, these observations further our understanding of the metabolic pathways that can contribute to P. aeruginosa growth and survival during CF lung infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCELactate is thought to serve as a carbon and energy source during chronic infections. Sites of bacterial colonization can contain two enantiomers of lactate: the L-form, generally produced by the host, and the D-form, which is usually produced by bacteria including the pulmonary pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we characterize P. aeruginosas set of four enzymes that it can use to interconvert pyruvate and lactate, the functions of which depend on the availability of oxygen and specific enantiomers of lactate. We also show that anaerobic pyruvate fermentation triggers production of the aerobic D-lactate dehydrogenase in both liquid cultures and biofilms, thereby enabling metabolic cross-feeding of lactate over time and space between subpopulations of cells. These metabolic pathways could contribute to P. aeruginosa growth and survival in the lung.",

    "abstract": "An integral aspect of human cognition is the ability to inhibit habitual responses in order to initiate complex, rule-guided actions. Moreover, humans have also the ability to alternate between different sets of rules or tasks, at the cost of degraded performance when compared to repeating the same task, a phenomenon called the  task switch cost. While it is recognized that switching between tasks requires often to inhibit habitual responses, the interaction between these two forms of cognitive control has been much less studied than each of them separately. Here, we use a computational model to draw a bridge between inhibitory control and voluntary action generation and thereby provide a novel account of seemingly paradoxical findings in the task switch literature. We investigated task switching in the mixed antisaccade task, in which participants are cued to saccade either in the same or in the opposite direction to a peripheral stimulus. Our model demonstrates that stopping a habitual action leads to increased inhibitory control that persists on the next trial. However, enhanced inhibition affects only the probability of generating habitual responses, and, contrary to previous accounts, cannot be characterized as proactive task interference. In addition, our model demonstrates that voluntary actions (but not habitual responses) are slower and more prompt to errors on switch trials compared to repeat trials. We conclude that precisely the interaction between these two effects explains a variety of contradictory findings reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "One Sentence SummarySubstrate binding to Tribbles-homolog 1 (TRIB1) pseudokinase induces allosteric changes that allow formation of a complex with the COP1 ubiquitin ligase.\\n\\nAbstractThe Tribbles family of pseudokinases recruit substrates to the COP1 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitination. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family transcription factors are crucial Tribbles substrates in adipocyte and myeloid development. Here we show that the TRIB1 pseudokinase can recruit various C/EBP family members, with binding of C/EBP{beta} attenuated by phosphorylation. To explain the mechanism of substrate recruitment, we solved the crystal structure of TRIB1 in complex with C/EBP. TRIB1 undergoes a significant conformational change relative to its substrate-free structure, to bind C/EBP in a pseudo-substrate-like manner. Crucially, substrate binding triggers allosteric changes that link substrate recruitment to COP1 binding, which is consistent with molecular dynamics and biochemical studies. These findings offer a view of pseudokinase regulation with striking parallels to bona fide kinase regulation-- via the activation loop and C-helix--and raise the possibility of small molecules targeting either the activation loop-in, or loop-out, conformations of Tribbles pseudokinases.",

Its lowest biomass was recorded in the surf zone and wave breaking, whereas the highest biomass was registered in the area of weakened effect of waves on the bottom. The cover percent of the bottom with filamentous algae in different areas of the coastal zone varied from 0 to 100%. Hydraulic characteristics of Spirogyra were the same as those of planktonic diatoms.

Although the development and homing of IELs have been studied in some details, the factors controlling their homeostasis are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that FADD, a classic adaptor protein required for death-receptor-induced apoptosis, is a critical regulator of the intestinal IEL development. The mice with a dominant negative mutant of FADD (FADD-DN) display a defective localized intestinal IELs with a marked defect on CD8+TCR{gamma}{delta}+ T cells.

IL-7 plays a differentiation inducing role in the development of intestinal IELs and its receptor IL-7R is a transcriptional target of Notch1. The level of Notch1 expression also showed very low in Lin- LPLs cells from FADD-DN mice compared with normal mice, indicating a possible molecular mechanism of FADD in the early IEL development. In addition, loss of {gamma}{delta} T-IELs induced by FADD-DN results in a worsening inflammation in murine DSS-induced colitis model, suggesting a protective role of FADD in the intestinal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide spread of Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to almost all {beta}-lactam antibiotics is of major clinical concern. {beta}-lactams interfere with cross-linking of the bacterial cell wall, but the killing mechanism of this important class of antibiotics is not fully understood. Here we show that sub-lethal doses of {beta}-lactams stimulate the growth of S. aureus mutants lacking the widely conserved chaperone ClpX. S. aureus clpX mutants have a severe growth defect at temperatures below 37{degrees}C, and we reasoned that a better understanding of this growth defect could provide novel insights into how {beta}-lactam antibiotics interfere with growth of S. aureus. We demonstrate that ClpX is important for coordinating the S. aureus cell cycle, and that S. aureus cells devoid of ClpX fail to divide, or lyze spontaneously, at high frequency unless {beta}-lactams are added to the growth medium. Super-resolution imaging revealed that clpX cells display aberrant septum synthesis, and initiate daughter cell separation prior to septum completion at 30{degrees}C, but not at 37{degrees}C. FtsZ localization and dynamics were not affected in the absence of ClpX, suggesting that ClpX affects septum formation and autolytic activation downstream of Z-ring formation. Interestingly, {beta}-lactams restored septum synthesis and prevented premature autolytic splitting of clpX cells. Strikingly, inhibitors of wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis that work synergistically with {beta}-lactams to kill MRSA synthesis also rescued growth of the clpX mutant, underscoring a functional link between the PBP activity and WTA biosynthesis. The finding that {beta} -lactams can prevent lysis and restore septum synthesis of a mutant with dysregulated cell division lends support to the idea that PBPs function as coordinators of cell division and that {beta} -lactams do not kill S. aureus simply by weakening the cell wall.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of human disease, and the rapid spread of S. aureus strains that are resistant to almost all {beta}-lactam antibiotics has made treatment increasingly difficult. {beta}-lactams interfere with cross-linking of the bacterial cell wall but the killing mechanism of this important class of antibiotics is still not fully understood. Here we provide novel insight into this topic by examining a defined S. aureus mutant that has the unusual property of growing markedly better in the presence of {beta}-lactams. Without {beta}-lactams this mutant dies spontaneously at a high frequency due to premature separation of daughter cells during cell division. Cell death of the mutant can, however, be prevented either by exposure to {beta}-lactam antibiotics or by inhibiting synthesis of wall teichoic acid, a major component of the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria with a conserved role in activation of autolytic splitting of daughter cells. The finding that the detrimental effect of {beta}-lactam antibiotics can be reversed by a mutation that affect the coordination of cell division emphasizes the idea that {beta}-lactams do not kill S. aureus simply by weakening the cell wall but rather by interference with the coordination of cell division.",

    "abstract": "We have simulated polymer translocation across the a -hemolysin nano-pore via a coarse grained computational model for both the polymer and the pore. We simulate the translocation process by allowing the protein cross a free-energy barrier from a metastable state, in the presence of thermal fluctuations. The deformation in the channel, which we model by making the radius of pore change from large to small size, can be originated by the random and non-random (systematic) cellular environment, drive out the polymer out of equilibrium during the transport dynamics. We expect that in more realistic conditions, effects originating on the translocation phenomena due to the deformability of the nano-pore can either decrease or increase the transport time of biomolecule passing through the channel. Deformation in channel can occurred because the structure of -hemolysin channel is not completely immobile, hence a small pore deformation can be occurred during translocation process. We also discuss the effects of polymer deformation on the translocation process, which we achieve by varying the value of the empirical and dihedral potential constants. We investigate the dynamic and thermodynamical properties of the translocation process by revealing the statistics of translocation time as a function of the pulling inward force acting along the axis of the pore under the influence of small and large pore. We observed that a pore with small size can speed down the polymer translocation process, especially at the limit of small pulling force. A drastic increase in translocation time at the limit of low force for small pore clearly illustrate the strong interaction between the transport polymer and pore. Our results can be of fundamental importance for those experiments on DNA-RNA sorting and sequencing and drug delivery mechanism for anti-cancer therapy.",

Nanopore sequencers output fast5 files containing signal data subsequently base called to fastq format. Optionally, ONT devices can collect data from all sequencing channels simultaneously in a bulk fast5 file enabling inspection of signal in any channel at any point. We sought to visualise this signal to inspect challenging or difficult to sequence samples, or where flow cell performance is modified by an external agent, such as  Read Until.\\n\\nResultsThe BulkVis tool can load a bulk fast5 file and overlays MinKNOW classifications on the signal trace. Users can navigate to a channel and time or, given a fastq header from a read, jump to its specific position. BulkVis can export regions as Nanopore base caller compatible reads. Using BulkVis, we find long reads can be incorrectly divided by MinKNOW resulting in single DNA molecules being split into two or more reads. The longest seen to date is 2,272,580 bases in length and reported in eleven consecutive reads. We provide helper scripts that identify and reconstruct split reads given a sequencing summary file and alignment to a reference. We note that incorrect read splitting appears to vary according to input sample type and is more common in  ultra long read preparations.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software is available freely under an MIT license at https://github.com/LooseLab/bulkVis.

    "abstract": "Growth and division by most bacteria requires remodeling and cleavage of their cell wall. A byproduct of this process is the generation of free peptidoglycan (PG) fragments known as muropeptides. These muropeptides are recycled in many model organisms, where the bacteria can harness their unique nature as a signal for cell wall damage. These molecules also serve as important signals for hosts where binding to specific receptors reports on the presence of intracellular bacteria. Despite this critical role for muropeptides, it has long been thought that pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis do not recycle their PG. Herein we show for the first time that M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG are able to recycle components of their PG. We demonstrate that the core-mycobacterial gene lpqI, encodes an authentic NagZ {beta}-N-acetylglucosaminidase and that it is essential for PG-derived amino sugar recycling via an unusual pathway. By characterizing an M. bovis BCG strain lacking lpqI we are also able to show that stem-peptide recycling proceeds independent of amino sugar recovery and loss of lpqI leads to antimicrobial resistance in vitro. Together these data provide a critical first step in understanding how mycobacteria recycle their peptidoglycan.",

Functional experiments and molecular dynamic simulations of constructs with and without substitutions at this glycine indicate that it acts as a hinge, permitting the intracellular portion of the ion channel to laterally expand. This expansion stabilizes long-lived open states leading to slow deactivation and high Ca2+ permeability.

    "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiencies affect a large part of the world population. They are mostly due to the consumption of grains with insufficient content of Fe or Zn. Both de novo uptake by roots and recycling from leaves may provide seeds with nutrients. Autophagy, which is a conserved mechanism for nutrient recycling in eukaryotes, was shown to be involved in nitrogen remobilization to seeds. Here, we have investigated the role of this mechanism in micronutrient translocation to seeds. We found that several Arabidopsis thaliana plants impaired in autophagy display defects in nutrient remobilization to seeds. In atg5-1 mutant, which is completely defective in autophagy, the efficiency of Fe translocation from vegetative organs to seeds was severely decreased even when Fe was provided during seed formation. Combining atg5-1 with sid2 mutation that counteracts premature senescence associated to autophagy deficiency and using 57Fe pulse labeling, we could propose a two-step mechanism in which iron taken up de novo during seed formation is first accumulated in vegetative organs and subsequently remobilized to seeds. Finally, we showed that translocations of zinc and manganese to seeds are also dependent on autophagy. Fine tuning autophagy during seed formation opens therefore new possibilities to improve micronutrient remobilization to seeds.",

On the contrary, using melanosomes of melanocytes as a model, we recently discovered that motor myosin-Va, works with dynamic actin tracks, to drive long-range organelle dispersion in microtubule depleted cells. This suggests that in animals, as in yeast and plants, myosin/actin can drive long-range transport. Here we show that SPIRE1/2 and formin-1 (FMN1) proteins generate actin tracks required for myosin-Va-dependent transport in melanocytes. Moreover we show that, in addition to melanophilin/myosin-Va, Rab27a can recruit SPIRE1/2 to melanosomes, thereby integrating motor and track assembly activity at the organelle membrane. Based on this we suggest a model in which organelles and force generators (motors and track assemblers) are linked forming a cell-wide network that allows their collective activity to rapidly disperse the population of organelles long-distance throughout the cytoplasm.",

Here, we demonstrate that intrinsic self-organization of Plk4 underlies symmetry breaking in centriole duplication. We show that in its nonphosphorylated state, Plk4 preferentially self-assembles via a disordered linker and that this self-assembly is prevented by autophosphorylation. Consistently, the dissociation dynamics of centriolar Plk4 are controlled by autophosphorylation. We further found that autophophorylated Plk4 is localized as a single focus around the mother centriole before procentriole formation, and is subsequently targeted for STIL-HsSAS6 loading. Perturbing Plk4 self-organization affects the asymmetry of centriolar Plk4 distribution and centriole duplication.

Here we ask whether the matrix also regulates centriole assembly. To define the interaction between the matrix and individual centriole components, we take advantage of a heterologous expression system using fission yeast. Importantly, its centrosome, the spindle pole body (SPB), has matrix but no centrioles. Surprisingly, we observed that the SPB can recruit several animal centriole components. Pcp1/pericentrin, a conserved matrix component that is often upregulated in cancer, recruits a critical centriole constituent, SAS-6. We further show that this novel interaction is conserved and important for centriole biogenesis and elongation in animals. We speculate that the Pcp1/pericentrin-SAS-6 interaction surface was conserved for one billion years of evolution after centriole loss in yeasts, due to its conserved binding to calmodulin. This study reveals an ancestral relationship between pericentrin and the centriole, where both regulate each other assembly, ensuring mutual localisation.\\n\\nShort summaryThe pericentriolar matrix (PCM) is not only important for microtubule-nucleation but also can regulate centriole biogenesis.

Here we explore the mutation-selection phase-diagram of 6721 primary tumors representing 23 cancer types, by quantifying the overall somatic point mutation load (ML) and selection (dN/dS) in the entire proteome of each tumor. We show that ML strongly correlates with patient survival, revealing two opposing regimes around a critical point. In low ML cancers, high number of mutations indicates poor prognosis, whereas high ML cancers show the opposite trend, due to mutational meltdown. Although the majority of cancers evolve near neutrality, deviations are observed at extreme MLs. Cancers with the highest ML evolve under purifying selection, whereas those with the lowest ML show signatures of positive selection, demonstrating how selection affects cancer fitness. Moreover, different cancers occupy specific positions on the ML-dN/dS plane, revealing a diversity of evolutionary trajectories. These results support and expand the theory of tumor evolution and its non-linear effects on survival.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIt remains an open fundamental question how mutation and selection co-determine the course of cancer evolution. We construct a selection-mutation phase diagram, using tumor mutation load and selection strength as key variables, and assess their association with clinical outcome. We demonstrate the existence of a biphasic evolutionary regime, whereby beyond a critical ML, the fitness of tumors decreases with the number of mutations, while the proteome evolves near neutrality. Deviations from neutrality in extreme ML elucidate how positive and purifying selections maintain tumor fitness. These results empirically corroborate the existence of a critical state in cancer evolution predicted by theory, and have fundamental and likely clinical implications.",

Treatment with recombinant DUSP28 (rDUSP28) significantly increased the migration, invasion, and viability of metastatic pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of CREB, AKT, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, rDUSP28 acted as an oncogenic reagent through the interaction with integrin 1 in metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, rDUSP28 induced pro-angiogenic effects in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Administration of rDUSP28 also produced tumor growth in vivo. Notably, sDUSP28 can easily be detected by immunoassay. The results establish the rationale for sDUSP28 as a promising therapeutic target and biomarker for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell formation (CSCs) are two fundamental and well-studied processes contributing to cancer metastasis and tumor relapse. Cells can undergo a partial EMT to attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype or a complete EMT to attain a mesenchymal one. Similarly, cells can reversibly gain or lose  stemness. This plasticity in cell states is modulated by signaling pathways such as Notch. However, the interconnections among the cell states enabled by EMT, CSCs and Notch signaling remain elusive. Here, we devise a computational model to investigate the coupling among the core decision-making circuits for EMT, CSCs and the Notch pathway. Our model predicts that hybrid E/M cells are most likely to associate with stemness traits and exhibit enhanced Notch-Jagged signaling - a pathway that is implicated in therapeutic resistance. Further, we show that the position of the  stemness window on the  EMT axis is varied by altering the coupling strength between EMT and CSC circuits, and/or modulating Notch signaling. Finally, we analyze the gene expression profile of CSCs from several cancer types and observe a heterogeneous distribution along the  EMT axis, suggesting that different subsets of CSCs may exist with varying phenotypes along the epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity axis. Our computational model offers insights into the complex EMT-stemness interplay and provides a platform to investigate the effects of therapeutic perturbations such as treatment with metformin, a common anti-diabetic drug that has been associated with decreased cancer incidence and increased lifespan of patients. Our mechanism-based model helps explain how metformin can both inhibit EMT and blunt the aggressive potential of CSCs simultaneously, by driving the cells out of a hybrid E/M stem-like state with enhanced Notch-Jagged signaling.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in experimental methods in neuroscience enable measuring in-vivo activity of large populations of neurons at cellular level resolution. To leverage the full potential of these complex datasets and analyze the dynamics of individual neurons, it is essential to extract high-resolution regions of interest, while addressing demixing of overlapping spatial components and denoising of the temporal signal of each neuron. In this paper, we propose a data-driven solution to these challenges, by representing the spatiotemporal volume as a graph in the image plane. Based on the spectral embedding of this graph calculated across trials, we propose a new clustering method, Local Selective Spectral Clustering, capable of handling overlapping clusters and disregarding clutter. We also present a new nonlinear mapping which recovers the structural map of the neurons and dendrites, and global video denoising. We demonstrate our approach on in-vivo calcium imaging of neurons and apical dendrites, automatically extracting complex structures in the image domain, and denoising and demixing their time-traces.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTranscription control plays a crucial role in establishing a unique gene expression signature for each of the hundreds of mammalian cell types. Though gene expression data has been widely used to infer the cellular regulatory networks, the methods mainly infer correlations rather than causality. We propose that a causal inference framework successfully used for eQTL data can be extended to infer causal regulatory networks using enhancers as causal anchors and enhancer RNA expression as a readout of enhancer activity.\\n\\nResultsWe developed statistical models and likelihood-ratio tests to infer causal gene regulatory networks using enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression information as a causal anchor and applied the framework to eRNA and transcript expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Predicted causal targets of transcription factors (TFs) in mouse embryonic stem cells, macrophages and erythroblastic leukemia overlapped significantly with experimentally validated targets from ChIP-seq and perturbation data. We further improved the model by taking into account that some TFs might act in a quantitative, dosage-dependent manner, whereas others might act predominantly in a binary on/off fashion. We predicted TF targets from concerted variation of eRNA and TF and target promoter expression levels within a single cell type as well as across multiple cell types. Importantly, TFs with high-confidence predictions were largely different between these two analyses, demonstrating that variability within a cell type is highly relevant for target prediction of cell type specific factors. Finally, we generated a compendium of high-confidence TF targets across diverse human cell and tissue types.\\n\\nAvailabilityMethods have been implemented in the Findr software, available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr\\n\\nContactTom.Michoel@roslin.ed.ac.uk, Anagha.Joshi@roslin.ed.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments is an essential goal of population and quantitative genetics. While technological advances now allow interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation is still limited. To address this limitation, we use extensive forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of variation in demography, trait genetics, and selection on the rate and mode of adaptation and the resulting genetic architecture. We simulate a population adapting to an optimum shift, modeling sequence variation for 20 QTL for each of 12 different demographies for 100 different traits varying in the effect size distribution of new mutations, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the contribution of the genomic background. We then use random forest regression approaches to learn the relative importance of input parameters in determining a number of aspects of the process of adaptation including the speed of adaptation, the relative frequency of hard sweeps and sweeps from standing variation, or the final genetic architecture of the trait. We find that selective sweeps occur even for traits under relatively weak selection and where the genetic background explains most of the variation. Though most sweeps occur from variation segregating in the ancestral population, new mutations can be important for traits under strong stabilizing selection that undergo a large optimum shift. We also show that population bottlenecks and expansion impact overall genetic variation as well as the relative importance of sweeps from standing variation and the speed with which adaptation can occur. We then compare our results to two traits under selection during maize domestication, showing that our simulations qualitatively recapitulate differences between them. Overall, our results underscore the complex population genetics of individual loci in even relatively simple quantitative trait models, but provide a glimpse into the factors that drive this complexity and the potential of these approaches for understanding polygenic adaptation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMany traits are controlled by a large number of genes, and environmental changes can lead to shifts in trait optima. How populations adapt to these shifts depends on a number of parameters including the genetic basis of the trait as well as population demography. We simulate a number of trait architectures and population histories to study the genetics of adaptation to distant trait optima. We find that selective sweeps occur even in traits under relatively weak selection and our machine learning analyses find that demography and the effect sizes of mutations have the largest influence on genetic variation after adaptation. Maize domestication is a well suited model for trait adaptation accompanied by demographic changes. We show how two example traits under a maize specific demography adapt to a distant optimum and demonstrate that polygenic adaptation is a well suited model for crop domestication even for traits with major effect loci.",

    "abstract": "Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) is an important industrial crop. The knowledge about genes of guar involved in various processes can help in developing improved varieties of this crop. qRT-PCR is a preferred technique for accurate quantification of gene expression data. This technique requires the use of appropriate reference genes from the crop to be studied. Such genes have not been yet identified in guar. The expression stabilities of the 10 candidate reference genes, viz., CYP, ACT 11, EF-1, TUA, TUB, ACT 7, UBQ 10, UBC 2, GAPDH and 18S rRNA were evaluated in various tissues of guar under normal and abiotic stress conditions. Four different algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and {triangleup}Ct approach, were used to assess the expression stabilities and the results obtained were integrated into comprehensive stability rankings. The most stable reference genes were found to be CYP and ACT 11(tissues), ACT 11, UBC 2 and ACT 7 (seed development), ACT 7 and TUB (drought stress), TUA, UBC 2 and CYP (nitrogen stress), TUA and UBC 2 (cold stress), GAPDH and ACT 7 (heat stress) and GAPDH and EF-1a (salt stress). These results indicated the necessity of identifying a suitable reference gene for each experimental condition. Four selected reference genes were validated by normalizing the expression of CtMT1 gene. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the identification of reference genes in guar. These findings are likely to provide a boost to the gene expression studies in this important crop.",

    "abstract": "Increasing popularity of high-throughput phenotyping technologies, such as image-based phenotyping, offer novel ways for quantifying plant growth and morphology. These new methods can be more or less accurate and precise than traditional, manual measurements. Many large-scale phenotyping efforts are conducted to enable genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but it is unclear exactly how alternative methods of phenotyping will affect GWAS results. In this study we simulate phenotypes that are controlled by the same set of causal loci but have differing heritability, similar to two different measurements of the same morphological character. We then perform GWAS with the simulated traits and create receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from the results. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) provide a metric that allows direct comparisons of GWAS results from different simulated traits. We use this framework to evaluate the effects of heritability and the number of causative loci on the AUCs of simulated traits; we also test the differences between AUCs of traits with differing heritability. We find that both increasing the number of causative loci and decreasing the heritability reduce a traits AUC. We also find that when two traits are controlled by a greater number of causative loci, they are more likely to have significantly different AUCs as the difference between their heritabilities increases. These results provide a framework for deciding between competing phenotyping strategies when the ultimate goal is to generate and use phenotype-genotype associations from GWAS.",

Its most distinctive characteristic is a polysaccharide capsule that envelops the whole cell. It is the major virulence attribute and the antigen for serologic diagnosis. We have developed a method for easy observation of the capsule and its growth dynamics using the cell-separation reagent Percoll and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Percoll suspension is far less disruptive of cell physiology than methods relying on antibody binding to the capsule, and measurements made with it are equivalent with India ink. Time-lapse microscopy observations using this method suggest that during budding, a dividing cell can regulate whether the capsule polysaccharide it produces is deposited on the capsule of the bud or on its own. This observation has important implications for our understanding of the C. neoformans capsule induction process during budding.\\n\\nList of abbreviations and acronyms",

User-defined genes in OrthoRep continuously and rapidly evolve through serial passaging, a highly scalable process. Using OrthoRep, we evolved drug resistant malarial DHFRs 90 times and uncovered a more complex fitness landscape than previously realized5-9. We find rare fitness peaks that resist the maximum soluble concentration of the antimalarial pyrimethamine - these resistant variants support growth at pyrimethamine concentrations >40,000-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme can tolerate - and also find that epistatic interactions direct adaptive trajectories to convergent outcomes. OrthoRep enables a new paradigm of routine, high-throughput evolution of biomolecular and cellular function.",

Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker linked to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8-85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of 7 cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination.",

Given the role of the hippocampus in contextual representations of threat and memory, we investigated relationships between retrospectively reported combat exposure, perceived threat, and hippocampal volume in trauma-exposed veterans.\\n\\nMethodsT1-weighted anatomical MRI scans were obtained from 52 male veterans with a broad range of PTSD symptoms. Hippocampal volume was estimated using automatic segmentation tools in FreeSurfer. An index of perceived threat bias was calculated, reflecting the degree of discordance between subjective perceptions of threat while deployed and self-reported combat exposure. Hippocampal volume was regressed on perceived threat bias and PTSD symptoms on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).\\n\\nResultsPerceived threat bias was unrelated to overall CAPS symptoms, but was positively correlated with CAPS avoidance/numbing symptoms and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and worry. The degree of perceived threat bias was inversely correlated with hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was also inversely related to avoidance/numbing CAPS symptoms.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results indicate that volume of the hippocampus, a region involved in contextual threat processing and memory, is related to recalled associations between traumatic events and accompanying subjective threat appraisals. Future research should clarify the precise temporal milieu of these effects and investigate whether individual differences in hippocampal structure and function contribute to exaggerated threat appraisal at the time of trauma, or in subsequently biased memories or appraisals of traumatic events.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that novel enzyme functions evolved from low-level promiscuous activities in ancestral enzymes. Yet, the evolutionary dynamics and physiological mechanisms of how such side activities contribute to systems-level adaptations are poorly understood. Furthermore, it remains untested whether knowledge of an organisms promiscuous reaction set ( underground metabolism) can aid in forecasting the genetic basis of metabolic adaptations. Here, we employ a computational model of underground metabolism and laboratory evolution experiments to examine the role of enzyme promiscuity in the acquisition and optimization of growth on predicted non-native substrates in E. coli K-12 MG1655. After as few as 20 generations, the evolving populations repeatedly acquired the capacity to grow on five predicted novel substrates-D-lyxose, D-2-deoxyribose, D-arabinose, m-tartrate, and monomethyl succinate-none of which could support growth in wild-type cells. Promiscuous enzyme activities played key roles in multiple phases of adaptation. Altered promiscuous activities not only established novel high-efficiency pathways, but also suppressed undesirable metabolic routes. Further, structural mutations shifted enzyme substrate turnover rates towards the new substrate while retaining a preference for the primary substrate. Finally, genes underlying the phenotypic innovations were accurately predicted by genome-scale model simulations of metabolism with enzyme promiscuity. Computational approaches will be essential to synthesize the complex role of promiscuous activities in applied biotechnology and in models of evolutionary adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Although lysosomes perform a number of essential cellular functions, damaged lysosomes represent a potential hazard to the cell. Such lysosomes are therefore engulfed by autophagic membranes in the process known as lysophagy, which is initiated by recognition of luminal glycoprotein domains by cytosolic lectins such as Galectin-3. Here we show that, under various conditions that cause injury to the lysosome membrane, components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery are recruited. This recruitment occurs before that of Galectin-3 and the lysophagy machinery. Subunits of the ESCRT-III complex show a particularly prominent recruitment, which depends on the ESCRT-I component TSG101 and the TSG101- and ESCRT-III-binding protein ALIX. Interference with ESCRT recruitment abolishes lysosome repair and causes otherwise reversible lysosome damage to become cell lethal. Vacuoles containing the intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii show reversible ESCRT recruitment, and interference with this recruitment reduces intravacuolar bacterial replication. We conclude that the cell is equipped with an endogenous mechanism for lysosome repair which protects against lysosomal damage-induced cell death but which also provides a potential advantage for intracellular pathogens.",
