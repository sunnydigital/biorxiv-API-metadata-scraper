    "abstract": "Recent whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies have estimated that the human germline mutation rate per basepair per generation ([~]1.2-10-8) 1,2 is substantially higher than in mice (3.5-5.4-10-9) 3,4, which has been attributed to more efficient purifying selection due to larger effective population sizes in mice compared to humans.5,6,7. In humans, most germline mutations are paternal in origin and the numbers of mutations per offspring increase markedly with paternal age 2,8,9 and more weakly with maternal age 10. Germline mutations can arise at any stage of the cellular lineage from zygote to gamete, resulting in mutations being represented in different proportion and types of cells, with the earliest embryonic mutations being mosaic in both somatic and germline cells. Here we use WGS of multi-sibling mouse and human pedigrees to show striking differences in germline mutation rate and spectra between the two species, including a dramatic reduction in mutation rate in human spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) divisions, which we hypothesise was driven by selection. The differences we observed between mice and humans result from both biological differences within the same stage of embryogenesis or gametogenesis and species-specific differences in cellular genealogies of the germline.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100049).\\n\\nNew parasites commonly arise through host-shifts, where parasites from one host species jump to and become established in a new host species. There is much evidence that the probability of host-shifts decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient hosts, but the consequences of such preferential host switching remain little explored. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of parasite host-shifts in the presence of this phylogenetic distance effect. Host trees evolve under a stochastic birth-death process and parasites co-evolve concurrently on those trees, undergoing host-shifts, co-speciation and extinction. Our model indicates that host trees have a major influence on these dynamics. This applies both to individual trees that evolved under the same stochastic process and to sets of trees that evolved with different macroevolutionary parameters. We predict that trees consisting of a few large clades of host species and those with fast species turnover should harbour more parasites than trees with many small clades and those that diversify more slowly. Within trees, large clades should exhibit a higher infection frequency than small clades. We discuss our results in the light of recent cophylogenetic studies in a wide range of host-parasite systems, including the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia.",

    "abstract": "Self-fertilization is often associated with ecological traits corresponding to the ruderal strategy in Grimes Competitive-Stress-tolerant-Ruderal (CSR) classification of ecological strategies. Consequently, selfers are expected to be less competitive than outcrossers, either because of a colonization/competition trade-off or because of the deleterious genetic effects of selfing. Range expansion could reduce further competitive ability while polyploidy could mitigate the effects of selfing. Although suggested by meta-analyses, these predictions have not been directly tested yet. We compared the competitive ability of four Capsella species differing by their mating system and ploidy level. We found that the two diploid selfing species (C. rubella and C. orientalis) were more sensitive to competition than the diploid outcrosser (C. grandiflora), and that the tetraploid selfer (C. bursa-pastoris) was intermediate. Within C. bursa-pastoris, we also found that sensitivity to competition increased in parallel to range expansion. These results highlight the possible roles of ecological context and ploidy in the evolutionary trajectories of selfing species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA central question in bioinformatics is how to minimize arbitrariness and bias in analysis of patterns of enrichment in data. A prime example of such a question is enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in lists of genes. Our paper deals with two issues within this larger question. One is how to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a set of apparently enriched ontologies, and the second how to set that FDR within the context of assessing significance for addressing biological questions, to answer these questions we compare a random resampling method with a commonly used method for assessing FDR, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. We further develop a heuristic method for evaluating Type II (false negative) errors to enable utilization of F-Measure binary classification theory for distinguishing \\\"significant\\\" from \\\"non-significant\\\" degrees of enrichment.\\n\\nResultsThe results show the preferability and feasibility of random resampling assessment of FDR over the analytical methods with which we compare it. They also show that the reasonableness of any arbitrary threshold depends strongly on the structure of the dataset being tested, suggesting that the less arbitrary method of F-measure optimization to determine significance threshold is preferable.\\n\\nConclusionTherefore, we suggest using F-measure optimization instead of placing an arbitrary threshold to evaluate the significance of Gene Ontology Enrichment results, and using resampling to replace analytical methods",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus needs to control the position and timing of cell division and cell wall synthesis to maintain its spherical shape. We identified two membrane proteins, named CozEa and CozEb, which together are important for proper cell division in S. aureus. CozEa and CozEb are homologs of the cell elongation regulator CozESpn of Streptococcus pneumoniae. While cozEa and cozEb were not essential individually, the {Delta}cozEa{Delta}cozEb double mutant was lethal. To study the functions of cozEa and cozEb, we constructed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for S. aureus, allowing transcriptional knockdown of essential genes. CRISPRi knockdown of cozEa in the {Delta}cozEb strain (and vice versa) causes cell morphological defects and aberrant nucleoid staining, showing that cozEa and cozEb have overlapping functions and are important for normal cell division. We found that CozEa and CozEb interact with the cell division protein EzrA, and that EzrA-GFP mislocalizes in the absence of CozEa and CozEb. Furthermore, the CozE-EzrA interaction is conserved in S. pneumoniae, and cell division is mislocalized in cozESpn-depleted S. pneumoniae cells. Together, our results show that CozE proteins mediate control of cell division in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, likely via interactions with key cell division proteins such as EzrA.",

    "abstract": "The human brain integrates diverse cognitive processes into a coherent whole, shifting fluidly as a function of changing environmental demands. Despite recent progress, the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for this dynamic system-level integration remain poorly understood. Here, we used multi-task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project to examine the spatiotemporal architecture of cognition in the human brain. By investigating the spatial, dynamic and molecular signatures of system-wide neural activity across a range of cognitive tasks, we show that large-scale neuronal activity converges onto a low dimensional manifold that facilitates the dynamic execution of diverse task states. Flow within this attractor space is associated with dissociable cognitive functions, and with unique patterns of network-level topology and information processing complexity. The axes of the low-dimensional neurocognitive architecture align with regional differences in the density of neuromodulatory receptors, which in turn relate to distinct signatures of network controllability estimated from the structural connectome. These results advance our understanding of functional brain organization by emphasizing the interface between low dimensional neural activity, network topology, neuromodulatory systems and cognitive function.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA diverse set of neuromodulators facilitates the formation of a dynamic, low-dimensional integrative core in the brain that is recruited by diverse cognitive demands",

Reanalysis using databses including the MirGeneDB database reveals that the miRNAs in question, miR-21-5p and miR-30a-5p, arise from 100% identical 5 precursor sequences in human and bovine, and the putative bovine-specific isomiRs appear to be depleted, not enriched, in bovine milk.

    "abstract": "AbstractAnalysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.\\n\\nAuthor summarySub-cellular localisation of proteins provides insights into sub-cellular biological processes. For a protein to carry out its intended function it must be localised to the correct sub-cellular environment, whether that be organelles, vesicles or any sub-cellular niche. Correct sub-cellular localisation ensures the biochemical conditions for the protein to carry out its molecular function are met, as well as being near its intended interaction partners. Therefore, mis-localisation of proteins alters cell biochemistry and can disrupt, for example, signalling pathways or inhibit the trafficking of material around the cell. The sub-cellular distribution of proteins is complicated by proteins that can reside in multiple micro-environments, or those that move dynamically within the cell. Methods that predict protein sub-cellular localisation often fail to quantify the uncertainty that arises from the complex and dynamic nature of the sub-cellular environment. Here we present a Bayesian methodology to analyse protein sub-cellular localisation. We explicitly model our data and use Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty in our predictions. We find our method is competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning methods and additionally provides uncertainty quantification. We show that, with this additional information, we can make deeper insights into the fundamental biochemistry of the cell.",

    "abstract": "1. AbstractSynaptic vesicles (SVs) are a key component of neuronal signaling and fulfil different roles depending on their composition. In electron micrograms of neurites, two types of vesicles can be distinguished by morphological criteria, the classical \\\"clear core\\\" vesicles (CCV) and the typically larger \\\"dense core\\\" vesicles (DCV), with differences in electron density due to their diverse cargos. Compared to CCVs, the precise function of DCVs is less defined. DCVs are known to store neuropeptides, which function as neuronal messengers and modulators [1]. In C. elegans, they play a role in locomotion, dauer formation, egg-laying, and mechano- and chemosensation [2]. Another type of DCVs, also referred to as granulated vesicles, are known to transport Bassoon, Piccolo and further constituents of the presynaptic density in the center of the active zone (AZ), and therefore are important for synaptogenesis [3].\\n\\nTo better understand the role of different types of SVs, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, the ImageJ macro 3D ART VeSElecT. With that we reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs in electron tomograms of C. elegans NMJs using image-based features. Analysis of the underlying ground truth data shows an increased fraction of DCVs as well as a higher mean distance between DCVs and AZs in dauer larvae compared to young adult hermaphrodites. Our machine learning based tools are adaptable and can be applied to study properties of different synaptic vesicle pools in electron tomograms of diverse model organisms.\\n\\n2.

Two types of synaptic vesicles can be distinguished by electron microscopy: the classical \\\"clear core\\\" vesicles (CCVs) and the typically larger \\\"dense core\\\" vesicles (DCVs). The distinct appearance of vesicles is caused by their different cargos. To rapidly distinguish between both vesicle types, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles in electron tomograms. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, an ImageJ macro, to reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs using specific image-based features. The approach was trained and validated using data-sets that were hand curated by microscopy experts. Our technique can be transferred to more extensive comparisons in both stages as well as to other neurobiology questions regarding synaptic vesicles.",

In practice, many factors resulting from the environment, the protocol, and even the instrument itself, can lead to minor discrepancies between spectra, rendering automated comparative analysis difficult.

In an effort to reveal the organisation of immunity in roots, we undertook a cell type-specific transcriptome analysis to identify gene networks activated in epidermis, cortex and pericycle cells of Arabidopsis roots upon treatment with two immunity elicitors, the bacterial microbe-associated molecular pattern flagellin, and the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern Pep1. Our analyses revealed that both elicitors induced immunity gene networks in a cell type-specific manner. Interestingly, both elicitors did not alter cell identity-determining gene networks. Using sophisticated paired motif promoter analyses, we identified key transcription factor pairs involved in the regulation of cell type-specific immunity networks. In addition, our data show that cell identity networks integrate with cell immunity networks to activate cell type-specific immune response according to the functional capabilities of each cell type.\\n\\nMaterial Distribution FootnoteThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Patrick Schafer (p.schafer@warwick.ac.uk).",

    "abstract": "We here present two methods for inferring population structure and admixture proportions in low depth next generation sequencing data. Inference of population structure is essential in both population genetics and association studies and is often performed using principal component analysis or clustering-based approaches. Next-generation sequencing methods provide large amounts of genetic data but are associated with statistical uncertainty for especially low depth sequencing data. Models can account for this uncertainty by working directly on genotype likelihoods of the unobserved genotypes. We propose a method for inferring population structure through principal component analysis in an iterative approach of estimating individual allele frequencies, where we demonstrate improved accuracy in samples with low and variable sequencing depth for both simulated and real datasets. We also use the estimated individual allele frequencies in a fast non-negative matrix factorization method to estimate admixture proportions. Both methods have been implemented in the PCAngsd framework available at http://www.popgen.dk/software/.",

Heritability and variant effects were generally stronger in women than men, and we found approximately one-third of all signals to be sexually dimorphic.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndirect vibration stimulation i.e. whole body vibration or upper limb vibration, has been suggested increasingly as an effective exercise intervention for sports and rehabilitation applications. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) stimulation superimposed to graded isometric contractions superimposed on. For this scope, we investigated the effects of WBV superimposed to graded isometric contractions in the lower limbs on muscle activation. We also assessed the agonist-antagonist co-activation during this type of exercise.\\n\\nTwelve healthy volunteers were exposed to WBV superimposed to graded isometric contractions, at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the maximum voluntary contractions (V) or just isometric contractions performed on a custom designed horizontal leg press Control (C). Tested stimulation consisted of 30Hzand 50Hz frequencies and 0.5mm and 1.5mm amplitudes. Surface electromyographic activity of Vastus Lateralis (VL), Vastus Medialis (VM) and Biceps Femoris (BF) were measured during V and C conditions. Co-contraction activity of agonist-antagonist muscles was also quantified. The trials were performed in random order.\\n\\nResultsBoth the prime mover, (VL) and the antagonist, (BF) displayed significantly higher (P < 0.05) EMG activity with the V than the C condition. For both the VL and BF, the increase in mean EMGrms values depended on the frequency, amplitude and muscle contraction level with 50Hz-0.5mm stimulation inducing the largest neuromuscular activity. 50Hz-0.5mm V condition also led to co-activation ratios significantly (P< 0.05) higher at 40, 80 and 100% of MVC than the C condition.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show that the isometric contraction superimposed on vibration stimulation leads to higher neuromuscular activity compared to isometric contraction alone in the lower limbs. Compared to the control condition, the vibratory stimulation leads to higher agonist-antagonist co-activation of the muscles around the knee joint in all vibration conditions and effort levels. The combination of vibration magnitude (frequency and amplitude) and the level of muscle contraction affect neuromuscular activity rather than vibration frequency alone. Results of this study suggest that more parameters need to be taken into consideration when designing vibration exercise programs for sports and rehabilitation purposes.",

We measure information as the reduction in entropy under a probabilistic evolutionary model that describes genetic variation across [~]50 diverse humans and several nonhuman primates. We find that several genomic features yield more information in combination than they do individually, with DNase-seq displaying particularly strong synergy. Most of the entropy in human genetic variation, by far, reflects mutation and neutral drift; the genome-wide reduction in entropy due to selection is equivalent to only a small fraction of the storage requirements of a single human genome. Based on this framework, we produce cell-type-specific maps of the probability that a mutation at each nucleotide will have fitness consequences (FitCons scores). These scores are predictive of known functional elements and disease-associated variants, they reveal relationships among cell types, and they suggest that [~]8% of nucleotide sites are constrained by natural selection.",

    "abstract": "AAA+ proteases are essential players in cellular pathways of protein degradation. Elucidating their conformational behavior is key for understanding their reaction mechanism and, importantly, for elaborating our understanding of mutation-induced protease deficiencies. Here, we study the structural dynamics of the Thermotoga maritima AAA+ hexameric ring metalloprotease FtsH (TmFtsH). Using a single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer approach to monitor ATPase and protease inter-domain conformational changes in real time, we show that TmFtsH--even in the absence of nucleotide--is a highly dynamic protease undergoing conformational transitions between five states on the second timescale in a sequential manner. Addition of ATP does not influence the number of states nor change the timescale of domain motions, but affects the state occupancy distribution leading to an inter-domain compaction. These findings suggest that thermal energy, but not chemical energy, provides the major driving force for conformational switching, while ATP, through a state reequilibration, introduces directionality into this process. The TmFtsH A359V mutation, a homolog of the human pathogenic A510V mutation of paraplegin (SPG7) causing hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), does not affect the dynamic behavior of the protease but impairs the ATP-coupled domain compaction and, thus, may account for protease malfunctioning and pathogenesis in HSP.",

Despite reports of lysogeny in marine cyanobacteria, the genome sequence of such temperate cyanophages remains unknown although genomic analysis indicate potential for lysogeny in certain marine cyanophages. Using assemblies from Red Sea and Tara Oceans metagenomes, we recovered genomes of a novel uncultured marine cyanophage lineage, which contain, in addition to common cyanophage genes, a phycobilisome degradation protein NblA, an integrase and a split DNA polymerase. The DNA polymerase forms a monophyletic clade with a DNA polymerase from a genomic island in Synechococcus WH8016. The island contains a relic prophage that does not resemble any previously reported cyanophage but shares several genes with the newly identified cyanophages reported here. Metagenomic recruitment indicates that the novel cyanophages are widespread, albeit at low abundance.

Despite reports of lysogeny in marine cyanobacteria, genomes from lysogenic marine cyanophages have not been reported yet. Using metagenomics assemblies, we recovered complete genomes of a novel uncultured marine cyanophage lineage.

The genomic island contains a putative relic prophage that does not resemble any known cultured cyanophage but shares several genes with the newly identified cyanophage family.

    "abstract": "A large volume of biological data is being generated for studying mechanisms of various biological processes. These precious data enable large-scale computational analyses to gain biological insights. However, it remains a challenge to mine the data efficiently for knowledge discovery. The heterogeneity of these data makes it difficult to consistently integrate them, slowing down the process of biological discovery. We introduce a data processing paradigm to identify key factors in biological processes via systematic collection of gene expression datasets, primary analysis of data, and evaluation of consistent signals. To demonstrate its effectiveness, our paradigm was applied to epidermal development and identified many genes that play a potential role in this process. Besides the known epidermal development genes, a substantial proportion of the identified genes are still not supported by gain- or loss-of-function studies, yielding many novel genes for future studies. Among them, we selected a top gene for loss-of-function experimental validation and confirmed its function in epidermal differentiation, proving the ability of this paradigm to identify new factors in biological processes. In addition, this paradigm revealed many key genes in cold-induced thermogenesis using data from cold-challenged tissues, demonstrating its generalizability. This paradigm can lead to fruitful results for studying molecular mechanisms in an era of explosive accumulation of publicly available biological data.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTaxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis. When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree. This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However,likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever-increasing throughput of DNA sequencing.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.\\n\\nAvailabilityProgram and sources freely available for download at gite.lirmm.fr/linard/RAPPAS.\\n\\nContactbenjamin.linard@lirmm.fr",

Higher contrasts released glutamate packets composed of more vesicles and coding by amplitude often continued after rate coding had saturated.

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal cell migration relies on the coordinated regulation of the actin and microtubule networks which participate in polarised cell protrusion, adhesion and contraction. During collective migration, most of the traction forces are generated by the acto-myosin network linked to focal adhesions at the front of leader cells, which transmit these pulling forces to the followers. Here, using an in vitro wound healing assay to induce polarisation and collective directed migration of primary astrocytes, we show that the intermediate filament (IF) network composed of vimentin, GFAP and nestin contributes to directed collective movement by controlling the distribution of forces in the migrating cell monolayer. Together with the cytoskeletal linker plectin, these IFs control the organisation and dynamics of the acto-myosin network, promoting the actin-driven treadmilling of adherens junctions, thereby facilitating the polarisation of leader cells. Independently of their effect on adherens junctions, IFs influence the dynamics and localisation of focal adhesions and limit their mechanical coupling to the acto-myosin network. We thus conclude that IFs promote collective directed migration by restricting the generation of traction forces to the front of leader cells, preventing aberrant tractions in the followers and by contributing to the maintenance of lateral cell-cell interactions.",

    "abstract": "During much of the 20th Century, partridge/quail-like, Afro-Asian phasianine birds referred to commonly as African spurfowls, francolins and/or partridges had a tortuous taxonomic history. Because of striking autapomorphic differences in plumage, vocalizations and ecology in some of these taxa, as many as nine genera and nearly 200 clinal and/or idiosyncratic subspecies, embedded within a polyphyletic Perdicinae, were recognized. In 1963, two clades, 28  francolin and  spurfowl species (fisante in Afrikaans) and 13 Afro-Asiatic  francolins and  partridges (patryse in Afrikaans), were combined into a single genus (Francolinus) - the largest within the Galliformes - comprising about 100 subspecies. Furthermore, fisante and patryse were partitioned into several unnamed \\\"Groups\\\" and four \\\"Unplaced\\\" species. Here, we use morphological, behavioural and DNA evidence to produce: a comprehensive revision of the taxonomy and phylogeny of the fisante clade; a stable classification system for tis component taxa; and hypotheses vis-a-vis eco-biogeographical processes that promoted their speciation and cladogenesis. We shift Francolinus spp. sensu stricto (members of the Spotted Group) and the Unplaced  Francolinus gularis from the fisante clade to the patryse [discussed in Mandiwana-Neudani et al., in review]. An Unplaced fisant,  F. nahani, is linked with Ptilopachus petrosus (another African endemic  partridge ) within the Odontophoridae (New World  Quails ). We recognize 25 species of fisante (hereafter spurfowls), including seven with subspecies. They comprise 34 terminal taxa placed within a single genus, Pternistis, sister to Ammoperdix and Perdicula spp., Coturnix  quails and Alectoris  partridges , within the now monophyletic Coturnicinae. Only one of four putative Groups of spurfowls, the Bare-throated Group, is monophyletic. The other three Groups (Montane, Scaly and Vermiculated) are para- or polyphyletic. Several species pairs of spurfowls, most notably P. afer and cranchii, hybridize in para/sympatry. One Bare-throated spurfowl, P. rufopictus, may be the product of stabilized hybridization between P. afer and/or cranchii and P. leucoscepus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSuccessful chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is known to be associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with failed CTO PCI. However, it is not clear whether the angiographic and clinical outcomes of long CTO lesionis different with those of short CTO lesion in the drug eluting stent (DES) era.\\n\\nMethod sand ResultsA total of 235 consecutive patients underwent successful CTO intervention were divided into two groups according the CTO lesion length. Six-month angiographic and two-year clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. The baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups except prior PCI was more frequent in long CTO group whereas bifurcation lesion was more frequent in the short CTO group. In-hospital complications were similar between the two groups except intimal dissection was more frequent in long CTO group. Both groups had similar angiographic outcomes at 6 months and clinical outcomes up to 2 years except the incidence of repeat PCI, predominantly target vessel revascularization (TVR) was higher in long CTO group. In multivariate analysis, long CTO was an important predictor for repeat PCI (OR;4.26, CI 1.53-11.9, p=0.006).\\n\\nConclusionThe safety profile, angiographic and 2-year clinical outcomes were similar between the two groups except higher incidence of repeat PCI in long CTO group despite of successful PCI with DESs.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the three Bithorax complex homeotic genes is orchestrated by nine parasegment-specific regulatory domains. Autonomy of each domain is conferred by boundary elements (insulators). Here, we have used an in situ replacement strategy to reanalyze the sequences required for the functioning of one of the best-characterized fly boundaries, Fab-7. It was initially identified by a deletion, Fab-71, that transformed parasegment (PS) 11 into a duplicate copy of PS12. Fab-71 deleted four nuclease hypersensitive sites, HS*, HS1, HS2, and HS3, located in between the iab-6 and iab-7 regulatory domains. Transgene and P-element excision experiments mapped the boundary to HS*+HS1+HS2, while HS3 was shown to be the iab-7 Polycomb response element (PRE). Recent replacement experiments showed that HS1 is both necessary and sufficient for boundary activity when HS3 is also presented in the replacement construct. Surprisingly, while HS1+HS3 combination has full boundary activity, we discovered that HS1 alone has only minimal function. Moreover, when combined with HS3, only the distal half of HS1, dHS1, is needed. A [~]1,000 kD multiprotein complex containing the GAF protein, called the LBC, binds to the dHS1 sequence and we show that mutations in dHS1 that disrupt LBC binding in nuclear extracts eliminate boundary activity and GAF binding in vivo. HS3 has binding sites for GAF and Pho proteins that are required for PRE silencing. In contrast, HS3 boundary activity only requires the GAF binding sites. LBC binding with HS3 in nuclear extracts, and GAF association in vivo depend upon the HS3 GAF sites, but not the Pho sites. Consistent with a role for the LBC in HS3 boundary activity, the boundary function of the dHS1+HS3mPho combination is lost when the flies are heterozygous for a mutation in the GAF gene. Taken together, these results reveal a novel function for the iab-7 PREs in chromosome architecture.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPolycomb group proteins (PcG) are important epigenetic regulators of developmental genes in all higher eukaryotes. In Drosophila, these proteins are bound to specific regulatory DNA elements called Polycomb group Response Elements (PREs). PcG support proper patterns of homeotic gene expression throughout development. Drosophila PREs are made up of binding sites for a complex array of DNA binding proteins, including GAF and Pho. In the regulatory region of the bithorax complex (BX-C), the boundary/insulator elements organize the autonomous regulatory domains, and their active or repressed states are regulated by PREs. Here, we studied the domain organization of the Fab-7 boundary and the neighboring PRE, which separate the iab-6 and iab-7 domains involved in transcription of the Abd-B gene. It was previously thought that PRE recruits PcG proteins that inhibit activation of the iab-7 enhancers in the inappropriate domains. However, here we found that PRE contributes to boundary activity and in combination with a key 242 bp Fab-7 region (dHS1) can form a completely functional boundary. Late Boundary Complex (LBC) binds not only to dHS1 but also to PRE and is required for the boundary activity of both elements. At the same time, mutations of Pho binding sites strongly diminish recruiting of PcG but do not considerably affect boundary function, suggesting that these activities can be separated in PRE.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fundamental importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to human evolution there are still large gaps in our understanding of the forces that shape their distribution across the genome. SNPs have been shown to not be distributed evenly, with directly adjacent SNPs found unusually frequently. Why this is the case is unclear. We illustrate how neighbouring SNPs that cant be explained by a single mutation event (that we term here sequential dinucleotide mutations, SDMs) are driven by distinct mutational processes and selective pressures to SNPs and multinucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs). By studying variation across multiple populations, including a novel cohort of 1,358 Scottish genomes, we show that, SDMs are over twice as common as MNPs and like SNPs, display distinct mutational spectra across populations. These biases are though not only different to those observed among SNPs and MNPs, but also more divergent between human population groups. We show that the changes that make up SDMs are not independent, and identify a distinct mutational profile, CA [-&gt;] CG [-&gt;] TG, that is observed an order of magnitude more often than other SDMs, including others that involve the gain and subsequent deamination of CpG sites. This suggests these specific changes are driven by a distinct process. In coding regions particular SDMs are favoured, and especially those that lead to the creation of single codon amino acids. Intriguingly selection has favoured particular pathways through the amino acid code, with epistatic selection appearing to have disfavoured sequential non-synonymous changes.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectivesThe occurrence of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their risk assessment in the environment over a decade have become a real concern in various existing water resources. Microbial bioremediation of organic pollutants in wastewater is a key process in both natural and engineered systems. This study aimed to the use of green technology with South African indigenous fungi for the removal of diclofenac from water, which is an environmentally friendly process applied to manage water quality at large.\\n\\nMethodThe fungal growth was optimised in flasks, then the aerated and stationary batch flasks were run for 14 d and samples taken once daily in order to carry out the fungal removal efficiency of the most popular and anti-analgesic anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac sodium (DCF) from water. The five isolate South African indigenous fungal strains (ISAIFS) T. longibrachiatum, T. polyzona, A. niger, M. circinelloides and R. microsporus were then found to have a optimum growth in low nitrogen medium (LN-m) at temperature range of between 26.5{degrees}C to 31.5 {degrees}C and pH around 3 to 4.5.\\n\\nResultsAspergillus niger gave better growth and seemed thermotolerence than others. Glucose supply as well as physicochemical parameters such as pH and temperature have shown to have play a vital role on fungal growth in suspension liquid media. The best DCF degradation result obtained was 95% by R. microsporus in aerated batch flasks after 7 d followed by A. niger with 80% of DCF removal, while the only one white-rot fungi (WRF) of that isolate fungal group, T. polyzona did not give the best DCF elimination as expected for the same period.\\n\\nConclusionFinally, the effectiveness of DCF elimination by each isolate South African indigenous fungal strain (ISAIFS) was found to be better than some traditional methods used in wastewater treatment plants, including: coagulation-flocculation, nitrifying and denitrifying and sewage treatment. These fungal species especially R. microsporus, A. niger and M. circinelloides can be used for the degradation of emerging pollutant in wastewater treatment plants.",

Mir-196a is transcribed from two loci and has been implicated in a wide range of developmental and pathogenic processes, with targets including Hox, Fox, Cdk inhibitors and annexins. Genetic variants and altered expression of miR196a are associated with risk and progression of multiple cancers including breast cancer, however little is known about the regulation of the genes encoding this miRNA, nor the impact of variants therein. Here we demonstrate that MIR196A displays complex and dynamic expression patterns, in part controlled by long range transcriptional regulation between promoter and enhancer elements bound by ER. Expression of this miRNA is significantly increased in models of hormone receptor positive disease resistance. The expression of MIR196A also proves to be a robust prognostic factor for patients with advanced and post-menopausal ER+ disease. This work sheds light on the normal and abnormal regulation of MIR196A and provides a novel stratification method for therapeutically resistant breast cancer.",

Systematic survey of genetic interactions in yeast showed that genes operating in the same biological process have highly correlated genetic interaction profiles, and this observation has been exploited to infer gene function in model organisms. Systematic surveys of digenic perturbations in human cells are also highly informative, but are not scalable, even with CRISPR-mediated methods. As an alternative, we developed an indirect method of deriving functional interactions. We show that genes having correlated knockout fitness profiles across diverse, non-isogenic cell lines are analogous to genes having correlated genetic interaction profiles across isogenic query strains, and similarly implies shared biological function. We constructed a network of genes with correlated fitness profiles across 400 CRISPR knockout screens in cancer cell lines into a \\\"coessentiality network,\\\" with up to 500-fold enrichment for co-functional gene pairs, enabling strong inference of human gene function.

    "abstract": "Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are core spliceosome components and mediate pre-mRNA splicing. During their biogenesis, snRNAs acquire several constitutive nucleotide modifications. Here we show that snRNAs also contain a regulated and reversible nucleotide modification causing them to exist as two different methyl isoforms, m1 and m2, reflecting the methylation state of the adenosine adjacent to the snRNA cap. We find that snRNA biogenesis involves the formation of an initial m1-isoform with a single-methylated adenosine (2-O-methyladenosine, Am), which is then converted to a dimethylated m2-isoform (N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine, m6Am). The relative m1- and m2-isoform levels are determined by the RNA demethylase FTO, which selectively demethylates the m2-isoform. We show FTO is inhibited by endogenous metabolites, resulting in increased m2-snRNA levels. Furthermore, cells that exhibit high m2-snRNA levels show altered patterns of alternative splicing. Together, these data reveal that FTO has a central role in snRNA biogenesis and controls a previously unknown step of snRNA processing involving reversible methylation, thereby providing a potential link between reversible RNA modifications and mRNA splicing.",

Basilisk on the growth and development through germinative characteristics, dry matter yield and physiological composition. Plant growth regulators increased germination and mass yields of plant structures in coated seeds. From the regression estimates, higher germination percentages and root dry mass production were obtained with the use of Plant growth regulators for the initial growth (10.3; 12.8 mL.kg-1 seed, respectively). Leaf and pseudostem mass production had a significant interaction effect between seed type and the use of growth regulator. Coated seeds had greater performance with absence or at lower levels of growth regulators, and embryo quality contributed to the greater formation of plant tissues. More efficient levels (8.85 and 9.57 mL.kg-1 seed) were observed for the yields of plant structures (leaf and pseudostem). Soil N-fertilization resulted in higher dry mass productions of leaf, stem, shoot and root, as well as for root volume. Rates of photoassimilate were increased by soil fertilization and use of plant growth regulators. The use of exogenous hormonal compounds acts on the organogenesis of plant tissues and increases the development of Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesClassical methods for combining summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only use marginal genetic effects and power can be compromised in the presence of heterogeneity. We aim to enhance the discovery of novel associated loci in the presence of heterogeneity of genetic effects in sub-groups defined by an environmental factor.\\n\\nMethodsWe present a p-value Assisted Subset Testing for Associations (pASTA) framework that generalizes the previously proposed association analysis based on subsets (ASSET) method by incorporating gene-environment (G-E) interactions into the testing procedure. We conduct simulation studies and provide two data examples.\\n\\nResultsSimulation studies show that our proposal is more powerful than methods based on marginal associations in the presence of G-E interactions and maintains comparable power even in their absence. Both data examples demonstrate that our method can increase power to detect overall genetic associations and identify novel studies/phenotypes that contribute to the association.\\n\\nConclusionsOur proposed method can be a useful screening tool to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are potentially associated with the trait(s) of interest for further validation. It also allows researchers to determine the most probable subset of traits that exhibit genetic associations in addition to the enhancement of power.",

    "abstract": "The indigenous populations of inner Eurasia, a huge geographic region covering the central Eurasian steppe and the northern Eurasian taiga and tundra, harbor tremendous diversity in their genes, cultures and languages. In this study, we report novel genome-wide data for 763 individuals from Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. We furthermore report genome-wide data of two Eneolithic individuals ({bsim}5,400 years before present) associated with the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan. We find that inner Eurasian populations are structured into three distinct admixture clines stretching between various western and eastern Eurasian ancestries. This genetic separation is well mirrored by geography. The ancient Botai genomes suggest yet another layer of admixture in inner Eurasia that involves Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in Europe, the Upper Paleolithic southern Siberians and East Asians. Admixture modeling of ancient and modern populations suggests an overwriting of this ancient structure in the Altai-Sayan region by migrations of western steppe herders, but partial retaining of this ancient North Eurasian-related cline further to the North. Finally, the genetic structure of Caucasus populations highlights a role of the Caucasus Mountains as a barrier to gene flow and suggests a post-Neolithic gene flow into North Caucasus populations from the steppe.",

However, a better prediction of chronological age implies less opportunity for biological age. Here we used 13,661 samples (from blood and saliva) in the age range of 2 to 104 years from 14 cohorts measured on Illumina HumanMethylation450/EPIC arrays to perform prediction analyses. We show that increasing the sample size achieves a smaller prediction error and higher correlations in test datasets. We demonstrate that smaller prediction errors provide a limit to how much variation in biological ageing can be captured by methylation and provide evidence that age predictors from small samples are prone to confounding by cell composition.

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has major implications. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are generally investigated at the interspecific level, although intraspecific diversity (i.e. within-species diversity) is increasingly perceived as an important ecological facet of biodiversity. Here, we provide a quantitative and integrative synthesis testing, across diverse plant and animal species, whether intraspecific diversity is a major driver of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. We specifically tested (i) whether the number of genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. intraspecific richness) or the specific identity of genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. intraspecific variation) in populations modulate the structure of communities and the functioning of ecosystems, (ii) whether the ecological effects of intraspecific richness and variation are strong in magnitude, and (iii) whether these effects vary among taxonomic groups and ecological responses. We found a non-linear relationship between intraspecific richness and community and ecosystem dynamics that follows a saturating curve shape, as observed for biodiversity-function relationships measured at the interspecific level. Importantly, intraspecific richness modulated ecological dynamics with a magnitude that was equal to that previously reported for interspecific richness. Our results further confirm, based on a database containing more than 50 species, that intraspecific variation also has substantial effects on ecological dynamics. We demonstrated that the effects of intraspecific variation are twice as high as expected by chance, and that they might have been underestimated previously. Finally, we found that the ecological effects of intraspecific variation are not homogeneous and are actually stronger when intraspecific variation is manipulated in primary producers than in consumer species, and when they are measured at the ecosystem rather than at the community level. Overall, we demonstrated that the two facets of intraspecific diversity (richness and variation) can both strongly affect community and ecosystem dynamics, which reveals the pivotal role of within-species biodiversity for understanding ecological dynamics.",

The highest removal rates of suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand was 86%, 75%, 80%, 95% and 84%, respectively. Proteobacteria (average 43.4% of total sequences) and Actinobacteria (19.9%) were the dominant phyla. Numerous genus had obvious differences between influent and effluent water, for instance, 13, 12 and 7 % in effluent water were assigned to the hgcl_clade, Norank_c_Cyanobacteria, and Rhizorhapis, while their relative abundances were decreased to 5, 3 and 0 %. In contrast, a distinct increase among Flavobacterium (10%), Limnohabitans (7%), Alpinimonas (4%), norank_p_Saccharibacteria (4%), Erwinia (3%) after MS-PFI treatment.

However, few study explain the bacteria diversity and its responses between influent and effluent water in a planted floating island. The significance of our study is in identifying-in greater detail-the responses of bacteria in the new MS-PFI. This will greatly enhance our knowledge of bacteria communities, and can be widely used in micro-polluted water remediation.",

    "abstract": "Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) is now a powerful tool in determining atomic structures of biological macromolecules under nearly natural conditions. The major task of single-particle cryoEM is to estimate a set of parameters for each input particle image to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the macromolecules. As future large-scale applications require increasingly higher resolution and automation, robust high-dimensional parameter estimation algorithms need to be developed in the presence of various image qualities. In this paper, we introduced a particle-filter algorithm for cryoEM, which was a sequential Monte Carlo method for robust and fast high-dimensional parameter estimation. The cryoEM parameter estimation problem was described by a probability density function of the estimated parameters. The particle filter uses a set of random and weighted support points to represent such a probability density function. The statistical properties of the support points not only enhance the parameter estimation with self-adaptive accuracy but also provide the belief of estimated parameters, which is essential for the reconstruction phase. The implementation of these features showed strong tolerance to bad particles and enabled robust defocus refinement, demonstrated by the remarkable resolution improvement at the atomic level.",

    "abstract": "Spatially varying selection is a critical driver of adaptive differentiation. Yet, there are few examples where the fitness effects of naturally segregating variants that contribute to local adaptation have been measured in the field. This project investigates the genetic basis of adaption to serpentine soils in Mimulus guttatus. Reciprocal transplant studies show that serpentine and non-serpentine populations of M. guttatus are genetically differentiated in their ability to survive on serpentine soils. We mapped serpentine tolerance by performing a bulk segregant analysis on F2 survivors from a field transplant study and identify a single QTL where individuals that are homozygous for the non-serpentine allele do not survive on serpentine soils. This same QTL controls serpentine tolerance in a second, geographically distant population. A common garden study where the two serpentine populations were grown on each other's soil finds that one of the populations has significantly lower survival on this \\\"foreign\\\" serpentine soil compared to its home soil. So, while these two populations share a major QTL they either differ at other loci involved in serpentine adaptation or have different causal alleles at this QTL. This raises the possibility that serpentine populations may not be broadly tolerant to serpentine soils but may instead be locally adapted to their particular patch. Nevertheless, despite the myriad chemical and physical challenges that plants face in serpentine habitats, adaptation to these soils in M. guttatus has a simple genetic basis.",

    "abstract": "Organisms can affect one anothers phenotypes when they socially interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individuals phenotype is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we estimated variance parameters and the strength of selection at low and high population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring breeding were weak at low, but stronger at high population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than direct differences among-individuals, although the genetic component to these indirect effects was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the estimated effect size was large enough to suggest that indirect genetic effects could alter evolutionary change, resulting in less change at high densities despite stronger selection. Despite the difficulty in estimating them precisely, indirect genetic effects have clear potential to alter evolutionary trajectories in any natural systems where organisms interact.",

However, some lapses could also be caused by exploratory noise: behavioral randomness that facilitates learning in changing environments. If so, strategic processes would need only up-regulate (rather than generate) exploration to adapt to a changing environment. This view predicts that lapse rates should be correlated with flexibility because they share a common cause. We report that when macaques performed a set-shifting task, lapse rates were negatively correlated with perseverative error frequency. Furthermore, chronic exposure to cocaine, which impairs cognitive flexibility, increased perseverative errors, but, surprisingly, improved overall performance by reducing lapse rates. We reconcile these results with a model in which cocaine decreased exploration by deepening attractor basins corresponding to rules. These results support the idea that exploratory noise contributes to lapses, meaning that it affects rule-based decision-making even when it has no strategic value.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe OPRM1 A118G gene variant (N40D) encoding the {micro}-opioid receptor (MOR) has been associated with dependence on opiates and other abused drugs but its mechanism is unknown. With opioid abuse-related deaths rising at unprecedented rates, understanding these mechanisms may provide a path to therapy.\\n\\nMethodsSeven human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from homozygous N40D subjects (4 with N40 and 3 with D40 variants) were generated and human induced neuronal cells (iNs) were derived from these iPS cell lines. Morphological, gene expression as well as synaptic physiology analyses were conducted in human iN cells carrying N40D MOR variants; Two pairs of isogenic pluripotent stem cells carrying N40D were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing and iN cells derived from them were analyzed.\\n\\nResultsInhibitory human neurons generated from subjects carrying N40D MOR gene variants show mature properties in morphological and functional analyses. Gene expression revealed that they express mature neuronal marker and MORs. Activation of MORs suppressed inhibitory synaptic transmission in human neurons carrying both N40 or D40 MOR variants but D40 show stronger effects. To mitigate the confounding effects of background genetic variation on neuronal function, the regulatory effects of MORs on synaptic transmission were validated in two sets of independently generated isogenic N40D iNs.\\n\\nConclusionsActivations of N40D MOR variants show different regulatory effects on synaptic transmission in inhibitory human neurons. This study identifies neurophysiological differences between human MOR variants that may predict altered opioid responsivity and/or dependence in this subset of individuals.",

    "abstract": "All superclasses of retinal neurons display some form of electrical coupling including the key neurons of the inner plexiform layer: bipolar cells (BCs), amacrine or axonal cells (ACs) and ganglion cells (GCs). However, coupling varies extensively by class. For example, mammalian rod bipolar cells form no gap junctions at all, while all cone bipolar cells form class-specific coupling arrays, many of them homocellular in-superclass arrays. Ganglion cells are unique in that classes with coupling predominantly form heterocellular cross-class arrays of ganglion cell::amacrine cell (GC::AC) coupling in the mammalian retina. Ganglion cells are the least frequent superclass in the inner plexiform layer and GC::AC gap junctions are sparsely arrayed amidst massive cohorts of AC::AC, bipolar cell BC::BC, and AC::BC gap junctions. Many of these gap junctions and most ganglion cell gap junctions are suboptical, complicating analysis of specific ganglion cells. High resolution 2 nm TEM analysis of rabbit retinal connectome RC1 allows quantitative GC::AC coupling maps of identified ganglion cells. Ganglion cells classes apparently avoid direct cross-class homocellular coupling altogether even though they have opportunities via direct membrane touches, while transient OFF alpha ganglion cells and transient ON directionally selective (DS) ganglion cells are strongly coupled to distinct amacrine / axonal cell cohorts.\\n\\nA key feature of coupled ganglion cells is intercellular metabolite flux. Most GC::AC coupling involves GABAergic cells ({gamma}+ amacrine cells), which results in significant GABA flux into ganglion cells. Surveying GABA coupling signatures in the ganglion cell layer across species suggests that the majority of vertebrate retinas engage in GC::AC coupling.\\n\\nMulti-hop synaptic queries of the entire RC1 connectome clearly profiles the coupled amacrine and axonal cells. Photic drive polarities and source bipolar cell class selec-tivities are tightly matched across coupled cells. OFF alpha ganglion cells are coupled to OFF {gamma}+ amacrine cells and transient ON DS ganglion cells are coupled to ON {gamma}+ amacrine cells including a large interstitial axonal cell (IAC). Synaptic tabulations show close matches between the classes of bipolar cells sampled by the coupled amacrine and ganglion cells. Further, both ON and OFF coupling ganglion networks show a common theme: synaptic asymmetry whereby the coupled {gamma}+ neurons are also presynaptic to ganglion cell dendrites from different classes of ganglion cells outside the coupled set. In effect, these heterocellular coupling patterns enable an excited ganglion cell to directly inhibit nearby ganglion cells of different classes. Similarly, coupled {gamma}+ amacrine cells engaged in feedback networks can leverage the additional gain of bipolar cell synapses in shaping the signaling of a spectrum of downstream targets based on their own selective coupling with ganglion cells.",

The precise developmental brain changes that account for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalising on a unique longitudinal dataset, that includes in-vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI, we show this transition period is characterised by brain-wide growth in MT, within both gray matter and adjacent juxta-cortical white matter. We show that an expression of common developmental psychiatric risk symptomatology in this otherwise healthy population, specifically compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to regionally specific aberrant unfolding of these MT trajectories. This is most marked in frontal midline structures for compulsivity, and in lateral frontal areas for impulsivity. The findings highlight a brain developmental linkage for emergent psychiatric risk features, evident in regionally specific perturbations in the expansion of MT-related myelination.",

    "abstract": "Conspecific negative density-dependence(CNDD) is one of the main mechanisms proposed to regulate species coexistence. Tropical highland forests, in contrast to diverse lowland forests, are commonly dominated by a few tree species. Testing the importance of density-dependence effects on seedling establishment of dominant trees may provide insights on the mechanisms regulating population dynamics and forest composition of tropical highlands. We tested the importance of CNDD regulation on seedling survival and recruitment of Quercus costaricensis, a monodominant oak in the Talamanca highland forests of Costa Rica. We used spatial statistics and generalized linear mixed models to test the effects of conspecific density, distance to the nearest adult, density of Chusquea bamboo shoots, and herbivory on the annual survival probability of 3538 seedlings between 2014 and 2017. We did not find any effect of CNDD on seedling survival. However, bamboo density and herbivory both significantly decreased seedling survival. All seedlings had signs of herbivory and predator satiation may explain the lack of density dependent regulation in this species. We argue that the lack of intraspecific density regulation at the seedling stage may explain the dominance of Q. costaricensis in the highland forests of Costa Rica. Local density of this endemic oak is instead regulated by herbivory and the density of Chusquea.",

How many are there? What information is available for them? And what features do they share that could explain the gap in our understanding? Efforts to build predictive, whole-cell models of E. coli inevitably face this knowledge gap. We approached these questions systematically by assembling annotations from the knowledge bases EcoCyc, EcoGene, UniProt, RefSeq, and RegulonDB. We identified the genes that lack direct experimental evidence of function (the \\\"y-ome\\\") which include 1563 of 4653 unique genes (34%), of which 131 have absolutely no evidence of function. An additional 304 genes (6.6%) are pseudogenes or phantom genes. y-ome genes tend to have lower expression levels and are enriched in the termination region of the E. coli chromosome. Where evidence is available for y-ome genes, it most often points to them being membrane proteins and transporters. We resolve the misconception that a gene in E. coli whose primary name starts with \\\"y\\\" is unannotated, and we discuss the value of the y-ome for systematic improvement of E. coli knowledge bases and its extension to other organisms.",

    "abstract": "With Aedes aegypti mosquitoes now being released in field programs aimed at disease suppression, there is interest in identifying factors influencing the mating and invasion success of released mosquitoes. One factor that can increase release success is size: released males may benefit competitively from being larger than their field counterparts. However, there could be a risk in releasing only large males if small field females avoid these males and instead prefer small males. Here we investigate this risk by evaluating mating success for mosquitoes differing in size. We measured mating success indirectly by coupling size with Wolbachia-infected or uninfected mosquitoes and scoring cytoplasmic incompatibility as a way of estimating relative mating success. Large females showed no evidence of a mating preference, whereas small males were relatively more successful than large males when mating with small females, exhibiting an advantage of around 20-25%. Because field females typically encompass a wide range of sizes while laboratory reared (and released) males typically fall into a narrow size range of large mosquitoes, these patterns can influence the success of release programs which rely on cytoplasmic incompatibility to suppress populations and initiate replacement invasions. Releases could include some small males generated under low food or crowded conditions to counter this issue, although this would need to be weighed against issues associated with costs of producing males of various size classes.",

    "abstract": "This study is the first to investigate bacterial community associated with live medusa Aurelia sp. in the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea) using both culture independent and culture-based methods. We have analysed bacterial community composition of different body parts of medusa: exumbrella surface, oral arms ( outer body parts) and of gastric cavity ( inner body part) and investigated possible differences in medusa associated bacterial community structure at the time of jellyfish population peak and during senescent phase at the end of bloom, when jellyfish start to decay. Based on 16S rRNA clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, we demonstrated significant difference between bacterial community associated with Aurelia and the ambient seawater bacterial assemblage. Comparing bacterial community composition between different Aurelia medusa body parts, communities differed significantly, especially the one within the gastral cavity. The pronounced difference is dominance of Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderia, Cupriavidus and Achromobacter) in gastral cavity of medusa and Alpha- (Phaeobacter, Ruegeria) and Gamma- proteobacteria (Stenotrophomonas, Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio) on  outer body parts. This suggests that body-part specific bacterial association might have an important functional roles for the host. The results of bacterial isolates showed the dominance of Gammaproeteobacteria, especially Vibrio and Pseudoalteromonas in all body parts. Finally, comparison of medusa associated bacterial community structure, at the time of jellyfish population peak and during senescent phase at the end of bloom showed increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, especially Vibrio. Our results suggest members of Vibrio group are possible commensal opportunistic visitors, later becoming consumer of moribund jellyfish biomass and that the structure of jellyfish bacterial community might be affected by anthropogenic pollution in the marine environment.",

    "abstract": "Introgression is a pervasive biological process, and many statistical methods have been developed to infer its presence from genomic data. However, many of the consequences and genomic signatures of introgression remain unexplored from a methodological standpoint. Here, we develop a model for the timing and direction of introgression based on the multispecies network coalescent, and from it suggest new approaches for testing introgression hypotheses. We suggest two new statistics, D1 and D2, which can be used in conjunction with other information to test hypotheses relating to the timing and direction of introgression, respectively. D1 may find use in evaluating cases of homoploid hybrid speciation, while D2 provides a four-taxon test for polarizing introgression. Although analytical expectations for our statistics require a number of assumptions to be met, we show how simulations can be used to test hypotheses about introgression when these assumptions are violated. We apply the D1 statistic to genomic data from the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus, a proposed example of homoploid hybrid speciation, demonstrating its use as a test of this model. These methods provide new and powerful ways to address questions relating to the timing and direction of introgression.",

In this study, we aim to elucidate the activity of IL-17A in the protection against Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic fungus that causes fatal meningoencephalitis among AIDS patients. For this purpose, we examined if C. neoformans infection triggers IL-17A secretion in the in vitro setting using RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells, and in vivo using wildtype C57BL/6 mice. In addition, an enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) reporter and a knockout (KO) mouse models were used to track the source of IL-17A secretion and explore the protective function of IL-17A, respectively. Our findings showed that both in vivo and in vitro models of C. neoformans infection demonstrated induction of abundant IL-17A secretion. By examining the lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and spleen of the IL-17A- EGFP reporter mice, we showed that intranasal inoculation with C. neoformans promoted leukocytes lung infiltration. A large proportion (~50%) of the infiltrated CD4+ helper T cell population secreted EGFP, indicating vigorous TH17 activity in the C. neoformans-infected lung. The infection study in IL-17A-KO mice, on the other hand, revealed that absence of IL-17A marginally boosted fungal burden in the lung and accelerated the mouse death. Therefore, our data suggest that IL-17A, released predominantly from TH17 cells in vivo, is essential in providing a protective immunity against C. neoformans infection.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a human opportunist pathogen able to infect and kill Drosophila. Previous studies proved that E. faecalis carrying the Fsr quorum sensing system are extremely virulent. Fsr is the regulator of two important virulence factors, gelatinase and serine protease, which cause death of Drosophila adult flies by decreasing its tolerance to infection. The exact mechanism underlying the toxicity of these E. faecalis virulence factors is nevertheless not known, in particular the way they interfere with the host immune response. In the present study, we investigated the influence of Fsr-GelE-SprE bacterial factors on different immunity responses, namely antimicrobial peptide production, phagocytosis and melanization. Using E. faecalis V583 wild type and E. faecalis V583 {Delta}fsrB{Delta}gelE{Delta}sprE mutant we showed that both drosomycin production and phagocytosis were activated to similar levels by the two bacterial strains. However, fly pupae infected with the mutant strain showed less melanization and higher survival rates when compared to pupae infected with wild type bacteria. Using adult flies carrying the PPO1{Delta} PPO2{Delta} mutation, we found that absence of melanization had a different impact in survival of the flies when infected with the two E. faecalis strains. PPO1{Delta}, PPO2{Delta} mutant flies were more tolerant to E. faecalis deprived of its major virulence factors. By showing that the presence of the E. faecalis proteases completely alters the impact of melanization activation on Drosophila tolerance, this study provides new clues on the interactions between E. faecalis virulence factors and the fly{acute}s immune system. Future studies on Drosophila immunity should consider the pathogen genomic content.",

    "abstract": "Over the past years, metagenomics has revolutionized our view of microbial diversity. Moreover, extracting near-complete genomes from metagenomes has led to the discovery of known metabolic traits in unsuspected lineages. Genome-resolved metagenomics relies on assembly of the sequencing reads and subsequent binning of assembled contigs, which might be hampered by strain heterogeneity or low abundance of a target organism. Here we present a complementary approach, metagenome marker gene mining, and use it to assess the global diversity of archaeal methane metabolism through the mcrA gene. To this end, we have screened 18,465 metagenomes for the presence of reads matching a database representative of all known mcrA proteins and reconstructed gene sequences from the matching reads. We use our mcrA dataset to assess the environmental distribution of the Methanomassiliicoccales and reconstruct and analyze a draft genome belonging to the  Lake Pavin cluster, an understudied environmental clade of the Methanomassiliicoccales. Thus, we show that marker gene mining can enhance the discovery power of metagenomics, by identifying novel lineages and aiding selection of targets for in-depth analyses. Marker gene mining is less sensitive to strain heterogeneity and has a lower abundance threshold than genome-resolved metagenomics, as it only requires short contigs and there is no binning step. Additionally, it is computationally cheaper than genome resolved metagenomics, since only a small subset of reads needs to be assembled. It is therefore a suitable approach to extract knowledge from the many publicly available sequencing projects.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory piriform cortex is thought to participate in olfactory associative memory. Like the hippocampus, which is essential for episodic memory, it belongs to an evolutionally conserved paleocortex and comprises a three-layered cortical structure. During slow-wave sleep, the olfactory piriform cortex becomes less responsive to external odor stimuli and instead displays sharp wave (SPW) activity similar to that observed in the hippocampus. Neural activity patterns during hippocampal SPW have been intensively studied in terms of memory consolidation; however, little is known about the activity patterns of olfactory cortical neurons during olfactory cortex sharp waves (OC-SPWs). In this study, we recorded multi-unit neural activities in the anterior piriform cortex in urethane-anesthetized mice. We found that the activity patterns of olfactory cortical neurons during OC-SPWs were non-randomly organized. Individual olfactory cortical neurons varied in the timings of their peak firing rates during OC-SPW events. Moreover, specific pairs of olfactory cortical neurons were more frequently activated together than expected by chance. On the basis of these observations, we speculate that coordinated activation of specific subsets of olfactory cortical neurons repeats during OC-SPWs, thereby facilitating synaptic plasticity underlying the consolidation of olfactory associative memories.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPipelines are a natural tool in bioinformatics applications. Virtually any meaningful processing of biological data involves the execution of multiple software tools, and this execution must be arranged in a coherent manner. Many tools for the building of pipelines were developed over time and used to facilitate work with increasing volume of bioinformatics data. Here we present a flexible and expandable framework for building pipelines, MXP, which we hope will find its own niche in bioinformatics applications.\\n\\nResultsWe developed MXP and tested it on various tasks in our organization, primarily for building pipelines for GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) and post-GWAS analysis. It was proven to be sufficiently flexible and useful.\\n\\nConclusionsMXP implements a number of novel features which, from our point of view, make it to be more suitable and more convenient for building bioinformatics pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a prominent choice for large-scale absolute protein quantification, but its quantification accuracy still has substantial room for improvement. A crucial issue is the bias between the peptide MS intensity and the actual peptide abundance, i.e., the fact that peptides with equal abundance may have different MS intensities. This bias is mainly caused by the diverse physicochemical properties of peptides. Here, we propose a novel algorithm for label-free absolute protein quantification, LFAQ, which can correct the biased MS intensities by using the predicted peptide quantitative factors for all identified peptides. When validated on datasets produced by different MS instruments and data acquisition modes, LFAQ presented accuracy and precision superior to those of existing methods. In particular, it reduced the quantification error by an average of 46% for low-abundance proteins.",

    "abstract": "During Shigella cell invasion, the IpaA effector targets the focal adhesion protein vinculin through three vinculin-binding sites (VBSs). Here, we report that IpaA VBS3 also binds to talin. The 2.5 [A] resolution crystal structure indicates that IpaA VBS3 forms a tightly folded -helical bundle with talin H1-H4, contrasting with bundle unraveling upon vinculin interaction. High-affinity binding of Ipa VBS3 to talin H1-H4 requires a core of hydrophobic residues conserved in vinculin binding and a pair of electrostatic interactions accounting for talin binding specificity. IpaA VBS3 does not bind to talin H1-H5 suggesting the targeting of partially activated stretched talin but not inactive talin. Consistently, IpaA VBS3 labeled filopodial and nascent adhesions and regulated their formation through talin binding. In addition, talin-binding by IpaA VBS3 was required for bacterial capture by filopodia during Shigella invasion and for the stabilization of focal adhesions in infected cells. These findings point to the functional diversity of VBSs and a critical role for talin-binding by Shigella IpaA VBS3 and possibly talin VBSs in the regulation of adhesion structures.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can be transferred via surface touch. To evaluate the transfer rate, traditional single-touch methods require measuring the number of bacteria on donor and recipient surfaces, which is typically characterized by high levels of uncertainty. In this study, two concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were inoculated on a clean thumb. For each set of trials, sequential touches were made between the thumb and each of 30 sterile glass slides, and each slide was placed in a sterile petri dish. The transferred bacteria on each slide were directly cultured in situ, and the colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. The bacterial contact transfer rate was calculated by fitting the series of CFUs with the formula established. The average transfer rate was 12.9% under these conditions. The goodness of fit was compared in terms of the number of slides used in a set of trials and the number of CFUs counted on the slides. The use of more slides in a set of trials allowed more accurate evaluation of the transfer rate. The use of fewer than 20 slides was unacceptable. The high density of CFUs on the slides made counting them difficult, but if fewer than five CFUs were counted in a set of trials, the fit would be significantly influenced. To further evaluate the method, the dermal resident microflora on the thumb were also used to perform contact transfer tests. No statistically significant difference was found in the estimated transfer rate between the standard strain and the resident microflora.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEDiseases can be transferred indoors via the surface route because bacteria and viruses can be transferred to and from the hands when a fomite is touched. Various methods have been used to estimate the bacterial contact transfer rate between hands and surfaces. Evaluated transfer rates have had significant deviations and varied significantly across studies, partially due to the use of the single hand-surface touch method, inefficient hand/surface sampling, and complicated bacteria culture.\\n\\nIn this study, the bacterial contact transfer rate was evaluated with a new method involving sequential touches between a donor and a series of recipients. The bacteria on the recipients were cultured in situ without hand/surface sampling, which simplified the process of surface bacteria quantification. The new method significantly reduces experimental complexity, decreases random errors in the data, and provides a new method for understanding microbial transfers between surfaces.",

    "abstract": "The discovery that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize lanthanides as catalysts for methanol metabolism has opened new areas of biology and biochemistry. Recent studies of lanthanide-dependent enzymes have focused on biochemical and kinetic properties or the regulation of encoding genes. Kinetic analysis of a pyrroloquinoline quinone methanol dehydrogenase, XoxF1 (MexAM1_1746), from the model methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 confirms the use of different lanthanides as cofactors and formaldehyde as a product of methanol oxidation, showing that not all XoxF MDH produce formate as the only end product in vivo. The dephosphotetrahydromethanopterin pathway for formaldehyde oxidation is still required for lanthanide-methylotrophic growth, as a fae mutant does not grow with methanol in the presence of exogenous lanthanides. Increases of 15-22% in growth rate and 10-12.5% in growth yield are observed when M. extorquens AM1 is grown in the presence of lanthanides with methanol. RNA-sequencing transcriptomics indicates remodeling of methanol, formaldehyde and formate oxidation gene expression, and targeted metabolomics shows increased accumulation of intracellular formate and decreased pools of several assimilatory intermediates. Methanol sensitivity growth assays show that the lanthanide-dependent pyrroloquinoline quinone alcohol dehydrogenase ExaF (MexAM1_1139), but not XoxF1, can reduce formaldehyde toxicity when lanthanides are present, providing evidence of a role for ExaF during lanthanide-dependent methylotrophy. We conclude from these results that lanthanide-dependent methylotrophy is more efficient than calcium-dependent methylotrophy in M. extorquens AM1, and that this change is due, at least in part, to the lanthanide-dependent enzymes XoxF1 and ExaF.\\n\\nIMPORTANCELanthanides serve as cofactors for pyrroloquinoline quinone containing alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes in methylotrophic bacteria. The present study addresses a fundamental gap in our understanding of how lanthanides impact metabolism, including a detailed assessment of the metabolic modifications to accommodate enhanced efficiency during methylotrophy. Kinetic characterization of XoxF1 provides a detailed description of the impact of diverse lanthanides on catalytic function for a lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase. We further show that the lanthanide-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase ExaF can oxidize formaldehyde in vivo, revealing complementary roles for these enzymes. This study provides novel insight into the effects of lanthanides on bacterial metabolism, highlighting the implementation of multiple, redundant and complementary oxidation systems.",

    "abstract": "Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane bound cytosolic enzyme that is known to regulate the uptake of calcium into the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that SERCA can also regulate paramyxovirus [Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)] replication. Treatment of Vero cells with SERCA specific inhibitor (Thapsigargin) at a concentration that is nontoxic to the cells significantly reduced virus replication. Conversely, overexpression of SERCA rescued the inhibitory effect of Thapsigargin on virus replication. PPRV/NDV infection induced SERCA expression in Vero cells which could be blocked by Thapsigargin. With the help of time-of-addition and virus step-specific assays, it was observed that Thapsigargin specifically inhibits viral entry and subcellular localization of the viral proteins. Furthermore, NDV, but not PPRV acquired a significant resistance to Thapsigargin on long-term passage (P=70) in Vero cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing virus supportive role of SERCA and a rare report suggesting that viruses may acquire resistance even in the presence of an inhibitor that targets a cellular factor. This study will contribute in understanding paramyxovirus replication and development of antiviral therapeutics using SERCA (host factor) as a candidate drug target.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which specific anaerobic microorganisms remain firmly attached to lignocellulosic material allowing them to efficiently decompose the organic matter are far to be elucidated. To circumvent this issue, the microbiomes collected from anaerobic digesters treating pig manure and meadow grass were fractionated to separate the planktonic microbes from those adhered to lignocellulosic substrate. Assembly of shotgun reads followed by binning process recovered 151 population genomes, 80 out of which were completely new and were not previously deposited in any database. Genome coverage allowed the identification of microbial spatial distribution into the engineered ecosystem. Moreover, a composite bioinformatic analysis using multiple databases for functional annotation revealed that uncultured members of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes follow diverse metabolic strategies for polysaccharide degradation. The structure of cellulosome in Firmicutes can vary depending on the number and functional roles of carbohydrate-binding modules. On contrary, members of Bacteroidetes are able to adhere and degrade lignocellulose due to the presence of multiple carbohydrate-binding family 6 modules in beta-xylosidase and endoglucanase proteins or S-layer homology modules in unknown proteins. This study combines the concept of variability in spatial distribution with genome-centric metagenomics allowing a functional and taxonomical exploration of the biogas microbiome.\\n\\nImportanceThis work contributes new knowledge about lignocellulose degradation in engineered ecosystems. Specifically, the combination of the spatial distribution of uncultured microbes with genome-centric metagenomics provides novel insights into the metabolic properties of planktonic and firmly attached to plant biomass bacteria. Moreover, the knowledge obtained in this study enabled us to understand the diverse metabolic strategies for polysaccharide degradation in different species of Bacteroidetes and Clostridiales. Even though structural elements of cellulosome were restricted to Clostridiales, our study identified in Bacteroidetes a putative mechanism for biomass decomposition based on a gene cluster responsible for cellulose degradation, disaccharide cleavage to glucose and transport to cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Extensive 5 untranslated regions (UTR) are a hallmark of transcripts determining hyphal morphogenesis in Candida albicans. The major transcripts of the EFG1 gene, which are responsible for cellular morphogenesis and metabolism, contain a 5 UTR of up to 1170 nt. Deletion analyses of the 5 UTR revealed a 218 nt sequence that is required for production of the Efg1 protein and its functions in filamentation, without lowering the level and integrity of the EFG1 transcript. Polysomal analyses revealed that the 218 nt 5 UTR sequence is required for efficient translation of the Efg1 protein. Replacement of the EFG1 ORF by the heterologous reporter gene CaCBGluc confirmed the positive regulatory importance of the identified 5 UTR sequence. In contrast to other reported transcripts containing extensive 5 UTR sequences, these results indicate the positive translational function of the 5 UTR sequence in the EFG1 transcript, which is observed in context of the native EFG1 promoter. The results suggest that the 5 UTR recruits regulatory factors, possibly during emergence of the native transcript, which aid in translation of the EFG1 transcript.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMany of the virulence traits that make Candida albicans an important human fungal pathogen are regulated on a transcriptional level. Here we report an important regulatory contribution of translation, which is exerted by the extensive 5 untranslated regulatory sequence (5 UTR) of the transcript for the protein Efg1, which determines growth, metabolism and filamentation in the fungus. Presence of the 5 UTR is required for efficient translation of Efg1, to promote filamentation. Because transcripts for many relevant regulators contain extensive 5 UTR sequences, it appears that virulence of C. albicans depends on the combination of transcriptional and translation regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience studies of human decision-making abilities commonly involve sub-jects completing a decision-making task while BOLD signals are recorded using fMRI. Hypotheses are tested about which brain regions mediate the effect of past experience, such as rewards, on future actions. One standard approach to this is model-based fMRI data analysis, in which a model is fitted to the behavioral data, i.e., a subjects choices, and then the neural data are parsed to find brain regions whose BOLD signals are related to the models internal signals. However, the internal mechanics of such purely behavioral models are not constrained by the neural data, and therefore might miss or mischaracterize aspects of the brain. To address this limitation, we introduce a new method using recurrent neural network models that are flexible enough to be jointly fitted to the behavioral and neural data. We trained a model so that its internal states were suitably related to neural activity during the task, while at the same time its output predicted the next action a subject would execute. We then used the fitted model to create a novel visualization of the relationship between the activity in brain regions at different times following a reward and the choices the subject subsequently made. Finally, we validated our method using a previously published dataset. We found that the model was able to recover the underlying neural substrates that were discovered by explicit model engineering in the previous work, and also derived new results regarding the temporal pattern of brain activity.",

    "abstract": "The significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in many biological processes and diseases has gained intense interests over the past several years. However, computational identification of lncRNAs in a wide range of species remains challenging; it requires prior knowledge of well-established sequences and annotations or species-specific training data, but the reality is that only a limited number of species have high-quality sequences and annotations. Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (>90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs. Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.",

    "abstract": "Osmolytes mechanism of protecting proteins against denaturation is a longstanding puzzle, further complicated by the complex diversities inherent in protein sequences. An emergent approach in understanding osmolytes mechanism of action towards biopolymer has been to investigate osmolytes interplay with hydrophobic interaction, the major driving force of protein folding. However, the crucial question is whether all these protein-stabilizing osmolytes display a single unified mechanism towards hydrophobic interactions. By simulating the hydrophobic collapse of a macromolecule in aqueous solutions of two such osmoprotectants, Glycine and Trimethyl N-oxide (TMAO), both of which are known to stabilize proteins folded conformation, we here demonstrate that these two osmolytes can impart mutually contrasting effects towards hydrophobic interaction. While TMAO preserves its protectant nature across diverse range of polymer-osmolyte interactions, glycine is found to display an interesting cross-over from being a protectant at weaker polymer-osmolyte interaction to a denaturant of hydrophobicity at stronger polymer-osmolyte interactions. A preferential-interaction analysis reveals that a subtle balance of conformation-dependent exclusion/binding of osmolyte molecules from/to the macromolecule holds the key to overall heterogenous behavior. Specifically, TMAOs consistent stabilization of collapsed configuration of macromolecule is found to be a result of TMAOs preferential binding to polymer via hydrophobic methyl groups. However, polar Glycines cross-over from being a protectant to denaturant across polymer-osmolyte interaction is rooted in its switch from preferential exclusion to preferential binding to the polymer with increasing interaction. Overall, by highlighting the complex interplay of osmolytes with hydrophobic interaction, this work puts forward the necessity of quantitative categorization of osmolytes action in protein.",

TLR4 dimerization induces the activation of NF-kB and IRF3 through MyD88- or TRIF-dependent pathways. Saquinavir (SQV), a FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor, has been shown to suppress the activation of NF-kB induced by HMGB1 by blocking TLR4-MyD88 association in proteasome-independent pathway. However, it remains nknown whether SQV is a HMGB1-specific and MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling inhibitor and which precise signaling element of TLR4 is targeted by SQV. Our results showed that SQV inhibits both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways in response to LPS, a critical sepsis inducer and TLR4 agonist, leading to downregulation of NF-kB and IRF3. SQV did not suppress MyD88-dependent pathway triggered by TLR1/2 agonist Pam3csk4. In the only TRIF-dependent pathway, SQV did not attenuate IRF3 activation induced by TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C). Furthermore, dimerization of TLR4 induced by LPS and HMGB1 was decreased by SQV. These results suggest that TLR4 receptor complex is the molecular target of SQV and shed light on that TLR4-mediated inmune responses and consequent risk for uncontrolled inflammation could be modulated by FDA-approved drug SQV.",

While such a test may be applicable when investigating specific regions and prior information about directionality is present, we argue here that it is often mis-applied, with severe consequences for false positive rate (FPR) control. Conceptually, a pair of one-sided t-tests conducted in tandem (e.g., to test separately for both positive and negative effects), effectively amounts to a two-sided t-test. However, replacing the two-sided test with a pair of one-sided tests without multiple comparisons correction essentially doubles the intended FPR of statements made about the same study; that is, the actual family-wise error (FWE) of results at the whole brain level would be 10% instead of the 5% intended by the researcher. Therefore, we strongly recommend that, unless otherwise explicitly justified, two-sided t-tests be applied instead of two simultaneous one-sided t-tests.",

    "abstract": "Assembly of bacterial short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data frequently results in hundreds of contigs for which the origin, plasmid or chromosome, is unclear. Long-read sequencing has emerged as a solution to resolve plasmid structures and to obtain complete genomes for most bacterial species. This information can be used to generate and label datasets from short-read based contigs as plasmid- or chromosome-derived. We investigated the use of several popular machine learning methods to classify short-read contigs with known plasmid- or chromosome-origin from Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli using pentamer frequencies. Based on resulting F1-scores we selected support-vector machine (SVM) models as best classifier for all three bacterial species (F1-score E. faecium = 0.94, F1-score K. pneumoniae = 0.90, F1-score E. coli = 0.76), which outperformed other existing plasmid tools using an independent set of isolates (precision E. faecium = 0.92, precision K. pneumoniae = 0.86, precision E. coli = 0.82). We demonstrated the scalability of our model by accurately predicting the plasmidome of a large collection of 1,644 E. faecium isolates with only short-read WGS available using a standard laptop with a single core. A low number of false positive predicted sequences suggests that the assignment of a particular gene of interest as plasmid- or chromosome-encoded by the models is plausible. The SVM classifiers are publicly available as a new R package called  mlplasmids at https://gitlab.com/sirarredondo/mlplasmids under the GNU General Public License v3.0. We additionally developed a graphical-user interface using the Shiny package which can be accessed at https://sarredondo.shinyapps.io/mlplasmids/. Single genomes can easily be predicted by uploading genome assemblies. We anticipate that this tool may significantly facilitate research on the dissemination of plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance and/or contributing to host adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant and successful efforts in Brazil regarding snakebites in the areas of research, antivenom manufacture and quality control, training of health professionals in the diagnosis and clinical management of bites, little is known about determinants of snakebites incidence in order to further plan interventions to reduce the impact of this medical condition. Understanding the complexity of ecological interactions in a geographical region is important for prediction, prevention and control measures of snakebites. The aim of this investigation is to describe spatial distribution and identify environmental determinants of human- lancehead pit vipers (Bothrops genus) contact resulting in injuries, in the Brazilian Amazon. Aggregated data by municipality was used to analyze the spatial distribution of Bothrops bites cases and its relationship with geographic and environmental factors. Eight geo-environmental factors were included in the analysis as independent variables: (1) tree canopy loss increase; (2) area with vegetation cover; (3) area covered by water bodies; (4) altitude; (5) precipitation; (6) air relative humidity; (7) soil moisture; and (8) air temperature. Human- lancehead pit vipers (Bothrops genus) contact resulting in envenomings in the Amazon region is more incident in lowlands [-0.0006827 (IC95%: -0.0007705; - 0.0005949), p<0.0001], with high preserved original vegetation cover [0.0065439 (IC95%: 0.0070757; 0.0060121), p<0.0001], with heaviest rainfall [0.0000976 (IC95%: 0.0000925; 0.0001026), p<0.0001] and higher air relative humidity [- 0.0081773 (IC95%: -0.0107681; -0.0055865), p<0.0001].

The aim of this study is to describe spatial distribution and identify environmental determinants of human- lancehead pit vipers (Bothrops genus) contact resulting in injuries, in the Brazilian Amazon. An increase in the forest productivity with a higher availability of some types of prey, such as frogs and amphibians, anurans and lizards, was suggested as a cause for the higher snake abundance in the rainy season. Probably due to the higher forest productivity and abundance of pit vipers in such landscapes, human-lancehead pit vipers contact resulting in envenomings in the Amazon region is more incident in lowlands, with high preserved original vegetation cover, with heaviest rainfall and higher air relative humidity.",

    "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) targets the LDL receptor (LDLR) for degradation, increasing plasma LDL and, consequently, cardiovascular risk. Uptake of secreted PCSK9 is required for its predominant effect on the LDLR. LDL itself inhibits this uptake, though the mechanism by which it does so remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between LDL, the PCSK9:LDLR interaction, and PCSK9 uptake. We show that LDL inhibits binding of PCSK9 to the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR in vitro more impressively than it inhibits PCSK9 uptake in cells. Furthermore, a cell-based factor responsive to heparin-targeting treatments can explain this difference, consistent with its identity as a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), a known co-receptor for PCSK9. Furthermore, we show that the entire PCSK9 prodomain, but not truncated variants, rescues PCSK9 uptake in the presence of LDL, suggesting that PCSK9:LDL binding requires the entire prodomain. Additionally, we show that the gain-of-function (GOF) PCSK9 variant S127R has increased affinity for heparin-like molecules such as HSPGs, potentially explaining the biochemical basis for its phenotype. Overall, our findings suggest a model where PCSK9, LDL, and HSPGs all interact to regulate PCSK9 uptake into the hepatocyte.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is commonly used for cancer therapy, although its efficacy is reduced in hypoxic regions of tumours. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emergent, non-invasive imaging technique that allows the measurement of blood oxygen saturation (sO2) which inversely correlates with hypoxia in tissue. The potential use of PAI as a prognostic tool for radiotherapy outcome was investigated in a head and neck cancer model in vivo. PAI was performed before delivering a single fraction (10, 20 or 30 Gy) treatment. The results show that tumours with pre-treatment higher blood sO2 responded better than those with lower levels in the 10 and 20 Gy groups. For the 30 Gy group, treatment response was independent of blood sO2. The haemoglobin content of the tumours was not correlated with their response to any of the radiation doses studied. Changes in sO2, monitored at 24 h and 96 h following 10 and 20 Gy doses, showed that tumours that were subsequently unresponsive to treatment had an increase in blood sO2 at both time points compared to those which subsequently regressed after radiotherapy. The results suggest that sO2 values measured by photoacoustic imaging can be used before, and shortly after, irradiation to predict subsequent treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasite genes exhibit variation in both sequence and expression level. There is much information on sequence polymorphism, but less resolution on natural variation in transcriptomes of parasites at specific developmental stages. This is largely because it is challenging to obtain highly replicated sampling of transcriptomes to overcome potentially confounding technical and biological variation. We address the issue in the major human parasite Plasmodium falciparum by obtaining RNA-seq profiles of multiple independent replicate preparations of mature schizont-stage parasites from a panel of clinical isolates recently established in culture and from long-term laboratory-adapted clones. With a goal of robustly identifying variably expressed genes, we show that increasing the numbers of biological sample replicates greatly improves the discovery rate. Generally, six independent replicates of each parasite culture is recommendable as being significantly to lower numbers, although for highly expressed genes variable expression can be detected when fewer replicates are available. A broad comparison identifies genes differing in relative expression between cultured clinical isolates and laboratory-adapted clones. Genes more highly expressed in the laboratory-adapted clones include an AP2 transcription factor gene Pf3D7_0420300 and putative methyl transferase genes. The variable expression of several known merozoite invasion ligands is confirmed, and previously uncharacterised genes are shown to be differentially expressed among clinical isolates. New RT-qPCR assays validate the variation in transcript levels of these genes, and allow quantitation of expression to be extended to a wider panel of clinical isolate samples. These variably expressed genes are new candidates for investigation as potential determinants of alternative parasite developmental pathways or targets of immunity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding parasite diversity and adaptation may require characterisation of gene expression variation, and is vital if chemotherapeutic or vaccine development is to consider new candidate targets, but it is technically challenging to generate precise data on clinical isolates. Here, we analyse the transcriptomes of mature Plasmodium falciparum schizonts using RNA-sequencing, using large numbers of biological replicate samples to minimise the impact of inter-replicate variation on observed patterns of differential expression. This identifies genes that are differentially expressed in long term laboratory-adapted parasites and recently cultured clinical isolates, as well as among different clinical isolates. In additional samples of schizonts grown in the first cycle ex vivo prior to any erythrocyte invasion, expression levels of a selected panel of these genes vary among isolates, but mean levels are similar to those in the continuously cultured clinical isolates, indicating that the latter are useful for experimental studies requiring biological replication.",
