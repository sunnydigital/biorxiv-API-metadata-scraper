    "abstract": "To understand the gene regulation of an organism of interest, a comprehensive genome annotation is essential. While some features, such as coding sequences, can be computationally predicted with high accuracy based purely on the genomic sequence, others, such as promoter elements or non-coding RNAs are harder to detect. RNA-Seq has proven to be an efficient method to identify these genomic features and to improve genome annotations. However, processing and integrating RNA-Seq data in order to generate high-resolution annotations is challenging, time consuming and requires numerous different steps. We have constructed a powerful and modular tool called ANNOgesic that provides the required analyses and simplifies RNA-Seq-based bacterial and archaeal genome annotation. It can integrate data from conventional RNA-Seq and dRNA-Seq, predicts and annotates numerous features, including small non-coding RNAs, with high precision. The software is available under an open source license (ISCL) at https://pypi.org/project/ANNOgesic/.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is believed to subserve the baseline mental activity in humans. Its highest energy consumption compared to other brain networks and its intimate coupling with conscious awareness are both pointing to an overarching function. Many research streams speak in favor of an evolutionarily adaptive role in envisioning experience to anticipate the future. In the present work, we propose a process model that tries to explain how the DMN may implement continuous evaluation and prediction of the environment to guide behavior. Specifically, we answer the question whether the neurobiological properties of the DMN collectively provide the computational building blocks necessary for a Markov Decision Process. We argue that our formal account of DMN function naturally accommodates as special cases previous interpretations based on (1) predictive coding, (2) semantic associations, and (3) a sentinel role. Moreover, this process model for the neural optimization of complex behavior in the DMN offers parsimonious explanations for recent experimental findings in animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a critical cytokine regulating hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation into the megakaryocytic lineage. However, the transcriptional and chromatin dynamics elicited by TPO signaling are poorly understood. Here, we study the immediate early transcriptional and cis-regulatory responses to TPO in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and use this paradigm of cytokine signaling to chromatin to dissect the relation between cis-regulatory activity and chromatin architecture. We show that TPO profoundly alters the transcriptome of HSPCs, with key hematopoietic regulators being transcriptionally repressed within 30 minutes of TPO. By examining cis-regulatory dynamics and chromatin architectures, we demonstrate that these changes are accompanied by rapid and extensive epigenome remodeling of cis-regulatory landscapes that is spatially coordinated within topologically associating domains (TADs). Moreover, TPO-responsive enhancers are spatially clustered and engage in preferential homotypic intra- and inter-TAD interactions that are largely refractory to TPO signaling. By further examining the link between cis-regulatory dynamics and chromatin looping, we show that rapid modulation of cis-regulatory activity is largely independent of chromatin looping dynamics. Finally, we show that, although activated and repressed cis-regulatory elements share remarkably similar DNA sequence compositions, transcription factor binding patterns accurately predict rapid cis-regulatory responses to TPO.",

    "abstract": "Structures built by animals, such as nests, often can be considered extended phenotypes that facilitate the study of animal behaviour. For rodents, nest building is both an important form of behavioural thermoregulation and a critical component of parental care. Changes in nest structure or the prioritization of nesting behaviour are therefore likely to have consequences for survival and reproduction, and both biotic and abiotic environmental factors are likely to influence the adaptive value of such differences. Here we first develop a novel assay to investigate interspecific variation in the nesting behaviour of deer mice (genus Peromyscus). Using this assay, we find that, while there is some variation in the complexity of the nests built by Peromyscus mice, differences in the latency to begin nest construction are more striking. Four of the seven taxa examined here build nests within an hour of being given nesting material, but this latency to nest is not related to ultimate differences in nest structure, suggesting that the ability to nest is relatively conserved within the genus, but species differ in their prioritization of nesting behaviour. We also find that latency to nest is not correlated with body size, climate, or the construction of burrows that create microclimates. However, the four taxa with short nesting latencies all have monogamous mating systems, suggesting that differences in nesting latency may be related to social environment. This detailed characterization of nesting behaviour within the genus provides an important foundation for future studies of the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of behaviour.",

Surrogate sire technology allows the creation of males that lack their own germline cells, but have transplanted spermatogonial stem cells from donor males. With this technology, a single elite male donor could give rise to huge numbers of progeny, potentially as much as all the production animals in a particular time period.\\n\\nOne hundred replicates of various scenarios were performed. Scenarios followed a common overall structure but differed in the strategy used to identify elite donors and how these donors were used in the product development part.\\n\\nThe results of this study showed that using surrogate sire technology would significantly increase the genetic merit of commercial sires, by as much as 6.5 to 9.2 years worth of genetic gain compared to a conventional breeding program. The simulations suggested that a strategy involving three stages (an initial genomic test followed by two subsequent progeny tests) was the most effective of all the strategies tested.\\n\\nThe use of one or a handful of elite donors to generate the production animals would be very different to current practice. While the results demonstrate the great potential of surrogate sire technology there are considerable risks but also other opportunities. Practical implementation of surrogate sire technology would need to account for these.",

To understand this feat, one has to fathom two main characteristics of multicellular organisms: differentiation and self-organization. Any explanation concerning this major transition should involve mechanisms that can simultaneously explain the marvellous intricacies manifest in the aforementioned characteristics, and an account of the evolution of such traits. Here we propose a noise-driven differentiation (NDD) model. The reliance on noise, in place of a more mechanistic approach, makes the NDD model a more suitable approach to explain differentiation and self-organization. Furthermore, our model sheds some light on the possible evolutionary origins of these biological innovations. To test the NDD model, we utilize a model of cell aggregation. The behavior of this model of cell aggregation is in concert with the NDD model.",

    "abstract": "The major hallmark of cancer cells is uncontrollable growth on soft matrices (transformed growth), which indicates that they have lost the ability to properly sense the rigidity of their surroundings. Recent studies of fibroblasts show that local contractions by cytoskeletal rigidity sensor units block growth on soft surfaces and their depletion causes transformed growth. The contractile system involves many cytoskeletal proteins that must be correctly assembled for proper rigidity sensing. We tested the hypothesis that cancer cells lack rigidity sensing due to their inability to assemble contractile units because of altered cytoskeletal protein levels. In four widely different cancers, there were over ten-fold fewer rigidity-sensing contractions compared with normal fibroblasts. Restoring normal levels of cytoskeletal proteins restored rigidity sensing and rigidity-dependent growth in transformed cells. Most commonly, this involved restoring balanced levels of the tropomyosins 2.1 (often depleted by miR-21) and 3 (often overexpressed). Restored cells could be transformed again by depleting other cytoskeletal proteins including myosin IIA. Thus, the depletion of rigidity sensing modules enables growth on soft surfaces and many different perturbations of cytoskeletal proteins can disrupt rigidity sensing thereby causing transformed growth of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Despite the abundance of large-scale molecular and drug-response data, the insights gained about the mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy in cancer has been in general limited. Machine learning algorithms applied to those datasets most often are used to provide predictions without interpretation, or reveal single drug-gene association and fail to derive robust insights. We propose to use Macau, a bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the interactions between the drug targets and signaling pathways activation. A typical insight would be: \\\"Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X\\\". We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using gene expression of 990 cancer cell lines, activity scores of 11 signaling pathways derived from the tool PROGENy as cell line input and 228 nominal targets for 265 drugs as drug input. These interactions can guide a tissue-specific combination treatment strategy, for example suggesting to modulate a certain pathway to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues. Such an analysis of interactions across tissues might help target discovery, drug repurposing and patient stratification strategies.",

What computational purpose does this transformation serve? We propose that the PN-KC network implements an online clustering algorithm which we derive from the k-means cost function. The vector of PN-KC synaptic weights converging onto a given KC represents the corresponding cluster centroid. KC activities represent attribution indices, i.e. the degree to which a given odor presentation is attributed to each cluster. Remarkably, such clustering view of the PN-KC circuit naturally accounts for several of its salient features. First, attribution indices are nonnegative thus rationalizing rectification in KCs. Second, the constraint on the total sum of attribution indices for each presentation is enforced by a Lagrange multiplier identified with the activity of a single inhibitory interneuron reciprocally connected with KCs. Third, the soft-clustering version of our algorithm reproduces observed sparsity and overcompleteness of the KC representation which may optimize supervised classification downstream.",

Despite its importance and widespread use, large-scale mutation screening remains time-consuming, labour-intensive and costly. Here, we describe a cheap, practicable and high-throughput screening strategy that allows parallel screening of 96 x N (N denotes the number of targets) genome-modified sites. The strategy simplified and streamlined the process of next-generation sequencing (NGS) library construction by fixing the bridge sequences and barcoding primers. We also developed Hi-TOM (available at http://www.hi-tom.net/hi-tom/), an online tool to track the mutations with precise percentage. Analysis of the samples from rice, hexaploid wheat and human cells reveals that the Hi-TOM tool has high reliability and sensitivity in tracking various mutations, especially complex chimeric mutations that frequently induced by genome editing. Hi-TOM does not require specially design of barcode primers, cumbersome parameter configuration or additional data analysis. Thus, the streamlined NGS library construction and comprehensive result output make Hi-TOM particularly suitable for high-throughput identification of all types of mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas systems.",

Here, we performed in vivo clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification, and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.",

In this study, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of the developmental sequence on a macroevolutionary scale using the teleost.

The phylogenetic comparisons of these sequences revealed event-dependent heterogeneity in the frequency of sequence changes. Most of the sequence changes occurred as exchanges of temporally neighboring events. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that the ancestral species had experienced frequent changes in developmental sequences. Although the analyses showed that these heterochronic changes accumulated along phylogenic time, the precise distribution of the changes over the teleost phylogeny remains unclear due to technical limitations. Finally, this first comprehensive analysis of teleost developmental sequences will provide solid ground on which to elucidate the significance of developmental timing in animal morphological diversification.",

In contrast, the central axis of motor and nonmotor macroscale organization in the cerebellum remains unknown. Here we applied diffusion map embedding to resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project dataset (n=1003), and show for the first time that cerebellar functional regions follow a gradual organization which progresses from primary (motor) to transmodal (DMN, task-unfocused) regions. A secondary axis extends from task-unfocused to task-focused processing. Further, these two principal gradients reveal functional properties of the well-established cerebellar double motor representation, and its relationship with the recently described triple nonmotor representation. These interpretations are further supported by data-driven clustering and cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity analyses. Importantly, these descriptions remain observable at the individual subject level. These findings, from an exceptionally large and high-quality dataset, provide new and fundamental insights into the functional organization of the human cerebellum, unmask new testable hypotheses for future studies, and yield an unprecedented tool for the topographical, macroscale interpretation of cerebellar findings.",

However, the success rate (i.e., radiographic union at six months after ESWT) is only approximately 75%. Detailed knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms that induce bio-calcification after ESWT is limited. The aim of the present study was to analyze the biological response within mineralized tissue of a new invertebrate model organism, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, after exposure with extracorporeal shock waves (ESWs). Mussels were exposed to ESWs with positive energy density of 0.4 mJ/mm2 or were sham exposed. Detection of newly calcified tissue was performed by concomitantly exposing the mussels to fluorescent markers. Two weeks later, the fluorescence signal intensity of the valves was measured. Mussels exposed to ESWs showed a statistically significantly higher mean fluorescence signal intensity within the shell zone than mussels that were sham exposed. Additional acoustic measurements revealed that the increased mean fluorescence signal intensity within the shell of those mussels that were exposed to ESWs was independent of the size and position of the focal point of the ESWs. These data demonstrate that induction of bio-calcification after ESWT may not be restricted to the region of direct energy transfer of ESWs into calcified tissue. The results of the present study are of relevance for better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that induce formation of new mineralized tissue after ESWT. Specifically, bio-calcification following ESWT may extend beyond the direct area of treatment.\\n\\nSummary statementThe use of zebra mussels in research on extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) therapy for fracture nonunions allows new insights into the complex process of induction of biomineralization by ESWs.",

However, no comprehensive model linking all these aspects of its physiology and behavior has been constructed and tested experimentally.

We experimentally validate the hypothesized adaptive flagellar photoresponse using high spatio-temporal resolution methodology on immobilized cells, and corroborate the predicted reorientation dynamics of phototactic swimmers using 3D-tracking of free-swimming cells. Finally, we reconfirm, both theoretically and experimentally, that the adaptive nature of the response has peak fidelity at a frequency of about 1.6 Hz, corresponding to the rotation frequency of the cell body.",

    "abstract": "Double strand breaks in the DNA backbone are the most lethal type of defect that can be induced in the cell nucleus by chemical and radiation treatments of cancer. However, little is known about the potentially large differences in the outcomes of damage between free and nucleosomal DNA, leading to corresponding differences in damage repair capability. We performed microsecond-length molecular dynamics computer simulations of nucleosomes including double-strand breaks (DSB) at various sites, to characterize the early stages of the evolution of this important DNA lesion right after its formation. We find that all DSB configurations tend to remain compact, with only the terminal bases interacting with histone proteins; the interacting molecular structures are studied by looking at the essential dynamics of the relevant DNA and histone fragments, and compared to the intact nucleosome, thus exposing key features of the interactions. Moreover, we show that the broken DNA ends at the DSB must overcome a free-energy barrier to detach from the nucleosome core, as measured by means of umbrella sampling of the potential of mean force. Finally, by using state-of-the-art calculation of the covariant mechanical stress at the molecular scale, we demonstrate that, depending on the DNA-core separation distance, the coupled bending and torsional stress stored in the detached DNA can force the free end to either stick back to the nucleosome core surface, or to open up straight, thus making it accessible to damage signalization proteins.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced sampling methods, such as forward flux sampling (FFS), have great capacity for accelerating stochastic simulations of nonequilibrium biochemical systems involving rare events. However, the description of the tradeoffs between simulation efficiency and error in FFS remains incomplete. We present a novel and mathematically rigorous analysis of the errors in FFS that, for the first time, covers the contribution of every phase of the simulation. We derive a closed form expression for the optimally efficient count of samples to take in each FFS phase in terms of a fixed constraint on sampling error. We introduce a new method, forward flux pilot sampling (FFPilot), that is designed to take full advantage of our optimizing equation without prior information or assumptions about the phase weights and costs along the transition path. In simulations of both single- and multi-dimensional gene regulatory networks, FFPilot is able to completely control sampling error. Higher dimensional systems have additional sources of error and we show that this extra error can be traced to correlations between phases due to roughness on the probability landscape. Finally, we show that in sets of simulations with matched error, FFPilot is on the order of tens-to-hundreds of times faster than direct sampling, in a fashion that scales with the rarity of the events.",

Approaches to combine immunotherapies and targeted therapies to overcome or delay drug resistance have been hindered by limited knowledge of the effect of erlotinib on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Using mouse models, we studied the immunological profile of mutant EGFR-driven lung tumors before and after erlotinib treatment. We found that erlotinib triggered the recruitment of inflammatory T cells into the lungs. Interestingly, this phenotype could be recapitulated by tumor regression mediated by deprivation of the EGFR oncogene indicating that tumor regression alone was sufficient for these immunostimulatory effects. Erlotinib treatment also led to increased maturation of myeloid cells and an increase in CD40+ dendritic cells. Our findings lay the foundation for understanding the effects of TKIs on the tumor microenvironment and highlights potential avenues for investigation of targeted and immuno-therapy combination strategies to treat EGFR mutant lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying driver mutations from the large number of neutral passenger mutations within a given tumor. Here, we utilize motifs critical for kinase activity to functionally filter genomic data to identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise. In the first step of our screen, we define a putative tumor suppressing kinome by identifying kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. We aligned these kinase sequences and, utilizing data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases, identified amino acids that represent predicted hotspots for loss-of-function mutations. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were validated and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7 as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite the mutational frequency of MAP2K7 falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished catalytic activity compared to the wild type kinase, consistent with a tumor suppressive role for MAP2K7 in gastric cancer. Furthermore, reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or JNK1 suppresses clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional importance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. In summary, our data highlights a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations leading us to define the JNK pathway as tumor suppressive in gastric cancer.\\n\\nSummaryA unique computational pan-cancer analysis pinpoints novel tumor suppressing kinases, and highlights the power of functional genomics by defining the JNK pathway as tumor suppressive in gastric cancer.",

X. borealis eggs were slightly smaller than those of X. laevis, and slightly smaller spindles were assembled in egg extracts.

Extract mixing experiments revealed common scaling phenomena among Xenopus species, while characterization of spindle factors katanin, TPX2, and Ran indicate that X. borealis spindles possess both X. laevis and X. tropicalis features.

    "abstract": "Adaptive divergence between marine and freshwater environments is important in generating phyletic diversity within fishes, but the genetic basis of adaptation to freshwater habitats remains poorly understood. Available approaches to detect adaptive loci include genome scans for selection, but these can be difficult to interpret because of incomplete knowledge of the connection between genotype and phenotype. In contrast, genome wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful tools for linking genotype to phenotype, but offer limited insight into the evolutionary forces shaping variation. Here, we combine GWAS and selection scans to identify loci important in the adaptation of complex physiological traits to freshwater environments. We focused on freshwater (FW)-native and brackish water (BW)-native populations of the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) as well as a population that is a natural admixture of these two populations. We measured phenotypes for multiple physiological traits that differ between populations and that may contribute to adaptation across osmotic niches (salinity tolerance, hypoxia tolerance, metabolic rate, and body shape) and used a reduced representation approach for genome-wide genotyping. Our results show patterns of population divergence in physiological capabilities that are consistent with local adaptation. Selection scans between BW-native and FW-native populations identified genomic regions that presumably aect fitness between BW and FW environments, while GWAS revealed loci that contribute to variation for each physiological trait. There was substantial overlap in the genomic regions putatively under selection and loci associated with the measured physiological traits, suggesting that these phenotypes are important for adaptive divergence between BW and FW environments. Our analysis also implicates candidate genes likely involved in physiological capabilities, some of which validate a priori hypotheses. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanisms that enable diversification of fishes across osmotic boundaries.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIdentifying the genes that underlie adaptation is important for understanding the evolutionary process, but this is technically challenging. We bring multiple lines of evidence to bear for identifying genes that underlie adaptive divergence. Specifically, we integrate genotype-phenotype association mapping with genome-wide scans for signatures of natural selection to reveal genes that underlie phenotypic variation and that are adaptive in populations of killifish that are diverging between marine and freshwater environments. Because adaptation is likely manifest in multiple physiological traits, we focus on hypoxia tolerance, salinity tolerance, and metabolic rate; traits that are divergent between marine and freshwater populations. We show that each of these phenotypes is evolving by natural selection between environments; genetic variants that contribute to variation in these physiological traits tend to be evolving by natural selection between marine and freshwater populations. Furthermore, one of our top candidate genes provides a mechanistic explanation for previous hypotheses that suggest the adaptive importance of cellular tight junctions. Together, these data demonstrate a powerful approach to identify genes involved in adaptation and help to reveal the mechanisms enabling transitions of fishes across osmotic boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Cellular responses to changing environments frequently involve rapid reprogramming of the transcriptome. Regulated changes in mRNA degradation rates can accelerate reprogramming by clearing or stabilizing extant transcripts. Here, we measured mRNA stability using 4-thiouracil labeling in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during a nitrogen upshift and found that 78 mRNAs are subject to destabilization. These transcripts include Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) and carbon metabolism mRNAs, suggesting that mRNA destabilization is a mechanism for targeted reprogramming. To explore the molecular basis of destabilization we implemented a SortSeq approach to screen using the pooled deletion collection library for trans factors that mediate rapid GAP1 mRNA repression. We combined low-input multiplexed Barcode sequencing with branched-DNA single-molecule mRNA FISH and Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BFF) to identify that the Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex and general mRNA decay machinery are important for GAP1 mRNA clearance. We also find that the decapping modulator SCD6, translation factor eIF4G2, and the 5 UTR of GAP1 are important for this repression, suggesting that translational control may impact the post-transcriptional fate of mRNAs in response to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is a prokaryotic adaptive defense system that assimilates short sequences of invading genomes (spacers) within repeats, and uses nearby effector proteins (Cas), one of which is an endonuclease (Cas9), to cleave homologous nucleic acid during future infections from the same or closely related organisms. Here, a novel CRISPR locus with uncharacterized Cas proteins, is reported in Symbiobacterium thermophilum (Accid:NC 006177.1) around loc.1248561. Credence to this assertion is provided by four arguments. First, the presence of an exact repeat (CACGTGGGGTTCGGGTCGGACTG, 23 nucleotides) occurs eight times encompassing fragments about 83 nucleotides long. Second, comparison to a known CRISPR-Cas locus in the same organism (loc.355482) with an endonuclease Cas3 (WP 011194444.1, 729 aa) [~]10000 nt upstream shows the presence of a known MutS2 endonuclease (WP 011195247.1, 801 aa) in approximately the same distance in loc.1248561. Thirdly, and remarkably, an uncharacterized protein (1357 aa) long is uncannily close in length to known Cas9 proteins (1368 for Streptococcus pyogenes). Lastly, the presence of transposases and reverse transcriptase (RT) downstream of the repeat indicates this is one of an enigmatic RT-CRISPR locus, Also, the MutS2 endonuclease is not characterized as a CRISPR-endonuclease to the best of my knowledge. Interestingly, this locus was not among the four loci (three confirmed, one probable) reported by crisperfinder (http://crispr.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/Server), indicating that the search algorithm needs to be revisited. This finding begs the question - how many such CRISPR-Cas loci and Cas9-like proteins lie undiscovered within bacterial genomes?",

    "abstract": "For long-read sequencing applications, shearing of DNA is a significant issue as it limits the read-lengths generated by sequencing. During extraction and storage of DNA the DNA polymers are susceptible to physical and chemical shearing. In particular, the mechanisms of physical shearing are poorly understood in most laboratories as they are of little relevance to commonly used short-read sequencing technologies. This study draws upon lessons learned in a diverse set of research fields to create a comprehensive theoretical framework for obtaining high molecular weight DNA (HMW-DNA) to support improved quality management in laboratories and biobanks for long-read sequencing applications.\\n\\nUnder common laboratory conditions physical and chemical shearing yields DNA fragments of 5-35 kilobases (kb) in length. This fragment length is sufficient for DNA sequencing using short-read technologies but for Nanopore sequencing, linked reads and single molecular real time sequencing (SMRT) poorly preserved DNA will limit the length of the reads generated.\\n\\nThe shearing process can be divided into physical and chemical shearing which generates different patterns of fragmentation. Exposure to physical shearing creates a characteristic fragment length where the main cause of shearing is shear stress induced by turbulence. The characteristic fragment length is several thousand base pairs longer than the reads produced by short-read sequencing as the shear stress imposed on short DNA fragments is insufficient to shear the DNA. This characteristic length can be measured using gel electrophoresis or instruments for DNA fragment analysis. Chemical shearing generates randomly distributed fragment lengths visible as a smear of DNA below the peak fragment length. By measuring the peak of the DNA fragment length distribution and the proportion of very short DNA fragments, both sources of shearing can be measured using commonly used laboratory techniques, providing a suitable quantification of DNA integrity of DNA for sequencing with long-read technologies.",

Flowers often occur in the hottest, driest parts of the plant canopy and can face harsh abiotic conditions. Prior evidence suggests that extant species vary dramatically in how water is delivered to flowers, with some evidence that water may be imported into flowers by the phloem. Here we measured midday water potential gradients between flowers, leaves, and stems often phylogenetically diverse species. We further tested the likelihood of xylem-hydration by measuring rates of rehydration after experimentally induced desiccation. There was no significant difference in rehydration rates between leaves and flowers. These results are consistent with xylem-hydration of flowers and suggest that there has been little modification to the mechanisms of water transport despite the diversity of floral form.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulators of cellular processes in diseases such as cancer, although the functions of most remain poorly understood. To address this, here we apply a novel strategy to integrate gene expression profiles across 32 cancer types, and cluster human lncRNAs based on their pan-cancer protein-coding gene associations. By doing so, we derive 16 lncRNA modules whose unique properties allow simultaneous inference of function, disease specificity and regulation for over 800 lncRNAs. Remarkably, modules could be grouped into just four functional themes: transcription regulation, immunological, extracellular, and neurological, with module generation frequently driven by lncRNA tissue specificity. Notably, three modules associated with the extracellular matrix represented potential networks of lncRNAs regulating key events in tumour progression. These included a tumour-specific signature of 33 lncRNAs that may play a role in inducing epithelialmesenchymal transition through modulation of TGF{beta} signalling, and two stromal-specific modules comprising 26 lncRNAs linked to a tumour suppressive microenvironment, and 12 lncRNAs related to cancer-associated fibroblasts. At least one member of the 12-lncRNA signature was experimentally supported by siRNA knockdown, which resulted in attenuated differentiation of quiescent fibroblasts to a cancer-associated phenotype. Overall, the study provides a unique pan-cancer perspective on the lncRNA functional landscape, acting as a global source of novel hypotheses on lncRNA contribution to tumour progression.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe established view of protein production is that genomic DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein. Proteins play a critical role in shaping the function of each individual cell in the human body yet they represent less than 2% of human genomic sequence whilst up to 90% of the genome is transcribed. To explain this disparity, the existence of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has emerged that do not encode proteins but perform function as an RNA molecule. Most lncRNAs have yet to be assigned a specific biological role, so to address this we apply a novel computational approach to characterise the function of >800 lncRNAs through consistent association with protein coding genes across multiple cancer types. By doing so, we discover 16 \\\"modules\\\" of closely related lncRNAs that share broad functional themes, the most compelling of which consists of 12 lncRNAs that could regulate activation of specific cells neighbouring the tumour, leading to accelerated tumour progression and invasion. Overall, the study provides the most robust view of the lncRNA-protein coding gene landscape to date, adding to growing evidence that lncRNAs are key regulators of cancer, and have therapeutic potential comparable to proteins.",

    "abstract": "There is intense interest in mapping the tissue-specific binding sites of transcription factors in the human genome to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and predict functions for non-coding genetic variation. DNase-seq footprinting provides a means to predict genome-wide binding sites for hundreds of transcription factors (TFs) simultaneously. However, despite the public availability of DNase-seq data for hundreds of samples, there is neither a unified analytical workflow nor a publicly accessible database providing the locations of footprints across all available samples. Here, we implemented a workflow for uniform processing of footprints using two state-of-the-art footprinting algorithms: Wellington and HINT. Our workflow scans the footprints generated by these algorithms for 1,530 sequence motifs to predict binding sites for 1,515 human transcription factors. We applied our workflow to detect footprints in 192 DNase-seq experiments from ENCODE spanning 27 human tissues. This collection of footprints describes an expansive landscape of potential TF occupancy. At thresholds optimized through machine learning, we report high-quality footprints covering 9.8% of the human genome. These footprints were enriched for true positive TF binding sites as defined by ChIP-seq peaks, as well as for genetic variants associated with changes in gene expression. Integrating our footprint atlas with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies revealed that risk for neuropsychiatric traits was enriched specifically at highly-scoring footprints in human brain, while risk for immune traits was enriched specifically at highly-scoring footprints in human lymphoblasts. Our cloud-based workflow is available at github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint and a database with all footprints and TF binding site predictions are publicly available at http://data.nemoarchive.org/other/grant/sament/sament/footprint_atlas.",

    "abstract": "Acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen, is ubiquitously present in the human environment, with sources including heated starchy foods, coffee and cigarette smoke. Humans are also exposed to acrylamide occupationally. Acrylamide is genotoxic, inducing gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in various experimental settings. Covalent haemoglobin adducts were reported in acrylamide-exposed humans and DNA adducts in experimental systems. The carcinogenicity of acrylamide has been attributed to the effects of glycidamide, its reactive and mutagenic metabolite capable of inducing rodent tumors at various anatomical sites. In order to characterize the pre-mutagenic DNA lesions and global mutation spectra induced by acrylamide and glycidamide, we combined DNA-adduct and whole-exome sequencing analyses in an established exposure-clonal immortalization system based on mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Sequencing and computational analysis revealed a unique mutational signature of glycidamide, characterized by predominant T:A>A:T transversions, followed by T:A>C:G and C:G>A:T mutations exhibiting specific trinucleotide contexts and significant transcription strand bias. Computational interrogation of human cancer genome sequencing data indicated that a combination of the glycidamide signature and an experimental benzo[a]pyrene signature are nearly equivalent to the COSMIC tobacco-smoking related signature 4 in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We found a more variable relationship between the glycidamide- and benzo[a]pyrene-signatures and COSMIC signature 4 in liver cancer, indicating more complex exposures in the liver. Our study demonstrates that the controlled experimental characterization of specific genetic damage associated with glycidamide exposure facilitates identifying corresponding patterns in cancer genome data, thereby underscoring how mutation signature laboratory experimentation contributes to the elucidation of cancer causation.\\n\\nA 40-word summaryInnovative experimental approaches identify a novel mutational signature of glycidamide, a metabolite of the probable human carcinogen acrylamide. The results may elucidate the cancer risks associated with exposure to acrylamide, commonly found in tobacco smoke, thermally processed foods and beverages.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHumoral immune responses to infectious agents or vaccination vary substantially among individuals, and many of the factors responsible for this variability remain to be defined. Current evidence suggests that human genetic variation influences (i) serum immunoglobulin levels, (ii) seroconversion rates, and (iii) intensity of antigen-specific immune responses. Here, we evaluate the impact of intrinsic (age and sex), environmental and genetic factors on the variability of humoral response to common pathogens and vaccines.\\n\\nMethodsWe characterized the serological response to 15 antigens from common human pathogens or vaccines, in an age- and sex-stratified cohort of 1,000 healthy individuals (Milieu Interieur cohort). Using clinical-grade serological assays, we measured total IgA, IgE, IgG and IgM levels, as well as qualitative (serostatus) and quantitative IgG responses to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 & 2, varicella zoster virus, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, influenza A virus, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B virus. Following genome-wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, we examined associations between ~5 million genetic variants and antibody responses using single marker and gene burden tests.\\n\\nResults and discussionWe identified age and sex as important determinants of humoral response, with older individuals and women having higher rates of seropositivity for most antigens. Genome-wide association studies revealed significant associations between variants in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on chromosome 6 and anti-EBV and anti-rubella IgG levels. We used HLA imputation to fine map these associations to amino acid variants in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DR{beta}1 and HLA-DP{beta}1, respectively. We also observed significant associations for total IgA levels with two loci on chromosome 2 and with specific KIR-HLA combinations.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing extensive serological testing and genome-wide association analyses in a well-characterized cohort of healthy individuals, we demonstrate that age, sex and specific human genetic variants contribute to inter-individual variability in humoral response. By highlighting genes and pathways implicated in the normal antibody response to frequently encountered antigens, these findings provide a basis to better understand disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the gut microbiome in industrialized populations differs from those living traditional lifestyles. However, it has been difficult to separate the contributions of human genetic and geographic factors from lifestyle/modernization. Here, we characterize the stool bacterial composition of four Himalayan populations to investigate how the gut community changes in response to shifts in human lifestyles. These groups led seminomadic hunting-gathering lifestyles until transitioning to varying dependence upon farming. The Tharu began farming 250-300 years ago, the Raute and Raji transitioned 30-40 years ago, and the Chepang retain many aspects of a foraging lifestyle. We assess the contributions of dietary and environmental factors on their gut microbiota and find that the gut microbiome composition is significantly associated with lifestyle. The Chepang foragers harbor elevated abundance of taxa associated with foragers around the world. Conversely, the gut microbiomes of populations that have transitioned to farming are more similar to those of Americans, with agricultural dependence and several associated lifestyle and environmental factors correlating with the extent of microbiome divergence from the foraging population. For example, our results show that drinking water source and solid cooking fuel are significantly associated with the gut microbiome. Despite the pronounced differences in gut bacterial composition across populations, we found little differences in alpha diversity across populations. These findings in genetically similar populations living in the same geographical region establish the key role of lifestyle in determining human gut microbiome composition and point to the next challenging steps of isolating dietary effects from other factors that change during modernization.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/253450_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (108K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68f595org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d33792org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e56314org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cbbba2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Using an integrated approach, combining quantitative metatranscriptomics with gas- and volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiling, we gained fundamental insights into temporal dynamics of the cow rumen microbiome during feed degradation.\\n\\nResultsThe microbiome composition was highly individual and remarkably stable within each cow, despite similar gas emission and VFA profiles between cows. Gene expression profiles revealed a fast microbial growth response to feeding, reflected by drastic increases in microbial biomass, CH4 emissions and VFA concentrations. Microbiome individuality was accompanied by high inter- and intra-domain functional redundancy among pro- and eukaryotic microbiome members in the key steps of anaerobic feed degradation. Methyl-reducing but not CO2-reducing methanogens were correlated with increased CH4 emissions during plant biomass degradation.\\n\\nConclusionsThe major response of the rumen microbiome to feed intake was a general growth of the whole community. The high functional redundancy of the cow-individual microbiomes was possibly linked to the robust performance of the anaerobic degradation process. Furthermore, the strong response of methylotrophic methanogens is suggesting that they might play a more important role in ruminant CH4 emissions than previously assumed, making them potential targets for CH4 mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "There is an unmet need in severe asthma where approximately 40% of patients exhibit poor {beta}-agonist responsiveness, suffer daily symptoms and show frequent exacerbations. Antagonists of the Ca2+-activated-Cl- channel, TMEM16A, offers a new mechanism to bronchodilate airways and block the multiple contractiles operating in severe disease. To identify TMEM16A antagonists we screened a library of ~580,000 compounds. The anthelmintics niclosamide, nitazoxanide and related compounds were identified as potent TMEM16A antagonists that blocked airway smooth muscle depolarization and contraction. To evaluate whether TMEM16A antagonists resist use- and inflammatory-desensitization pathways limiting {beta}-agonist action, we tested their efficacy under harsh conditions using maximally contracted airways or airways pretreated with a cytokine cocktail. Stunningly, TMEM16A antagonists fully bronchodilated airways, while the {beta}-agonist isoproterenol showed only partial effects. Thus, antagonists of TMEM16A and repositioning of niclosamide and nitazoxanide represent an important additional treatment for patients with severe asthma and COPD that is poorly controlled with existing therapies. It is of note that drug repurposing has also attracted wide interest in niclosamide and nitazoxanide as a new treatment for cancer and infectious disease. For the first time we identify TMEM16A as a molecular target for these drugs and thus provide fresh insights into their mechanism for the treatment of these disorders in addition to respiratory disease.",

Our analysis of 9,655 previously reported mammalian mtDNA deletions and 1,307 novel Caenorhabditis elegans mtDNA deletions, indicates a significant role of 0-25bp misalignments, supporting the role of erroneous non-homologous and micro-homology dependent DSB repair in deletion formation.

We derive conditions for this sweet spot for a broad class of learning algorithms in the context of binary classification tasks, in which ambiguous stimuli must be sorted into one of two classes. For all of these gradient-descent based learning algorithms we find that the optimal error rate for training is around 15.87% or, conversely, that the optimal training accuracy is about 85%.

    "abstract": "RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 systems can be designed to mutate or excise the integrated HIV genome from latently infected cells and have therefore been proposed as a curative approach for HIV. However, most studies to date have focused on molecular clones with ideal target site recognition and do not account for target site variability observed within and between patients. For clinical success and broad applicability, guide RNA (gRNA) selection must account for circulating strain diversity and incorporate the within-host diversity of HIV. To address this, we identified a set of gRNAs targeting HIV LTR, gag and pol using publicly available sequences for these genes. We ranked gRNAs according to global conservation across HIV-1 group M and within subtypes A-C. By considering paired and triplet combinations of gRNAs, we found triplet sets of target sites such that at least one of the gRNAs in the set was present in over 98% of all globally-available sequences. We then selected 59 gRNAs from our list of highly-conserved LTR target sites and evaluated in vitro activity using a loss-of-function LTR-GFP fusion reporter. We achieved efficient GFP knockdown with multiple gRNAs and found clustering of highly active gRNA target sites near the middle of the LTR. Using published deep-sequence data from HIV-infected patients, we found that globally conserved sites also had greater within-host target conservation. Lastly, we developed a mathematical model based on varying distributions of within-host HIV sequence diversity and enzyme efficacy. We used the model to estimate the number of doses required to deplete the latent reservoir and achieve functional cure thresholds. Our modeling results highlight the importance of within-host target site conservation. While increased doses may overcome low target cleavage efficiency, inadequate targeting of rare strains is predicted to lead to rebound upon ART cessation even with many doses.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe field of genome engineering has exploded over the last decade with the discovery of targeted endonucleases such as CRISPR/Cas9. Endonucleases are now being used to develop a wide range of therapeutics and their use has expanded into antiviral therapy against latent viral infections like HIV. The idea is to induce mutations in latent viral genomes that will render them replication-incompetent, thereby producing a functional cure. Although a great deal of progress has been made, most studies to date have relied on molecular clones that represent \\\"ideal\\\" targets. For clinical success and broad applicability, these therapies need to account for viral genetic diversity within and between individuals. Our paper examines the impact of HIV diversity on CRISPR-based cure strategies to determine the predictors of future clinical success. We performed an exhaustive and detailed computational analysis to identify optimal CRISPR target sites, taking into consideration both within-host and global viral diversity. We coupled this with laboratory testing of highly-conserved guides and compared measured activity to predicted results. Finally, we developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of enzyme activity and viral diversity on the number of doses of a CRISPR-based therapy needed to achieve a functional cure of HIV.",

In this context, it is unclear how mechanical forces affect E-cadherin adhesion and junction dynamics.\\n\\nDuring Drosophila embryo axis elongation, Myosin-II activity in the apico-medial and junctional cortex generates mechanical forces to drive junction remodeling. Here we report that the ratio between Vinculin and E-cadherin intensities acts as a ratiometric readout for these mechanical forces (load) at E-cadherin complexes. Medial Myosin-II loads E-cadherin complexes on all junctions, exerts tensile forces, and increases levels of E-cadherin. Junctional Myosin-II, on the other hand, biases the distribution of load between junctions of the same cell, exerts shear forces, and decreases the levels of E-cadherin. This work suggests distinct effects of tensile versus shear stresses on E-cadherin adhesion.",

In contrast to human, where comprehensive curated TF collections exist, bovine TFs are only rudimentary recorded and characterized. In this article, we present a manually-curated compendium of 865 sequence-specific DNA-binding bovines TFs, which we analyzed for domain family distribution, evolutionary conservation, and tissue-specific expression. In addition, we provide a list of putative transcription cofactors derived from known interactions with the identified TFs. Since there is a general lack of knowledge concerning the regulation of gene expression in cattle, the curated list of TF should provide a basis for an improved comprehension of regulatory mechanisms that are specific to the species.",

    "abstract": "The molecular chaperone and heat-shock protein Hsp90 has become a central target in anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the effect of Hsp90 inhibition is still not understood at the molecular level, preventing a truly rational drug design. Here we report on the effect of the most prominent drug candidates, namely radicicol, geldanamycin, derivatives of purine and novobiocin, on Hsp90s characteristic conformational dynamics and the binding of three interaction partners. Unexpectedly, the global opening and closing transitions are hardly affected by Hsp90 inhibitors. Instead, the conformational equilibrium, as well as the associated kinetic rate constants remain almost untouched. Moreover, we find no significant changes in the binding of the cochaperones Aha1 and p23 nor of the model substrate {Delta}131{Delta}. This holds true for both, competitive and allosteric inhibitors. Therefore, direct inhibition mechanisms, affecting only one molecular interaction, are unlikely. Based on our results, we speculate that the inhibitory action observed in vivo is caused by a combination of subtle effects, which can be used in the search for novel Hsp90 inhibition mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Alzheimers disease (AD) is the leading cause of disability in the elderly. It has been a long time about the calcium hypothesis of AD on the basis of emerging evidence since 1994. However, most studies focused on the association between calcium homeostasis and AD, and concerned the intracellular calcium concentration. Only few studies reported reduced serum calcium levels in AD. Until now, it remains unclear whether serum calcium levels are genetically associated with AD risk.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate the genetic association between increased serum calcium levels and AD risk\\n\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a Mendelian randomization study to investigate the association of increased serum calcium with AD risk using the genetic variants from the large-scale serum calcium genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset (N=61,079 individuals of European descent) and the large-scale AD GWAS dataset (N=54,162 individuals including 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls of European descent). Inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (IVW) was used to provide a combined estimate of the genetic association. Meanwhile, we selected the weighted median regression and MR-Egger regression as the complementary analysis methods to examine the robustness of the IVW estimate.\\n\\nEXPOSURES Genetic predisposition to increased serum calcium levels\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The risk of AD.\\n\\nRESULTS We selected 6 independent genetic variants influencing serum calcium levels as the instrumental variables. IVW analysis showed that a genetically increased serum calcium level (per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase 0.5-mg/dL) was significantly associated with a reduced AD risk (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.94, P=5.00E-03). Meanwhile, both the weighted median estimate (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.34-1.06, P=0.08) and MR-Egger estimate (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.26-1.67, P=0.381) were consistent with the IVW estimate in terms of direction and magnitude.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We provided evidence that genetically increased serum calcium levels could reduce the risk of AD. Meanwhile, randomized controlled study should be further conducted to assess the effect of serum calcium levels on AD risk, and further clarify whether diet calcium intake or calcium supplement, or both could reduce the risk of AD.\\n\\nKey PointsQuestion Is there a genetic relationship between elevated serum calcium levels and the risk of Alzheimers disease?\\n\\nFindings This Mendelian randomization study showed that the genetically increased serum calcium levels were associated with the reduced risk of Alzheimers disease.\\n\\nMeaning These findings provide evidence that genetically increased serum calcium levels could reduce the risk of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent genetic and genomics approaches have yielded novel insights in the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) but the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment still remain largely empirical1,2. We reasoned that molecular characterization of SLE by whole blood transcriptomics may facilitate early diagnosis and personalized therapy. To this end, we analyzed genotypes and RNA-seq in 142 patients and 58 matched healthy individuals to define the global transcriptional signature of SLE. By controlling for the estimated proportions of circulating immune cell types, we show that the Interferon (IFN) and p53 pathways are robustly expressed. We also report cell-specific, disease-dependent regulation of gene expression and define a core/susceptibility and a flare/activity disease expression signature, with oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome regulation and cell cycle pathways being enriched in lupus flares. Using these data, we define a novel index of disease activity/severity by combining the validated Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)1 with a new variable derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data. We also delineate unique signatures across disease endo-phenotypes whereby active nephritis exhibits the most extensive changes in transcriptome, including prominent drugable signatures such as granulocyte and plasmablast/plasma cell activation. The substantial differences in gene expression between SLE and healthy individuals enables the classification of disease versus healthy status with median sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 100%, respectively. We explored the genetic regulation of blood transcriptome in SLE and found 3142 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By integration of SLE genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals and eQTLs from 44 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium, we demonstrate that the genetic causality of SLE arises from multiple tissues with the top causal tissue being the liver, followed by brain basal ganglia, adrenal gland and whole blood. Collectively, our study defines distinct susceptibility and activity/severity signatures in SLE that may facilitate diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic interactions among species are ubiquitous in nature, and the fitness costs and benefits they impose often reinforce and stabilize them over time. These interactions are of particular importance in the human gut, where they have functions ranging from enhancing digestion to preventing (or exacerbating) infections. The diversity and sheer number of species present lead to the potential for a multitude of metabolic interactions among species to occur. However, identifying the mechanism and consequences of metabolic interactions between even two species is incredibly challenging. Here, we develop, apply, and experimentally test a framework for identifying potential metabolic mechanisms associated with interspecies interactions. We perform pairwise growth and metabolome profiling of co-cultures of strains from the altered Schaedler flora (ASF), a defined murine microbiota. We then apply our novel framework, which we call the Constant Yield Expectation (ConYE) model, to dissect emergent metabolic behaviors that occur in co-culture. Using the ConYE model, we identify and interrogate an amino acid cross-feeding interaction that is likely to confer a growth benefit to one ASF strain (Clostridium sp. ASF356) in co-culture with another strain (Parabacteroides goldsteinii ASF519). We experimentally validate that the proposed interaction leads to a growth benefit for this strain via media supplementation experiments. Our results reveal the type and extent of emergent metabolic behavior in microbial communities and demonstrate how metabolomic data can be used to identify potential metabolic interactions between organisms such as gut microbes. Our in vitro characterization of the ASF strains and interactions between them also enhances our ability to interpret and design experiments that utilize ASF-colonized animals. We anticipate that this work will improve the tractability of studies utilizing mice colonized with the ASF. Here, we focus on growth-modulating interactions, but the framework we develop can be applied to generate specific hypotheses about mechanisms of interspecies interaction involved in any phenotype of interest within a microbial community.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation, determine immune cell phenotype. To understand the epigenetic alterations induced by helminth co-infections, we evaluated the longitudinal effect of ascariasis and schistosomiasis infection on CD4+ T cell DNA methylation and the downstream tuberculosis (TB)-specific and BCG-induced immune phenotype. All experiments were performed on human primary immune cells from a longitudinal cohort of recently TB-exposed children. Compared to age-matched uninfected controls, children with active Schistosoma haematobium and Ascaris lumbricoides infection had 751 differentially DNA methylated genes with 72% hyper-methylated. Gene ontology pathway analysis identified inhibition of IFN-{gamma} signaling, cellular proliferation, and the Th1 pathway. Targeted RT-PCR after methyl-specific endonuclease digestion confirmed DNA hyper-methylation of the transcription factors BATF3, ID2, STAT5A, IRF5, PPARg, RUNX2, IRF4 and NFATC1 and cytokines or cytokine receptors IFNGR1, TNFS11, RELT (TNF receptor), IL12RB2 and IL12B (p< 0.001; Sidak-Bonferroni). Functional blockage of the IFN-{gamma} signaling pathway was confirmed with helminth-infected individuals having decreased up-regulation of IFN-{gamma}-inducible genes (Mann-Whitney p < 0.05). Hypo-methylation of the IL-4 pathway and DNA hyper-methylation of the Th1 pathway was confirmed by antigen-specific multidimensional flow cytometry demonstrating decreased TB-specific IFN-{gamma} and TNF and increased IL-4 production by CD4+ T cells (Wilcoxon signed rank P <0.05). In S.haematobium infected individuals, these DNA methylation and immune phenotypic changes persisted at least six months after successful deworming. This work demonstrates that helminth infection induces DNA methylation and immune perturbations that inhibit TB-specific immune control and that the duration of these changes are helminth-specific.",
