    "abstract": "BackgroundDogs (Canis lupus familiaris) were domesticated from gray wolves between 10-40 kya in Eurasia, yet details surrounding the process of domestication remain unclear. The vast array of phenotypes exhibited by dogs mirror other domesticated animal species, a phenomenon known as the Domestication Syndrome. Here, we use signatures persisting in the dog genome to identify genes and pathways altered by the intensive selective pressures of domestication.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 246 candidate domestication regions containing 10.8Mb of genome sequence and 178 genes through whole-genome SNP analysis of 43 globally distributed village dogs and 10 wolves. Comparisons with ancient dog genomes suggest that these regions reflect signatures of domestication rather than breed formation. The strongest hit is located in the Retinoic Acid-Induced 1 (RAI1) gene, mutations of which cause Smith-Magenis syndrome. The identified regions contain a significant enrichment of genes linked to neural crest cell migration, differentiation and development. Read depth analysis suggests that copy number variation played a minor role in dog domestication.\\n\\nConclusionOur results indicate that phenotypes distinguishing domesticated dogs from wolves, such as tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, are determined by genes which act early in embryogenesis. These differences are all phenotypes of the Domestication Syndrome, which can be explained by decreases in neural crest cells at these sites. We propose that initial selection during early dog domestication was for behavior, a trait also influenced by genes which act in the neural crest, which secondarily gave rise to the phenotypes of modern dogs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransmission in epidemics of infectious diseases is characterized by a high level of subject-specific elements. These include heterogeneous infection conditions, time-dependent transmission potential, and age-dependent contact structure. These insights are often lost in epidemic models using population data. Here we submit an approach that can capture these details, paving the way for studying epidemics in a more mechanistic and realistic way.\\n\\nMethodsUsing experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of a pathogen infection dynamics from which we can simulate its transmission potential mechanistically. The models were then embedded in our implement of an age-specific contact network structure that allows to express all elements relevant to the transmission process. This approach is illustrated here with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV).\\n\\nResultsThe results showed that within-host infection dynamics can capture EBOVs transmission parameters as good as approaches using population data. Population age-structure, contact distribution and patterns can also be captured with our network generating algorithm. This framework opens vast opportunities for the investigations of each element involved in the epidemic process. Here, estimating EBOVs reproduction number revealed a heterogeneous pattern among age-groups, prompting questions on current estimates which are not adjusted for this factor. Assessments of mass vaccination strategies showed that a time window from five months before to one week after the start of an epidemic appeared to be effective. Noticeably, compared to a non-intervention scenario, a low vaccination coverage of 33% could reduce number of cases by ten to hundred times as well as lessen the case-fatality rate.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first effort coupling directly within-host infection model into an age-structured epidemic network model, adding more realistic elements in simulating epidemic processes. Experimental data at the within-host infection are shown able to capture upfront key parameters of a pathogen; the applications of this approach will give us more time to prepare for potential epidemics. Population of interest in epidemic assessments could be modeled with an age-specific contact network without exhaustive amount of data. Further assessments and adaptations for different pathogens and scenarios are underway to explore multilevel aspects in infectious diseases epidemics.",

In vertebrates, multipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors produce second-heart-field-derived cardiomyocytes, and branchiomeric skeletal head muscles. However, the mechanisms underlying these early fate choices remain largely elusive. The tunicate Ciona emerged as an attractive model to study early cardiopharyngeal development at high resolution: through two asymmetric and oriented divisions, defined cardiopharyngeal progenitors produce distinct first and second heart precursors, and pharyngeal muscle (aka atrial siphon muscle, ASM) precursors. Here, we demonstrate that differential FGF-MAPK signaling distinguishes between heart and ASM precursors. We characterize a feed-forward circuit that promotes the successive activations of essential ASM determinants, Hand-related, Tbx1/10 and Ebf. Finally, we show that coupling FGF-MAPK restriction and cardiopharyngeal network deployment with cell divisions defines the timing of gene expression and permits the emergence of diverse cell types from multipotent progenitors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacterial genomes have characteristic compositional skews, which are differences in nucleotide frequency between the leading and lagging DNA strands across a segment of a genome. It is thought that these strand asymmetries arise as a result of mutational biases and selective constraints, particularly for energy efficiency. Analysis of compositional skews in a diverse set of bacteria provides a comparative context in which mutational and selective environmental constraints can be studied. These analyses typically require finished and well-annotated genomic sequences.\\n\\nResultsWe present three novel metrics for examining genome composition skews; all three metrics can be computed for unfinished or partially-annotated genomes. The first two metrics, (dot-skew and cross-skew) depend on sequence and gene annotation of a single genome, while the third metric (residual skew) highlights unusual genomes by subtracting a GC content-based model of a library of genome sequences. We applied these metrics to all 7738 available bacterial genomes, including partial drafts, and identified outlier species. A number of these outliers (i.e., Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Kinetoplastibacterium, and Phytoplasma) display similar skew patterns despite only distant phylogenetic relationship. While unrelated, some of the outlier bacterial species share lifestyle characteristics, in particular intracellularity and biosynthetic dependence on their hosts.\\n\\nConclusionsOur novel metrics appear to reflect the effects of biosynthetic constraints and adaptations to life within one or more hosts on genome composition.

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network. The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa.\\n\\nWe report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The relationship between several measures of network centrality and sensitivity to mutation is weak, but point estimates of the correlation between network centrality and mutational variance are positive, with only one exception. There is a marginally significant correlation between core number and mutational heritability. There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites.\\n\\nPositive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between shortest path length and the mutational correlation between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGlioblastoma exhibits profound tumor heterogeneity, which causes inconsistent treatment response. The aim of this study was to propose an interpretation method of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using joint histogram analysis of DTI-p and-q. With this method we explored the patterns of tumor infiltration which causes disruption of brain microstructure, and examined the prognostic value of tumor infiltrative patterns for patient survival.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsA total of 115 primary glioblastoma patients (mean age 59.3 years, 87 males) were prospectively recruited from July 2010 to August 2015. Patients underwent preoperative MRI scans and maximal safe resection. DTI was processed and decomposed into p and q components. The univariate and joint histograms of DTI-p and-q were constructed using the voxels of contrast-enhancing and non-enhancing regions respectively. Eight joint histogram features were obtained and correlated with tumor progression and patient survival. Their prognostic values were compared with clinical factors using receiver operating characteristic curves.\\n\\nResultsThe subregion of increased DTI-p and decreased DTI-q accounted for the largest proportion. Additional diffusion patterns can be identified via joint histogram analysis. Particularly, higher proportion of decreased DTI-p and increased DTI-q in non-enhancing region contributed to worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.08, p< 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.11, p < 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsJoint histogram analysis of DTI can provide a comprehensive measure of tumor infiltration and microstructure change, which showed prognostic values. The subregion of decreased DTI-p and increased DTI-q in non-enhancing regions may indicate a more invasive habitat.",

Although microfluidic technology can miniaturise AST, the high dynamic range of pathogen density found in clinical urine samples makes direct testing of clinical samples - rather than testing colonies from overnight agar plates - extremely challenging. We evaluated for the first time how pathogen concentration in urine affects microfluidic AST using a novel microplate-compatible high-throughput microfluidic AST system termed \\\"Lab-on-a-Comb\\\". When tested with clinical E. coli isolates at standardised density, these devices gave identical antibiotic susceptibility profiles to standard disc diffusion and microtitre plate tests. Bacterial detection directly in synthetic urine spiked with clinical E. coli UTI isolates was possible over a very large dynamic range of starting cell densities, from 103 - 108 CFU/mL which covers the range of pathogen cell densities found in patient urine. The lowest cell density where cell growth was reproducibly detected optically was 9.6x102 CFU/mL, corresponding to one single CFU detected in a 1 L microcapillary-an unprecedented level of sensitivity. Cell growth kinetics followed a simple Monod model with fast growth limited by the substrate availability and an estimated doubling time of 24.5 min, indicating optimal E. coli growth conditions within these microfluidic devices. There was a trade-off between sensitivity and speed of detection, with 105 CFU/mL detection possible within 2h, but 6h incubation required at 103 CFU/mL.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion has recently emerged as an active player in a myriad of cellular processes. Additionally, it was recently shown that more than 200 diseases are known to be linked to variants in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes interacting with mitochondria. This has reinvigorated interest in its biology and population genetics. Mitochondrial heteroplasmy, or genotypic variation of mitochondria within an individual, is now understood to be common in humans and important in human health. However, it is still not possible to make quantitative predictions about the inheritance of heteroplasmy and its proliferation within the body, partly due to the lack of an appropriate model. Here, we present a population-genetic framework for modeling mitochondrial heteroplasmy as a process that occurs on an ontogenetic phylogeny, with genetic drift and mutation changing heteroplasmy frequencies during the various developmental processes represented in the phylogeny. Using this framework, we develop a Bayesian inference method for inferring rates of mitochondrial genetic drift and mutation at different stages of human life. Applying the method to previously published heteroplasmy frequency data, we demonstrate a severe effective germline bottleneck comprised of the cumulative genetic drift occurring between the divergence of germline and somatic cells in the mother and the separation of germ layers in the offspring. Additionally, we find that the two somatic tissues we analyze here undergo tissue-specific bottlenecks during embryogenesis, less severe than the effective germline bottleneck, and that these somatic tissues experience little additional genetic drift during adulthood. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of the ontogenetic phylogeny framework and its possible applications to other ontogenetic processes in addition to mitochondrial heteroplasmy.",

Here we focus on characterizing the human brains large-scale network organization, as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We developed a highly principled approach to identify cortical network communities at the level of functional systems, calibrating our community detection algorithm using extremely well-established sensory and motor systems as guides. Building on previous network partitions, we replicated and expanded upon well-known and recently identified networks, including several higher-order cognitive networks such as a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex, revealing 358 highly organized subcortical parcels that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. Notably, the identified subcortical parcels are similar in number to a recent estimate of the number of cortical parcels (360). This whole-brain network atlas - released as an open resource for the neuroscience community - places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex into a single large-scale functional framework, with the potential to facilitate a variety of studies investigating large-scale functional networks in health and disease.",

Imputation of methylation values at low-coverage sites may mitigate these biases while also identifying important genomic features and motifs associated with predictive power.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe BoostMe, a novel method for imputation of DNA methylation within whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data based on a gradient boosting algorithm. Importantly, we designed a new feature that leverages information from multiple samples in the same tissue and disease state, enabling BoostMe to outperform existing imputation methods in speed and accuracy. We show that imputation improves WGBS concordance with the Infinium MethylationEPIC array at low WGBS sequencing depth, suggesting improvement in WGBS accuracy after imputation. Furthermore, we compare the ability of BoostMe and DeepCpG - a deep neural network method - to identify interesting features and motifs associated with methylation in three human tissues implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D) etiology. We find that while BoostMe only identifies features important to general methylation levels across tissues, DeepCpG is able to learn differences in methylation-associated sequence motifs among different tissues and identify tissue-specific regulators of differentiation such as EBF1 in adipose, ASCL2 in muscle, and FOXA1, TCF12, and NRF1 in islets. Neither algorithm readily identified T2D-associated features.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the current power and limitations of machine and deep learning algorithms to both improve the quality of, and infer biological meaning from, genome-wide DNA methylation data.",

However, performing accurate measurements of the fluid level in small-scale reservoirs (<1mL) has proven to be an elusive goal, especially if direct fluid-sensor contact needs to be avoided. In particular, gravity-driven systems used in several microfluidic applications to establish pressure gradients and impose flow remain open-loop and largely unmonitored due to these sensing limitations. Here we present an optimized self-shielded coplanar capacitive sensor design and automated control system to provide submillimeter fluid-height resolution (~250 m) and control of small-scale open reservoirs without the need for direct fluid contact. Results from testing and validation of our optimized sensor and system also suggest that accurate fluid height information can be used to robustly characterize, calibrate and dynamically control a range of microfluidic systems with complex pumping mechanisms, even in cell culture conditions. Capacitive sensing technology provides a scalable and cost-effective way to enable continuous monitoring and closed-loop feedback control of fluid volumes in small-scale gravity-dominated wells in a variety of microfluidic applications.",

    "abstract": "Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multivariate fMRI analysis stress the importance of information inherent to voxel patterns. Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signals functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions. Thirdly, knowing the functional dimensionality allows assessing task-related differences in the complexity of neural patterns.",

    "abstract": "The origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the legs epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments",

    "abstract": "Streptomycetes constitute the largest genus of actinobacteria, living predominantly in soil and decaying vegetation. The bacteria are widely known for their filamentous morphologies and their capacity to synthesize antibiotics and other biologically active molecules. More than a decade ago, we and others identified 22 genomic islands that Streptomyces coelicolor M145 possesses and other Streptomyces strains lack. One of these genomic islands, Genomic Island (GI) 6, encodes an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor that we were characterizing in separate work. Here we report that artificial induction of the ECF sigma factor, which is encoded by SCO3450, causes the transcription of approximately one-fourth of GI 6, or ~26 mostly contiguous genes, to increase. More than half of the regulon encodes putative enzymes involved in small molecule metabolism. A putative haloacid dehalogenase is present. Genes encoding two putative anti-sigma factors flank SCO3450, the three genes residing within the regulon. Our data suggest that the ECF sigma factor and its regulon are a self-contained transcriptional unit that can be transferred by horizontal gene transfer. To our knowledge, only one other example has been identified of an ECF sigma factor and its contiguous regulon appearing to be transferrable by horizontal gene transfer [18,19]. Because the regulon appears not to be induced by the 44 growth conditions recently examined by Byung-Kwan Cho and colleagues [20], if it confers fitness to S. coelicolor, the regulon likely does so in as-yet unknown situations. Those situations might range from scavenging to detoxification to even communication within microbial communities.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEStreptomyces bacteria grow as hyphae that colonize soil and differentiate into spores when nutrients become scarce. In their terrestrial habitats, the bacteria encounter diverse conditions. Presumably so that the bacteria can cope with those conditions, the chromosomes of streptomycetes are highly dynamic, varying greatly in structure not only between species but also between closely related strains of a single species. The bacteria also have large numbers of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, which undoubtedly help the microorganisms respond to the plethora of challenges coming from the environment. This work illustrates these two threads of Streptomyces biology dovetailing: Genetic adaptability through horizontal gene transfer seems to have enabled Streptomyces coelicolor to acquire a self-contained transcriptional unit that consists of an ECF sigma factor and its regulon. The suggested facile movement of the regulon between microbial hosts indicates the value of the metabolism of small molecules possibly mediated by the regulon.",

    "abstract": "Speech intelligibility is currently measured by scoring how well a person can identify a speech signal. The results of such behavioral measures reflect neural processing of the speech signal, but are also influenced by language processing, motivation and memory. Very often electrophysiological measures of hearing give insight in the neural processing of sound. However, in most methods non-speech stimuli are used, making it hard to relate the results to behavioral measures of speech intelligibility. The use of natural running speech as a stimulus in electrophysiological measures of hearing is a paradigm shift which allows to bridge the gap between behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Here, by decoding the speech envelope from the electroencephalogram, and correlating it with the stimulus envelope, we demonstrate an electrophysiological measure of neural processing of running speech. We show that behaviorally measured speech intelligibility is strongly correlated with our electrophysiological measure. Our results pave the way towards an objective and automatic way of assessing neural processing of speech presented through auditory prostheses, reducing confounds such as attention and cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that our electrophysiological measure will allow better differential diagnosis of the auditory system, and will allow the development of closed-loop auditory prostheses that automatically adapt to individual users.",

Quantifying the selective pressures that act on natural variation in grass species is therefore essential regarding biodiversity maintenance. In this study, we investigate the selection pressures that act on two distinct populations of the grass model Brachypodium distachyon without prior knowledge about the traits under selection. We took advantage of whole-genome sequencing data produced for 44 natural accessions of B. distachyon and used complementary genome-wide scans of selection (GWSS) methods to detect genomic regions under balancing and positive selection. We show that selection is shaping genetic diversity at multiple temporal and spatial scales in this species and affects different genomic regions across the two populations. Gene Ontology annotation of candidate genes reveals that pathogens may constitute important factors of positive and balancing selection in Brachypodium distachyon. We eventually cross-validated our results with QTL data available for leaf-rust resistance in this species and demonstrate that, when paired with classical trait mapping, GWSS can help pinpointing candidate genes for further molecular validation. Thanks to a near-base perfect reference genome and the large collection of freely available natural accessions collected across its natural range, B. distachyon appears as a prime system for studies in ecology, population genomics and evolutionary biology.",

    "abstract": "The problem of genome assembly is ultimately linked to the problem of the characterization of all repeat families in a genome as a repeat graph. The key reason the de Bruijn graph emerged as a popular short read assembly approach is because it offered an elegant representation of all repeats in a genome that reveals their mosaic structure. However, most algorithms for assembling long error-prone reads use an alternative overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) approach that does not provide a repeat characterization. We present the Flye algorithm for constructing the A-Bruijn (assembly) graph from long error-prone reads, that, in contrast to the k-mer-based de Bruijn graph, assembles genomes using an alignment-based A-Bruijn graph. In difference from existing assemblers, Flye does not attempt to construct accurate contigs (at least at the initial assembly stage) but instead simply generates arbitrary paths in the (unknown) assembly graph and further constructs an assembly graph from these paths. Counter-intuitively, this fast but seemingly reckless approach results in the same graph as the assembly graph constructed from accurate contigs. Flye constructs (overlapping) contigs with possible assembly errors at the initial stage, combines them into an accurate assembly graph, resolves repeats in the assembly graph using small variations between various repeat instances that were left unresolved during the initial assembly stage, constructs a new, less tangled assembly graph based on resolved repeats, and finally outputs accurate contigs as paths in this graph. We benchmark Flye against several state-of-the-art Single Molecule Sequencing assemblers and demonstrate that it generates better or comparable assemblies for all analyzed datasets.",

In all, five phenotypes were found for persister cell resuscitation: (i) immediate division, (ii) immediate elongation followed by division, (iii) immediate elongation but no division, (iv) delayed elongation/division, and (v) no growth. In addition, once cell division begins, the growth rate is that of exponential cells. Critically, the greater the ribosome content, the faster the persister cells resuscitate.",

However, it is unknown whether there are differences in spindle or kinetochore composition or architecture which influence the efficiency chromosome segregation in different cell types. Here we show that the transition of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype causes a stabilisation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and an increase in the frequency of chromosome mis-segregation, due to inefficient error-correction, during mitosis. We find that this is caused by microtubule detyrosination during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and that parthenolide, a tubulin carboxypeptidase inhibitor, efficiently reverts mes-enchymal cells to the epithelial mode of chromosome segregation. We propose that reprogramming the post-translational modifications of the mitotic spindle decreases mitotic fidelity and may contribute to CIN in mesenchymal cell populations during tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein with an unusual domain structure that allows it to integrate G protein and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. RGS14 mRNA and protein are enriched in brain tissue of rodents and primates. In the adult mouse brain, RGS14 is predominantly expressed in postsynaptic dendrites and spines of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons where it naturally inhibits synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. However, the signaling proteins that RGS14 natively interacts with in neurons to regulate plasticity are unknown. Here, we show that RGS14 exists as a component of a high molecular weight protein complex in brain. To identify RGS14 neuronal interacting partners, endogenous RGS14 immunoprecipitated from mouse brain was subjected to mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis. We find that RGS14 interacts with key postsynaptic proteins that regulate neuronal plasticity. Gene ontology analysis reveals that the most enriched RGS14 interacting proteins have functional roles in actin-binding, calmodulin(CaM)-binding, and CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) activity. We validate these proteomics findings using biochemical assays that identify interactions between RGS14 and two previously unknown binding partners: CaM and CaMKII. We report that RGS14 directly interacts with CaM in a calcium-dependent manner and is phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro. Lastly, we detect that RGS14 associates with CaMKII and with CaM in hippocampal CA2 neurons by proximity ligation assays in mouse brain sections. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that RGS14 is a novel CaM effector and CaMKII phosphorylation substrate thereby providing new insight into cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 controls plasticity in CA2 neurons.",

    "abstract": "Small heat-shock proteins (sHSP) are molecular chaperones that bind and sequester partially and globally unfolded states of their client proteins. Of paramount importance to their physiological roles is the assembly into large oligomers, which for mammalian sHSP are polydisperse and undergo subunit exchange. The flexibility and dynamic nature of these oligomers mediates functional regulation by phosphorylation and underpins the deleterious effects of disease-linked mutations. Previously, we discovered that the archaeal Hsp16.5, which natively forms ordered and symmetric 24-subunit oligomers, can be engineered to transition to an ordered and symmetric 48-subunit oligomer by insertion of a peptide from human HspB1 (Hsp27) at the junction of the N-terminal and -crystallin domains. Here, we carried out a detailed analysis of the determinants of Hsp16.5 oligomeric plasticity by altering the sequence and length of the inserted peptide. Utilizing light scattering, blue native gel electrophoresis, native mass spectrometry and electron microscopy, we uncovered the existence of an array of oligomeric states (30 to 38 subunits) that can be populated as a consequence of different insertions. These oligomers are intermediate states on the assembly pathway of the 48-subunit oligomer as two of the variants can concurrently form 24-subunit or 30-38 subunit polydisperse oligomers. Polydisperse Hsp16.5 oligomers displayed higher affinity to a model client protein consistent with a general mechanism for recognition and binding that involves increased access of the hydrophobic N-terminal region. Our findings, which integrate structural and functional analyses from evolutionarily-distant sHSP, support a model wherein the modular architecture of these proteins encodes motifs of oligomer polydispersity, dissociation and expansion to achieve functional diversity and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is one of the commonest and deadliest solid tumours of childhood, and is thought to result from disrupted differentiation of the developing sympathoadrenergic lineage of the neural crest. Neuroblastoma exhibits intra-and intertumoural heterogeneity, with high risk tumours characterised by poor differentiation, which can be attributable to MYCN-mediated repression of genes involved in neuronal differentiation. MYCN is known to co-operate with oncogenic signalling pathways such as Alk, Akt and MEK/ERK signalling, and, together with c-MYC has been shown to be activated by Wnt signalling in various tissues. However, our previous work demonstrated that Wnt3a/Rspo2 treatment of some neuroblastoma cell lines can, paradoxically, decrease c-MYC and MYCN proteins. This prompted us to define the neuroblastoma-specific Wnt3a/Rspo2-driven transcriptome using RNA sequencing, and characterise the accompanying changes in cell biology.\\n\\nHere we report the identification of ninety Wnt target genes, and show that Wnt signalling is upstream of numerous transcription factors and signalling pathways in neuroblastoma. Using live-cell imaging, we show that Wnt signalling can drive differentiation of SK-N-BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cell-lines, but, conversely, proliferation of SK-N-AS cells. We show that cell-lines that differentiate show induction of pro-differentiation BMP4 and EPAS1 proteins, which is not apparent in the SK-N-AS cells. In contrast, SK-N-AS cells show increased CCND1, phosphorylated RB and E2F1 in response to Wnt3a/Rspo2, consistent with their proliferative response, and these proteins are not increased in differentiating lines. By meta-analysis of the expression of our 90 genes in primary tumour gene expression databases, we demonstrate discrete expression patterns of our Wnt genes in patient cohorts with different prognosis. Furthermore our analysis reveals interconnectivity within subsets of our Wnt genes, with one subset comprised of novel putative drivers of neuronal differentiation repressed by MYCN. Assessment of {beta}-catenin immunohistochemistry shows high levels of {beta}-catenin in tumours with better differentiation, further supporting a role for canonical Wnt signalling in neuroblastoma differentiation.",

Predation is hypothesized as one selective pressure that may have driven the evolution of multicellularity. Here we show that de novo origins of simple multicellularity can evolve in response to predation. We subjected outcrossed populations of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to selection by the filter-feeding predator Paramecium tetraurelia. Two of five experimental populations evolved multicellular structures not observed in unselected control populations within ~750 asexual generations. Considerable variation exists in the evolved multicellular life cycles, with both cell number and propagule size varying among isolates. Survival assays show that evolved multicellular traits provide effective protection against predation. These results support the hypothesis that selection imposed by predators may have played a role in some origins of multicellularity.",

WGDs are known to have occurred in the lineages leading to plants, fungi, and vertebrates. Changes to ploidy level impact the rate and spectrum of beneficial mutations and thus the rate of adaptation. Laboratory evolution experiments initiated with haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures repeatedly experience WGD. We report recurrent genome duplication in 46 haploid yeast populations evolved for 4,000 generations. We find that WGD confers a fitness advantage, and this immediate fitness gain is accompanied by a shift in genomic and phenotypic evolution. The presence of ploidy-enriched targets of selection and structural variants reveals that autodiploids utilize adaptive paths inaccessible to haploids. We find that autodiploids accumulate recessive deleterious mutations, indicating an increased capacity for neutral evolution. Finally, we report that WGD results in a reduced adaptation rate, indicating a trade-off between immediate fitness gains and long term adaptability.",

    "abstract": "In the history of life, some phenotypes have been acquired several times independently, through convergent evolution. Recently, lots of genome-scale studies have been devoted to identify nucleotides or amino acids that changed in a convergent manner when the convergent phenotypes evolved. These efforts have had mixed results, probably because of differences in the detection methods, and because of conceptual differences about the definition of a convergent substitution. Some methods contend that substitutions are convergent only if they occur on all branches where the phenotype changed towards the exact same state at a given nucleotide or amino acid position. Others are much looser in their requirements and define a convergent substitution as one that leads the site at which they occur to prefer a phylogeny in which species with the convergent phenotype group together. Here we suggest to look for convergent shifts in amino acid preferences instead of convergent substitutions to the exact same amino acid. We define as convergent shifts substitutions that occur on all branches where the phenotype changed and such that they correspond to a change in the type of amino acid preferred at this position. We implement the corresponding model into a method named PCOC. We show on simulations that PCOC better recovers convergent shifts than existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We test it on a plant protein alignment where convergent evolution has been studied in detail and find that our method recovers several previously identified convergent substitutions and proposes credible new candidates.",

However, there are a limited number of data simulators that provide structural variants in silico. Moreover, there are a paucity of programs that generate structural variants with different allelic fraction and haplotypes.\\n\\nFindingsWe developed SVEngine, an open source tool to address this need. SVEngine simulates next generation sequencing data with embedded structural variations. As input, SVEngine takes template haploid sequences (FASTA) and an external variant file, a variant distribution file and/or a clonal phylogeny tree file (NEWICK) as input. Subsequently, it simulates and outputs sequence contigs (FASTAs), sequence reads (FASTQs) and/or post-alignment files (BAMs). All of the files contain the desired variants, along with BED files containing the ground truth. SVEngines flexible design process enables one to specify size, position, and allelic fraction for deletion, insertion, duplication, inversion and translocation variants. Finally, SVEngine simulates sequence data that replicates the characteristics of a sequencing library with mixed sizes of DNA insert molecules. To improve the compute speed, SVEngine is highly parallelized to reduce the simulation time.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrated the versatile features of SVEngine and its improved runtime comparisons with other available simulators. SVEngines features include the simulation of locus-specific variant frequency designed to mimic the phylogeny of cancer clonal evolution. We validated the accuracy of the simulations. Our evaluation included checking various sequencing mapping features such as coverage change, read clipping, insert size shift and neighbouring hanging read pairs for representative variant types.

    "abstract": "Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions in the genome cause a number of degenerative diseases. A prominent TNR expansion involves the triplet CAG in the huntingtin (HTT) gene responsible for Huntingtons disease (HD). Pathology is caused by protein and RNA generated from the TNR regions including small siRNA-sized repeat fragments. An inverse correlation between the length of the repeats in HTT and cancer incidence has been reported for HD patients. We now show that siRNAs based on the CAG TNR are toxic to cancer cells by targeting genes that contain long reverse complimentary TNRs in their open reading frames. Of the 60 siRNAs based on the different TNRs, the 6 members in the CAG/CUG family of related TNRs are the most toxic to both human and mouse cancer cells. siCAG/CUG TNR-based siRNAs induce cell death in vitro in all tested cancer cell lines and slow down tumor growth in a preclinical mouse model of ovarian cancer with no signs of toxicity to the mice. We propose to explore TNR-based siRNAs as a novel form of anti-cancer reagents.",

To address this question, we assembled the largest molecular data set to date, covering > 300 species (out of ca. 800 extant), from 13 of the 14 known families over nine genes, and employed relaxed molecular clocks to uncover their patterns of diversification. As the fossil record of flatfish is contentious, we used sister species distributed on both sides of the American continent to calibrate clock models based on the closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS), and on their current species range. We show that flatfish diversified in two bouts, as species that are today distributed around the Equator diverged during the closure of CAS, while those with a northern range diverged after this, hereby suggesting the existence of a post-CAS closure dispersal for these northern species, most likely along a trans-Arctic northern route, a hypothesis fully compatible with paleogeographic reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "By making use of the increasing number of available mitogenomes we propose a novel population genetic distance metric, named Shared Haplogroup Distance (SHD). Unlike FST, SHD is a true mathematical distance that complies with all metric axioms, which enables our new algorithm (MITOMIX) to detect population-level admixture based on SHD minimum optimization. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology we analyzed the relation of 62 modern and 25 ancient Eurasian human populations, and compared our results with the most widely used FST calculation. We also sequenced and performed an in-depth analysis of 272 modern Hungarian mtDNA genomes to shed light on the genetic composition of modern Hungarians. MITOMIX analysis showed that in general admixture occurred between neighboring populations, but in some cases it also indicated admixture with migrating populations. SHD and MITOMIX analysis comply with known genetic data and shows that in case of closely related and/or admixing populations, SHD gives more realistic results and provides better resolution than FST. Our results suggest that the majority of modern Hungarian maternal lineages have Late Neolith/Bronze Age European origins (partially shared also with modern Danish, Belgian/Dutch and Basque populations), and a smaller fraction originates from surrounding (Serbian, Croatian, Slovakian, Romanian) populations. However only a minor genetic contribution (<3%) was identified from the IXth Hungarian Conquerors whom are deemed to have brought Hungarians to the Carpathian Basin. Our analysis shows that SHD and MITOMIX can augment previous methods by providing novel insights into past population processes.",

    "abstract": "The recovery of a DNA profile from the perpetrator or victim in criminal investigations can provide valuable  source level information for investigators. However, a DNA profile does not reveal the circumstances by which biological material was transferred. Some contextual information can be obtained by a determination of the tissue or fluid source of origin of the biological material as it is potentially indicative of some behavioral activity on behalf of the individual that resulted in its transfer from the body. Here, we sought to improve upon established RNA based methods for body fluid identification by developing a targeted multiplexed next generation mRNA sequencing assay comprising a panel of approximately equal sized gene amplicons. The multiplexed biomarker panel includes several highly specific gene targets with the necessary specificity to definitively identify most forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues (blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and skin). In developing the biomarker panel we evaluated 66 gene targets, with a progressive iteration of testing target combinations that exhibited optimal sensitivity and specificity using a training set of forensically relevant body fluid samples. The current assay comprises 33 targets: 6 blood, 6 semen, 6 saliva, 4 vaginal secretions, 5 menstrual blood and 6 skin markers. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and the ability to identify body fluids in single source and admixed stains. A 16 sample blind test was carried out by one lab with samples provided by the other participating lab. The blinded lab correctly identified the body fluids present in 15 of the samples with the major component identified in the 16th. Various classification methods are being investigated to permit inference of the body fluid/tissue in dried physiological stains. These include the percentage of reads in a sample that are due to each of the 6 tissues/body fluids tested and inter-sample differential gene expression revealed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering.",

We investigated this in the context of severe asthma with persistent airway eosinophilia - a phenotype associated with high exacerbation risk and responsiveness to type-2 cytokine-targeted therapies. In two independent cohorts we show that, in contrast to Th2 cells, type-2 cytokine-secreting CD8+CRTH2+ (Tc2) cells are enriched in blood and airways in severe eosinophilic asthma. Concentrations of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and cysteinyl leukotriene E4 (LTE4) are also increased in the airways of the same group of patients. In vitro PGD2 and LTE4 function synergistically to trigger Tc2 cell recruitment and activation in a TCR-independent manner. These lipids regulate diverse genes in Tc2 cells inducing type-2 cytokines and many other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which could contribute to eosinophilia. These findings are consistent with an important innate-like role for human Tc2 cells in severe eosinophilic asthma and suggest a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMechanistic understanding of tendon molecular and cellular biology is crucial towards furthering our abilities to design new therapies for tendon and ligament injuries and disease. Recent transcriptomic and epigenomic studies in the field have harnessed the power of mouse genetics to reveal new insights into tendon biology. However, many mouse studies pool tendon tissues or use amplification methods to perform RNA analysis, which can significantly increase the experimental costs and limit the ability to detect changes in expression of low copy transcripts.\\n\\nMethodsSingle Achilles tendons were harvested from uninjured, contralateral injured, and wild type mice between 3-5 months of age, and RNA was extracted. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and concentration were determined, and RT-qPCR gene expression analysis was performed.\\n\\nResultsAfter testing several RNA extraction approaches on single adult mouse Achilles tendons, we developed a protocol that was successful at obtaining high RIN and sufficient concentrations suitable for RNA analysis. We found that the RNA quality was sensitive to the time between tendon harvest and homogenization, and the RNA quality and concentration was dependent on the duration of homogenization. Using this method, we demonstrate that analysis of Scx gene expression in single mouse tendons reduces the biological variation caused by pooling tendons from multiple mice. We also show successful use of this approach to analyze Sox9 and Col1a2 gene expression changes in injured compared with uninjured control tendons.\\n\\nDiscussionOur work presents a robust, cost-effective, and straightforward method to extract high quality RNA from a single adult mouse Achilles tendon at sufficient amounts for RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. We show this can reduce biological variation and decrease the overall costs associated with experiments.

    "abstract": "More and more studies had used connectivity profiles to predict functions of the brain. However, whether anatomical connectivity can predict functions consistently with functional connectivity in various functional domains and whether the connectivity-function relationship is universal across the whole cortex are unknown. Using a linear model, we discovered that anatomical connectivity was comparative to functional connectivity in explaining the variance of functions in most cortical regions, with the exception that anatomical connectivity had poor explaining abilities in brain areas which had high individual task variations. In addition, anatomical connectivity were not that good at capturing individual functional differences and had less inter-subject variation than functional connectivity, however anatomical connectivity could be regarded as more stable in the perspective of parcellation. The current results provided the first comprehensive picture of the relationships between functions and connectivity in the whole human cortex at a fine-grained brain atlas.",

    "abstract": "We conducted two experiments to investigate how the eventfulness of everyday experiences influences peoples prospective timing ability. Specifically, we investigated whether events contained within movies of everyday activities serve as markers of time, as predicted by Event Segmentation Theory, or whether events pull attention away from the primary timing task, as predicted by the Attentional Gate theory. In the two experiments reported here, we asked participants to reproduce a previously learned 30 second target duration while watching a movie that contained eventful and uneventful intervals. In Experiment 2, reproduction also occurred during \\\"blank movies\\\" while watching a fixation. In both experiments, participants made shorter and more variable reproductions while simultaneously watching eventful as compared to uneventful movie intervals. Moreover, in Experiment 2, the longest reproductions were produced when participants had to watch the blank movies, which contained no events. These results support Event Segmentation Theory and demonstrate that the elapsing events during prospective temporal reproduction appear to serve as markers of temporal duration rather than distracting from the timing task.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic models are instrumental in uncovering operating principles of cellular metabolism and model-guided re-engineering. Recent applications of metabolic models have also demonstrated their usefulness in unraveling cross-feeding within microbial communities. Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging far behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual cura-tion required to obtain good quality models and thus physiologically meaningful simulation results. Here, we present an automated tool - CarveMe - for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation-ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, CarveMe uses a top-down approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We build reconstructions for two model organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtillis, as well as a collection of human gut bacteria, and show that CarveMe models perform similarly to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of CarveMe through reconstructing 5587 bacterial models. Overall, CarveMe provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.",

    "abstract": "Certain retroviruses, including HIV, insert their DNA in a non-random fraction of the host genome via poorly understood selection mechanisms. Here, we develop a biophysical model for retroviral integrations as stochastic and quasi-equilibrium topological reconnections between polymers. We discover that physical effects, such as DNA accessibility and elasticity, play important and universal roles in this process. Our simulations predict that integration is favoured within nucleosomal and flexible DNA, in line with experiments, and that these biases arise due to competing energy barriers associated with DNA deformations. By considering a long chromosomal region in human T-cells during interphase, we discover that at these larger scales integration sites are predominantly determined by chromatin accessibility. Finally, we propose and solve a reaction-diffusion problem that recapitulates the distribution of HIV hot-spots within T-cells. With few generic assumptions, our model can rationalise experimental observations and identifies previously unappreciated physical contributions to retroviral integration site selection.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare, slow growing cancers that present in a diversity of tissues. To understand molecular underpinnings of gastrointestinal (GINET) and pancreatic NETs (PNETs), we profiled 45 tumours combining exome, RNA, and shallow whole genome sequencing, as well as fluorescent in situ hybridization. In addition to expected somatic mutations and copy number alterations, we found that PNETs contained a highly consistent copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) profile affecting over half of the genome; a greater percentage than any cancer analyzed to date. Our data indicates that onset of extreme autozygosity may be progressive, associated with metastasis, and initially triggered by the loss of DAXX/ATRX, and subsequent biallelic loss of MEN1. We confirmed this molecular timing model using targeted clinical sequencing data from an additional 43 NETs made available by the AACR GENIE project. Against this background of CN-LOH, several chromosomal regions consistently retained heterozygosity, suggesting selection for crucial allele-specific components specific to PNET progression and potential new therapeutic targets.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWe have discovered that pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours contain a characteristic pattern of copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity affecting the majority of the genome following mutations of MEN1 and ATRX/DAXX. Against this background of loss-of-heterozygosity, specific genomic regions are consistently retained and may therefore contain vulnerable therapeutic targets for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.",

Using a cancer mouse model, we show that tumor cells compromised in exosome release grow slower and are less innervated than controls indicating a contribution of innervation to disease progression. We find that neo-neurogenesis is mediated in part by the axonal guidance molecule, EphrinB1, contained in exosomes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMeiotic recombination plays an important role in evolution by shuffling different alleles along the chromosomes, thus generating the genetic diversity across generations that is vital for adaptation. The plasticity of recombination rates and presence of hotspots of recombination along the genome has attracted much attention over two decades due to their contribution to the evolution of the genome. Yet, the variation in genome-wide recombination landscape and the differences in the location and strength of hotspots across worldwide human populations remains little explored.\\n\\nResultsWe make use of the untapped linkage disequilibrium (LD) based genetic maps from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) to perform in-depth analyses of finescale variation in the autosomal recombination rates across 20 human populations to uncover the global recombination landscape. We have generated a detailed map of human recombination landscape comprising of a comprehensive set of 88,841 putative hotspots and 80,129 coldspots with their respective strengths across populations, about 2/3rd of which were previously unknown. We have validated and assessed the number of historical putative hotspots derived from the patterns of LD that are currently active in the contemporary populations using a recently published high-resolution pedigree-based genetic map, constructed and refined using 3.38 million crossovers from various populations. For the first time, we provide statistics regarding the conserved, shared, and unique hotspots across all the populations studied.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analysis yields clusters of continental groups, reflecting their shared ancestry and genetic similarities in the recombination rates that are linked to the migratory and evolutionary histories of the populations. We provide the genomic locations and strengths of hotspots and coldspots across all the populations studied which are a valuable set of resources arising out our analyses of 1KGP data. The findings are of great importance for further research on human hotspots as we approach the dusk of retiring HapMap-based resources.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWOaks are dominant forest tree species widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, where they constitute natural resources of economic, ecological, social and historical value. Hybridization and adaptive introgression have long been thought to be major drivers of their ecological success. Thus, the maintenance of species barriers remains a key question, given the extent of interspecific gene flow. In this study, we scanned the genomes of four European white oak species for reproductive barriers. We identified the ecological and phylogenic relationships of these species and inferred a long-term strict isolation followed by a recent and extensive postglacial contact. Then, we made use of the tremendous genetic variation among these species (31 million SNPs) to identify genomic regions for reproductive isolation. A literature-based functional annotation of the underlying genes highlighted important functions driving the reproductive isolation between these sister species. These functions were consistent with their ecological preferences and included tolerance to biotic and abiotic constraints. This study holds important implications for the renewal of European forests under global warming.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetic analyses require extensive measurements of phenotypic traits, a task that is often not trivial, especially in wild populations. On top of instrumental measurement error, some traits may undergo transient (i.e. non-persistent) fluctuations that are biologically irrelevant for selection processes. These two sources of variability, which we denote here as measurement error in a broad sense, are possible causes for bias in the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters. We illustrate how in a continuous trait transient effects with a classical measurement error structure may bias estimates of heritability, selection gradients, and the predicted response to selection. We propose strategies to obtain unbiased estimates with the help of repeated measurements taken at an appropriate temporal scale. However, the fact that in quantitative genetic analyses repeated measurements are also used to isolate permanent environmental instead of transient effects, requires a re-assessment of the information content of repeated measurements. To do so, we propose to distinguish \\\"short-term\\\" from \\\"long-term\\\" repeats, where the former capture transient variability and the latter the permanent effects. We show how the inclusion of the corresponding variance components in quantitative genetic models yields unbiased estimates of all quantities of interest, and we illustrate the application of the method to data from a Swiss snow vole population.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing studies have highlighted candidate sets of genes involved in schizophrenia, including activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Two genes, SETD1A and RBM12, have also been associated with robust statistical evidence. Larger samples and novel methods for identifying disease-associated missense variants are needed to reveal novel genes and biological mechanisms associated with schizophrenia. We sequenced 187 genes, selected for prior evidence of association with schizophrenia, in a new dataset of 5,207 cases and 4,991 controls. Included were members of ARC and NMDAR post-synaptic protein complexes, as well as voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. We observed a significant case excess of rare (<0.1% in frequency) loss-of-function (LoF) mutations across all 187 genes (OR = 1.36; Pcorrected = 0.0072) but no individual gene was associated with schizophrenia after correcting for multiple testing. We found novel evidence that LoF and missense variants at paralog conserved sites were enriched in sodium channels (OR = 1.26; P = 0.0035). Meta-analysis of our new data with published sequencing data (11,319 cases, 15,854 controls and 1,136 trios) supported and refined this association to sodium channel alpha subunits (P = 0.0029). Meta-analysis also confirmed association between schizophrenia and rare variants in ARC (P = 4.0 x 10-4) and NMDAR (P = 1.7 x 10-5) synaptic genes. No association was found between rare variants in calcium channels and schizophrenia.\\n\\nIn one of the largest sequencing studies of schizophrenia to date, we provide novel evidence that multiple voltage-gated sodium channels are involved in schizophrenia pathogenesis, and increase the evidence for association between rare variants in ARC and NMDAR post-synaptic complexes and schizophrenia. Larger samples are required to identify specific genes and variants driving these associations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCommon and rare genetic variations are known to play a substantial role in the development of schizophrenia. Recently, sequencing studies have started to highlight specific sets of genes that are enriched for rare variation in schizophrenia, such as the synaptic gene sets ARC and NMDAR, as well as voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. To confirm the role of these gene sets in schizophrenia, and identify specific risk genes, we sequenced 187 genes in a new sample of 5,207 schizophrenia cases and 4,991 controls. We find an excess of protein truncating mutations with a frequency <0.1% in all 187 targeted genes, and provide novel evidence that mutations altering amino acids conserved across sodium channel proteins are risk factors for schizophrenia. Through meta-analysing our new data with previously published sequencing data sets, for a total of 11,319 cases, 15,854 controls and 1,136 trios, we increase the evidence for association between rare coding variants and schizophrenia in voltage-gated sodium channels, as well as in synaptic gene sets ARC and NMDAR. Although no individual gene was associated with schizophrenia, these findings suggest larger studies will identify the specific genes driving these associations.",

We compared the shared aetiology of depression and a range of phenotypes, contrasting individuals reporting trauma exposure with those who did not (final sample size range: 24,094-92,957). Depression was heritable in participants reporting trauma exposure and in unexposed individuals, and the genetic correlation between the groups was substantial and not significantly different from 1. Genetic correlations between depression and psychiatric traits were strong regardless of reported trauma exposure, whereas genetic correlations between depression and body mass index (and related phenotypes) were observed only in trauma exposed individuals.

We present here a study of vaccine mixing and release following dissolution of filter-dried model protein and toxoid antigens within a single syringe, filter and needle unit. Release was better for filters made from glass than cellulose. Without additional mixing, uniformity was poor and only 41% of input protein was released from protein filter-dried onto glass fibre. In contrast, adding a simple glass bead and mixing by inversion, 100% release antigen solution was achieved, with uniform concentration at exit from the needle throughout a simulated injection. Adsorption onto alum adjuvant had no detectable effect on vaccine dissolution and mixing. The uniformity and yield of low doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid was also improved by mixing, albeit with a lower yield of 60-68%. We conclude that uniformity and mixing should be studied to ensure safety and efficacy of directly reconstituted filter-dried vaccine formulations.",

    "abstract": "Enveloped viruses gain entry into host cells by fusing with cellular membranes, a step required for virus replication. Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection. This will provide insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses.",

However, less is understood about how these may influence disease-related brain mechanisms underlying epidemiological observations that urban birth and childhoods may increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including increased social stress and depression. In a genetically homogeneous Han Chinese adult population with divergent urban and rural birth and childhoods, we examined the structural and functional MRI neural correlates of childhood urbanicity, focusing on behavioral traits responding to social status threats, and polygenic risk for depression. Subjects with divergent rural and urban childhoods were similar in adult socioeconomic status and were genetically homogeneous. Urban childhoods, however, were associated with higher trait anxiety-depression. On structural MRI, urban childhoods were associated with relatively reduced medial prefrontal gray matter volumes. Functional medial prefrontal engagement under social status threat during working memory correlated with trait anxiety-depression in subjects with urban childhoods, to a significantly greater extent than in their rural counterparts, implicating an exaggerated physiological response to the threat context. Stress-associated medial prefrontal engagement also interacted with polygenic risk for depression, significantly predicting a differential response in individuals with urban but not rural childhoods. Developmental urbanicity thus differentially influenced medial prefrontal structure and function, at least in part through mechanisms associated with the neural processing of social status threat, trait anxiety, and genetic risk for depression, which may be factors in the association of urbanicity with adult psychopathology.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUrban living has been associated with social inequalities and stress. However, less is understood about the neural underpinnings by which these stressors affect disease risk, and in particular, genetic risk for depression. Leveraging urbanization in China, we studied adults with diverse urban and rural upbringings, who were genetically homogeneous and with similar current socioeconomic status, to isolate the effects of childhood urbanicity. At medial prefrontal cortex, a region critical for processing emotional stressors and social status, genetic risk for depression resulted in more deleterious function under stress in individuals with urban, but not rural childhoods. This implicates medial prefrontal cortexs critical role in brain development, integrating genetic mechanisms of stress and depression with the childhood environment.",

    "abstract": "Humans can learn to perform multiple tasks in succession over the lifespan (\\\"continual\\\" learning), whereas current machine learning systems fail. Here, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms that permit successful continual learning in humans. Unlike neural networks, humans that were trained on temporally autocorrelated task objectives (focussed training) learned to perform new tasks more effectively, and performed better on a later test involving randomly interleaved tasks. Analysis of error patterns suggested that focussed learning permitted the formation of factorised task representations that were protected from mutual interference. Furthermore, individuals with a strong prior tendency to represent the task space in a factorised manner enjoyed greater benefit of focussed over interleaved training. Building artificial agents that learn to factorise tasks appropriately may be a promising route to solving continual task performance in machine learning.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHumans learn to perform many different tasks over the lifespan, such as speaking both French and Spanish. The brain has to represent task information without mutual interference. In machine learning, this \\\"continual learning\\\" is a major unsolved challenge. Here, we studied the patterns of errors made by humans and state-of-the-art deep networks whilst they learned new tasks from scratch and without instruction. Humans, but not machines, seem to benefit from training regimes that focussed on one task at a time, especially when they had a prior bias to represent stimuli in a way that facilitated task separation. Machines trained to exhibit the same prior bias suffered less interference between tasks, suggesting new avenues for solving continual learning in artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is evidence of increasing use of laboratory tests with substantial variation between clinical teams which is difficult to justify on clinical grounds. The aim of this project was to assess the effect of a demand optimisation intervention on laboratory test requesting in primary care.\\n\\nMethodsThe intervention comprised educational initiatives, feedback to 55 individual practices on test request rates with ranking relative to other practices, and a small financial incentive for practices to engage and reflect on their test requesting activity. Data on test request numbers were collected from the laboratory databases for consecutive 12 month periods; pre-intervention 2011-12, intervention 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15, and post-intervention 2015-16.\\n\\nResultsThe intervention was associated with a 3.6% reduction in the mean number of profile test requests between baseline and 2015-16, although this was seen only in rural practices. In both rural and urban practices, there was a significant reduction in-between practice variability in request rates. The mean number of HbA1c requests increased from 1.9 to 3.0 per practice patient with diabetes. Variability in HbA1c request rates increased from 23.8% to 36.6%. At all considered time points, test request rates and variability were higher in rural than in urban areas.\\n\\nConclusionsThe intervention was associated with a reduction in both the volume and between practice variability of profile test requests, with differences noted between rural and urban practices. The increase in HbA1c requests may reflect a more appropriate rate of diabetes monitoring and also the adoption of HbA1c as a diagnostic test.\\n\\nStrengths & limitations of the studyO_LIWe assessed the effect of a laboratory demand optimisation intervention both on the value and between GP practice variability in laboratory test requesting.\\nC_LIO_LIThe changes in laboratory test requesting were separately evaluated for rural and urban GP practices.\\nC_LIO_LIOther factors (GP practice organisation, characteristics of general practitioners) potentially affecting between practice differences in laboratory test ordering were not taken into account due to data unavailability.\\nC_LIO_LIThe demand management initiative was not accompanied by the cost-effectiveness analysis.\\nC_LIO_LIThe demand optimisation intervention was conducted in a Northern Ireland (NI) Western Health and Social Care Trust and the findings have not been independently replicated in any other NI trusts.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fertility critically depends on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator, a neural construct comprised of hypothalamic neurons co-expressing kisspeptin, neurokoinin-B and dynorphin that drives the pulsatile release of GnRH. How this neural network generates and controls the appropriate ultradian frequency essential for gametogenesis and ovulation is unknown. Here, we present a mathematical model of the GnRH pulse generator with theoretical evidence and in vivo experimental data showing that robust pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone, a proxy for GnRH, emerges abruptly as we increase the basal activity of the neuronal network using continuous low frequency optogenetic stimulation of the neural construct. Further increases in basal activity markedly increase pulse frequency. Model predictions that such behaviors are concomitant of non-linear positive and negative feedback interactions mediated through neurokinin-B and dynorphin signaling respectively are confirmed neuropharmacologically. Our mathematical model sheds light on the long-elusive GnRH pulse generator offering new horizons for fertility regulation.",
