    "abstract": "Increasing evidence has shown that posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation and hydroxymethylation on cytosine would greatly impact the binding of transcription factors (TFs). However, there is a lack of motif finding algorithms with the function to search for motifs with PTMs. In this study, we expend on our previous motif finding pipeline Epigram to provide systematic de novo motif discovery and performance evaluation on methylated DNA motifs. Using the tool, we were able to identified methylated motifs in Arabidopsis DAP-seq data that were previously demonstrated to contain such motifs1. When applied to TF ChIP-seq and DNA methylome data in H1 and GM12878, our method successfully identified novel methylated motifs that can be recognized by the TFs or their co-factors. We also observed spacing constraint between the canonical motif of the TF and the newly discovered methylated motifs, which suggests operative recognition of these cis-elements by collaborative proteins.",

    "abstract": "Memory performance is highly variable between individuals. Most studies examining human memory, however, have largely focused on the neural correlates of successful memory formation within individuals, rather than the differences between them. As such, what gives rise to this variability is poorly understood. Here, we examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings captured from 43 participants (23 male) implanted with subdural electrodes for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We identified three separate but related signatures of neural activity that tracked differences in successful memory formation across individuals. High performing individuals consistently exhibited less broadband power, flatter power spectral density (PSD) slopes, and greater complexity in their iEEG signals. Furthermore, within individuals across three separate time scales ranging from seconds to days, successful recall was positively associated with these same metrics. Our data therefore suggest that memory ability across individuals can be indexed by increased neural signal complexity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe show that participants whose intracranial EEG exhibits less low frequency power, flatter power spectrums, and greater sample entropy overall are better able to memorize associations, and that the same metrics track fluctuations in memory performance across time within individuals. These metrics together signify greater neural signal complexity which may index the brains ability to flexibly engage with information and generate separable memory representations. Critically, the current set of results provide a unique window into the neural markers of individual differences in memory performance which have hitherto been underexplored.",

    "abstract": "The genome of all organisms is constantly threatened by numerous agents that cause DNA damages. When the replication fork encounters an unrepaired DNA lesion, two DNA damage tolerance pathways are possible: error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) that requires specialized DNA polymerases, and error-free Damage Avoidance (DA) that relies on homologous recombination. The balance between these two mechanisms is essential since it defines the level of mutagenesis during lesion bypass, allowing genetic variability and adaptation to the environment, but also introducing the risk of generating genome instability. Here we report that the mere proximity of replication-blocking lesions that arise in Escherichia colis genome during a genotoxic stress, leads to a strong increase in the use of the error-prone TLS. We show that this increase is caused by the local inhibition of homologous recombination due to the overlapping of single-stranded DNA regions generated downstream the lesions. This increase in TLS is independent of SOS activation, but its mutagenic effect is additive with the one of SOS. Hence, the combination of SOS induction and lesions proximity leads to a strong increase in TLS that becomes the main lesion tolerance pathway used by the cell during a genotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which visual inference is shaped by attentional goals is unclear. Voluntary attention may simply modulate the priority with which information is accessed by higher cognitive functions involved in perceptual decision making. Alternatively, voluntary attention may influence fundamental visual processes, such as those involved in segmenting an incoming retinal signal into a structured scene of coherent objects, thereby determining perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether the segmentation and integration of visual form can be determined by an observers goals by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We generated predictions about the influence of attention with a machine classifier, and tested these predictions with a psychophysical response classification technique. Despite seeing the same image on each trial, observers perception of illusory spatial structure depended on their attentional goals. These attention-contingent illusory contours directly conflicted with equally plausible visual form implied by the geometry of the stimulus, revealing that attentional selection can determine the perceived layout of a fragmented scene. Attentional goals, therefore, not only select pre-computed features or regions of space for prioritised processing, but, under certain conditions, also greatly influence perceptual organisation and thus visual appearance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe extent to which higher cognitive functions can influence perceptual organisation is debated. The role of voluntary spatial attention, the ability to focus on only some parts of a scene, has been particularly controversial among neuroscientists and psychologists who aim to uncover the basic neural computations involved in grouping image features into coherent objects. To address this issue, we repeatedly presented the same novel ambiguous image to observers and changed their attentional goals by having them make fine spatial judgements about only some elements of the image. We found that observers attentional goals determine the perceived organisation of multiple illusory shapes. We thus reveal that voluntary spatial attention can control the fundamental processes that determine perceptual organisation.",

    "abstract": "Numerous interactions between plants and animals vary in their outcome between antagonism and mutualism, but it has proven to be difficult to quantify their final outcome. Interactions between plants and scatterhoarding animals provide a prime example of this phenomenon. Scatterhoarders consume large quantities of seeds (potentially reducing plant establishment), yet also disperse seeds and bury them in shallow caches (potentially improving recruitment). However, it has been rarely determined which role prevails for particular plant species. We demonstrate how plant-scatterhoarder interactions can be placed at the antagonism-mutualism continuum, with interactions between rodents and two oaks species (sessile oak Quercus petraea, and red oak Q. rubra) as an empirical example. Our approach consists of quantifying the net outcome of the interaction through assembling different vital rates (e.g. probability of seedling recruitment with and without rodents; near and far from conspecific trees; with and without seed pilferage) piecewise with a simple mathematical model. Our results indicate that during the period of the study, interactions between scatterhoarding rodents and both focal oaks were antagonistic. Even though acorn burial increased the likelihood of seedling establishment, this effect was not strong enough to compensate for the costs of seed predation. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the short-distance transportation that is usually provided by small mammals benefited early oak recruitment. Our study demonstrates how readily accessible field data can be used to gauge the outcomes in conditional mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Polyomaviruses (PyVs) can cause serious disease in immunosuppressed hosts. Several pathogenic PyVs encode microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that regulate gene expression via RNA silencing. Despite recent advances in understanding the activities of PyV miRNAs, the biological functions of PyV miRNAs during in vivo infections are mostly unknown. Studies presented here use murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) as a model to assess the roles of the PyV miRNAs in a natural host. This analysis reveals that a MuPyV mutant that is unable to express miRNAs has enhanced viral DNA loads in select tissues at late times after infection, indicating that during infection of a natural host, PyV miRNAs function to reduce viral replication during the persistent phase of infection. Additionally, MuPyV miRNAs promote viruria during the acute phase of infection as evidenced by a defect in shedding during infection with the miRNA mutant virus. The viruria defect of the miRNA mutant virus could be rescued by infecting Rag2-/-mice. These findings implicate miRNA activity in both the persistent and acute phases of infection and suggest a role for MuPyV miRNA in evading the adaptive immune response.\\n\\nImportanceMicroRNAs are expressed by diverse viruses, but for only a few is there any understanding of their in vivo function. PyVs can cause serious disease in immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, increased knowledge of how these viruses interact with the immune response is of possible clinical relevance. Here we show a novel activity for a viral miRNA in promoting virus shedding. This work indicates that in addition to any role for the PyV miRNA in long-term persistence, that it also has biological activity during the acute phase. As this mutant phenotype is alleviated by infection of mice lacking an effective adaptive immune response, our work also connects the in vivo activity of a PyV miRNA to the immune response. Given that PyV-associated disease is associated with alterations in the immune response, our findings may help to better understand how the balance between PyV and the immune response becomes altered in pathogenic states.",

    "abstract": "Evolved resistance to one antibiotic may be associated with \\\"collateral\\\" sensitivity to other drugs. Here we provide an extensive quantitative characterization of collateral effects in Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. By combining parallel experimental evolution with high-throughput dose-response measurements, we measure phenotypic profiles of collateral sensitivity and resistance for a total of 900 mutant-drug combinations. We find that collateral effects are pervasive but difficult to predict, as independent populations selected by the same drug can exhibit qualitatively different profiles of collateral sensitivity as well as markedly different fitness costs. Using whole-genome sequencing of evolved populations, we identified mutations in a number of known resistance determinants, including mutations in several genes previously linked with collateral sensitivity in other species. While phenotypic drug sensitivity profiles show significant diversity, they cluster into statistically similar groups characterized by selecting drugs with similar mechanisms. To exploit the statistical structure in these resistance profiles, we develop a simple mathematical model based on a stochastic control process and use it to design optimal drug policies that assign a unique drug to every possible resistance profile. Stochastic simulations reveal that these optimal drug policies outperform intuitive cycling protocols by maintaining long-term sensitivity at the expense of short-term periods of high resistance. The approach reveals a new conceptual strategy for mitigating resistance by balancing short-term inhibition of pathogen growth with infrequent use of drugs intended to steer pathogen populations to a more vulnerable future state. Experiments in laboratory populations confirm that model-inspired sequences of four drugs reduce growth and slow adaptation relative to naive protocols involving the drugs alone, in pairwise cycles, or in four-drug uniform cycles.",

We investigated the effects of multiple parameters in this protocol - the number of beads, the shape of movement, and the number of movements. Standard suspensions of Escherichia coli were spread while varying these parameters to assess their impact on colony growth. Results were assessed by a variety of metrics - the number of colonies, the mean distance between closest colonies, and the variability and uniformity of their spatial distribution. Finally, we devised a mathematical model of shifting billiard to explain the heterogeneities in the observed spatial patterns.

    "abstract": "Native protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the cornerstone for understanding the structure, dynamics and mechanisms of function of protein complexes. In this study, we investigate the association of the SAM domains of the EphA2 receptor and SHIP2 enzyme by performing a combined total of 48 s all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the native SAM heterodimer is only predicted at a low rate of 6.7% with the original CHARMM36 force field, the yield is increased to 16.7% and to 18.3% by scaling the vdW solute-solvent interactions (better fitting the solvation free energy of amino acid side chain analogues) and by an increase of vdW radius of guanidinium interactions, and thus a dramatic reduction of electrostatic interaction between Arg and Glu/Asn in CHARMM36m, respectively. These modifications effectively improve the overly sticky association of proteins, such as ubiquitin, using the original potential function. By analyzing the 25 native SAM complexes formed in the simulations, we find that their formation involves a pre-orientation guided by electrostatic interaction, consistent with an electrostatic steering mechanism. The complex could then transform to the native protein interaction surfaces directly from a well pre-orientated position ({Delta}interface-RMSD < 5[A]). In other cases, modest (< 90{degrees}) orientational and/or translational adjustments are needed (5 [A] <{Delta}i-RMSD <10 [A]) to the native complex. Although the tendency for non-native complexes to dissociate has nearly doubled with the modified potential functions, a re-association to the correct complex structure is still rare. Instead a most non-native complexes are undergoing configurational changes/surface searching, which do not lead to native structures on a timescale of 250 ns. These observations provide a rich picture on mechanisms of protein-protein complex formation, and suggest that computational predictions of native complex protein-protein interactions could be improved further.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy that arises during meiosis and/or mitosis is a major contributor to early embryo loss. We previously demonstrated that human preimplantation embryos encapsulate mis-segregated chromosomes into micronuclei while undergoing cellular fragmentation and that fragments can contain chromosomal material, but the source of this DNA was unknown. Here, we leveraged the use of a non-human primate model and single-cell DNA-sequencing (scDNA-seq) to examine the chromosomal content of 471 individual samples comprising 254 blastomeres, 42 polar bodies, and 175 cellular fragments from a large number (N=50) of disassembled rhesus cleavage-stage embryos. Our analysis revealed that the frequency of aneuploidy and micronucleation is conserved between humans and macaques and that cellular fragments encapsulate whole and/or partial chromosomes lost from blastomeres. Single-cell/fragment genotyping demonstrated that these chromosome-containing cellular fragments (CCFs) can be either maternal or paternal in origin and display DNA damage via double-stranded breaks. Chromosome breakage and abnormal cytokinesis resulted in reciprocal losses/gains at the terminal ends of chromosome arms, uniparental genome segregation, and mixoploidy between blastomeres. Combining time-lapse imaging with scDNA-seq, we also determined that multipolar divisions at the zygote or 2-cell stage generated chaotic aneuploidy encompassing a complex mixture of maternal and paternal chromosomes. Despite frequent chromosomal mis-segregation at the cleavage-stage, we show that CCFs and non-dividing aneuploid blastomeres exhibiting extensive DNA damage are prevented from incorporation at the blastocyst stage. These findings suggest that embryos respond to chromosomal errors by encapsulation into micronuclei, elimination by cellular fragmentation, and selection against highly aneuploid blastomeres to overcome chromosome instability during preimplantation development.",

HMGA1 proteins regulate gene activity both in the nucleus and within mitochondria. They are expressed mainly during embryogenesis and their upregulation in cancerous cells indicates poor prognosis. The human HMGA1a isoform is upregulated under hypoxia via oxidative stress-dependent signalling and can then bind nascent transcripts of the familial Alzheimers disease gene PSEN2 to regulate alternative splicing to produce the truncated PSEN2 protein isoform PS2V. Zebrafish where hmga1a expression is induced by hypoxia to control splicing of the psen1 gene to produce the PS2V-equivalent isoform PS1IV. Zebrafish possess a second gene with apparent HMGA1 orthology, hmga1b. Here we investigate the predicted structure of Hmga1b protein and demonstrate it to be co-orthologous to human HMGA1 and most similar in structure to human isoform HMGA1c. We show that forced over-expression of either hmga1a or hmga1b mRNA can suppress the action of the cytotoxin hydroxyurea in stimulating cell death and transcription of the genes mdm2 and cdkn1a that, in humans, are controlled by p53.

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are measurable changes associated with the disease. Without the control of homeostatic mechanisms, urine accumulates systemic body changes and thus serves as an excellent early biomarker source. However, urine is affected by many factors other than disease. Although many candidate biomarkers have been identified in animal models, a large number of clinical samples might still be required for the disease related changes. A self-controlled study should be able to avoid the interferences of individual differences among patients. Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors and have a very poor prognosis. Early diagnosis of gliomas and the monitoring of tumor recurrence are crucial to improve glioma patient outcomes. Here we set to try if biomarker candidates can be identified by comparing urine samples from five glioma patients collected at the time of tumor diagnosis and after surgical removal of the tumor. Using label-free liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) quantification, twenty-seven urinary proteins were significantly changed after tumor resection (fold change [&ge;] 1.5, P-value < 0.05, and similar changes in all 5 patients), many of which have been previously associated with gliomas, such as CEACAM1, ANXA7, CALR, CRYAB, CD276, pIgR and cathepsin D. Functions of these proteins were significantly enriched in the regulation of tissue remodeling, autophagy, the inhibition of gene expression, the positive regulation of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and angiogenesis, which are associated with glioma development. Our results suggested that using the self-control of before and after tumor resection is an effective method to identify differential proteins associated with the disease, even with a small number of patients.",

For example, Annexin A2 is known to localise to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (cell surface) where it is involved in plasminogen activation leading to fibrinolysis and cell migration, among other functions. Despite having well described extracellular functions, the mechanism of annexin transport from the cytoplasmic inner leaflet to the extracellular outer leaflet of the plasma membrane remains unclear. Here, we show that phospholipid flipping activity is crucial for the transport of annexins A2 and A5 across membranes in cells and in liposomes. We identified TMEM16F (anoctamin-6) as a lipid scramblase required for transport of these annexins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This work reveals a mechanism for annexin translocation across membranes which depends on plasma membrane phospholipid flipping.",

The budding yeast Cdc14 orthologue has essential functions in the control of late mitosis and cytokinesis. In mammals, however, the two Cdc14 homologues, Cdc14A and Cdc14B, do not play a prominent role in controlling late mitotic events, suggesting that some Cdc14 functions are not conserved across species. Moreover, in yeast, Cdc14 is regulated by changes in its subcellular location and by phosphorylation events. In contrast, little is known about the regulation of human Cdc14 phosphatases. Here, we have studied how the human Cdc14A orthologue is regulated during the cell cycle. We found that Cdc14A is phosphorylated on Ser411, Ser453 and Ser549 by Cdk1 early in mitosis and becomes dephosphorylated during late mitotic stages. Interestingly, in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that, unlike in yeast, Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of human Cdc14A did not control its catalytic activity but likely modulated its interaction with other proteins in early mitosis. These findings point to differences in Cdk1-mediated mechanisms of regulation between human and yeast Cdc14 orthologues.",

Here we uncover a novel role for EHMTs in regulating heterochromatin anchorage to the nuclear periphery (NP) via non-histone (LaminB1) methylations. We show that EHMTs methylates and stabilizes LaminB1 (LMNB1), which associates with the H3K9me2-marked peripheral heterochromatin. Loss of LMNB1 methylation or EHMTs abrogates the heterochromatin anchorage from the NP. We further demonstrate that the loss of EHMTs induces many hallmarks of aging including global reduction of H3K27methyl marks along with altered nuclear-morphology. Consistent with this, we observed a gradual depletion of EHMTs, which correlates with loss of methylated LMNB1 and peripheral heterochromatin in aging human fibroblasts. Restoration of EHMT expression reverts peripheral heterochromatin defect in aged cells. Collectively our work elucidates a new mechanism by which EHMTs regulate heterochromatin domain organization and reveals their impact on fundamental changes associated with the intrinsic aging process.",

Applied to T cell subsets such as T effector and T regulatory cells, it should help identify novel biomarkers of diseases. However, given the extreme diversity of TCR repertoires, understanding how the sequencing conditions, including cell numbers, biological and technical sampling and sequencing depth, impact the experimental outcome is critical to properly use of these data. Here we assessed the representativeness and robustness of TCR repertoire diversity assessment according to experimental conditions. By comparative analyses of experimental datasets and computer simulations, we found that (i) for small samples, the number of clonotypes recovered is often higher than the number of cells per sample, even after removing the singletons; (ii) high sequencing depth for small samples alters the clonotype distributions, which can be corrected by filtering the datasets using Shannon entropy as a threshold; (iii) a single sequencing run at high depth does not ensure a good coverage of the clonotype richness in highly polyclonal populations, which can be better covered using multiple sequencing. Altogether, our results warrant better understanding and awareness of the limitation of TCR diversity analyses by HTS and justify the development of novel computational tools for improved modelling of the highly complex nature of TCR repertoires.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi are important cellular factories for the production and secretion of homologous and heterologous enzymes such as carbohydrate-active enzymes. However, the regulation of protein secretion in these microorganisms requires more profound studies since the enzyme levels produced are usually below the levels required by industry for profitable processes. Genomic and transcriptomic approaches have been used to understand the overexpression and production of heterologous enzymes and their capacity to induce different cellular biological processes. To investigate this regulation, Aspergillus nidulans recombinant strains were analyzed by transcriptomics. We designed three A. nidulans recombinant strains producing the following heterologous proteins: alpha-arabinofuranosidase (AbfA), beta-glucosidase (BglC) and thermophilic mannanase (Tp-Man5). The heterologous genes abfA and bglC were highly expressed, while tp-man5 mRNA levels were low and similar to those of a reference gene. There was an indirect relationship between mRNA and protein secretion levels, suggesting that transcription is not a bottleneck for target gene expression in this system. Despite the distinct features of the recombinant proteins, 30 differentially expressed genes were common to all the recombinant strains, suggesting that these genes represent a general response to the expression of heterologous genes. We also showed that the early activation of the canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway by hacA alternative splicing was normalized after 8h, except in the strain expressing BglC, suggesting either no accumulation of the BglC misfolded form or the presence of an alternative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and UPR pathway. Finally, to focus our analysis on the secretion pathway, a set of 374 genes was further evaluated. Seventeen genes were common to all the recombinant strains, suggesting again that these genes represent a general response of A. nidulans cells to the overexpression of recombinant genes, even thermophilic genes. Additionally, we reported the possible genetic interactions of these 17 genes based on coexpression network calculations. Interestingly, protein improvements are nongeneric, and improvements in the production of one target protein are not necessarily transferable to another one. Thus, this study may provide genetic and cellular background and targets for genetic manipulation to improve protein secretion by A. nidulans.",

Using a tone-signaled, platform-mediated active avoidance task, we observed that pharmacological inactivation of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) delayed initiation of avoidance. However, optogenetic silencing of PL neurons did not delay avoidance. Consistent with this finding, inhibitory, but not excitatory, responses of rostral PL neurons to the tone were correlated with initiation of avoidance. To oppose inhibitory responses, we photoactivated rostral PL neurons during the tone to maintain pre-tone firing rate. Photoactivation of rostral PL (but not caudal PL) neurons at 4 Hz (but not 2 Hz) delayed or prevented avoidance. These findings suggest that the initiation of active avoidance requires inhibitory neuronal responses in rostral PL, and underscores the importance of designing behavioral optogenetic studies based on neuronal firing patterns.",

    "abstract": "The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. These models were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying this behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to symptoms of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAs neuropsychiatry begins to leverage the power of computational methods to understand disease states and to develop better therapies, it is vital that we acknowledge the trade-offs between model complexity and performance. We show that computational methods can elucidate a neural signature of feeding behavior and show how these methods could be used to discover neural patterns related to other behaviors and used as therapeutic targets. Further, our results helps to contextualize both the limitations and potential of applying computational methods to neuropsychiatry by showing how changing the data being used to train predictive models (e.g., population vs. individual data) can have a large impact on how model performance generalizes across time, internal states and individuals.",

    "abstract": "Damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) leads to a visual field loss (scotoma) in the retinotopically corresponding part of the visual field. Nonetheless, a small amount of residual visual sensitivity persists within the blind field. This residual capacity has been linked to activity observed in the middle temporal area complex (V5/MT+). However, it remains unknown whether the organization of hV5/MT+ changes following V1 lesions. We studied the organization of area hV5/MT+ of five patients with dense homonymous defects in a quadrant of the visual field as a result of partial V1+ or optic radiation lesions. To do so, we developed a new method, which models the boundaries of population receptive fields directly from the BOLD signal of each voxel in the visual cortex. We found responses in hV5/MT+ arising inside the scotoma for all patients and identified two possible sources of activation: 1) responses might originate from partially lesioned parts of area V1 corresponding to the scotoma, and 2) responses can also originate independent of area V1 input suggesting the existence of functional V1-bypassing pathways. Apparently, visually driven activity observed in hV5/MT+ is not sufficient to mediate conscious vision. More surprisingly, visually driven activity in corresponding regions of V1 and early extrastriate areas including hV5/MT+ did not guarantee visual perception in the group of patients with post-geniculate lesions that we examined. This suggests that the fine coordination of visual activity patterns across visual areas may be an important determinant of whether visual perception persists following visual cortical lesions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, of which over 2000 have been reported to date. Mutations have yet to be analyzed in aggregate to assess their distribution across the tertiary structure of the CFTR protein, an approach that could provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationship of CFTR. In addition, the binding site of Class I correctors (VX-809, VX-661, C18) is not well understood.\\n\\nMethodsExonic CFTR mutations and mutant allele frequencies described in three curated databases (ABCMdb, CFTR1 and CFTR2, comprising >130,000 data points) were mapped to two different structural models: a homology model of full-length CFTR protein in the open-channel state, and a cryo-electron microscopy core-structure of CFTR in the closed-channel state. Immunoblotting confirmed the approximate binding site of Class I correctors, and molecular docking generated binding poses for their complex with the cryo-electron microscopy structure.\\n\\nResultsResidue positions of six high-frequency mutant CFTR alleles were found to spatially co-localize in CFTR protein, and a significant cluster was identified at the NBD1:ICL4 interdomain interface. Further, Class I correctors VX-809, VX-661 and C18 were shown to act via a similar mechanism in vitro, and a putative multi-domain corrector binding site near residues F374-L375 was predicted in silico.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results confirm the significance of interdomain interfaces as susceptible to disruptive mutation, and identify a putative corrector binding site. The structural pharmacogenomics approach of mapping mutation databases to protein models shows promise for facilitating drug discovery and personalized medicine for monogenetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The in-vitro fabrication of hierarchical biological systems such as human vasculature, which are made up of two or more cell types with intricate co-culture architectures, is by far one of the most complicated challenges that tissue engineers have faced. Here, we introduce a versatile method to create multi-layered, cell-laden hydrogel microstructures with coaxial geometries and heterogeneous mechanical and biological properties. The technique can be used to build in-vitro vascular networks that are fully embedded in hydrogels of physiologically realistic mechanical stiffness. Our technique produces free-standing 3D structures, eliminating rigid polymeric surfaces from the vicinity of cells and allowing layers of multiple cell types to be defined with tailored extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and stiffness, and in direct contact with each other. We demonstrate co-axial geometries with diameters ranging from 200-2000 m and layer thicknesses as small as 50-200 {micro}m in agarose- collagen (AC) composite hydrogels. Coaxial geometries with such fine feature sizes are beyond the capabilities of most bioprinting techniques. A potential application of such a structure is to simulate vascular networks in the brain with endothelial cells surrounded by multiple layers of pericytes and other glial cells. For this purpose, the composition and mechanical properties of the composite AC hydrogels have been optimized for cell viability and biological performance of endothelial and glial cell types in both 2D and 3D culture modes. Multi-layered vascular constructs with an endothelial layer surrounded by layers of glial cells have been fabricated. This prototype in-vitro model resembles vascular geometries and opens the way for complex multi-luminal blood vessels to be fabricated.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerge as important regulators of various biological processes. Many lncRNAs with tumor-suppressor or oncogenic functions in cancer have been discovered. While many studies have exploited public resources such as RNA-Seq data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to study lncRNAs in cancer, it is crucial to choose the optimal method for accurate expression quantification of lncRNAs. In this benchmarking study, we compared the performance of pseudoalignment methods Kallisto and Salmon, and alignment-based methods HTSeq, featureCounts, and RSEM, in lncRNA quantification, by applying them to a simulated RNA-Seq dataset and a pan-cancer RNA-Seq dataset from TCGA. We observed that full transcriptome annotation, including both protein coding and noncoding RNAs, greatly improves the specificity of lncRNA expression quantification. Pseudoalignment-based methods detect more lncRNAs than alignment-based methods and correlate highly with simulated ground truth. On the contrary, alignment-based methods tend to underestimate lncRNA expression or even fail to capture lncRNA signal in the ground truth. These underestimated genes include cancer-relevant lncRNAs such as TERC and ZEB2-AS1. Overall, 10-16% of lncRNAs can be detected in the samples, with antisense and lincRNAs the two most abundant categories. A higher proportion of antisense RNAs are detected than lincRNAs. Moreover, among the expressed lncRNAs, more antisense RNAs are discordant from ground truth than lincRNAs when measured by alignment-based methods, indicating that antisense RNAs are more susceptible to mis-quantification. In addition, the lncRNAs with fewer transcripts, less than three exons, and lower sequence uniqueness tend to be more discordant. In summary, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto or Salmon in combination with the full transcriptome annotation is our recommended strategy for RNA-Seq analysis for lncRNAs.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerge as important regulators of various biological processes. Our benchmarking work on both simulated RNA-Seq dataset and pan-cancer dataset provides timely and useful recommendations for wide research community who are studying lncRNAs, especially for those who are exploring public resources such as TCGA RNA-Seq data. We demonstrate that using full transcriptome annotation in RNA-Seq analysis is strongly recommended as it greatly improves the specificity of lncRNA quantification. Whats more, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto and Salmon outperform alignment-based methods in lncRNA quantification. It is worth noting that the default workflow for TCGA RNA-Seq data stored in Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal uses HTSeq, an alignment-based method. Thus, reanalyzing the data might be considered when checking gene expression in TCGA datasets. In summary, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto or Salmon in combination with full transcriptome annotation is our recommended strategy for RNA-Seq analysis for lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Here we present an open-source R package  meaRtools that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL>=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCultured neuronal networks are widely used to study and characterize neuronal network activity. Among the many uses of neuronal cultures are the capabilities to evaluate neurotoxicity and the effects of pharmacological compounds on cellular physiology. Multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can collect high-throughput data from multiple neuronal cultures simultaneously, and thereby make possible hypotheses-driven inquiries into neurobiology and neuropharmacology. The analysis of MEA-derived information presents many computational challenges. High frequency data recorded simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes can be difficult to handle. The need to compare network activity across various drug treatments or genotypes recorded on the same plate from experiments lasting several weeks presents another challenge. These challenges inspired us to develop meaRtools; an MEA data analysis package that contains new methods to characterize network activity patterns, which are illustrated here using examples from a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Among the highlights of meaRtools are novel algorithms designed to characterize neuronal activity dynamics and network properties such as bursting and synchronization, options to combine multiple recordings and use a robust statistical framework to draw appropriate statistical inferences, and finally data visualizations and plots. In summary, meaRtools provides a platform for the analyses of singular and longitudinal MEA experiments.",

    "abstract": "The development of malaria parasites throughout their various life cycle stages is controlled by coordinated changes in gene expression. We previously showed that the three-dimensional organization of the P. falciparum genome is strongly associated with gene expression during its replication cycle inside red blood cells. Here, we analyzed genome organization in the P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission stages. Major changes occurred in the localization and interactions of genes involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion, erythrocyte and liver cell invasion, sexual differentiation and master regulation of gene expression. In addition, we observed reorganization of subtelomeric heterochromatin around genes involved in host cell remodeling. Depletion of heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1) resulted in loss of interactions between virulence genes, confirming that PfHP1 is essential for maintenance of the repressive center. Overall, our results suggest that the three-dimensional genome structure is strongly connected with transcriptional activity of specific gene families throughout the life cycle of human malaria parasites.",
