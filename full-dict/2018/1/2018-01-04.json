    "abstract": "Nitric oxide, synthesised by three isoforms of Nitric Oxide synthases viz., nNOS by neurons, eNOS by endothelial cells and iNOS by phagocytes, performs a wide variety of biological functions in neurons, vascular endothelial cells and immune cells. Interaction between inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) was observed both in human monocytes and mouse macrophages and in cell free systems by biophysical methods. A novel mutation in nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (NOSIP) determined NO levels produced by human monocytes and was associated with disease severity in Sepsis patients. The study reveals NOSIP as an important regulator of inflammation by virtue of its ability to influence nitric oxide production both in mice and in humans and opens up novel avenues for therapeutic strategies against acute inflammation. While the influence of this novel NOSIP polymorphism in cardio-vascular and neuronal functions could be a subject of future investigations, its role in determining disease severity and mortality of the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic will be of immediate relevance.",

    "abstract": "The readiness potential (RP)--a key ERP correlate of upcoming action--is known to precede subjects reports of their decision to move. Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. Yet those studies focused on arbitrary decisions--purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary--but not deliberate--decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extent of human free will has been debated for millennia. Previous studies demonstrated that neural precursors of action--especially the readiness potential--precede subjects reports of deciding to move. Some viewed this as evidence against free-will. However, these experiments focused on arbitrary decisions--e.g., randomly raising the left or right hand. We directly compared deliberate (actual $1000 donations to NPOs) and arbitrary decisions, and found readiness potentials before arbitrary decisions, but--critically--not before deliberate decisions. This supports the interpretation of readiness potentials as byproducts of accumulation of random fluctuations in arbitrary but not deliberate decisions and points to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary choice. Hence, it challenges the generalizability of previous results from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Different coding strategies are used to represent odor information at various stages of the mammalian olfactory system. A temporal latency code represents odor identity in olfactory bulb (OB), but this temporal information is discarded in piriform cortex (PCx) where odor identity is instead encoded through ensemble membership. We developed a spiking PCx network model to understand how this transformation is implemented. In the model, the impact of OB inputs activated earliest after inhalation is amplified within PCx by diffuse recurrent collateral excitation, which then recruits strong, sustained feedback inhibition that suppresses the impact of later-responding glomeruli. Simultaneous OB-PCx recordings indicate that indeed, over a single sniff, the earliest-active OB inputs are most effective at driving PCx activity. We model increasing odor concentrations by decreasing glomerulus onset latencies while preserving their activation sequences. This produces a multiplexed cortical odor code in which activated ensembles are robust to concentration changes while concentration information is encoded through population synchrony. Our model demonstrates how PCx circuitry can implement multiplexed ensemble-identity/temporal-concentration odor coding.",

Although such theories have become very influential, evidence that physically attractive and unattractive women have different hormonal profiles is equivocal. Consequently, we investigated hypothesized relationships between salivary estradiol and progesterone and two aspects of womens physical attractiveness that are commonly assumed to be correlated with levels of these hormones: facial attractiveness (N=249) and waist-to-hip ratio (N=247). Our analyses revealed no evidence that women with more attractive faces or lower (i.e., more attractive) waist-to-hip ratios had higher levels of estradiol or progesterone.

    "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome have neurological and muscle impairments due to an additional copy of the human 21st chromosome (HSA21). Only a few of ~200 HSA21 genes encoding protein have been linked to specific Down syndrome phenotypes, while the remainder are understudied. To identify poorly characterized HSA21 genes required for nervous system function, we studied behavioral phenotypes caused by loss-of-function mutations in conserved HSA21 orthologs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We identified ten HSA21 orthologs that are required for neuromuscular behaviors: cle-1 (COL18A1), cysl-2 (CBS), dnsn-1 (DONSON), eva-1 (EVA1C), mtq-2 (N6ATM1), ncam-1 (NCAM2), pad-2 (POFUT2), pdxk-1 (PDXK), rnt-1 (RUNX1), and unc-26 (SYNJ1). We also found that three of these genes are required for normal release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This includes a known synaptic gene unc-26 (SYNJ1), as well as uncharacterized genes pdxk-1 (PDXK) and mtq-2 (N6ATM1). As the first systematic functional analysis of HSA21 orthologs, this study may serve as a platform to understand genes that underlie phenotypes associated with Down syndrome.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYDown syndrome causes neurological and muscle dysfunction due to an extra 21st chromosome. This chromosome has over 200 genes, most of which are understudied. To address this, we studied whether reducing function of these gene equivalents in the worm C. elegans caused neuronal or muscle defects. We identified ten genes conserved between human and worm that mediate function of behaviors. Among these, we show the uncharacterized genes mtq-2 and pdxk-1 are important for synaptic transmission and are exclusively expressed in nervous system. Our analysis may reveal functions of poorly studied genes that affect nervous system function in Down syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away. This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds. Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the  null space of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing. Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics1-4: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans5,6 and monkeys7. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory8,9 predict that optogenetic silencing of this region would impair behavior in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC significantly improved performance. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rats PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic sequencing is becoming widespread in biomedical and environmental research, and the pace is increasing even more thanks to nanopore sequencing. With a rising number of samples and data per sample, the challenge of efficiently comparing results within a specimen and between specimens arises. Reagents, laboratory, and host related contaminants complicate such analysis. Contamination is particularly critical in low microbial biomass body sites and environments, where it can comprise most of a sample if not all. Recentrifuge implements a robust method for the removal of negative-control and crossover taxa from the rest of samples. With Recentrifuge, researchers can analyze results from taxonomic classifiers using interactive charts with emphasis on the confidence level of the classifications. In addition to contamination-subtracted samples, Recentrifuge provides shared and exclusive taxa per sample, thus enabling robust contamination removal and comparative analysis in clinical and environmental metagenomics.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhether in a clinical or environmental sample, metagenomics can reveal what microorganisms exist and what they do. It is indeed a powerful tool for the study of microbial communities which requires equally powerful methods of analysis. Current challenges in the analysis of metagenomic data include the comparative study of samples, the degree of uncertainty in the results, and the removal of contamination. The scarcer the microbes are in an environment, the more essential it is to have solutions to these issues. Examples of sites with few microbes are not only habitats with low levels of nutrients, but also many body tissues and fluids. Recentrifuges novel approach combines statistical, mathematical and computational methods to tackle those challenges with efficiency and robustness: it seamlessly removes diverse contamination, provides a confidence level for every result, and unveils the generalities and specificities in the metagenomic samples.",

One enrolled prospectively (PCS, Jan. 2013 to April 2015) through volunteer sampling, and followed until delivery, 600 malaria-infected and non-infected pregnant women. The other assembled retrospectively (RCS, Jan. 2012 to Dec. 2013) clinical and malaria data from 4697 pregnant women selected through population-based sampling. The effects of malaria during pregnancy in the newborns were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression. According with World Health Organization guidelines babies were classified in small head (HC < 1 SD below the median) and microcephaly (HC < 2 SD below the median) using international HC standards.\\n\\nResultsAnalysis of 251 (PCS) and 232 (RCS) malaria-infected, and 158 (PCS) and 3650 (RCS) non-infected women with clinical data and anthropometric measures of their babies was performed. Among the newborns, 70 (17.1%) in the PCS and 934 (24.1%) in the RCS presented with a small head (SH). Of these, 15 (3.7%) and 161 (4.2%), respectively, showed microcephaly (MC). The prevalence of newborns with a SH (30.7% in PCS and 36.6% in RCS) and MC (8.1% in PCS and 7.3% in RCS) was higher among babies born from women infected with Plasmodium falciparum during pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that P. falciparum infection during pregnancy represents a significant increased odds for the occurrence of a SH in newborns (PCS: OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.52-6.53, p=0.002; RCS: OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.21-3.04, p=0.006). Similarly, there is an increased odds of MC in babies born from mothers that were P. falciparum-infected (PCS: OR 5.09, 95% CI 1.12-23.17, p=0.035). Moreover, characterization of placental pathology corroborates the association analysis, particularly through the occurrence of more syncytial nuclear aggregates and inflammatory infiltrates in placentas from babies with the reduced head circumference.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work indicates that falciparum-malaria during pregnancy presents an increased likelihood of occurring reduction of head circumference in newborns, which is associated with placental malaria.\\n\\nTrial Registrationregistered as RBR-3yrqfq in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry",

To investigate the etiology of this inflammation, the effect of HIV-1 on innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and NK cells was examined. Homeostatic ILCs in blood and intestine were depleted permanently. NK cells were skewed towards a memory subset. Cytokines that are elevated during HIV-1 infection reproduced both abnormalities ex vivo. Pseudotime analysis of single NK cell transcriptomes revealed a developmental trajectory towards a subset with expression profile, chromatin state, and biological function like memory T lymphocytes. Expression of TCF7, a WNT transcription factor, increased over the course of the trajectory. TCF7 disruption, or WNT inhibition, prevented memory NK cell induction by inflammatory cytokines.

    "abstract": "Yeonsan Ogye (YO), an indigenous Korean chicken breed (gallus gallus domesticus), has entirely black external features and internal organs. In this study, the draft genome of YO was assembled using a hybrid de novo assembly method that takes advantage of high-depth Illumina short-reads (232.2X) and low-depth PacBio long-reads (11.5X). Although the contig and scaffold N50s (defined as the shortest contig or scaffold length at 50% of the entire assembly) of the initial de novo assembly were 53.6Kbp and 10.7Mbp, respectively, additional and pseudo-reference-assisted assemblies extended the assembly to 504.8Kbp for contig N50 (pseudo-contig) and 21.2Mbp for scaffold N50, which included 551 structural variations including the Fibromelanosis (FM) locus duplication, compared to galGal4 and 5. The completeness (97.6%) of the draft genome (Ogye_1) was evaluated with single copy orthologous genes using BUSCO, and found to be comparable to the current chicken reference genome (galGal5; 97.4%), which was assembled with a long read-only method, and superior to other avian genomes (92~93%), assembled with short read-only and hybrid methods. To comprehensively reconstruct transcriptome maps, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data were analyzed from twenty different tissues, including black tissues. The maps included 15,766 protein-coding and 6,900 long non-coding RNA genes, many of which were expressed in the tissue-specific manner, closely related with the DNA methylation pattern in the promoter regions.",

    "abstract": "Decision bias is traditionally conceptualized as an internal reference against which sensory evidence is compared. Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation towards a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation towards target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2-6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8--12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. The alpha suppression in turn mediated the output activity of visual cortex, as expressed in 59--100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation towards the decision bound that maximizes their reward.",

    "abstract": "Negative emotionality is a well-established and stable risk factor for affective disorders. Individual differences in negative emotionality have been linked to associative learning processes which can be captured experimentally in fear conditioning paradigms. Literature suffers from underpowered samples, suboptimal methods, and an isolated focus on single questionnaires and single outcome measures. Here, we apply multivariate and dimensional approaches for three commonly investigated questionnaires in the field (STAI-T, NEO-FFI Neuroticism, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale) across multiple analysis units (ratings, skin conductance, startle, BOLD-fMRI) during fear acquisition-training in two large samples (NStudy1=356; NStudy2=113). We investigate whether the specific or shared variance of these questionnaires is linked with CS-discrimination in specific outcome measures (Study 1). We identify a significant negative association between STAI-T and CS-discrimination in SCRs and between Intolerance of Uncertainty and CS-discrimination in startle responding. Yet, correlation coefficients for all questionnaire-outcome measure combinations did not differ significantly from each other. In Study 2 the STAI-T score was positively associated with CS-discrimination in a number of brain areas linked to conditioned fear (amygdala, putamen, thalamus), but not to SCRs or ratings. Importantly, we replicate potential sampling biases between fMRI and behavioral studies regarding anxiety levels. We discuss the implications of these results.",

The genetic risk component is high with heritability estimates of 518-70%9. Here we report the first genome-wide significant risk locus for cannabis use disorder (CUD, P=9.31x10-12) that replicates in an independent population (Preplication=3.27x10-3, Pmetaanalysis=9.09x10-12). The finding is based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,387 cases and 48,985 controls followed by replication in 5,501 cases and 301,041 controls. The index SNP (rs56372821) is a strong eQTL for CHRNA2 and analyses of the genetic regulated gene expressions identified significant association of CHRNA2 expression in cerebellum with CUD. This indicates a potential therapeutic use in CUD of compounds with agonistic effect on the neuronal acetylcholine receptor alpha-2 subunit encoded by CHRNA2. At the polygenic level analyses revealed a significant decrease in the risk of CUD with increased load of variants associated with cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate through Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). Neurotransmitter release properties play a key role in defining information flow in circuits and are tuned during multiple forms of plasticity. Despite their central role in determining neurotransmitter release properties, little is known about how Ca2+ channel levels are modulated to calibrate synaptic function. We used CRISPR to tag the Drosophila CaV2 Ca2+ channel Cacophony (Cac) and investigated the regulation of endogenous Ca2+ channels during homeostatic plasticity in males in which all endogenous Cac channels are tagged. We found that heterogeneously distributed Cac is highly predictive of neurotransmitter release probability at individual AZs and differentially regulated during opposing forms of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Specifically, Cac levels at AZ are increased during chronic and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP), and live imaging during acute expression of PHP reveals proportional Ca2+ channel accumulation across heterogeneous AZs. In contrast, endogenous Cac levels do not change during presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD), implying that the reported reduction in Ca2+ influx during PHD is achieved through functional adaptions to pre-existing Ca2+ channels. Thus, distinct mechanisms bi-directionally modulate presynaptic Ca2+ levels to maintain stable synaptic strength in response to diverse challenges, with Ca2+ channel abundance providing a rapidly tunable substrate for potentiating neurotransmitter release over both acute and chronic timescales.",

    "abstract": "Gemin4 is a member of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein complex, which is responsible for the assembly and maturation of Sm-class small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). In metazoa, Sm snRNPs are assembled in the cytoplasm and subsequently imported into the nucleus. We previously showed that the SMN complex is required for snRNP import in vitro, although it remains unclear which specific components direct this process. Here, we report that Gemin4 overexpression drives SMN and the other Gemin proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Moreover, it disrupts the subnuclear localization of the Cajal body marker protein, coilin, in a dose-dependent manner. We identified three putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs within Gemin4, one of which is necessary and sufficient to direct nuclear import. Overexpression of Gemin4 constructs lacking this NLS sequestered Gemin3 and, to a lesser extent Gemin2, in the cytoplasm but had little effect on the nuclear accumulation of SMN. We also investigated the effects of Gemin4 depletion in the laboratory mouse, mus musculus. Gemin4 null mice die early in embryonic development, demonstrating that Gemin4 is an essential mammalian protein. When crossed onto a severe SMA mutant background, heterozygous loss of Gemin4 failed to modify the early postnatal mortality phenotype of SMA type I (Smn-/-;SMN2+/+) mice. We conclude that Gemin4 plays an essential role in mammalian snRNP biogenesis, and may facilitate import of the SMN complex (or subunits thereof) into the nucleus.",

These progenitors, called Neural Mesodermal Progenitors (NMPs) are identified as cells coexpressing Sox2 and T/Brachyury, a criterion used to derive NMP-like cells from Embryonic Stem Cells in vitro. However, these progenitors do not self renew, as embryonic NMPs do. Here we find that protocols that yield NMP-like cells in vitro first produce a multipotent population that, additional to NMPs, generates progenitors for the lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm. We show that Epiblast Stem Cells (EpiSCs) are an effective source for these multipotent progenitors that are further differentiated by a balance between BMP and Nodal signalling. Importantly, we show that NMP-like cells derived from EpiSCs self renew in vitro and exhibit a gene expression signature similar to that of their embryo counterparts.",

    "abstract": "For more than a century researchers have been comparing embryogenesis and regeneration hoping that lessons learned from embryonic development will unlock hidden regenerative potential. This problem has historically been a difficult one to investigate since the best regenerative model systems are poor embryonic models and vice versa. Recently however, the comparison of embryogenesis and regeneration has seen renewed interest as emerging models including the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis have allowed researchers to investigate these processes in the same organism. This interest has been further fueled by the advent of high-throughput transcriptomic analyses that provide virtual mountains of data. Unfortunately much of this data remains in raw unanalyzed formats that are difficult to access or browse. Here we present Nematostella vectensis Embryogenesis and Regeneration Transcriptomics - NvERTx, the first platform for comparing gene expression during embryogenesis and regeneration. NvERTx is comprised of close to 50 RNAseq datasets spanning embryogenesis and regeneration in Nematostella. These data were used to perform a robust de novo transcriptome assembly which users can search, BLAST and plot expression of multiple genes during these two developmental processes. The site is also home to the results of gene clustering analyses, to further mine the data and identify groups of co-expressed genes. The site can be accessed at http://nvertx.kahikai.org.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new algorithm to automatically segment the myofibrils, mitochondria and nuclei within single adult cardiac cells that are part of a large serial-block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) dataset. The algorithm only requires a set of manually drawn contours that roughly demarcate the cell boundary at routine slice intervals (every 50th, for example). The algorithm correctly classified pixels within the single cell with 97% accuracy when compared to manual segmentations. One entire cell and the partial volumes of two cells were segmented. Analysis of segmentations within these cells showed that myofibrils and mitochondria occupied 47.5% and 51.6% on average respectively, while the nuclei occupy 0.7% of the cell for which the entire volume was captured in the SBF-SEM dataset. Mitochondria clustering increased at the periphery of the nucleus region and branching points of the cardiac cell. The segmentations also showed high area fraction of mitochondria (up to 70% of the 2D image slice) in the sub-sarcolemmal region, whilst it was closer to 50% in the intermyofibrillar space. We finally demonstrate that our segmentations can be turned into 3D finite element meshes for cardiac cell computational physiology studies. We offer our large dataset and MATLAB implementation of the algorithm for research use at www.github.com/CellSMB/sbfsem-cardiac-cell-segmenter/. We anticipate that this timely tool will be of use to cardiac computational and experimental physiologists alike who study cardiac ultrastructure and its role in heart function.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer-induced mortality among women with 2.4 million new cases diagnosed and 523,000 deaths per year. Historically, a diagnosis has been initially performed using clinical screening followed by histopathological analysis. Automated classification of cancers using histopathological images is a chciteallenging task of accurate detection of tumor sub-types. This process could be facilitated by machine learning approaches, which may be more reliable and economical compared to conventional methods.\\n\\nTo prove this principle, we applied fine-tuned pre-trained deep neural networks. To test the approach we first classify different cancer types using 6, 402 tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) training samples. Our framework accurately detected on average 99.8% of the four cancer types including breast, bladder, lung and lymphoma using the ResNet V1 50 pre-trained model. Then, for classification of breast cancer sub-types this approach was applied to 7,909 images from the BreakHis database. In the next step, ResNet V1 152 classified benign and malignant breast cancers with an accuracy of 98.7%. In addition, ResNet V1 50 and ResNet V1 152 categorized either benign- (adenosis, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, and tubular adenoma) or malignant- (ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma) sub-types with 94.8% and 96.4% accuracy, respectively. The confusion matrices revealed high sensitivity values of 1, 0.995 and 0.993 for cancer types, as well as malignant- and benign sub-types respectively. The areas under the curve (AUC) scores were 0.996,0.973 and 0.996 for cancer types, malignant and benign sub-types, respectively. Overall, our results show negligible false negative (on average 3.7 samples) and false positive (on average 2 samples) results among different models.

    "abstract": "Activation of acid sphingomyelinase (SMPD1) and the generation of ceramide is a critical regulator of apoptosis in response to cellular stress including radiation. Endothelial SMPD1 has been shown to regulate tumor responses to radiation therapy. We show here that the SMPD1 gene is regulated by a microRNA (miR), miR-15a, in endothelial cells (ECs). Standard low dose radiation (2 Gy) upregulates miR-15a and decreases SMPD1 levels. In contrast, high dose radiation (10 Gy and above) decreases miR-15a and increases SMPD1. Ectopic expression of miR-15a decreases both mRNA and protein levels of SMPD1. Mimicking the effects of high dose radiation with a miR-15a inhibitor decreases cell proliferation and increases active Caspase-3 & 7. Mechanistically, inhibition of miR-15a increases inflammatory cytokines, such as IP10, activates caspase-1 inflammasome and increases Gasdermin D, an effector of pyroptosis. Importantly, both systemic and vascular-targeted delivery of miR-15a inhibitor decreases angiogenesis and tumor growth in a CT26 murine colorectal carcinoma model. Taken together, our findings highlight a novel role for miR mediated regulation of SMPD1 during radiation responses and establish proof-of-concept that this pathway can be targeted with a miR inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "One Sentence SummaryDNA replication establishes asymmetric epigenomes\n\nSummaryOne of the most fundamental questions in developmental biology concerns how cells with identical genomes differentiate into distinct cell types. One important context for understanding cell fate specification is asymmetric cell division, where the two daughter cells establish different cell fates following a single division. Many stem cells undergo asymmetric division to produce both a self-renewing stem cell and a differentiating daughter cell1-5. Here we show that histone H4 is inherited asymmetrically in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila male germline stem cells, similar to H36. In contrast, both H2A and H2B are inherited symmetrically. By combining superresolution microscopy with the chromatin fiber method, we are able to study histone inheritance patterns on newly replicated chromatin fibers. Using this technique, we find asymmetric inheritance patterns for old and new H3, but symmetric inheritance patterns for old and new H2A on replicating sister chromatids. Furthermore, co-localization studies on isolated chromatin fibers and proximity ligation assays on intact nuclei reveal that old H3 are preferentially incorporated by the leading strand while newly synthesized H3 are enriched on the lagging strand. Finally, using a sequential nucleoside analog incorporation assay, we detect a high incidence of unidirectional DNA replication on germline-derived chromatin fibers and DNA fibers. The unidirectional fork movement coupled with the strand preference of histone incorporation could explain how old and new H3 are asymmetrically incorporated by replicating sister chromatids. In summary, our work demonstrates that the intrinsic asymmetries in DNA replication may help construct sister chromatids enriched with distinct populations of histones. Therefore, these results suggest unappreciated roles for DNA replication in asymmetrically dividing cells in multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "The high degree of endemism on Sulawesi has previously been suggested to have vicariant origins, dating back 40 Myr ago. Recent studies, however, suggest that much of Sulawesis fauna assembled over the last 15 Myr. Here, we test the hypothesis that recent uplift of previously submerged portions of land on Sulawesi promoted diversification, and that much of the its faunal assemblage is much younger than the island itself. To do so, we combined palaeogeographical reconstructions with genetic and morphometric data sets derived from Sulawesis three largest mammals: the Babirusa, Anoa, and Sulawesi warty pig. Our results indicate that although these species most likely colonized the area that is now Sulawesi at different times (14 Myr ago to 2-3 Myr ago), they experienced an almost synchronous expansion from the central part of the island. Geological reconstructions indicate that this area was above sea level for most of the last 4 Myr, unlike most parts of the island. We conclude that recent emergence of land on Sulawesi (~1-2 Myr) may have allowed species to expand synchronously. Altogether, our results indicates that the establishment of the highly endemic faunal assemblage on Sulawesi was driven by geological events over the last few million years.",

Previous studies have found common genetic factors that influence educational achievement, cognitive performance and total brain volume (i.e., brain size). Here, in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank, we investigate the shared genetic basis between educational attainment and fine-grained cerebral cortical morphological features, and associate this genetic variation with a related aspect of cognitive ability. Importantly, we execute novel statistical methods that enable high-dimensional genetic correlation analysis, and compute high-resolution surface maps for the genetic correlations between educational attainment and vertex-wise morphological measurements. We conduct secondary analyses, using the UK Biobank verbal-numerical reasoning score, to confirm that variation in educational attainment that is genetically correlated with cortical morphology is related to differences in cognitive performance. Our analyses reveal the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and cortical thickness measurements in bilateral primary motor cortex and predominantly left superior temporal cortex and proximal regions. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the neurobiology that connects genetic variation to individual differences in educational attainment and cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTopological association domains (TADs) are chromosomal domains characterised by frequent internal DNA-DNA interactions. The transcription factor CTCF binds to conserved DNA sequence patterns called CTCF binding motifs to either prohibit or facilitate chromosomal interactions. TADs and CTCF binding motifs control gene expression, but they are not yet well defined in the bovine genome. In this paper, we sought to improve the annotation of bovine TADs and CTCF binding motifs, and assess whether the new annotation can reduce the search space for cis-regulatory variants.\\n\\nResultsWe used genomic synteny to map TADs and CTCF binding motifs from humans, mice, dogs and macaques to the bovine genome. We found that our mapped TADs exhibited the same hallmark properties of those sourced from experimental data, such as housekeeping gene, tRNA genes, CTCF binding motifs, SINEs, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Then we showed that runs of genes with the same pattern of allele-specific expression (ASE) (either favouring paternal or maternal allele) were often located in the same TAD or between the same conserved CTCF binding motifs. Analyses of variance showed that when averaged across all bovine tissues tested, TADs explained 14% of ASE variation (standard deviation, SD: 0.056), while CTCF explained 27% (SD: 0.078). Furthermore, we showed that the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with gene expression variation (eQTLs) or ASE variation (aseQTLs), which were identified from mRNA transcripts from 141 lactating cows white blood and milk cells, were highly enriched at putative bovine CTCF binding motifs. The most significant aseQTL and eQTL for each genic target were located within the same TAD as the gene more often than expected (Chi-Squared test P-value [&le;] 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that genomic synteny can be used to functionally annotate conserved transcriptional components, and provides a tool to reduce the search space for causative regulatory variants in the bovine genome.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making is often interpreted in terms of normative computations that maximize a particular reward function for stable, average behaviors. Aberrations from the reward-maximizing solutions, either across subjects or across different sessions for the same subject, are often interpreted as reflecting poor learning or physical limitations. Here we show that such aberrations may instead reflect the involvement of additional satisficing and heuristic principles. For an asymmetric-reward perceptual decision-making task, three monkeys produced adaptive biases in response to changes in reward asymmetries and perceptual sensitivity. Their choices and response times were consistent with a normative accumulate-to-bound process. However, their context-dependent adjustments to this process deviated slightly but systematically from the reward-maximizing solutions. These adjustments were instead consistent with a rational process to find satisficing solutions based on the gradient of each monkeys reward-rate function. These results suggest new dimensions for assessing the rational and idiosyncratic aspects of flexible decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Place cells in the mammalian hippocampus signal self-location with sparse spatially stable firing fields. Based on observation of place cell activity it is possible to accurately decode an animals location. The precision of this decoding sets a lower bound for the amount of information that the hippocampal population conveys about the location of the animal. In this work we use a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder to infer the location of freely moving rats from single unit hippocampal recordings. RNNs are biologically plausible models of neural circuits that learn to incorporate relevant temporal context without the need to make complicated assumptions about the use of prior information to predict the current state. When decoding animal position from spike counts in 1D and 2D-environments, we show that the RNN consistently outperforms a standard Bayesian model with flat priors. In addition, we also conducted a set of sensitivity analysis on the RNN decoder to determine which neurons and sections of firing fields were the most influential. We found that the application of RNNs to neural data allowed flexible integration of temporal context, yielding improved accuracy relative to a commonly used Bayesian approach and opens new avenues for exploration of the neural code.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBeing able to accurately self-localize is critical for most motile organisms. In mammals, place cells in the hippocampus appear to be a central component of the brain network responsible for this ability. In this work we recorded the activity of a population of hippocampal neurons from freely moving rodents and carried out neural decoding to determine the animals locations. We found that a machine learning approach using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allowed us to predict the rodents true positions more accurately than a standard Bayesian method with flat priors. The RNNs are able to take into account past neural activity without making assumptions about the statistics of neuronal firing. Further, by analyzing the representations learned by the network we were able to determine which neurons, and which aspects of their activity, contributed most strongly to the accurate decoding.",

Here we introduce a large-scale, multi-site recording platform that integrates polymer electrodes with a modular stacking headstage design supporting up to 1024 recording channels in freely behaving rats. This system can support months-long recordings from hundreds of well-isolated units across multiple brain regions. Moreover, these recordings are stable enough to track 25% of single units for over a week. This platform enables large-scale electrophysiological interrogation of the fast dynamics and long-timescale evolution of anatomically distributed circuits, and thereby provides a new tool for understanding brain activity.",

Replay is observed during hippocampal sharp-wave ripple-associated population burst events and is critical for consolidation and recall-guided behaviors. To present, population burst event (PBE) activity has been analyzed as a phenomenon subordinate to the place code. Here, we use hidden Markov models to study PBEs observed during exploration of both linear mazes and open fields. We demonstrate that estimated models are consistent with temporal replay sequences and that the latent states correspond to a spatial map of the environment. Moreover, we demonstrate the identification of hippocampal replay without recourse to the place code, using only PBE model congruence. These results suggest that downstream regions may rely on PBEs to form a substrate for memory. Additionally, by forming models independent of animal behavior, we lay the groundwork for studies of non-spatial memory.",

    "abstract": "In mammals olfactory sensation depends on inhalation, which controls activation of sensory neurons and temporal patterning of central activity. Odor representations by mitral and tufted (MT) cells, the main output from the olfactory bulb (OB), reflect sensory input as well as excitation and inhibition from OB circuits, which may change as sniff frequency increases. To test the impact of sampling frequency on MT cell odor responses, we obtained whole-cell recordings from MT cells in anesthetized male and female mice while varying inhalation frequency via tracheotomy, allowing comparison of inhalation-linked responses across cells. We characterized frequency effects on MT cell responses during inhalation of air and odorants using inhalation pulses and also  playback of sniffing recorded from awake mice. Inhalation-linked changes in membrane potential were well-predicted across frequency from linear convolution of 1 Hz responses and, as frequency increased, near-identical temporal responses could emerge from depolarizing, hyperpolarizing or multiphasic MT responses. However, net excitation was not well predicted from 1 Hz responses and varied substantially across MT cells, with some cells increasing and others decreasing in spike rate. As a result, sustained odorant sampling at higher frequencies led to increasing decorrelation of the MT cell population response pattern over time. Bulk activation of sensory inputs by optogenetic stimulation affected MT cells more uniformly across frequency, suggesting that frequency-dependent decorrelation emerges from odor-specific patterns of activity in the OB network. These results suggest that sampling behavior alone can reformat early sensory representations, possibly to optimize sensory perception during repeated sampling.\\n\\nSignificance statementOlfactory sensation in mammals depends on inhalation, which increases in frequency during active sampling of olfactory stimuli. We asked how inhalation frequency can shape the neural coding of odor information by recording from projection neurons of the olfactory bulb while artificially varying odor sampling frequency in the anesthetized mouse. We found that sampling an odor at higher frequencies led to diverse changes in net responsiveness, as measured by action potential output, that were not predicted from low-frequency responses. These changes led to a reorganization of the pattern of neural activity evoked by a given odorant that occurred preferentially during sustained, high-frequency inhalation. These results point to a novel mechanism for modulating early sensory representations solely as a function of sampling behavior.",

Bursting is influenced by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are not implicated in reinforcement learning, but rather in exploration and uncertainty-seeking. The leading model assigns these functions to tonic dopamine firing. To investigate this paradox, we recorded the activity of VTA dopamine neurons during a spatial decision-making task. When reward was certain, mice adopted a stereotyped behavior, and dopamine neurons signaled reward. When confronted with uncertain rewards or a novel environment, mice exhibited exploration. Modulation of phasic, but not tonic, dopamine activity predicted uncertainty-seeking and locomotor exploration. Deletion of nAChRs disrupted the influence of uncertainty and novelty on dopamine firing and behavior, sparing reward signaling and learning. Hence, nAChR modulation of dopamine neurons can influence cognitive functions on a short timescale, through the modulation of phasic, synchronous bursting.",

Harnessing the flexibility of the GreenGate cloning system, we produced a comprehensive set of GR-LhG4 driver lines targeting most tissues in the Arabidopsis shoot and root with a strong focus on the indeterminate meristems. We show that, when combined with effectors under control of the pOp promoter, tight temporal and spatial control of gene expression is achieved.

In populations evolving culture, such may be the role of high-magnitude innovators: individuals whose innovations are a major departure from the populations existing behavioural repertoire. Their effect on cultural evolution is twofold: they produce innovations that constitute a  cultural leap, and, once copied, their innovations may induce further innovations by conspecifics (socially induced innovations), as they explore the new behaviour themselves. I use computer simulations to study the co-evolution of independent innovations, socially induced innovations, and innovation magnitude, and show that while socially induced innovation is assumed here to be less costly than independent innovation, it does not readily evolve. When it evolves, it may in some conditions select against independent innovation and lower its frequency, despite it requiring independent innovation in order to operate; at the same time, however, it leads to much faster cultural evolution. These results confirm the role of high-magnitude innovators as keystones, and suggest a novel explanation for low frequency of independent innovation.",

On average 50% of potential donors in the NMDP database are unavailable for a variety of reasons, after initially matching a patient, with significant variations in availability among subgroups (e.g., by race or age). Several studies have established univariate donor characteristics associated with availability. Individual consideration of each applicable characteristic is laborious. Extrapolating group averages to individual donor level tends to be highly inaccurate. In the current environment with enhanced donor data collection, we can make better estimates of individual donor availability. In this study, we propose a Machine Learning based approach to predict availability of every registered donor, to be used during donor selection and reduce the time taken to complete a transplant.",

    "abstract": "Carcinogen-induced mouse models of liver cancer are used extensively to study the pathogenesis of the disease and have a critical role in validating candidate therapeutics. These models can recapitulate molecular and histological features of human disease. However, it is not known if the spectra of genomic alterations driving these mouse tumour genomes are comparable to those found in humans. Here, we provide a detailed characterisation of the exome-wide pattern of mutations in tumours from mice exposed to diethylnitrosamine (DEN), a commonly used model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DEN-initiated tumours had a high, uniform number of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), with very few insertions, deletions or copy number alterations, consistent with the known genotoxic action of DEN. Exposure of hepatocytes to DEN left a reproducible mutational imprint in resulting tumour exomes which we could computationally reconstruct using six known COSMIC mutational signatures. The tumours carried a high diversity of low-incidence, non-synonymous point mutations in many oncogenes and tumour suppressors, reflecting the stochastic introduction of SNVs into the hepatocyte genome by the carcinogen. We identified four recurrently mutated genes that were putative oncogenic drivers of HCC in this model. Every neoplasm carried activating hotspot mutations either in codon 61 of Hras, in codon 584 of Braf or in codon 254 of Egfr. Truncating mutations of Apc occurred in 21% of neoplasms, which were exclusively carcinomas supporting a role for deregulation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling in cancer progression. Conclusion: Our study provides detailed insight into the mutational landscape of tumours arising in a commonly-used carcinogen model of hepatocellular carcinoma, facilitating the future use of this model to understand the human disease.",

We find that northern California butterflies were impacted by a millennium-scale drought differentially at low and high elevations. At low elevations, phenological shifts facilitated persistence and even recovery during drought, while at higher elevations a shortened flight season was associated with decreases in species richness. Phenological and faunal dynamics are predicted by temperature and precipitation, thus advancing the possibility of understanding and forecasting biological responses to extreme weather.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative interactions among species, termed mutualisms, have played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth. However, despite key potential benefits to partners, there are many cases where two species cease to cooperate, and mutualisms break down. What factors drive the evolutionary breakdown of mutualism? We examined the pathways towards breakdowns of the mutualism between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using a comparative approach, we identify ~25 independent cases of complete mutualism breakdown across global seed plants. We found that breakdown of cooperation was only stable when host plants either: (i) partner with other root symbionts or (ii) evolve alternative resource acquisition strategies. Our results suggest that key mutualistic services are only permanently lost if hosts evolve alternative symbioses or adaptations.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCooperative interactions among species - mutualisms - are major sources of evolutionary innovation. However, despite their importance, two species that formerly cooperated sometimes cease their partnership. Why do mutualisms breakdown? We asked this question in the partnership between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and their plant hosts, one of the most ancient mutualisms. We analyse two potential trajectories towards evolutionary breakdown of their cooperation, symbiont switching and mutualism abandonment. We find evidence that plants stop interacting with AM fungi when they switch to other microbial mutualists or when they evolve alternative strategies to extract nutrients from the environment. Our results show vital cooperative interactions can be lost - but only if successful alternatives evolve.",

    "abstract": "Conrad H. Waddington discovered the phenomenon of genetic assimilation through a series of experiments on fruit flies. In those experiments, artificially exerted environmental stress induced plastic phe-notypic changes in the fruit flies, but after some generations the same phenotypic variant started to appear without the environmental stress. Both the initial state (where the phenotypic changes were environmentally induced and plastic) and the final state (where the phenotypic changes were genetically fixed and constitutive) are experimental facts. However, it remains unclear how the environmentally induced phenotypic change in the first generation becomes genetically fixed in the central process of genetic assimilation itself. We have argued that the key to understanding the mechanism of genetic assimilation lies in epigenetics, and proposed the \\\"cooperative model\\\" in which the evolutionary process depends on both genetic and epigenetic factors. Evolutionary simulations based on the cooperative model reproduced the process of genetic assimilation. Detailed analysis of the trajectories has revealed genetic assimilation is a process in which epigenetically induced phe-notypic changes are incrementally and statistically replaced with multiple minor genetic mutations through natural selection. In this scenario, epigenetic and genetic changes may be considered as mutually independent but equivalent in terms of their effects on phenotypic changes. This finding rejects the common (and confused) hypothesis that epigenetically induced phe-notypic changes depend on genetic mutations. Furthermore, we argue that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not required for evolution by genetic assimilation.",

    "abstract": "Genetic risk scores (GRSs) are weighted sums of risk allele counts of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a disease or trait. Construction of GRSs is typically based on published results from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs), the majority of which have been performed in large populations of European ancestry (EA) individuals. While many genotype-trait associations have been shown to generalize from EA populations to other populations, such as Hispanics/Latinos, the optimal choice of SNPs and weights for GRSs may differ between populations due to different linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequency patterns. This is further complicated by the fact that different Hispanic/Latino populations may have different admixture patterns, so that LD and allele frequency patterns may not be the same among non-EA populations. Here, we compare various approaches for GRS construction, using GWAS results from both large EA studies and a smaller study in Hispanics/Latinos, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL, n = 12, 803). We consider multiple ways to select SNPs from association regions and to calculate the SNP weights. We study the performance of the resulting GRSs in an independent study of Hispanics/Latinos from the Woman Health Initiative (WHI, n = 3, 582). We support our investigation with simulation studies of potential genetic architectures in a single locus. We observed that selecting variants based on EA GWASs generally performs well, as long as SNP weights are calculated using Hispanics/Latinos GWASs, or using the meta-analysis of EA and Hispanics/Latinos GWASs. The optimal approach depends on the genetic architecture of the trait.",

Notably, C57BL/6NHsd mice and gene-targeted mice that have been backcrossed to this substrain have been reported to harbor a duplication in exons 28 and 29 of Dock2. Here, we demonstrate the presence of this Dock2 variant in the widely used Nod2-/- mice. NOD2 is a cytosolic innate immune receptor that has been the subject of intense investigation due to its association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility. Consistent with a role of NOD2 in an immunological disorder, Nod2-/- mice bred at our institution displayed multiple B cell defects including deficiencies in recirculating B cells, marginal zone B cells and B1a cells. However, we found that these effects are due to the Dock2 variant and are independent of Nod2 deletion. Despite originating from the same gene-targeted founder mice, Nod2-/- mice from another source did not harbor the Dock2 variant or B cell defects. Finally, we show that Dock2-/- mice display the same B cell defects as mice harboring the Dock2 variant, confirming that the variant is a loss-of-function mutation and is sufficient to explain the alterations to the B cell compartment observed in Nod2-/- mice. Our findings highlight the effects of confounding mutations from widely-used inbred strains on gene-targeted mice and reveal new functions of DOCK2 in B cells.",

We hypothesized that Tudor proteins are required for viral piRNA production and performed a knockdown screen targeting all Ae. aegypti Tudor genes. Knockdown of several Tudor genes resulted in reduced viral piRNA levels, with silencing of AAEL012437 having the strongest effect. This protein, which we named Veneno, associates directly with Ago3 in an sDMA-dependent manner and localizes in cytoplasmic foci reminiscent of piRNA processing granules of Drosophila. Veneno-interactome analyses reveal a network of co-factors including the orthologs of the Drosophila piRNA pathway components Vasa and Yb, which in turn interacts directly with Piwi5. We propose that Veneno assembles a multi-protein complex for ping-pong dependent piRNA production from exogenous viral RNA.",

Here, we provide the first time-resolved high-resolution assessment of m6A on nascent RNA transcripts and unveil its importance for the control of RNA splicing kinetics. We identify that early co-transcriptional m6A deposition near splice junctions promotes fast splicing, while m6A modification of introns is associated with long, slowly processed introns and alternative splicing events. In conclusion, by directly comparing the processing dynamics of individual transcripts in the methylated versus unmethylated state on a transcriptome-wide scale we show that early m6A deposition marks transcripts for a fast-track processing.",

Corneal nerve density correlates with neuropathic pain states and is used as an assessment of small fiber neuropathies. Because pain, lacrimation and blinking are rarely assessed at the same time, it is not known if their regulatory mechanisms have similar temporal dynamics after acute corneal injury. We examined changes in corneal nerve density, evoked and spontaneous pain, and ocular homeostasis in Sprague-Dawley male rats after a superficial epithelial injury with heptanol that acutely abolished nerve endings within the central cornea. Despite a profound loss of epithelial nerve endings, pain was transiently enhanced after abrasion injury, while basal tear production was normal. We found no relationship between epithelial nerve density and pain or homeostatic responses. Axotomy following corneal abrasion increased expression of both ATF3 (a nerve injury marker) and CGRP (a nociceptive peptide) in trigeminal ganglia 24 hours after injury. These molecular changes were absent on the contralateral side, despite reductions in corneal epithelial nerve density in the uninjured eye. ATF3 and CGRP levels in trigeminal ganglion were normal at one week post-injury when pain responses were normal. In contrast, CGRP was upregulated in peripheral corneal endings one week after injury, when dry eye symptoms emerged. Our results demonstrate dynamic trafficking of CGRP within trigeminal sensory nerves, with elevations in the ganglion correlated with pain behaviors and elevations in peripheral endings correlated with dry eye symptoms.",

    "abstract": "A powerful and computationally efficient multivariate approach is proposed here, called structured kernel principal component regression (sKPCR), for the identification of associations in the voxel-level dense connectome. The method can identify voxel-phenotype associations based on the voxels whole-brain connectivity pattern, which is applicable to detect linear and non-linear signals for both volume-based and surface-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. For each voxel, our approach first extracts signals from the spatially smoothed connectivities by structured kernel principal component analysis, and then tests the voxel-phenotype associations via a general linear model. The method derives its power by appropriately modelling the spatial structure of the data. Simulations based on dense connectome data have shown that our method can accurately control the false-positive rate, and it is more powerful than many state-of-the-art approaches, such as the connectivity-wise general linear model (GLM) approach, multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR), adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) test, and least-square kernel machine (LSKM). To demonstrate the utility of our approach in real data analysis, we apply these methods to identify voxel-wise difference between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls in two independent resting-state fMRI datasets. The findings of our approach have a better between-sites reproducibility, and a larger proportion of overlap with existing schizophrenia findings.

    "abstract": "Unresponsiveness Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) patients may retain intact portions of the thalamocortical system that are spontaneously active and responsive to sensory stimuli. In these patients, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) also reveals preserved cortical reactivity, but in most cases, the residual thalamocortical circuits fail to engage complex causal interactions, as assessed by the perturbational complexity index (PCI). Another condition during which thalamocortical circuits are intact, active and reactive, yet unable to generate complex responses, is physiological non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The underlying mechanism is bistability: the tendency of cortical neurons to fall into a silent period (OFF-period) upon receiving an input. Here we tested whether a pathological form of bistability may be responsible for loss of brain complexity in UWS patients. Time-frequency decomposition analysis of TMS/EEG responses in UWS patients revealed the occurrence of OFF-periods (detected as a transient suppression of high-frequency oscillations in the EEG) similar to the ones evoked by TMS in the cortex of healthy sleeping subjects. Pathological OFF-periods were detected in any cortical area, significantly impaired local causal interactions (as measured by PLF) and prevented the build-up of global complexity (as measured by PCI) in the brain of UWS patients. Our results draw a first link between neuronal events (OFF-periods) and global brain dynamics (complexity) in UWS patients. To the extent that sleep-like bistability represents the common functional endpoint of loss of complexity, detecting its presence and tracking its evolution over time, may offer a valuable read-out to devise, guide and titrate therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Emotionally arousing events are usually better remembered than neutral ones. This phenomenon is in humans mostly studied by presenting mixed lists of neutral and emotional items. An emotional enhancement of memory is observed in these studies often already immediately after encoding and increases with longer delays and consolidation. A large body of animal research showed that the more efficient consolidation of emotionally arousing events is based on an activation of the central noradrenergic system and the amygdala (Modulation Hypothesis; Roozendaal & McGaugh, 2011). The immediately superior recognition of emotional items is attributed primarily to their attraction of attention during encoding which is also thought to be based on the amygdala and the central noradrenergic system. To investigate whether the amygdala and noradrenergic system support memory encoding and consolidation via shared neural substrates and processes a large sample of participants (n = 690) encoded neutral and arousing pictures. Their memory was tested immediately and after a consolidation delay. In addition, they were genotyped in two relevant polymorphisms (2B-adrenergic receptor and serotonin transporter). Memory for negative and positive emotional pictures was enhanced at both time points where these enhancements were correlated (immediate r = 0.60 and delayed test r = 0.46). Critically, the effects of emotional arousal on encoding and consolidation correlated only very low (negative r = 0.14 and positive r = 0.03 pictures) suggesting partly distinct underlying processes consistent with a functional heterogeneity of the central noradrenergic system. No effect of genotype on either effect was observed.",

    "abstract": "Given the paucity of effective treatments for fibrotic disorders, new insights into the deleterious mechanisms controlling fibroblast activation, the key cell type driving the fibrogenic process, are essential to develop new therapeutic strategies. Here, we identified the long non-coding RNA DNM3OS as a critical downstream effector of TGF-{beta}-induced myofibroblast activation. Mechanistically, DNM3OS regulates this process in trans by giving rise to 3 distinct profibrotic mature miRNAs (i.e. miR-199a-5p/3p and miR-214-3p), which influence both SMAD and non-SMAD components of TGF-{beta} signaling in a multifaceted way, through two modes of action consisting of either signal amplification or mediation. Finally, we provide preclinical evidence that interfering with DNM3OS function using distinct strategies not only prevents lung and kidney fibrosis but also improves established lung fibrosis, providing thus a novel paradigm for the treatment of refractory fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe DNM3OS lncRNA is a reservoir of fibromiRs with major functions in fibroblast response to TGF-{beta} and represents a valuable therapeutic target for refractory fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many disease associated loci, the majority of which have unknown biological functions. Understanding the mechanism underlying trait associations requires identifying trait-relevant tissues and investigating associations in a trait-specific fashion. Here, we extend the widely used linear mixed model to incorporate multiple SNP functional annotations from omics studies with GWAS summary statistics to facilitate the identification of trait-relevant tissues, with which to further construct powerful association tests. Specifically, we rely on a generalized estimating equation based algorithm for parameter inference, a mixture modeling framework for trait-tissue relevance classification, and a weighted sequence kernel association test constructed based on the identified trait-relevant tissues for powerful association analysis. We refer to our analytic procedure as the Scalable Multiple Annotation integration for trait-Relevant Tissue identification and usage (SMART). With extensive simulations, we show how our method can make use of multiple complementary annotations to improve the accuracy for identifying trait-relevant tissues. In addition, our procedure allows us to make use of the inferred trait-relevant tissues, for the first time, to construct more powerful SNP set tests. We apply our method for an in-depth analysis of 43 traits from 28 GWASs using tissue-specific annotations in 105 tissues derived from ENCODE and Roadmap. Our results reveal new trait-tissue relevance, pinpoint important annotations that are informative of trait-tissue relationship, and illustrate how we can use the inferred trait-relevant tissues to construct more powerful association tests in the Wellcome trust case control consortium study.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIdentifying trait-relevant tissues is an important step towards understanding disease etiology. Computational methods have been recently developed to integrate SNP functional annotations generated from omics studies to genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to infer trait-relevant tissues. However, two important questions remain to be answered. First, with the increasing number and types of functional annotations nowadays, how do we integrate multiple annotations jointly into GWASs in a trait-specific fashion to take advantage of the complementary information contained in these annotations to optimize the performance of trait-relevant tissue inference? Second, what to do with the inferred trait-relevant tissues? Here, we develop a new statistical method and software to make progress on both fronts. For the first question, we extend the commonly used linear mixed model, with new algorithms and inference strategies, to incorporate multiple annotations in a trait-specific fashion to improve trait-relevant tissue inference accuracy. For the second question, we rely on the close relationship between our proposed method and the widely-used sequence kernel association test, and use the inferred trait-relevant tissues, for the first time, to construct more powerful association tests. We illustrate the benefits of our method through extensive simulations and applications to a wide range of real data sets.",

    "abstract": "Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT4) is sequestered inside muscle and fat, then released by vesicle traffic to the cell surface in response to post-prandial insulin for blood glucose clearance. Here we map the biogenesis of this GLUT4 traffic pathway in humans, which involves clathrin isoform CHC22. We observe that GLUT4 transits through the early secretory pathway more slowly than the constitutively-secreted GLUT1 transporter and localize CHC22 to the endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi-intermediate compartment (ERGIC). CHC22 functions in transport from the ERGIC, as demonstrated by an essential role in forming the replication vacuole of Legionella pneumophila bacteria, which requires ERGIC-derived membrane. CHC22 complexes with ERGIC tether p115, GLUT4 and sortilin and down-regulation of either p115 or CHC22, but not GM130 or sortilin abrogate insulin-responsive GLUT4 release. This indicates CHC22 traffic initiates human GLUT4 sequestration from the ERGIC, and defines a role for CHC22 in addition to retrograde sorting of GLUT4 after endocytic recapture, enhancing pathways for GLUT4 sequestration in humans relative to mice, which lack CHC22.\\n\\nSummaryBlood glucose clearance relies on insulin-mediated exocytosis of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) from sites of intracellular sequestration. We show that in humans, CHC22 clathrin mediates membrane traffic from the ER-to-Golgi Intermediate Compartment, which is needed for GLUT4 sequestration during GLUT4 pathway biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The Roseobacter-group species Phaeobacter inhibens produces the antibacterial tropodithietic acid (TDA) and the algaecidal roseobacticides with both compound classes sharing part of the same biosynthetic pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of roseobacticides more broadly in TDA-producing roseobacters and to compare the effect of producers and non-producers on microalgae. Of 33 roseobacters analyzed, roseobacticide production was a unique feature of TDA-producing P. inhibens, P. gallaeciensis and P. piscinae strains. One TDA-producing Phaeobacter strain, 27-4, was unable to produce roseobacticides, possibly due to a transposable element. TDA-producing Ruegeria mobilis and Pseudovibrio did not produce roseobacticides. Addition of roseobacticide-containing bacterial extracts affected the growth of the microalgae Rhodomonas salina, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Emiliania huxleyi, while growth of Tetraselmis suecica was unaffected. During co-cultivation, growth of E. huxleyi was initially stimulated by the roseobacticide producer DSM 17395, while the subsequent decline in algal cell numbers during senescence was enhanced. Strain 27-4 that does not produce roseobacticides had no effect on algal growth. Both bacterial strains, DSM 17395 and 27-4, grew during co-cultivation presumably utilizing algal exudates. Furthermore, TDA-producing roseobacters have potential as probiotics in marine larviculture and it is promising that the live feed Tetraselmis was unaffected by roseobacticides-containing extracts.\\n\\nOriginality-significance statementSome Roseobacter-group bacteria produce the antibacterial compound tropodithetic acid (TDA) and have potential as probiotics in marine aquaculture. However, a few of these strains additionally produce algaecidal compounds, the roseobacticides, which would restrict their use in marine larviculture where algae are used as live feed for fish larvae. We herein found that roseobacticides are limited to TDA-producing Phaeobacter strains and were not biosynthesized by TDA-producers outside this genus. Roseobacticides affected several strains of microalgae, but not the chlorophyte that is used as live feed in the aquaculture industry. Thus, the application of Roseobacter strains as probiotics is not hampered. Furthermore, these results demonstrate how Roseobacter-group strains act as gardeners of microalgae and thereby would be involved in environmental processes on a larger scale.",

    "abstract": "Phasic dopamine release from mid-brain dopaminergic neurons signals errors of reward prediction (RPE). If reward maximisation is to maintain homeostasis, then the value of primary rewards should be coupled to the homeostatic errors they remediate. This leads to the prediction that RPE signals should be configured as a function of homeostatic state and thus, diminish with the attenuation of homeostatic error. To test this hypothesis, we collected a large volume of functional MRI data from five human volunteers on four separate days. After fasting for 12 hours, subjects consumed preloads that differed in glucose concentration. Participants then underwent a Pavlovian cue-conditioning paradigm in which the colour of a fixation-cross was stochastically associated with the delivery of water or glucose via a gustometer. This design afforded computation of RPE separately for better- and worse-than expected outcomes during ascending and descending trajectories of physiological serum glucose fluctuations. In the parabrachial nuclei, variations in regional activity coding positive RPEs scaled positively with serum glucose for ascending and descending glucose levels. The ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra became more sensitive to negative RPEs when glucose levels were ascending. Together, the results show that RPE signals in key brainstem structures are modulated by homeostatic trajectories of naturally occurring glycemic flux, revealing a tight interplay between homeostatic state and the neural encoding of primary reward in the human brain.",

Many RBPs that aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases self-assemble into RNA granules through intrinsically disordered low complexity (LC) domains. We report here that a LC domain within U1-70K of mixed charge, containing highly repetitive complementary repeats of basic (R/K) and acidic (D/E) residues, shares many of the same properties of the Q/N-rich LC domains found in the RBPs TDP-43 and FUS. These properties include the ability to self-assemble into oligomers, and to form nuclear granules. To analyze the functional roles of the U1-70K LC domains, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant U1-70K and deletions lacking the C-terminal LC domain(s). A network-driven approach resolved functional classes of U1-70K interacting proteins that showed dependency on the U1-70K LC domain(s) for their interaction. This included structurally similar RBPs, such as LUC7L3 and RBM25, which require their respective mixed charge domains for reciprocal interactions with U1-70K and for participation in nuclear RNA granules. Strikingly, a significant proportion of RBPs with mixed charge domains have elevated insolubility in AD brain proteome compared to controls. Furthermore, we show that the mixed charge LC domain of U1-70K can interact with Tau from AD brain. These findings highlight mechanisms for mixed charge domains in stabilizing RBP interactions and in potentially mediating co-aggregation with pathological Tau isoforms in AD.",

Here, we report a requirement for PARP2 in stabilising replication forks that encounter BER intermediates through Fbh1-dependent regulation of Rad51. Whilst PARP2 is dispensable for tolerance of cells to SSBs or homologous recombination dysfunction, it is redundant with PARP1 in BER. Therefore, combined disruption of PARP1 and PARP2 leads to defective BER, resulting in elevated levels of replication associated DNA damage due to an inability to stabilise Rad51 at damaged replication forks and prevent uncontrolled DNA resection. Together, our results demonstrate how PARP1 and PARP2 regulate two independent, but intrinsically linked aspects of DNA base damage tolerance by promoting BER directly, and through stabilising replication forks that encounter BER intermediates.",

Yet, it is still unclear how oocytes regulate the expression of these embryo fate-promoting genes within the general transcriptional program of oogenesis. Here we report that the Drosophila Trithorax group protein MLL3/4 (dMLL3/4, also known as Trr) is essential for the transition to embryo fate at fertilization. In the absence of dMLL3/4, oocytes develop normally but fail to initiate the embryo mitotic divisions after fertilization. This incapability results from defects in both paternal genome reprogramming and maternal meiotic completion. We show that, during oogenesis, dMLL3/4 promotes the expression of a functionally coherent gene subset that is later required for the correct assembly of the zygotic genome. Accordingly, we identify the evolutionarily-conserved IDGF4 glycoprotein (known as oviductin in mammals) as a new oocyte-to-embryo transition gene under dMLL3/4 transcriptional control. Based on these observations, we propose that dMLL3/4 plays an instructive role in the oocyte-to-embryo transition that is functionally uncoupled from the requirements of normal oocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors regulate the molecular, morphological, and physiological characters of neurons and generate their impressive cell type diversity. To gain insight into general principles that govern how transcription factors regulate cell type diversity, we used large-scale single-cell mRNA sequencing to characterize the extensive cellular diversity in the Drosophila optic lobes. We sequenced 55,000 single optic lobe neurons and glia and assigned them to 52 clusters of transcriptionally distinct single cells. We validated the clustering and annotated many of the clusters using RNA sequencing of characterized FACS-sorted single cell types, as well as marker genes specific to given clusters. To identify transcription factors responsible for inducing specific terminal differentiation features, we used machine-learning to generate a  random forest model. The predictive power of the model was confirmed by showing that two transcription factors expressed specifically in cholinergic (apterous) and glutamatergic (traffic-jam) neurons are necessary for the expression of ChAT and VGlut in many, but not all, cholinergic or glutamatergic neurons, respectively. We used a transcriptome-wide approach to show that the same terminal characters, including but not restricted to neurotransmitter identity, can be regulated by different transcription factors in different cell types, arguing for extensive phenotypic convergence. Our data provide a deep understanding of the developmental and functional specification of a complex brain structure.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the lysosomal Ragulator complex is essential for full activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Abnormal mTORC1 activation has been implicated in several developmental neurological disorders, including Angelman syndrome (AS), which is caused by maternal deficiency of the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3A. Here we report that Ube3a regulates mTORC1 signaling by targeting p18, a subunit of the Ragulator. Ube3a ubiquinates p18, resulting in its proteasomal degradation, and Ube3a deficiency in hippocampus of AS mice results in increased lysosomal localization of p18 and other members of the Ragulator-Rag complex, such as RagA, and increased mTORC1 activity. P18 down-regulation by siRNA or shRNA in hippocampal CA1 neurons of AS mice reduces elevated mTORC1 activity and improves long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic spine maturation. Our results indicate that Ube3a-mediated regulation of p18 and subsequent mTORC1 signaling is critical for typical synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine development.",

We present DRUID--Deep Relatedness Utilizing Identity by Descent--a method that works by inferring the identical by descent (IBD) sharing profile of an ungenotyped ancestor of a set of close relatives. Using this IBD profile, DRUID infers relatedness between unobserved ancestors and more distant relatives, thereby combining information from multiple samples to remove one or more generations between the deep relationships to be identified. DRUID constructs sets of close relatives by detecting full siblings and also uses a novel approach to identify the aunts/uncles of two or more siblings, recovering 92.2% of real aunts/uncles with zero false positives. In real and simulated data, DRUID correctly infers up to 10.5% more relatives than PADRE when using data from two sets of distantly related siblings, and 10.7-31.3% more relatives given two sets of siblings and their aunts/uncles. DRUID frequently infers relationships either correctly or within one degree of the truth, with PADRE classifying 43.3-58.3% of tenth degree relatives in this way compared to 79.6-96.7% using DRUID.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical models of biomolecular networks are successfully used to understand the mechanisms underlying complex diseases and to design therapeutic strategies. Network control, and its special case of target control, is a promising avenue toward developing disease therapies. In target control it is assumed that a small subset of nodes is most relevant to the systems state and the goal is to drive the target nodes into their desired states. An example of target control would be driving a cell to commit to apoptosis (programmed cell death). From the experimental perspective, gene knockout, pharmacological inhibition of proteins and providing sustained external signals are among practical intervention techniques. We identify methodologies to use the stabilizing effect of sustained interventions for target control in logical models of biomolecular networks. Specifically, we define the domain of influence of a node (in a certain state) to be the nodes (and their corresponding states) that will be ultimately stabilized by the sustained state of this node regardless of the initial state of the system. We also define the related concept of the logical domain of influence of a node, and develop an algorithm for its identification using an auxiliary network that incorporates the regulatory logic. This way a solution to the target control problem is a set of nodes whose domain of influence can cover the desired target node states. We perform greedy randomized adaptive search in state space to find such solutions. We apply our strategy to several biological networks to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

Many existing methods based on marker genes or k-mers have limited sensitivity or are too computationally demanding for many users. Additionally, most work in metagenomics has focused on bacteria and archaea, neglecting to study other key microbes such as viruses and eukaryotes.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a method, MiCoP (Microbiome Community Profiling), that uses fast-mapping of reads to build a comprehensive reference database of full genomes from viruses and eukaryotes to achieve maximum read usage and enable the analysis of the virome and eukaryome in each sample. We demonstrate that mapping of metagenomic reads is feasible for the smaller viral and eukaryotic reference databases. We show that our method is accurate on simulated and mock community data and identifies many more viral and fungal species than previously-reported results on real data from the Human Microbiome Project.\\n\\nConclusionsMiCoP is a mapping-based method that proves more effective than existing methods at abundance profiling of viruses and eukaryotes in metagenomic samples. MiCoP can be used to detect the full diversity of these communities. The code, data, and documentation is publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/smangul1/MiCoP",

Through in silico and in vitro analyses, we identified 24 agonists and 1 antagonist for this receptor. We detected that agonist 19-hydroxyandrostenedione, a product of the aromatase reaction, is endogenously produced upon receptor activation. We characterized the effects of receptor activation on metabolism using a prostate cancer cell line and demonstrated decreased intracellular anabolic signals and cell viability, induction of cell cycle arrest, and increased expression of neuronal markers. Furthermore, upregulation of neuron-specific enolase by agonist treatment was abolished in OR51E2-KO cells. The results of our study suggest that OR51E2 activation results in neuroendocrine trans-differentiation. These findings reveal a new role for OR51E2 and establish this G-protein coupled receptor as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer.\\n\\nSignificanceProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. Most deaths from prostate cancer are due to the progression of localized disease into metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer characterized by increased number of neuroendocrine-like cells. These neuroendocrine-like cells are non-proliferating, terminally differentiated cells. Olfactory receptor OR51E2, also known as a Prostate Specific G-Protein Receptor, is highly expressed in prostate cancer, and its expression correlates with disease progression. Here, we identify and validate novel endogenous ligands for this receptor. We show that activation of OR51E2 by newly-discovered prostate cancer-relevant agonists facilitates cellular transformation, resulting in neuroendocrine trans-differentiation, a characteristic phenotype of castrate resistant prostate cancer.

    "abstract": "Mutually-exclusive chemoreceptor expression in olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons (OSNs and VSNs) enables odorant discrimination. This configuration involves chemoreceptor mediated activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident kinase PERK. PERK drives translation of the transcription factor ATF5 to preclude additional chemoreceptor expression. ATF5 translation is transient in OSNs but persistent in VSNs, suggesting chemoreceptor-specific modes of PERK activation. Herein, we showed that the ER-lumenal domain (LD) of PERK recognized vomeronasal receptor (VR)-derived peptides, suggesting direct PERK activation drives persistent ATF5 translation in VSNs. In contrast, PERK LD did not recognize olfactory receptor (OR)-derived peptides in vitro, and facilitating OR maturation in vivo prevented PERK activation, suggesting that ORs activate PERK indirectly through a failure to exit the ER. Importantly, impairing or prolonging ATF5 expression drove specific chemoreceptor repertoire biases. Together, these results demonstrate mechanistic divergence in chemoreceptor feedback and establish that differences in PERK activation promote qualitatively different gene regulatory results.",

    "abstract": "Bee viral ecology is a fascinating emerging area of research: viruses exert a range of effects on their hosts, exacerbate the impacts of other environmental stressors, and, importantly, are readily shared across multiple bee species in a community. However, our understanding of bee viral communities is limited, as it is primarily derived from studies of North American and European Apis mellifera populations. Here, we examined viruses in populations of A. mellifera and 11 other bee species from 9 countries, across 5 continents and Oceania. We developed a novel pipeline to rapidly, inexpensively, and robustly screen for bee viruses. This pipeline includes purification of encapsulated RNA/DNA viruses, sequence-independent amplification, high throughput sequencing, integrated assembly of contigs, and filtering to identify contigs specifically corresponding to viral sequences. We identified sequences corresponding to (+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA, dsRNA, and ssDNA viruses. Overall, we found 127 contigs corresponding to novel viruses (i.e. previously not observed in bees), with 29 represented by >0.1 % of the reads in a given sample. These viruses and viral families were distributed across multiple regions and species. This study provides a robust pipeline for metagenomics analysis of viruses, and greatly expands our understanding of the diversity of viruses found in bee communities.",

LncRNA-MEG3 knockdown by lung-specific delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly prevented the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in vivo. Silencing of lncRNA-MEG3 by siRNAs and gapmers attenuated PASMC responses to hypoxia in vitro. Mechanically, we found that lncRNA-MEG3 acts as a molecular sponge of microRNA-328 (miR-328); upon hypoxia, lncRNA-MEG3 interacts and sequesters miR-328, leading to the upregulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). Additionally, higher expression of lncRNA-MEG3 and IGF1R, and lower expression of miR-328 were observed in PASMCs of iPAH patients. These data provide insight into the contribution of lncRNA-MEG3 in hypoxia pulmonary hypertension.

We recorded the response of 57 ML neurons in two monkeys. Face stimuli were presented at two sizes (10 and 5 degrees of visual angle) and two orientations (upright and inverted). The results indicate that different faces elicited distinct patterns of activity across ML neurons that were tolerant of changes in size. However, the results of the orientation manipulation were mixed; despite observing a reduced response to inverted faces, classifier performance was above chance for both upright and inverted faces and the classification score did not differ significantly for inverted and upright faces. We conclude that population responses in area ML to different faces are dependent on stimulus orientation but are more tolerant to changes in stimulus size.",

    "abstract": "The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial navigation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN). Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin expressing (PV) interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, while somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive ATN activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feed-forward inhibition is largely mediated by PV interneurons which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells. Our data point to a specific role of presubicular microcircuits in shaping thalamic head-direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex: Short-latency PV cell activation may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during fast turns. However, depression at ATN-PV synapses during repeated activation tends to facilitate pyramidal cell firing when head direction is maintained. Operations performed in presubicular layer 3 circuits seem well-adapted for spatial fine-tuning of head direction signals sent to the medial entorhinal cortex.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHow microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) excite layer 3 pyramidal cells (PC) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feed-forward inhibition. Somatostatin (SST) interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimes according to the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, SST-PC interactions support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, PV mediated feed-forward inhibition acts to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid protein A{beta} in senile plaques is a key driver and hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), a major cause of death and dementia in the elderly. The strongest genetic risk factor in sporadic AD is the {varepsilon}4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), which potentiates pre-symptomatic endosomal dysfunction and defective clearance of A{beta}, although how these two pathways are linked has been unclear. Here, we show that aberrant accumulation of endosomal protons in ApoE4 astrocytes traps the LRP1 receptor in non-productive intracellular compartments, leading to loss of surface expression and A{beta} clearance. Hyperacidification of endosomal pH is caused by selective down regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6, which functions as a critical proton leak pathway, in ApoE4 brain and astrocytes. In vivo, the NHE6KO mouse model shows elevated A{beta} in the brain. Epigenetic restoration of NHE6 expression with histone deacetylase inhibitors normalized ApoE4-specific defects in endosomal pH, LRP1 trafficking and amyloid clearance. Thus, NHE6 is a prominent effector of ApoE4 and emerges as a promising therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "The genome is reprogrammed during development to produce diverse cell types, largely through altered expression and activity of key transcription factors. The accessibility and critical functions of epidermal cells have made them a model for connecting transcriptional events to development in a range of model systems. In Arabidopsis thaliana and many other plants, fertilization triggers differentiation of specialized epidermal seed coat cells that have a unique morphology caused by large extracellular deposits of pectin. Here, we used DNase I-seq to generate regulatory landscapes of A. thaliana seeds at two critical time points in seed coat maturation, enriching for seed coat cells with the INTACT method. We found over 3000 developmentally dynamic regulatory DNA elements and explored their relationship with nearby gene expression. The dynamic regulatory elements were enriched for motifs for several transcription factors families; most notably the TCP family at the earlier time point and the MYB family at the later one. To assess the extent to which the observed regulatory sites in seeds added to previously known regulatory sites in A. thaliana, we compared our data to 11 other data sets generated with seven-day-old seedlings for diverse tissues and conditions. Surprisingly, over a quarter of the regulatory, i.e. accessible, bases observed in seeds were novel. Notably, in this comparison, development exerted a stronger effect on the plant regulatory landscape than extreme environmental perturbations, highlighting the importance of extending studies of regulatory landscapes to other tissues and cell types during development.",
