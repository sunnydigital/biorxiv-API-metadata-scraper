    "abstract": "An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.",

    "abstract": "The interplay of gene flow, genetic drift, and local selective pressure is a dynamic process that has been well studied from a theoretical perspective over the last century. Wright and Haldane laid the foundation for expectations under an island-continent model, demonstrating that an island-specific beneficial allele may be maintained locally if the selection coefficient is larger than the rate of migration of the ancestral allele from the continent. Subsequent extensions of this model have provided considerably more insight. Yet, connecting theoretical results with empirical data has proven challenging, owing to a lack of information on the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Here, we examine the demographic and selective history of deer mice in and around the Nebraska Sand Hills, a system in which variation at the Agouti locus affects cryptic coloration that in turn affects the survival of mice in their local habitat. We first genotyped 250 individuals from eleven sites along a transect spanning the Sand Hills at 660,000 SNPs across the genome. Using these genomic data, we found that deer mice first colonized the Sand Hills following the last glacial period. Subsequent high rates of gene flow have served to homogenize the majority of the genome between populations on and off the Sand Hills, with the exception of the Agouti pigmentation locus. Furthermore, mutations at this locus are strongly associated with the pigment traits that are strongly correlated with local soil coloration and thus responsible for cryptic coloration.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for advances in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma (EWS), an aggressive childhood tumor with possible neuroectodermal origin. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC) can revert aberrant epigenetic states and reduce growth in different experimental cancer types. Here, we investigated whether the potent HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate (NaB) has the ability to reprogram EWS cells towards a more differentiated state and affect their growth and survival. Exposure of two EWS cell lines to NaB resulted in rapid and potent inhibition of HDAC activity (1 h, IC50 1.5 mM) and a significant arrest of cell cycle progression (72 h, IC50 0.68-0.76 mM), marked by G0/G1 accumulation. Delayed cell proliferation and reduced colony formation ability were observed in EWS cells after long-term culture. NaB-induced effects included suppression of cell proliferation accompanied by reduced transcriptional expression of the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncogene, decreased expression of key survival and pluripotency-associated genes, and re-expression of the differentiation neuronal marker {superscript 2}III-tubulin. Finally, NaB reduced c-MYC levels and impaired survival in putative EWS cancer stem cells. Our findings support the use of HDAC inhibition as a strategy to impair cell growth and survival and to reprogram EWS tumors towards differentiation. These results are consistent with our previous studies indicating that HDis can inhibit the growth and modulate differentiation of cells from other types of childhood pediatric tumors possibly originating from neural stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation is one of the most ubiquitous processes in biology. But while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here we show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect bacterial promoters in a systematic and scalable way. We demonstrate this method on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input-output relationships. This method opens up the possibility of exhaustively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy involves rapid growth of phagophores through membrane addition. Newly added membranes are derived from other organelles through vesicles carrying the Atg9 protein. Membrane is delivered by fusing these vesicles with the phagophores. Atg9 is, nevertheless, not incorporated in autophagosomes. We now show that this protein is retrieved from phagophores by fission utilizing Dynamin-2 (Dnm2) as the membrane scission protein. Blocking Atg9 recycling by interfering with Dnm2 helps retain Atg9 in autophagosomes and degrades this protein by autophagy. Dnm2 colocalizes with the BAR domain protein Endophilin-B1 (EndoB1/Bif-1) when autophagy is induced, consistent with transient interactions during Atg9 retrieval. EndoB1 and Dnm2 also control the downstream fusion of phagophores to late endosomes, thus ensuring the completion of phagophores before proceeding to the next stage in the autophagy process. These data provide novel insights into the roles of membrane scission proteins during autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal protein synthesis (translation) is a highly accurate process. Translation termination, in particular, must be accurate to prevent truncated proteins. How this accuracy is achieved is not fully understood in all its details. Using an E. coli in vitro system, I explore novel mechanisms that contribute to the high accuracy of translation termination. By comparing the Michaelis-Menten parameters of methylated and non-methylated release factors on cognate and non-cognate codons. Post-translational methylation of a strictly conserved GGQ motif in class I release factors increases the accuracy of termination by up to 5-fold. This happens by increasing both the maximum rate of peptide release (kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constant (KM). Further, I demonstrate here that a non-methylated release factor acts like an uncompetitive inhibitor of enzyme reactions. Overall, this study shows that the methylation of class I release factors is a novel mechanism contributing to highly accurate translation termination.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Compiling the catalogue of genes actively involved in tumorigenesis (known as cancer drivers) is an ongoing endeavor, with profound implications to the understanding of tumorigenesis and treatment of the disease. An abundance of computational methods have been developed to screening the genome for candidate driver genes based on genomic data of somatic mutations in tumors. Most methods rely on detecting genes displaying excessive mutation rates compared to some background model. This approach is susceptible to false discoveries, due to its sensitivity to the assumptions of the background model, such as the need to account for hyper-mutated samples, cancer types and genomic loci. We present a fundamentally different approach. Instead of focusing on the number of mutations, we examine their content, and their expected effects on the functions of genes. We use a machine-learning model to predict functional effect scores of somatic mutations. For each gene, we compare the distribution of observed effect scores with the distribution expected at random, and report genes showing significant bias. By applying our framework on the ~20k protein-coding human genes, we detected 593 genes showing significant bias towards harmful mutations in the context of cancer. In contrast, we found only 6 significant genes biased in the opposite direction. The list of 593 genes, constructed without any prior knowledge of their role in cancer, shows an overwhelming overlap with known cancer driver genes, but also highlights many overlooked genes. These overlooked genes are promising candidates for novel cancer drivers. Our model is generic and is not restricted to the context of cancer. Applying the same framework to data of human-population genetic variation reveals the opposite trend. Unlike cancer, which is dominated by a bias towards harmful mutations, long-term evolution in healthy individuals results a bias towards less harmful mutations. The underlying assumptions of our framework are minimal, making it ideal for analyzing genetic data in search of genes subjected to positive or negative selection. It is fully open sourced and available for installation and use. Our framework presents a substantial development towards the application of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in genetic studies.",

We show here the crucial role of Wolbachia in the oogenesis of filarial nematodes, a class of parasites of biomedical and veterinary relevance. While the Wolbachia-depleted nematodes produce faulty embryos, we identified thanks to newly generated techniques the earliest requirements of Wolbachia in the germline. They stimulate its proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner, in parallel of the known key controllers, and not through nucleotide supplementation as previously hypothesized. We also found Wolbachia to maintain the quiescence of a pool of germline stem cells ensuring for many years a constant delivery of about 1400 eggs per day. The loss of quiescence upon Wolbachia depletion, as well as the disorganization of the distal germline suggest that Wolbachia are required to execute the proper germline stem cell developmental program in order to produce viable eggs and embryos.",

    "abstract": "Populations of organisms show prevalent genetic differences called polymorphisms. Understanding the effects of polymorphisms is of central importance in biology and medicine. Here, we ask which polymorphisms occur at high frequency when organisms evolve under tradeoffs between multiple tasks. Multiple tasks present a problem, because it is not possible to be optimal at all tasks simultaneously and hence compromises are necessary. Recent work indicates that tradeoffs lead to a simple geometry of phenotypes in the space of traits: phenotypes fall on the Pareto front, which is shaped as a polytope: a line, triangle, tetrahedron etc. The vertices of these polytopes are the optimal phenotypes for a single task. Up to now, work on this Pareto approach has not considered its genetic underpinnings. Here, we address this by asking how the polymorphism structure of a population is affected by evolution under tradeoffs. We simulate a multi-task selection scenario, in which the population evolves to the Pareto front: the line segment between two archetypes or the triangle between three archetypes. We find that polymorphisms that become prevalent in the population have pleiotropic phenotypic effects that align with the Pareto front. Similarly, epistatic effects between prevalent polymorphisms are parallel to the front. Alignment with the front occurs also for asexual mating. Alignment is reduced when drift or linkage is strong, and is replaced by a more complex structure in which many perpendicular allele effects cancel out. Aligned polymorphism structure allows mating to produce offspring that stand a good chance of being optimal multi-taskers in at least one of the locales available to the species.",

However, approaches that co-opt endogenous organelles may be limited by the potential for unwanted crosstalk and disruption of native metabolic functions. Here, we present the construction of synthetic non-endogenous organelles in the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on the prokaryotic family of self-assembling proteins known as encapsulins. We establish that encapsulins self-assemble to form nanoscale compartments in yeast, and that heterologous proteins can be selectively targeted for compartmentalization. Housing destabilized proteins within encapsulin compartments affords protection against proteolytic degradation in vivo, while the interaction between split protein components is enhanced upon co-localization within the compartment interior. Furthermore, encapsulin compartments can support enzymatic catalysis, with substrate turnover observed for an encapsulated yeast enzyme. Encapsulin compartments therefore represent a modular platform, orthogonal to existing organelles, for programming synthetic compartmentalization in eukaryotes.",
