    "abstract": "Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem of neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction system, we present evidence how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised machine learning tool, learns the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. As an example, we show how the method reveals a temporally shifted coordination in a thalamo-cortical circuit during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.",

    "abstract": "Developmental constraints on genome evolution have been suggested to follow either an early conservation model or an \\\"hourglass\\\" model. Both models agree that late development strongly diverges between species, but debate on which developmental period is the most conserved. Here, based on a modified \\\"Transcriptome Age Index\\\" approach, i.e. weighting trait measures by expression level, we analyzed the constraints acting on three evolutionary traits of protein coding genes (strength of purifying selection on protein sequences, phyletic age, and duplicability) in four species: nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, fly Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish Danio rerio, and mouse Mus musculus. In general, we found that both models can be supported by different genomic properties. Sequence evolution follows an hourglass model, but the evolution of phyletic age and of duplicability follow an early conservation model. Further analyses indicate that stronger purifying selection on sequences in the middle development are driven by temporal pleiotropy of these genes. In addition, we report evidence that expression in late development is enriched with retrogenes, which usually lack efficient regulatory elements. This implies that expression in late development could facilitate transcription of new genes, and provide opportunities for acquisition of function. Finally, in C. elegans, we suggest that dosage imbalance could be one of the main factors that cause depleted expression of high duplicability genes in early development.",

    "abstract": "A driving hypothesis of Evo-Devo is that animal morphological diversity is shaped both by adaptation and by developmental constraints. Here we have tested Darwins \\\"selection opportunity\\\" hypothesis, according to which high evolutionary divergence in late development is due to strong positive selection. We contrasted it to a \\\"developmental constraint\\\" hypothesis, according to which late development is under relaxed negative selection. Indeed, the highest divergence between species, both at the morphological and molecular levels, is observed late in embryogenesis and post-embryonically. To distinguish between adaptation and relaxation hypotheses, we investigated the evidence of positive selection on protein-coding genes in relation to their expression over development, in fly Drosohila melanogaster, zebrafish Danio rerio, and mouse Mus musculus. First, we found that genes specifically expressed in late development have stronger signals of positive selection. Second, over the full transcriptome, genes with evidence for positive selection trend to be expressed in late development. Finally, genes involved in pathways with cumulative evidence of positive selection have higher expression in late development. Overall, there is a consistent signal that positive selection mainly affects genes and pathways expressed in late embryonic development and in adult. Our results imply that the evolution of embryogenesis is mostly conservative, with most adaptive evolution affecting some stages of post-embryonic gene expression, and thus post-embryonic phenotypes. This is consistent with the diversity of environmental challenges to which juveniles and adults are exposed.",

We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date, including 20,352 cases and 31,358 controls of European descent, with follow-up analysis of 822 sentinel variants at loci with P<1x10-4 in an independent sample of 9,412 cases and 137,760 controls. In the combined analysis, 30 loci reached genome-wide significant evidence for association, of which 20 were novel. These significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters (CACNA1C, GRIN2A, SCN2A, SLC4A1), synaptic components (RIMS1, ANK3), immune and energy metabolism components. Bipolar disorder type I (depressive and manic episodes; ~73% of our cases) is strongly genetically correlated with schizophrenia whereas bipolar disorder type II (depressive and hypomanic episodes; ~17% of our cases) is more strongly correlated with major depressive disorder. These findings address key clinical questions and provide potential new biological mechanisms for bipolar disorder.",

Genome editing technology has now made this powerful approach routinely applicable to mammalian cells and many other model systems, opening up the possibility to systematically and quantitatively map the cellular proteome in four dimensions. 3D time-lapse confocal microscopy (4D imaging) is an essential tool to investigate spatial and temporal protein dynamics, however it lacks the required quantitative power to make absolute and comparable measurements required for systems analysis. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) on the other hand provides quantitative proteomic and biophysical parameters such as protein concentration, hydrodynamic radius and oligomerization but lacks the ability for high-throughput application in 4D spatial and temporal imaging. Here, we present an automated experimental and computational workflow that integrates both methods and delivers quantitative 4D imaging data in high-throughput. These data is processed to yield a calibration curve relating the fluorescence intensities of image voxels to absolute protein abundance. The calibration curve allows the conversion of the arbitrary fluorescence intensities to protein amounts for all voxels of 4D imaging stacks. With our workflow the users can acquire and analyze hundreds of FCS-calibrated image series to map their proteins of interest in four dimensions. Compared to other protocols, the current protocol does not require additional calibration standards and provides an automated acquisition pipeline for FCS and imaging data. The protocol can be completed in 1 day.",

CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for inserting fluorescent markers into all alleles of the gene of interest (GOI) and permits functionality and physiological expression of the fusion protein. It is essential to evaluate such genome-edited cell lines carefully in order to preclude off-target effects caused by either (i) incorrect insertion of the fluorescent protein, (ii) perturbation of the fusion protein by the fluorescent proteins or (iii) non-specific genomic DNA damage by CRISPR/Cas9. In this protocol1, we provide a step-by-step description of our systematic pipeline to generate and validate homozygous fluorescent knock-in cell lines.\\n\\nWe have used the paired Cas9D10A nickase approach to efficiently insert tags into specific genomic loci via homology-directed repair with minimal off-target effects. It is time- and cost-consuming to perform whole genome sequencing of each cell clone. Therefore, we have developed an efficient validation pipeline of the generated cell lines consisting of junction PCR, Southern Blot analysis, Sanger sequencing, microscopy, Western blot analysis and live cell imaging for cell cycle dynamics.

Using this protocol, up to 70% of the targeted genes can be tagged homozygously with fluorescent proteins and result in physiological levels and phenotypically functional expression of the fusion proteins.\\n\\nEditorial SummaryThis protocol provides a detailed workflow describing how to insert fluorescent markers into all alleles of a gene of interest using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology and how to generate and validate homozygous fluorescent knock-in cell lines.",

Genome mapping has revealed the functional units of chromatin at the sub-megabase scale as self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs) and showed they correspond to replication domains (RDs). A quantitative structural and dynamic description of RD behavior in the nucleus is however missing, as visualization of dynamic subdiffraction-sized RDs remains challenging. Using fluorescence labeling of RDs combined with correlative live and super-resolution microscopy in situ, we determined biophysical parameters to characterize the internal organization, spacing and mechanical coupling of RDs. We found that RDs are typically 150 nm in size and contain four co-replicating regions spaced 60 nm apart. Spatially neighboring RDs are spaced 300 nm apart and connected by highly flexible linker regions that couple their motion only below 550 nm. Our pipeline allows a robust quantitative characterization of chromosome structure in situ, and provides important biophysical parameters to understand general principles of chromatin organization.",

    "abstract": "Procedural memories, such as for riding a bicycle, can be maintained without practice for long periods of time and are thought to be supported by the persistent reorganization of sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1). Whereas enhanced synaptic strength and structural changes accompany the learning of motor tasks, the persistent molecular modifications that store long-term procedural memories within specific layers of sensorimotor cortex have not been identified. The persistent increase in the autonomously active, atypical PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is a putative molecular mechanism for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP) and several forms of long-term memory. Here we examine whether persistent increases in PKM{zeta} store long-term memory for a reaching task in rat sensorimotor cortex that could reveal the sites of procedural memory storage. Perturbing PKM{zeta} synthesis with PKM{zeta} -antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or blocking atypical PKC activity with zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) in S1/M1 disrupts and erases the maintenance of long-term motor memories. Only memories that are maintained without daily reinforcement are affected, indicating atypical PKCs (via ZIP) and PKM{zeta} specifically (via antisense) stores consolidated long-term procedural memories. Analysis of changes in the amount of PKM{zeta} in S1/M1 reveals PKM{zeta} increases in layers II/III and V of both S1 and M1 cortices as performance improves to an asymptote during training. After storage for 1 month without reinforcement, the increase in M1 layer V but not other layers persists without decrement. Thus, the sustained increases in PKM{zeta} reveal that the persistent molecular changes storing long-term procedural memory are localized to the descending output layer of primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrecipitation is predicted to become more variable in the western United States, meaning years of above and below average precipitation will become more common. Periods of extreme precipitation are major drivers of interannual variability in ecosystem functioning in water limited communities, but how ecosystems respond to these extremes over the long-term may shift with precipitation means and variances. Long-term changes in ecosystem functional response could reflect compensatory changes in species composition or species reaching physiological thresholds at extreme precipitation levels.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a five year precipitation manipulation experiment in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem in Idaho, United States. We used drought and irrigation treatments (approximately 50% decrease/increase) to investigate whether ecosystem functional response remains consistent under sustained high or low precipitation. We recorded data on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), species abundance, and soil moisture. We fit a generalized linear mixed effects model to determine if the relationship between ANPP and soil moisture differed among treatments. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling to quantify community composition over the five years.\\n\\nResultsEcosystem functional response, defined as the relationship between soil moisture and ANPP, was similar among irrigation and control treatments, but the drought treatment had a greater slope than the control treatment. However, all estimates for the effect of soil moisture on ANPP overlapped zero, indicating the relationship is weak and uncertain regardless of treatment. There was also large spatial variation in ANPP within-years, which contributes to the uncertainty of the soil moisture effect. Plant community composition was remarkably stable over the course of the experiment and did not differ among treatments.\\n\\nDiscussionDespite some evidence that ecosystem functional response became more sensitive under sustained drought conditions, the response of ANPP to soil moisture was consistently weak and community composition was stable. The similarity of ecosystem functional responses across treatments was not related to compensatory shifts at the plant community level, but instead may reflect the insensitivity of the dominant species to soil moisture. These species may be successful precisely because they have evolved life history strategies which buffer them against precipitation variability.",

Extracting signals related to RNA-related selection processes and using RNA sequencing data from the same samples we identified alterations in RNA expression and splicing linked to mutations on RBP binding sites. We found SRSF10 and MBNL1 motifs in introns, HNRPLL motifs at 5 UTRs, as well as 5 and 3 splice-site motifs, among others, with specific mutational patterns that disrupt the motif and impact RNA processing. MIRA facilitates the integrative analysis of multiple genome sites that operate collectively through common RBPs and can aid in the interpretation of non-coding variants in cancer.

The dominant neuropsychological approach to exercise behavior explains physical activity as a reward. However, the opposite of physical exertion -- behaviors minimizing energy cost -- may also be a reward, which activates automatic reactions favoring the engagement in behaviors associated with lower energetic costs.\\n\\nObjectiveOur objective was to systematically review studies testing the automatic reactions triggered by stimuli associated with different types of exercise behavior (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behaviors) and energetic cost variations (e.g., behaviors minimizing energetic cost).\\n\\nMethodsTwo authors systematically searched, screened, extracted, and analyzed data from articles in the MEDLINE database.\\n\\nResultsWe included 26 studies. Three types of automatic processes were tested: Affective reactions, attentional capture, and approach tendencies. Results show that automatic reactions toward stimuli depicting exercise behaviors explained individuals level of physical activity. Brain imaging results show that stimuli associated with exercise behavior activate regions associated with reward, but these studies were scarce.\\n\\nConclusionReward is an important factor of exercise behavior. There is strong evidence showing that physical activity is a reward. While brain imaging results suggest that sedentary behaviors are also a reward, behaviors minimizing energetic cost have not been investigated so far. Additional studies are required to establish a strong and complete framework of reward in exercise behavior.\\n\\nKey points- Behavioral and brain imaging studies using different types of automatic behavior show that physical activity is a reward\\n- Behaviors minimizing energetic cost have been essential to evolutionary survival and are likely to be a reward. However, experimental evidence remains scarce\\n- The dominant neuropsychological approaches to exercise behavior may be incomplete, which may partly explain our current inability to counteract the pandemic of physical inactivity",

Although research is focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying this symbiosis, the role of epigenetic mechanisms, which have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and acclimation to environmental change, is unknown. To assess the role of DNA methylation in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, we analyzed genome-wide CpG methylation, histone associations, and transcriptomic states of symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones in the model system Aiptasia. We find methylated genes are marked by histone H3K36me3 and show significant reduction of spurious transcription and transcriptional noise, revealing a role of DNA methylation in the maintenance of transcriptional homeostasis. Changes in DNA methylation and expression show enrichment for symbiosis-related processes such as immunity, apoptosis, phagocytosis recognition and phagosome formation, and unveil intricate interactions between the underlying pathways. Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation provides an epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional homeostasis during symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Jumping to conclusions during probabilistic reasoning is a cognitive bias reliably observed in psychosis, and linked to delusion formation. Although the reasons for this cognitive bias are unknown, one suggestion is that psychosis patients may view sampling information as more costly. However, previous computational modelling has provided evidence that patients with chronic schizophrenia jump to conclusion because of noisy decision making. We developed a novel version of the classical beads-task, systematically manipulating the cost of information gathering in four blocks. For 31 individuals with early symptoms of psychosis and 31 healthy volunteers, we examined the numbers of  draws to decision when information sampling had no, a fixed, or an escalating cost. Computational modelling involved estimating a cost of information sampling parameter and a cognitive noise parameter. Overall patients sampled less information than controls. However, group differences in numbers of draws became less prominent at higher cost trials, where less information was sampled. The attenuation of group difference was not due to floor effects, as in the most costly block participants sampled more information than an ideal Bayesian agent. Computational modelling showed that, in the condition with no objective cost to information sampling, patients attributed higher costs to information sampling than controls (Mann-Whiney U=289, p=0.007), with marginal evidence of differences in noise parameter estimates (t=1.86 df=60, p=0.07). In patients, individual differences in severity of psychotic symptoms were statistically significantly associated with higher cost of information sampling (rho=0.6, p=0.001) but not with more cognitive noise (rho=0.27, p=0.14); in controls cognitive noise predicted aspects of schizotypy (preoccupation and distress associated with delusion-like ideation on the Peters Delusion Inventory). Using a psychological manipulation and computational modelling, we provide evidence that early psychosis patients jump to conclusions because of attributing higher costs to sampling information, not because of being primarily noisy decision makers.",

    "abstract": "Many marine organisms have evolved a reflective iris to prevent unfocused light from reaching the retina. The fish iris has a dual function, both to camouflage the eye and serving as a light barrier. Yet, the mechanism that enables this dual functionality and the benefits of using a reflective iris have remained unclear. Using synchrotron micro-focused diffraction, cryo-SEM imaging and optical analyses on zebrafish at different stages of development, we show that the complex optical response of the iris is facilitated by the development a high-order organization of multilayered guanine-based crystal reflectors and pigments. We further demonstrate how the efficient light reflector is established during development to allow the optical functionality of the eye, already at early developmental stages. These results shed light on the evolutionary drive for developing a compact reflective iris, which is widely used by many animal species.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe fish iris is an exquisite example of natures remarkable engineering where specialized cells, dubbed iridophores, produce an efficient light reflector made of guanine-based crystals. This unique structure of the fish iris serves a dual function: In addition to its role as a light barrier, the iris has a second role of camouflaging the eye by creating a silvery reflectance, which merges with the fish skin. The underlying mechanism that enables the aforementioned dual functionality of the fish iris as well as the structural morphogenesis of the guanine reflector during embryonic development, remained unclear.

    "abstract": "Estimating the correct binding modes of ligands in protein-ligand complexes is not only crucial in the drug discovery process, but also for elucidating potential toxicity mechanisms. In the current paper, we discuss and demonstrate a computational modelling protocol using the combination of docking, classical (cMD) and accelerated (aMD) molecular dynamics and free energy perturbation (FEP+ protocol) for identification of the binding modes of selected perfluorocarboxyl acids (PFCAs) in the PPAR{gamma} nuclear receptor.\\n\\nInitially, we employed both the regular and induced fit docking which failed to correctly predict the ligand binding modes and rank the compounds with respect to experimental free energies of binding, when they were docked into non-native X-ray structure. The cMD and aMD simulations identified the presence of multiple binding modes for these compounds, and the shorter chain PFCAs (C6-C8) continuously moved between a few energetically favourable binding conformations. These results demonstrate that the docking scoring function cannot rank compounds precisely in such cases, not due to its insufficiency, but because of the use of incorrect or only one unique bindings pose, neglecting the protein dynamics. Finally, based on MD predictions of binding conformations, the FEP+ sampling protocol was extended and then accurately reproduced experimental differences in the free energies. Thus, the preliminary MD simulations can also provide helpful information about correct set-up of the FEP+ calculations. These results show that the PFCAs binding modes were accurately predicted and the FEP+ protocol can be used to estimate free energies of binding of flexible molecules outside of typical drug-like compounds.\\n\\nOur in silico workflow revealed the main characteristics of the PFCAs, which are week PPAR{gamma} partial agonists and illustrated the importance of specific ligand-residue interactions within the LBD. This work also suggests a common workflow for identification of ligand binding modes, ligand-protein dynamics description and relative free energy calculations.",

    "abstract": "For cells to grow faster they must increase their protein production rate. Microorganisms have traditionally been thought to accomplish this increase by producing more ribosomes to enhance protein synthesis capacity, leading to the linear relationship between ribosome level and growth rate observed under most growth conditions previously examined. Past studies have suggested that this linear relationship represents an optimal resource allocation strategy for each growth rate, independent of any specific nutrient state. Here we investigate protein production strategies in continuous cultures limited for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate, which differentially impact substrate supply for protein versus nucleic acid metabolism. Unexpectedly, we find that at slow growth rates, E. coli achieves the same protein production rate using three different strategies under the three different nutrient limitations. Upon phosphate (P) limitation, translation is slow due to a particularly low abundance of ribosomes, which are RNA-rich and thus particularly costly for phosphorous-limited cells. In nitrogen (N) limitation, translation is slowed by limited glutamine and stalling at glutamine codons, resulting is slow elongation. In carbon (C) limitation, translation is slowed by accumulation of inactive ribosomes not bound to mRNA. These extra ribosomes enable rapid growth acceleration upon nutrient upshift. Thus, bacteria tune ribosome usage across different limiting nutrients to enable balanced nutrient-limited growth while also preparing for future nutrient upshifts.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis results from the interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types. However, current methods to model morphogenic events offer little control over parallel cell type co-emergence and do not offer the capability to selectively perturb gene expression in specific subpopulations of cells. We have developed an in vitro system that can spatiotemporally interrogate cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. We examined the effects of independently knocking down molecular regulators of cortical tension and cell-cell adhesion using inducible CRISPRi: Rho-associated kinase-1 (ROCK1) and E-cadherin (CDH1), respectively. Induced mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 in hiPSC populations resulted in differential patterning events within hiPSC colonies indicative of cell-driven population organization. Patterned colonies retained an epithelial phenotype and nuclear expression of pluripotency markers. Gene expression within each of the mixed populations displayed a transient wave of differential expression with induction of knockdown that stabilized in coordination with intrinsic pattern formation. Mosaic patterning of hiPSCs enables the genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties of pluripotent cells, leading to a greater mechanistic understanding of the specific molecular pathways regulating the dynamics of symmetry breaking events that transpire during developmental morphogenesis.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEHuman embryonic development entails a series of multicellular morphogenic events that lead to primitive tissue formation. Attempts to study human morphogenic processes experimentally have been limited due to divergence from model organisms and the inability of current human in vitro models to accurately control the coincident emergence of heterogeneous cell populations in the spatially controlled manner necessary for proper tissue structure. We developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) in vitro model that enables temporal control over the emergence of heterotypic subpopulations of cells. We examined mosaic knockdown of two target molecules to create predictable and robust cell-patterning events within hiPSC colonies. This method allows for dynamic interrogation of intrinsic cell mechanisms that initiate symmetry breaking events and provides direct insight(s) into tissue developmental principles.",

    "abstract": "As proteins in mammalian cells exhibit optimal stability at natural temperatures, small temperature variations may cause unfolding and subsequent non-specific aggregation. As this process leads to a loss of function of the affected polypeptides as well as to further cytotoxic stress, aggregate formation has been recognized as a major pathogenic factor in human diseases. In this study we determined the impact of physiological heat stress on mammalian mitochondria on a proteomic level. The overall solubility of endogenous mitochondrial proteins was only marginally affected by a treatment at elevated temperatures. However, we identified a small subset of polypeptides that exhibited an exceptionally high sensitivity to heat stress. The mitochondrial translation elongation factor Tu (Tufm), a protein essential for organellar protein biosynthesis, was highly aggregation-prone and lost its solubility already under mild heat stress conditions. In parallel, mitochondrial translation as well as the import of cytosolic proteins was defective in heat stressed mitochondria. Both types of nascent polypeptides, derived from translation as well as from import exhibited a strong heat-induced aggregation tendency. We propose a model that a quick and specific inactivation of elongation factors may prevent an accumulation of misfolded nascent polypeptides and thereby attenuate proteotoxicity under stress.",

COPII vesicles export newly synthesized secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

In order to investigate the roles of mammalian Sec24 isoforms in cargo sorting, we have combined in vitro COPII vesicle reconstitutions with SILAC-based mass spectrometric analysis. This approach enabled us to identify the core proteome of mammalian COPII vesicles. Comparison of the proteomes generated from vesicles with different Sec24 isoforms confirms several established isoform-dependent cargo proteins, and identifies ERGIC1 and CNIH1 as novel Sec24C- and Sec24A-specific cargo proteins, respectively. Proteomic analysis of vesicles reconstituted with a Sec24C mutant, bearing a compromised binding site for the ER-to-Golgi QSNARE Syntaxin5, revealed that the SM/Munc18 protein SCFD1 binds to Syntaxin5 prior to its sorting into COPII vesicles. Furthermore, analysis of Sec24D mutants implicated in the development of a syndromic form of osteogenesis imperfecta showed sorting defects for the three ER-to-Golgi QSNAREs Syntaxin5, GS27, and Bet1.",

We find consistent patterns of eye movements on the floor predictive of steering commands issued by the driver in all subjects.

    "abstract": "An important aim of the development of selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) is to present a completely open and flexible microscope set-up for nonspecialist users. Here, we report Structured SPIM (SSPIM), which provides an open-source, user-friendly and compact toolbox for beam shaping that can generate digital patterns for a wide range of illumination beams. SSPIM represents a toolbox to produce static, spherical Gaussian, Bessel and Airy beams by simple control of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). In addition, it is able to produce patterns for incoherent and coherent (lattice beam) array beam formation and tiling for all types of beams supported. We demonstrate the workflow and experimental and simulation results using the SSPIM toolbox. In final, the capability of the SSPIM is investigated with 3D imaging of Drosophila embryo using three different illumination beams such as scanned/dithered Gaussian, Bessel and Lattice beam which engineered with SSPIM. SSPIM toolbox is easy to use and applicable for a wide range of applications to generate and optimize the desired beam pattern and thus can help developing adaptation of the Open SPIM system towards a wider range of biological samples.",

    "abstract": "Proteins that fold cotranslationally may do so in a restricted configurational space, due to the volume occupied by the ribosome. How does this environment, coupled with the close proximity of the ribosome, affect the folding pathway of a protein? Previous studies have shown that the cotranslational folding process for many proteins, including small, single domains, is directly affected by the ribosome. Here, we investigate the cotranslational folding of an all-b immunoglobulin domain, titin I27. Using an arrest peptide-based assay and structural studies by cryo-EM, we show that I27 folds in the mouth of the ribosome exit tunnel. Simulations that use a kinetic model for the force-dependence of escape from arrest, accurately predict the fraction of folded protein as a function of length. We used these simulations to probe the folding pathway on and off the ribosome. Our simulations - which also reproduce experiments on mutant forms of I27 - show that I27 folds, while still sequestered in the mouth of the ribosome exit tunnel, by essentially the same pathway as free I27, with only subtle shifts of critical contacts from the C to the N terminus.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost proteins need to fold into a specific three-dimensional structure in order to function. The mechanism by which isolated proteins fold has been thoroughly studied by experiment and theory. However, in the cell proteins do not fold in isolation, but are synthesized as linear chains by the ribosome during translation. It is therefore natural to ask at which point during synthesis proteins fold, and whether this differs from the folding of isolated protein molecules. By studying folding of a well characterized protein domain, titin I27, stalled at different points during translation, we show that it already folds in the mouth of the ribosome exit tunnel, and that the mechanism is almost identical to that of the isolated protein.",

    "abstract": "Syndecan-4 (Sdc4) organizes a complex of receptors consisting of its homologue, Sdc2, the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and MST1R/RON, and the laminin-binding 3{beta}1 and 6{beta}4 integrins that depends on a docking site within its extracellular domain. A peptide mimetic of the extracellular docking site, synstatin-EGFR (SSTNEGFR), disrupts the receptor complex and prevents the invasion of non-transformed or carcinoma cells that relies on active EGFR. However, the peptide also prevents DNA replication that relies on active MST1R/RON and c-Abl kinase within the complex, resulting in rapid S-phase arrest of head & neck (HN) and breast carcinoma cells. SSTNEGFR does not affect DNA replication in non-transformed oral or breast epithelial cells, but it does block their EGF-dependent invasion. Although EGFR is required as a component of the complex, its kinase activity is not required to sustain S-phase progression in the carcinoma cells, perhaps explaining why many HN and breast carcinomas that overexpress EGFR are nonetheless refractory to EGFR inhibitors. The syndecan-organized receptor complex (Sdc:RTK:ITG complex) appears to suppress stress signals that would otherwise disrupt the replisome engaged in DNA synthesis. SSTNEGFR-treatment of carcinoma cells, or normal oral epithelial cells expressing stress-inducing HPV oncogenes, causes rapid activation of the p38 stress MAPK leading to loss of PCNA from the chromatin and cessation of DNA synthesis. This arrest is independent of the common DNA damage response (DDR) known to activate an S-phase checkpoint, revealing a novel arrest mechanism and a novel receptor complex that is activated on tumor cells to suppress stress-induced proliferation arrest.",

    "abstract": "The phenotypic effect of perturbing a genes activity depends on the activity level of other genes, reflecting the notion that phenotypes are emergent properties of a network of functionally interacting genes. In the context of cancer, contemporary investigations have primarily focused on just one type of functional genetic interaction (GI) - synthetic lethality (SL). However, there may be additional types of GIs whose systematic identification would enrich the molecular and functional characterization of cancer. Here, we describe a novel data-driven approach called EnGIne, that applied to TCGA data identifies 71,946 GIs spanning 12 distinct types, only a small minority of which are SLs. The detected GIs explain cancer driver genes tissue-specificity and differences in patients response to drugs, and stratify breast cancer tumors into refined subtypes. These results expand the scope of cancer GIs and lay a conceptual and computational basis for future studies of additional types of GIs and their translational applications.

    "abstract": "PurposeInsulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) signaling regulates breast cancer initiation and progression and associated cancer phenotypes. We previously identified E-cadherin (CDH1) as a repressor of IGF1 signaling and in this study examined how loss of E-cadherin affects IGF1R signaling and response to anti-IGF1R therapies in breast cancer.\\n\\nExperimental DesignBreast cancer cell lines were used to assess how altered E-cadherin levels regulate IGF1R signaling and response to two anti-IGF1R therapies. In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to define interaction between IGF1R and E-cadherin. TCGA RNA-seq and RPPA data was used to compare IGF1R activation in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tumors. ER+ ILC cell lines and xenograft tumor explant cultures were used to evaluate efficacy to IGF1R pathway inhibition in combination with endocrine therapy.\\n\\nResultsDiminished functional E-cadherin increased both activation of IGF1R signaling and efficacy to anti-IGF1R therapies. PLA demonstrated a direct endogenous interaction between IGF1R and E-cadherin at points of cell-cell contact. Increased expression of IGF1 ligand and levels of IGF1R phosphorylation were observed in E-cadherin deficient ER+ ILC compared to IDC tumors. IGF1R pathway inhibitors were effective in inhibiting growth in ER+ ILC cell lines and synergized with endocrine therapy and similarly IGF1R inhibition reduced proliferation in ILC tumor explant culture.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide evidence that loss of E-cadherin hyperactivates the IGF1R pathway and increases sensitivity to IGF1R targeted therapy, thus identifying the IGF1R pathway as a potential novel target in E-cadherin deficient breast cancers.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEIGF1R signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in breast cancer due to its regulation of proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, clinical trials targeting IGF1R have largely been unsuccessful due to lack of biomarkers to stratify patients for therapeutic response. In this study, we demonstrate loss of E-cadherin as a potential biomarker for response to anti-IGF1R therapy, and show efficacy of IGF1R inhibition in ER+ ILC in combination with endocrine therapy. Patients with ER+ ILC have poorer long-term outcomes than patients with ER+ IDC and have a propensity for increased late recurrences, highlighting the need for improved therapeutic strategies for this subtype of breast cancer. Here, we credential IGF1R inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of ER+ ILC.",

Here we demonstrate robust cartilaginous matrix production in three unique hiPSC lines using a highly efficient and reproducible differentiation protocol. To purify chondroprogenitors produced by this protocol, we engineered a COL2A1-GFP knock-in reporter hiPSC line by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic information has been increasingly included into (meta)community assembly studies. However, recent studies have challenged the framework commonly used to infer processes from phylogenetic structure. Amphibians are good model organisms to study processes promoting structure in metacommunities, since they are subjected to different environmental and spatial processes throughout their biphasic life cycle. Pond canopy cover is one of these environmental factors that strongly influence the distribution of species and traits of several freshwater taxa, including larval amphibians (e.g., behavior, color, fin height, and length of intestine). Here, I tested the influence of pond canopy cover, floating vegetation, and pond morphology on the phylogenetic structure of an anuran metacommunity in the Atlantic Forest of Southeastern Brazil. I sampled tadpoles in 13 ponds and marshes from June 2008 and July 2009 in the Serra da Bocaina National Park, Sao Paulo. After building a metacommunity phylogeny, I used an eigenvector-based technique to describe the metacommunity phylogenetic composition (Principal Coordinates of Phylogenetic Structure, PCPS). I then run a db-RDA to evalute whether a subset of these eigenvectors can be explained by environmental variables. I found that pond canopy cover and floating vegetation were the main variables influencing lineage sorting in this metacommunity. Canopy cover separated hylid lineages from other families that were associated with open areas. Floating vegetation separated two hylid tribes (Cophomantini and Dendropsophini). Our results mainly suggest that the effect of canopy cover and floating vegetation on the structure of anuran metacommunity may affect not only species, but also entire lineages.",

Response to an urgent public health crisis requires accelerated research even as emerging epidemics themselves change rapidly and are inherently less well understood than well-established diseases. As part of the World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint, we designed a web-based interactive decision support system (InterVax-Tool) to help diverse stakeholders navigate the epidemiological, logistical, and ethical decisions involved in designing a vaccine efficacy trial during a public health emergency. In contrast to existing literature on trial design, InterVax-Tool offers high-level visual and interactive assistance through a set of four decision trees, guiding users through selection of 1) the Primary Endpoint, (2) the Target Population, (3) Randomization, and (4) the Comparator. Guidance is provided on how each of fourteen key considerations-grouped as Epidemiological, Vaccine-related, Infrastructural, or Sociocultural-should be used to inform each decision in the trial design process. The tool is not intended to provide a black box decision framework for identifying an optimal trial design, but rather to facilitate transparent, collaborative and comprehensive discussion of the relevant decisions, while recording the decision process. The tool can also assist capacity building by providing a cross-disciplinary picture of trial design using concepts from epidemiology, study design, vaccinology, biostatistics, mathematical modeling and clinical research ethics. Here, we describe the goals and features of InterVax-Tool as well as its application to the design of a Zika vaccine efficacy trial.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAn interactive web-based decision support tool was developed to assist in the design of vaccine efficacy trials during emerging outbreaks.",

Genomic markers can now be developed for non-model species using reduced representation library (RRL) sequencing methods that select a fraction of the genome using targeted sequence capture or restriction enzymes (genotyping-by-sequencing, GBS). We explored the influence of marker number and length, knowledge of gametic phase, and tradeoffs between sample size and sequencing depth on the quality of demographic inferences performed with ABC. We focused on 2-population models of recent spatial expansion with varying numbers of unknown parameters. Performing ABC on simulated datasets with known parameter values, we found that the timing of a recent spatial expansion event could be precisely estimated in a 3-parameter model. Taking into account uncertainty in parameters such as initial population size and migration rate collectively decreased the precision of inferences dramatically. Phasing haplotypes did not improve results, regardless of sequence length. Numerous short sequences were as valuable as fewer, longer sequences, and performed best when a large sample size was sequenced at low individual depth, even when sequencing errors were added. ABC results were similar to results obtained with an alternative method based on the site frequency spectrum (SFS) when performed with unphased GBS-type markers. We conclude that unphased GBS-type datasets can be sufficient to precisely infer simple demographic models, and discuss possible improvements for the use of ABC with genomic data.",

    "abstract": "About 450 million years ago, a marine chordate was subject to two successive whole genome duplications (WGDs) before becoming the common ancestor of vertebrates and diversifying into the more than 60,000 species found today. Here, we reconstruct in details the evolution of chromosomes of this early vertebrate along successive steps of the two WGD. We first compared 61 extant animal genomes to build a highly contiguous order of genes in a 326 million years old ancestral Amniota genome. In this genome, we established a well-supported list of duplicated genes originating from the WGDs to link chromosomes in tetrads, a telltale signature of these events. This enabled us to reconstruct a scenario where a pre-vertebrate genome composed of 17 chromosomes duplicated into 34 chromosomes, and was subject to 7 chromosome fusions before duplicating again into 54 chromosomes. After the separation of Agnatha (jawless fish) and Gnathostomata, four more fusions took place to form the ancestral Euteleostomi genome of 50 chromosomes. These results firmly establish the occurrence of the two WGD, resolving in particular the ambiguity raised by the analysis of the lamprey genetic map. In addition, we provide insight into the origin of homologous micro-chromosomes found in the chicken and the gar genomes. This work provides a foundation for studying the evolution of vertebrate chromosomes from the standpoint of a common ancestor, and particularly the pattern of duplicate gene retention and loss that resulted in the gene composition of extant genomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhole human genome sequencing initiatives provide a compendium of genetic variants that help us understand population history and the basis of genetic diseases. Current data mostly focuses on Old World populations and information on the genomic structure of Native Americans, especially those from the Southern Cone is scant.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a high-quality complete genome sequence of 11 Mapuche-Huilliche individuals (HUI) from Southern Chile (85% genomic and 98% exonic coverage at > 30X), with 96-97% high confidence calls. We found approximately 3.1x106 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) per individual and identified 403,383 (6.9%) of novel SNVs that are not included in current sequencing databases. Analyses of large-scale genomic events detected 680 copy number variants (CNVs) and 4,514 structural variants (SVs), including 398 and 1,910 novel events, respectively. Global ancestry composition of HUI genomes revealed that the cohort represents a marginally admixed population from the Southern Cone, whose genetic component is derived from early Native American ancestors. In addition, we found that HUI genomes display highly divergent and novel variants with potential functional impact that converge in ontological categories essential in cell metabolic processes.\\n\\nConclusionsMapuche-Huilliche genomes contain a unique set of small- and large-scale genomic variants in functionally linked genes, which may contribute to susceptibility for the development of common complex diseases or traits in admixed Latinos and Native American populations. Our data represents an ancestral reference panel for population-based studies in Native and admixed Latin American populations.",

    "abstract": "Endotoxin tolerance is a long-recognised property of macrophages that leads to an altered response to repeated or chronic exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The physiological role of tolerance is to limit the potential damage to host tissue that may otherwise result from prolonged production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Endotoxin tolerance is induced by all TLRs tested to date, however, tolerance induced by the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is by far the best studied. LPS tolerance involves a global transcriptional shift from a pro-inflammatory response toward one characterised by the expression of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution factors. Although largely reversible, LPS-tolerance leads to a hybrid macrophage activation state that is pro-inflammatory in nature but possesses distinct regulatory anti-inflammatory features. Remarkably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis of tolerance induced by different TLR ligands has not previously been reported. Here we describe the transcriptomic profiles of mouse macrophages tolerised with ligands for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR 9. While we identified TLR-specific transcriptional profiles in macrophages tolerised with each ligand, tolerance induced by TLR4 was the most comprehensive state, such that each gene tolerised by any of the TLRs tested was also found to be tolerised by TLR4. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are not universally supressed in all tolerant cells but distinct patterns of cytokine expression distinguished TLR-specific tolerance. Analysis of gene regulatory regions revealed specific DNA sequence motifs associated with distinct states of TLR tolerance, implicating previously identified as well as novel transcriptional regulators of tolerance in macrophages. These data provide a basis for the future exploitation of TLR-specific tolerant states to achieve therapeutic re-programming of the innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "Secretory immunoglobulins (SIg) are a first line of mucosal defense by the host. They are secreted into the gut lumen via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) where they bind to antigen and are transported back across the FAE via M cells. Noroviruses are highly prevalent, enteric pathogens that cause significant morbidity, mortality and economic losses worldwide. Murine norovirus (MNV) exploits microfold (M) cells to cross the lymphoid follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) and infect the underlying population of immune cells. However, whether natural, innate SIg can protect against norovirus infection remains unknown. To investigate the role of natural SIg during murine norovirus pathogenesis, we used pIgR-deficient animals, which lack SIg in the intestinal lumen. Contrary to other enteric pathogens, acute MNV replication was significantly reduced in the gastrointestinal tract of pIgR-deficient animals compared to controls, despite increased numbers of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells in the Peyers patch, established MNV target cell types. Also, natural SIg did not alter MNV FAE binding or FAE crossing into the lymphoid follicle. Instead, further analysis revealed enhanced baseline levels of the antiviral molecules interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the small intestine of naive pIgR-deficient animals compared to controls. Removing the microbiota equalized IFN{gamma} and iNOS transcript levels as well as MNV viral loads in germ-free pIgR KO mice compared to germ-free controls. These data are consistent with a model whereby SIg sensing reduces pro-inflammatory, antiviral molecules, which facilitates intestinal homeostasis but thereby promotes MNV infection. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that natural SIg are not protective during norovirus infection in mice and represent another example of indirect modulation of enteric virus pathogenesis by the microbiota.",

The recent introduction of routine whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a replacement for existing reference techniques in England provides an opportunity to characterise the genetic determinants of resistance. We conducted a systematic review to catalogue all known resistance determining mutations. This knowledge was used to construct a predictive algorithm based on mutations in the erm(41) and rrl genes which was tested on a collection of 203 sequentially acquired clinical isolates for which there was paired genotype/phenotype data. A search for novel resistance determining mutations was conducted using an heuristic algorithm.\\n\\nThe sensitivity of existing knowledge for predicting resistance in clarithromycin was 95% (95% CI 89 - 98%) and the specificity was 66% (95% CI 54 - 76%). Subspecies alone was a poor predictor of resistance to clarithromycin. Eight potential new resistance conferring SNPs were identified. WGS demonstrates probable resistance determining SNPs in regions the NTM-DR line probe cannot detect. These mutations are potentially clinically important as they all occurred in samples predicted to be inducibly resistant, and for which a macrolide would therefore currently be indicated. We were unable to explain all resistance, raising the possibility of the involvement of other as yet unidentified genes.",

    "abstract": "The effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on photosynthetic efficiency and the resulting mechanisms against UV exposure employed by phytoplankton are not completely understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a novel close-coupled, wavelength-configurable platform designed to produce precise and repeatable in vitro irradiation of Corethron hystrix, a member of a genera found abundantly in the Southern Ocean where UV exposure is high. We aimed to determine its metabolic, protective, mutative, and repair mechanisms as a function of varying levels of specific electromagnetic energy. Our results show that the physiological responses to each energy level of UV have a negative linear decrease in the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II proportional to UV intensity, corresponding to a large increase in the turnover time of quinone re-oxidation. Gene expression changes of photosystem II related reaction center proteins D1, CP43 and CP47 showed coordinated downregulation whereas the central metabolic pathway demonstrated mixed expression of up and downregulated transcripts after UVR exposure. These results suggest that while UVR may damage photosynthetic machinery, oxidative damage may limit production of new photosynthetic and electron transport complexes as a result of UVR exposure.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. The function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction of fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBiofilms are bacterial groups, often attached to surfaces, in which a broad variety of cooperative and competitive interactions typically occur. The spatial organization of different strains and species within biofilm communities strongly influences their global functioning, but little is known about how such structure arises. Combining experiments on V. cholerae and simulations of a cellular automaton, we show that the complex interaction between bacterial traits (cell adhesion) and environmental factors (fluid flow intensity) strongly influences the early origins of biofilm spatial structure. In most cases, we found that highly-adhesive strains form larger clusters than the weakly-adhesive ones. Against intuition, however, we also found the opposite outcome: weakly-adhesive tend to form larger clusters than the highly adhesive ones when flows are weak or the population density of colonizing cells is high.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. The progression to this pathogenic lifestyle is preceded by asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx. This colonization is associated with biofilm formation; the competence pathway influences the structure and stability of biofilms. However, the molecules that link the competence pathway to biofilm formation are unknown. Here, we describe a new competence-induced gene, called briC, and demonstrate that its product promotes biofilm development and stimulates colonization in a murine model. We show that expression of briC is induced by the master regulator of competence, ComE. Whereas briC does not substantially influence early biofilm development on abiotic surfaces, it significantly impacts later stages of biofilm development. Specifically, briC expression leads to increases in biofilm biomass and thickness at 72h. Consistent with the role of biofilms in colonization, briC promotes nasopharyngeal colonization in the murine model. The function of BriC appears to be conserved across pneumococci, as comparative genomics reveal that briC is widespread across isolates. Surprisingly, many isolates, including strains from clinically important PMEN1 and PMEN14 lineages, which are widely associated with colonization, encode a long briC promoter. This long form captures an instance of genomic plasticity and functions as a competence-independent expression enhancer that may serve as a precocious point of entry into this otherwise competence-regulated pathway. Moreover, overexpression of briC by the long promoter fully rescues the comE-deletion induced biofilm defect in vitro, and partially in vivo. These findings indicate that BriC may bypass the influence of competence in biofilm development and that such a pathway may be active in a subset of pneumococcal lineages. In conclusion, BriC is a part of the complex molecular network that connects signaling of the competence pathway to biofilm development and colonization.",

    "abstract": "Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern \\\"noise\\\" spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe brain encodes information by ensembles of neurons, and recent technological developments allow researchers to simultaneously record from over thousands of neurons. Neurons exhibit spontaneous activity patterns, which are constrained by experience and development, limiting the portion of state space that is effectively visited. Patterns of spontaneous activity may contribute to shaping the synaptic connectivity matrix and contribute to memory consolidation, and synaptic plasticity formation depends crucially on the temporal spiking order among neurons. Hence, the unsupervised detection of spike sequences is a sine qua non for understanding how spontaneous activity contributes to memory formation. Yet, sequence detection presents major methodological challenges like the sparsity and stochasticity of neuronal output, and its high dimensionality. We propose a dissimilarity measure between neuronal patterns based on optimal transport theory, determining their similarity from the pairwise cross-correlation matrix, which can be taken as a proxy of the \\\"trace\\\" that is left on the synaptic matrix. We then perform unsupervised clustering and visualization of patterns using density clustering on the dissimilarity matrix and low-dimensional embedding techniques. This method does not require binning of spike times, is robust to noise, jitter and rate fluctuations, and can detect more patterns than the number of neurons.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy remains one of the most common neurological disorders. In patients, it is characterized by unprovoked, spontaneous, and recurring seizures or ictal events. Typically, inter-ictal events or large bouts of population level activity can be measured between seizures and are generally asymptomatic. Decades of research has focused on understanding the mechanisms leading to the development of seizure-like activity using various proconvulsive pharmacological agents, including 4-aimnopyridine (4AP). However, the lack of consistency in the concentrations used for studying 4AP-induced epileptiform activity in animal models may give rise to differences in the results and interpretation thereof. Indeed, the range of 4AP concentration in both in vivo and in vitro studies varies from 3M to 40mM. Here, we explored the effects of various 4AP concentrations on the development and characteristics of hippocampal epileptiform activity in acute mouse brain slices of either sex. Using multielectrode array recordings, we show that 4AP induces hippocampal epileptiform activity for broad range of concentrations. The frequency component and the spatio-temporal patterns of the epileptiform activity revealed a dose-dependent response. Finally, in the presence of 4AP, reduction of KCC2 co-transporter activity by KCC2 antagonist VU0240551 prevented the manifestation of the frequency component differences between different concentrations of 4AP. Overall, the study predicts that different concentrations of 4AP can result in the different mechanisms behind hippocampal epileptiform activity, of which some are dependent on the KCC2 co-transporter function.",

It has been estimated that this reduction accounts for a substantial fraction of the attention-mediated improvement in sensory processing. These estimates depend on assumptions about how population signals are decoded and the conclusion that correlated variability impairs perception, is purely hypothetical. Here we test this proposal directly by optogenetically inducing low-frequency fluctuations, to see if this interferes with performance in an attention-demanding task. We find that low- frequency optical stimulation of neurons in V4 elevates correlations among pairs of neurons and impairs the animals ability to make fine sensory discriminations. Stimulation at higher frequencies does not impair performance, despite comparable modulation of neuronal responses. These results support the hypothesis that attention-dependent reductions in correlated variability contribute to improved perception of attended stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Understanding movies and stories requires maintaining a high-level situation model that abstracts away from perceptual details to describe the location, characters, actions, and causal relationships of the currently unfolding event. These models are built not only from information present in the current narrative, but also from prior knowledge about schematic event scripts, which describe typical event sequences encountered throughout a lifetime. We analyzed fMRI data from 44 human subjects presented with sixteen three-minute stories, consisting of four schematic events drawn from two different scripts (eating at a restaurant or going through the airport). Aside from this shared script structure, the stories varied widely in terms of their characters and storylines, and were presented in two highly dissimilar formats (audiovisual clips or spoken narration). One group was presented with the stories in an intact temporal sequence, while a separate control group was presented with the same events in scrambled order. Regions including the posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and superior frontal gyrus exhibited schematic event patterns that generalized across stories, subjects, and modalities. Patterns in mPFC were also sensitive to overall script structure, with temporally scrambled events evoking weaker schematic representations. Using a Hidden Markov Model, patterns in these regions can predict the script (restaurant vs. airport) of unlabeled data with high accuracy, and can be used to temporally align multiple stories with a shared script. These results extend work on the perception of controlled, artificial schemas in human and animal experiments to naturalistic perception of complex narrative stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn almost all situations we encounter in our daily lives, we are able to draw on our schematic knowledge about what typically happens in the world to better perceive and mentally represent our ongoing experiences. In contrast to previous studies that investigated schematic cognition using simple, artificial associations, we measured brain activity from subjects watching movies and listening to stories depicting restaurant or airport experiences. Our results reveal a network of brain regions that is sensitive to the shared temporal structure of these naturalistic situations. These regions abstract away from the particular details of each story, activating a representation of the general type of situation being perceived.",

    "abstract": "During complex tasks, patterns of functional connectivity (FC) differ from those in the resting state. What accounts for such differences remains unclear. Brain activity during a task reflects an unknown mixture of spontaneous activity and task-evoked responses. The difference in FC between a task state and resting state may reflect not only task-evoked connectivity, but also changes in spontaneously emerging networks. Here, we characterized the difference in apparent functional connectivity between the resting state and when human subjects were watching a naturalistic movie. Such differences were marginally (3-15%) explained by the task-evoked networks directly involved in processing the movie content, but mostly attributable to changes in spontaneous networks driven by ongoing activity during the task. The execution of the task reduced the correlations in ongoing activity among different cortical networks, especially between the visual and non-visual sensory cortices. Our results suggest that the interaction between spontaneous and task-evoked activities is not mutually independent or linearly additive, and that engaging in a task may suppress ongoing activity.",

    "abstract": "The article presents a novel stochastic mathematical model of mitosis in heterogeneous (multiple-phenotype), age-dependent cell populations. The developed computational techniques involve flexible use of differentiation tree diagrams. The applicability of the model is discussed in the context of the Haeckelian (biogenetic) paradigm. In particular, the article puts forward the conjecture of generality of Haeckels recapitulation law. The conjecture is briefly collated against relevant scientific evidence and elaborated for the specific case of evolving/mutable cell phenotypes as considered by the model. The feasibility, basic regimes and the convenience of the model are tested on examples and experimental data, and the corresponding open source simulation software is described and demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Tomato green fruits photosynthesis contributes to fruit growth and carbon economy. Tomato auxin response factor 10 (SlARF10) is one of the members of ARF family. Our results showed that SlARF10 locates in the nucleus and has no transcriptional activity. SlARF10 was expressed in various tomato tissues, but highly expressed in green fruit. Up-regulation of SlARF10 produced dark green phenotype of fruits, whereas down-regulation of SlARF10 had light green phenotype. Autofluorescence and chlorophyll content analysis confirmed the phenotypes, which indicated that SlARF10 plays an important role in chlorophyll accumulation in tomato fruits. Up-regulation of SlARF10 increased the photochemical potential in tomato leaves and fruits. Furthermore, the SlARF10 up-regulating lines displayed improved accumulation of starch in fruits, whereas SlARF10 suppressed lines had inhibited starch accumulation. Up-regulation of SlARF10 increased the expression of AGPases, the starch biosynthesis genes. SlARF10 up-regulating lines had increased accumulation of SlGLK1 and SlGLK2 transcripts in fruits. The promoter sequence of SlGLK1 gene had two conserved ARF binding sites. SlARF10 may regulate the expression of SlGLK1, thus controlling chlorophyll accumulation, photosynthesis rates and sugars synthesis in fruits. Our study provided more insight on the link between auxin signaling, chloroplastic activity and sugar metabolism during the development of tomato fruits.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nHighlightSlARF10 played an important role in the chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthesis in tomato fruits.

    "abstract": "Stomata control gas exchanges between the plant and the atmosphere. How natural variation in stomata size and density contributes to resolve trade-offs between carbon uptake and water-loss in response to local climatic variation is not yet understood. We developed an automated confocal microscopy approach to characterize natural genetic variation in stomatal patterning in 330 fully-sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana accessions collected throughout the European range of the species. We compared this to variation in water-use efficiency, measured as carbon isotope discrimination ({delta}13C). We detect substantial genetic variation for stomata size and density segregating within Arabidopsis thaliana. A positive correlation between stomata size and {delta}13C further suggests that this variation has consequences on water-use efficiency. Genome-wide association analyses indicate a complex genetic architecture underlying not only variation in stomata patterning but also to its co-variation with carbon uptake parameters. Yet, we report two novel QTL affecting {delta}13C independently of stomata patterning. This suggests that, in A. thaliana, both morphological and physiological variants contribute to genetic variance in water-use efficiency. Patterns of regional differentiation and co-variation with climatic parameters indicate that natural selection has contributed to shape some of this variation, especially in Southern Sweden, where water availability is more limited in spring relative to summer. These conditions are expected to favor the evolution of drought avoidance mechanisms over drought escape strategies.",

One Zygoptera species Mortonagrion varalli was newly added to the Odonata fauna of Bangladesh. Among surveyed habitats, species richness was highest in marshland with 38 species followed by 34 species in the lakeside. On the other hand, odonata diversity was lowest in the mangrove area. Our study shows a positive correlation between environmental variables (such as average rainfall, relative humidity, and average temperature) and species richness in the study area.

    "abstract": "Ageing is the largest risk factor for a variety of non-communicable diseases. Model organism studies have shown that genetic and chemical perturbations can extend both life- and health-span. Ageing is a complex process, with parallel and interacting mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover drugs that could combat ageing in human brain. Using multiple gene expression datasets from brain tissue, taken from patients of different ages, we first identified the expression changes that characterise ageing. Then, we compared these changes in gene expression with drug perturbed expression profiles in the Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as anti-ageing drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during ageing, others by mimicking the cellular defense mechanisms. The drugs that we identified included significant number of already identified pro-longevity drugs, indicating that the method can discover de novo drugs that meliorate ageing. The approach has the advantages that, by using data from human brain ageing data it focuses on processes relevant in human ageing and that it is unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for ageing studies.",

By determining an NMR-derived structure of the complex formed by the HCN2 channel CNBD and a minimal TRIP8b fragment, TRIPnano, we show here a bipartite interaction between the peptide and CNBD which prevents cAMP binding in two ways: through direct competition for binding at the distal C-helix of the CNBD; and through an allosteric reduction in cAMP affinity induced by TRIP8b binding to the CNBD N-bundle loop. TRIPnano abolishes cAMP binding in all three isoforms, HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4 and can be used to prevent cAMP stimulation in native f-channels. Application of TRIP8bnano, or its delivery via a cell-penetrating sequence, in sinoatrial node myocytes, selectively inhibits beta-adrenergic stimulation of the native If current and mimics the physiological concentrations of acetylcholine leading to a 30% reduction in the spontaneus rate of action potential firing.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common cancer in humans. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, along with its downstream effector mTOR, is one of the most frequently altered pathways in HNSCC, and is downstream of growth factor signaling including that mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is also commonly upregulated in HNSCC. Recently, IQ motif-containing GTPase activation protein 1 (IQGAP1) has been reported to function as a scaffold for the enzymes involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Iqgap1 gene expression is increased in human HNSCCs, raising the hypothesis that it acts as an oncogene in this cancer. Whether IQGAP1 is necessary for HNSCC development as well as what is its underlying mechanism are both unknown. Here we report on the role of IQGAP1 in HNSCC by performing a combination of in vitro studies using human cancer cell lines, and in vivo studies using a well-validated preclinical mouse model for HNSCC that is known to depend upon EGFR signaling. Cells knocked out for IQGAP1 lost AKT signaling. Disruption of IQGAP1-scaffolded PI3K/AKT signaling using a peptide that interferes with the ability of IQGAP1 to bind to PI3K reduced HNSCC cell survival. In vivo studies utilizing Iqgap1-null (Iqgap1-/-) mice demonstrated that IQGAP1 is necessary for efficient PI3K signaling upon EGF-stimulation. Treatment of Iqgap1-/- mice with the oral carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), Iqgap1-/- led to significantly lower multiplicities of cancer foci as well as significantly lower numbers of high grade cancers than observed in similarly treated Iqgap1+/+ mice. IQGAP1 protein was increased in its expression in HNSCCs arising in the Iqgap1+/+ mice, consistent with that seen in human HNSCCs. We also observed a significant down-regulation of PI3K signaling in 4NQO-induced HNSCCs arising in the Iqgap1-/- mice, consistent with IQGAP1 contributing to carcinogenesis by promoting PI3K signaling. Our studies, therefore, support the hypothesis that IQGAP1 acts as an oncogene in head and neck carcinogenesis, and provide mechanistic insight into its role.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are commonly deregulated in many cancers including head and neck cancer (HNC). Recently, we have shown that the IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) provides a molecular platform to scaffold all the components from the PI3K-Akt pathway and results in the sequential generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PI3,4,5P3). This makes the IQGAP1-PI3K scaffold a promising therapeutic target. In addition to the PI3K-Akt pathway, IQGAP1 also scaffolds the Ras-ERK pathway. To identify an IQGAP1 mutant that specifically loses IQGAP1-PI3K signaling but not other functions, we have focused on the IQ3 motif since this region binds with both the PIPK1 and PI3K enzymes and a short peptide derived from this sequence blocks binding and PI3K signaling. An IQ3 deletion mutant ({Delta}IQ3) in IQGAP1 was functionally compared with wild-type (WT) IQGAP1. We found that the IQ3 domain specifically mediates the PI3K-Akt pathway but does not regulate the Ras-ERK pathway. The IQ3 deletion mutant lost interactions with PI3K-Akt components but retained its binding of ERK pathway components and cell surface receptors, EGFR and integrins. In addition, the IQ3 deletion mutant lost regulation of cell migration. Consistently, the IQ3 motif derived peptide blocked Akt activation and led to the blockage of invasion mediated by EGFR organized into an integrin complex by syndecan-4. Taken together, this work has defined the IQGAP1 IQ3 motif as a specific target sequence for the scaffolding of the PI3K-AKT pathway.",

The cancer-only pipeline was unreliable, with about 69% of the identified somatic variants being false positive. Even with matched normal DNA where 82% of the somatic variants were detected reliably, only 36%-78% were found consistently in technical replicate pairs. Overall 34%-80% of the discordant somatic variants, which could be interpreted as ITGH, were found to constitute technical noise. Excluding mutations affecting low mappability regions or occurring in certain mutational contexts was found to reduce artifacts, yet detection of subclonal mutations by WES in the absence of orthogonal validation remains unreliable.",

We used the Drosophila model to characterize metabolic homeostasis in flies with modified Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathway activity. The IMD pathway is very similar to the mammalian Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha pathway, a key regulator of vertebrate immunity and metabolism. We found that persistent activation of IMD resulted in hyperglycemia, depleted fat reserves, and developmental delays, implicating IMD in metabolic regulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that imd mutants weigh more, are hyperlipidemic, and have impaired glucose tolerance. To test the importance of metabolic regulation for host responses to bacterial infection, we challenged insulin pathway mutants with lethal doses of several Drosophila pathogens. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the insulin pathway impacted host responses to infection in a manner that depends on the route of infection, and the identity of the infectious microbe. Combined, our results support a role for coordinated regulation of immune and metabolic pathways in host containment of microbial invaders.",

CLC-induced IL-1{beta} was dependent on NLRP3 and caspase-1, and their instillation in inflammasome reporter mice promoted the assembly of ASC complexes and IL-1{beta} secretion in the lungs.
