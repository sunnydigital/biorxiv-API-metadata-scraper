    "abstract": "Members of the KLF family of transcription factors can exert both positive and negative effects on axon regeneration in the central nervous system, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. KLF6 and -7 share nearly identical DNA binding domains and stand out as the only known growth-promoting family members. Here we confirm that similar to KLF7, expression of KLF6 declines during postnatal cortical development and that forced re-expression of KLF6 in corticospinal tract neurons of adult female mice enhances axon regeneration after cervical spinal injury. Unlike KLF7, however, these effects were achieved with wildtype KLF6, as opposed constitutively active mutants, thus simplifying the interpretation of mechanistic studies. To clarify the molecular basis of growth promotion, RNA sequencing identified 454 genes whose expression changed upon forced KLF6 expression in cortical neurons. Network analysis of these genes revealed sub-networks of downregulated genes that were highly enriched for synaptic functions, and sub-networks of upregulated genes with functions relevant to axon extension including cytoskeleton remodeling, lipid synthesis and transport, and bioenergetics. The promoter regions of KLF6-sensitive genes showed enrichment for the binding sequence of STAT3, a previously identified regeneration-associated gene. Notably, co-expression of constitutively active STAT3 along with KLF6 in cortical neurons produced synergistic increases in neurite length. Finally, genome-wide ATAC-seq footprinting detected frequent co-binding by the two factors in pro-growth gene networks, indicating co-occupancy as an underlying mechanism for the observed synergy. These findings advance understanding of KLF-stimulated axon growth and indicate functional synergy of KLF6 transcriptional effects with those of STAT3.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe failure of axon regeneration in the CNS limits recovery from damage and disease. These findings show the transcription factor KLF6 to be a potent promoter of axon growth after spinal injury, and more importantly clarify the underlying transcriptional changes. In addition, bioinformatics analysis predicted a functional interaction between KLF6 and a second transcription factor, STAT3, and genome-wide footprinting confirmed frequent co-occupancy. Co-expression of the two factors yielded synergistic elevation of neurite growth in primary neurons. These data point the way toward novel transcriptional interventions to promote CNS regeneration.",

Examples range from 17th century microscopes to modern particle colliders and high-throughput sequencers. Here, we studied the information sources used by academic researchers to assess scientific instruments, and reveal evidence of a worrying confluence of incentives similar to those that drove the biopharmaceutical industry to adopt controversial practices such as ghostwriting and hidden sponsorship. Our findings suggest there are little understood incentives against disclosure in the peer-reviewed literature on scientific instruments; constituting an underappreciated threat to scientific standards of trustworthiness and transparency. We believe that a public debate and subsequent editorial policy action are urgently required.",

    "abstract": "Glycolysis is a major cytosolic catabolic pathway that provides ATP for many organisms1. Mitochondria play an even more important role in the provision of additional cellular ATP for eukaryotes2. Here, we show that in many stramenopiles, the C3 part of glycolysis is localised in mitochondria. We discovered genuine mitochondrial targeting signals on the six last enzymes of glycolysis. These targeting signals are recognised and sufficient to import GFP into mitochondria of a heterologous host. Analysis of eukaryotic genomes identified these targeting signals on many glycolytic C3 enzymes in a large group of eukaryotes found in the SAR supergroup3, in particular the stramenopiles. Stramenopiles, or heterokonts, are a large group of ecologically important eukaryotes that includes multi- and unicellular algae such as kelp and diatoms, but also economically important oomycete pathogens such as Phytophthora infestans. Confocal immunomicroscopy confirmed the mitochondrial location of glycolytic enzymes for the human parasite Blastocystis. Enzyme assays on cellular fractions confirmed the presence of the C3 part of glycolysis in Blastocystis mitochondria. These activities are sensitive to treatment with proteases and Triton X-100 but not proteases alone. Our work clearly shows that core cellular metabolism is more plastic than previously imagined and suggests new strategies to combat stramenopile pathogens such as the causative agent of late potato blight, P. infestans.",

    "abstract": "Developing rice varieties adapted to alternate wetting and drying water management is crucial for the sustainability of irrigated rice cropping systems. Here we report the first study exploring the feasibility of breeding rice for adaptation to alternate wetting and drying using genomic prediction methods that account for genotype by environment interactions. Two breeding populations (a reference panel of 284 accessions and a progeny population of 97 advanced lines) were evaluated under alternate wetting and drying and continuous flooding management systems. The accuracy of genomic prediction for response variables (index of relative performance and the slope of the joint regression) and for multi-environment genomic prediction models were compared. For the three traits considered (days to flowering, panicle weight and nitrogen-balance index), significant genotype by environment interactions were observed in both populations. In cross validation, prediction accuracy for the index was on average lower (0.31) than that of the slope of the joint regression (0.64) whatever the trait considered. Similar results were found for across population validation (progeny validation). Both cross-validation and progeny validation experiments showed that the performance of multi-environment models predicting unobserved phenotypes of untested entrees was similar to the performance of single environment models with differences in accuracy ranging from - 6% to 4% depending on the trait and on the statistical model concerned. The accuracy of multi-environment models predicting unobserved phenotypes of entrees evaluated under both water management systems outperformed single environment models by an average of 30%. Practical implications for breeding rice for adaptation to AWD are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Concepts in molecular tension sensing in biology are growing and have their origins in studies of muscle contraction. In the heart muscle, a key parameter of contractility is the detachment rate from actin of myosin, which determines the time that myosin is bound to actin in a force-producing state and, importantly, depends on the load (force) against which myosin works. Here, we measure the detachment rate of single molecules of human {beta}-cardiac myosin and its load dependence. We find that both can be modulated by both small molecule compounds and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. Furthermore, effects of mutations can be reversed by introducing appropriate compounds. Our results suggest that activating vs. inhibitory perturbations of cardiac myosin are discriminated by the aggregate result on duty ratio, average force, and ultimately average power output and that cardiac contractility can be controlled by tuning the load-dependent kinetics of single myosin molecules.",

    "abstract": "To guide behavior, sensory systems detect the onset and offset of stimuli and process these distinct inputs via parallel pathways. In the retina, this strategy is implemented by splitting neural signals for light onset and offset via synapses connecting photoreceptors to ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. It remains poorly understood which molecular cues establish the architecture of this synaptic configuration to split light onset and offset signals. A mutant with reduced synapses between photoreceptors and one bipolar cell type, but not the other, could reveal a critical cue. From this approach, we report a novel synaptic role pregnancy associated plasma protein aa (pappaa) in promoting the structure and function of cone synapses that transmit light offset information. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses indicated pappaa mutant zebrafish have dysfunctional cone to OFF bipolar cell synapses and impaired responses to light offset, but intact cone to ON bipolar cell synapses and light onset responses. Ultrastructural analyses of pappaa mutant cones showed a lack of presynaptic domains at synapses with OFF bipolar cells. pappaa is expressed postsynaptically to the cones during retinal synaptogenesis and encodes a secreted metalloprotease known to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Induction of dominant negative IGF1 receptor expression during synaptogenesis reduced light offset responses. Conversely, stimulating IGF1 signaling at this time improved pappaa mutants light offset responses and cone presynaptic structures. Together, our results indicate Pappaa-regulated IGF1 signaling as a novel pathway that establishes how cone synapses convey light offset signals to guide behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDistinct sensory inputs, like stimulus onset and offset, are often split at distinct synapses into parallel circuits for processing. In the retina, photoreceptors and ON and OFF bipolar cells form discrete synapses to split neural signals coding light onset and offset, respectively. The molecular cues that establish this synaptic configuration to specifically convey light onset or offset remain unclear. Our work reveals a novel cue: pregnancy associated plasma protein aa (pappaa), which regulates photoreceptor synaptic structure and function to specifically transmit light offset information. Pappaa is a metalloprotease that stimulates local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. IGF1 promotes various aspects of synaptic development and function and is broadly expressed; thus requiring local regulators, like Pappaa, to govern its specificity.",

    "abstract": "Classical accounts of biased competition (BC) require an input bias to resolve the competition between neuronal ensembles driving downstream processing. However, flexible and reliable selection of behaviorally-relevant ensembles can occur with unbiased stimulation: striatal D1 and D2 spiny projecting neurons (SPNs) receive balanced cortical input, yet their activity determines the choice between GO and NO-GO pathways in the basal ganglia. We present a corticostriatal model identifying three mechanisms that rely on physiological asymmetries to effect rate- and time-coded BC in the presence of balanced inputs. First, tonic input strength determines which SPN phenotype exhibit higher mean firing rate (FR). Second, low strength oscillatory inputs induce higher FR in D2 SPNs but higher coherence between D1 SPNs. Third, high strength inputs oscillating at distinct frequencies preferentially activate D1 or D2 SPN populations. Of these mechanisms, the latter accommodates observed rhythmic activity supporting rule-based decision making in prefrontal cortex.",

Whereas scientific misconduct, like data fabrication, is clearly irresponsible and unethical, other behaviors--often referred to as questionable research practices (QRPs)--exploit the ethical shades of gray that color acceptable practice. This study aimed to measure the frequency of self-reported QRPs in a diverse, international sample of health professions education (HPE) researchers.\\n\\nMethodIn 2017, the authors conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional survey study. The web-based survey contained 43 QRP items that asked respondents to rate how often they had engaged in various forms of scientific misconduct. The items were adapted from two previously published surveys.\\n\\nResultsIn total, 590 HPE researchers took the survey. The mean age was 46 years (SD=11.6), and the majority of participants were from the United States (26.4%), Europe (23.2%), and Canada (15.3%). The three most frequently reported QRPs were adding authors to a paper who did not qualify for authorship (60.6%), citing articles that were not read (49.5%), and selectively citing papers to please editors or reviewers (49.4%). Additionally, respondents reported misrepresenting a participants words (6.7%), plagiarizing (5.5%), inappropriately modifying results (5.3%), deleting data without disclosure (3.4%), and fabricating data (2.4%). Overall, 533 (90.3%) respondents reported at least one QRP.\\n\\nConclusionsNotwithstanding the methodological limitations of survey research, these findings indicate that a substantial proportion of HPE researchers report a range of QRPs. In light of these results, reforms are needed to improve the credibility and integrity of the HPE research enterprise.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"Researchers should practice research responsibly.

We tested whether ancient Earth conditions (low O2, high Fe2+, high Mn2+) can revert the ribosome to a functional ancestral state. First, SHAPE (Selective 2 Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) was used to compare the effect of Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ on the tertiary structure of rRNA. Then, we used in vitro translation reactions to test whether Fe2+ or Mn2+ could mediate protein production, and quantified ribosomal metal content. We found that: (i) Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ had strikingly similar effects on rRNA folding; (ii) Fe2+ and Mn2+ can replace Mg2+ as the dominant divalent cation during translation of mRNA to functional protein; (iii) Fe and Mn associate extensively with the ribosome. Given that the translation system originated and matured when Fe2+ and Mn2+ were abundant, these findings suggest that Fe2+ and Mn2+ played a role in early ribosomal evolution.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCERibosomes are found in every living organism where they are responsible for the translation of messenger RNA into protein.
