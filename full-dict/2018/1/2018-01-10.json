    "abstract": "The increase in infections as a result of multi-drug resistant strains of Escherichia coli is a global health crisis. The emergence of globally disseminated lineages of E. coli carrying ESBL genes has been well characterised. An increase in strains producing carbapenemase enzymes and mobile colistin resistance is now being reported, but to date there is little genomic characterisation of such strains. Routine screening of patients within an ICU of West China Hospital identified a number of E. coli carrying the blaNDM-5 carbapenemase gene, found to be two distinct clones, E. coli ST167 and ST617. Interrogation of publically available data shows isolation of ESBL and carbapenem resistant strains of both lineages from clinical cases across the world. Further analysis of a large collection of publically available genomes shows that ST167 and ST617 have emerged in distinct patterns from the ST10 clonal complex of E. coli, but share evolutionary events involving switches in LPS genetics, intergenic regions and anaerobic metabolism loci. These may be evolutionary events which underpin the emergence of carbapenem resistance plasmid carriage in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Developmental processes depend on the combined efforts of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes that lead to the production of specific proteins that are important determinants of cellular identity and developmental processes. Ribosomes are a central component of the protein biosynthesis machinery in cells; however, their regulatory roles in the translational control of gene expression in an organ specific context during development remain to be defined. In a genetic screen to identify critical regulators of myogenesis, we identified a DEAD-Box RNA helicase, DDX27, that is required for the proliferation and myogenic commitment of skeletal muscle stem cells. DDX27 deficient skeletal muscle exhibits hypotrophy and impaired regeneration potential. We demonstrate that DDX27 regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation, and thereby the ribosome biogenesis and the translation of specific transcripts that are required to maintain pluripotency and myogenic differentiation of satellite cells. These findings provide insight into the translational regulation of gene expression in myogenesis and suggest novel functions for ribosomes in regulating gene expression during skeletal muscle development.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYInherited skeletal muscle diseases are the most common form of genetic disorders with primary abnormalities in the structure and function of skeletal muscle resulting in the impaired locomotion in affected patients. A major hindrance to the development of effective therapies is a lack of understanding of biological processes that promote skeletal muscle growth. By performing a forward genetic screen in zebrafish we have identified mutation in a RNA helicase that leads to perturbations of ribosomal biogenesis pathway and impairs skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Therefore, our studies have identified novel ribosome-based disease processes that may be therapeutic modulated to restore muscle function in skeletal muscle diseases.",

This trend has introduced at least two novel problems: an elevated risk of somatic disorders, such as cancer, and declining evolvability due to reduced population size, lower reproduction rate and extended generation time. Low population size is widely recognized to explain the high mutation rates in animals by limiting the presumed universally negative selection acting on mutation rates. Here, we present evidence from stochastic modeling that the direction and strength of selection acting on mutation rates is highly dependent on the evolution of somatic maintenance, and thus longevity, which modulates the cost of somatic mutations. We argue that this mechanism may have been critical in facilitating animal evolution.",

We aim to elucidate the impact of blood flow on the arrest and the extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in vivo. Using the zebrafish embryo, we show that arrest of CTCs occurs in vessels with favorable flow profiles where flow forces control the adhesion efficacy of CTCs to the endothelium. We biophysically identified the threshold values of flow and adhesion forces allowing successful arrest of CTCs. In addition, flow forces fine-tune tumor cell extravasation by impairing the remodeling properties of the endothelium. Importantly, we also observe endothelial remodeling at arrest sites of CTCs in mouse brain capillaries. Finally, we observed that human supratentorial brain metastases preferably develop in areas with low perfusion. Altogether, these results demonstrate that hemodynamic profiles at metastatic sites regulate key steps of extravasation preceding metastatic outgrowth.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion in cellular membranes is regulated by processes which occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales. These processes include membrane fluidity, inter-protein and inter-lipid interactions, interactions with membrane microdomains, interactions with the underlying cytoskeleton, and cellular processes which result in net membrane movement. The complex, non-Brownian diffusion that results from these processes has been difficult to characterize, and moreover, the impact of factors such as membrane recycling on membrane diffusion remains largely unexplored. We have used a careful statistical analysis of single-particle tracking data of the single-pass plasma membrane protein CD93 to show that the diffusion of this protein is well-described by a continuous-time random walk in parallel with an aging process mediated by membrane corrals. The overall result is an evolution in the diffusion of CD93: proteins initially diffuse freely on the cell surface, but over time, become increasingly trapped within diffusion-limiting membrane corrals. Stable populations of freely diffusing and corralled CD93 are maintained by an endocytic/exocytic process in which corralled CD93 is selectively endocytosed, while freely diffusing CD93 is replenished by exocytosis of newly synthesized and recycled CD93. This trafficking not only maintained CD93 diffusivity, but also maintained the heterogeneous distribution of CD93 in the plasma membrane. These results provide insight into the nature of the biological and biophysical processes that can lead to significantly non-Brownian diffusion of membrane proteins, and demonstrate that ongoing membrane recycling is critical to maintaining steady-state diffusion and distribution of proteins in the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is a widespread, intracellular symbiont of arthropods, able to induce reproductive distortions and antiviral protection in insects. Wolbachia can also be pathogenic, as is the case with wMelPop, a virulent variant of the endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. An extensive genomic amplification of the 20kb region encompassing eight Wolbachia genes, called Octomom, is responsible for wMelPop virulence. The Octomom copy number in wMelPop can be highly variable between individual D. melanogaster flies, even when comparing siblings arising from a single female. Moreover, Octomom copy number can change rapidly between generations. These data suggest an intra-host variability in Octomom copy number between Wolbachia cells. Since wMelPop Wolbachia with different Octomom copy numbers grow at different rates, we hypothesized that selection could act on this intra-host variability. Here we tested if total Octomom copy number changes during the lifespan of individual Drosophila hosts, revealing selection for different Wolbachia populations. We performed a time course analysis of Octomom amplification in flies whose mothers were controlled for Octomom copy number. We show that despite the Octomom copy number being relatively stable it increases slightly throughout D. melanogaster adult life. This indicates that there is selection acting on the intra-host variation in the Octomom copy number over the lifespan of individual hosts. This within host selection for faster replicating bacterial symbionts may be in conflict with between host selection against highly pathogenic Wolbachia.",

    "abstract": "Despite the abundance of large-scale molecular and drug-response data, the insights gained about the mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy in cancer has been in general limited. Machine learning algorithms applied to those datasets most often are used to provide predictions without interpretation, or reveal single drug-gene association and fail to derive robust insights. We propose to use Macau, a bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the interactions between the drug targets and signaling pathways activation. A typical insight would be: \\\"Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X\\\". We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using gene expression of 990 cancer cell lines, activity scores of 11 signaling pathways derived from the tool PROGENy as cell line input and 228 nominal targets for 265 drugs as drug input. These interactions can guide a tissue-specific combination treatment strategy, for example suggesting to modulate a certain pathway to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues. Such an analysis of interactions across tissues might help target discovery, drug repurposing and patient stratification strategies.",

Significantly increased mALFF clusters were found in bilateral PAC and HAC of THL-NC1 maps and in the left inferior colliculus and right HAC of TNH-NC2 maps. Thus, subgroups of tinnitus with and without hearing impairment might exhibit different homeostatic plasticity in the central auditory system. mALFF values of aberrant active clusters in the central auditory system are partly associated with specific clinical tinnitus characteristics.",

We find that the liquid phase of P granules is stabilized by a molecularly-distinct, enveloping shell that is intrinsically non-dynamic. Consistent with a gel phase, the shell is resistant to dilution, high salt, and aliphatic alcohols, and dissolves in SDS. Solidification of RNA granules has been linked to neuronal degeneration 3.

It is well known that ethylene-inhibited root elongation involves basipetal auxin delivery requiring PIN2. However, the molecular mechanism how ethylene regulates PIN2 is not well understood. Here, we report that the ethylene-responsive HD-Zip gene HB52 is involved in ethylene-mediated inhibition of primary root elongation. Using biochemical and genetic analyses, we demonstrated that HB52 is ethylene-responsive and acts immediately downstream of EIN3. HB52 knock-down mutants are insensitive to ethylene in primary root elongation while the overexpression lines have dramatically shortened roots like ethylene treated plants. Moreover, HB52 upregulates PIN2, WAG1, and WAG2 by directly binding to their promoter, leading to an enhanced basipetal auxin delivery to the elongation zone and thus inhibiting root growth. Our work uncovers HB52 as an important crosstalk node between ethylene signaling and auxin transport in root elongation.",

    "abstract": "The identification of the molecular mechanisms regulating pathways associated to the potential of fat deposition in pigs can lead to the detection of key genes and markers for the genetic improvement of fat traits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interactions with target RNAs regulate gene expression and modulate pathway activation in cells and tissues. In pigs, miRNA discovery is well far from saturation and the knowledge of miRNA expression in backfat tissue and particularly of the impact of miRNA variations are still fragmentary. We characterized by RNAseq the small RNAs (sRNAs) expression profiles in Italian Large White pig backfat tissue. Comparing two groups of pigs divergent for backfat deposition, we detected 31 significant differentially expressed (DE) sRNAs, 14 up-regulated (including ssc-miR-132, ssc-miR-146b, sscmiR-221-5p, ssc-miR-365-5p, and the moRNA ssc-moR-21-5p) and 17 down-regulated (including ssc-miR-136, ssc-miR-195, ssc-miR-199a-5p, and ssc-miR-335). To understand the biological impact of the observed miRNA expression variations, we used the expression correlation of DE miRNA target transcripts expressed in the same samples to define a regulatory network of 193 interactions between DE miRNAs and 40 DE target transcripts showing opposite expression profiles and being involved in specific pathways. Several miRNAs and mRNAs in the network resulted to be expressed from backfat related pig QTLs. These results are informative on the complex mechanisms influencing fat traits, shed light on a new aspect of the genetic regulation of fat deposition in pigs, and facilitate the perspective implementation of innovative strategies of pig genetic improvement based on genomic markers.",

Therefore, investigating the associations between ARGs and bacterial communities become an important issue for environment protection. Ocean microbiomes are potentially large ARG reservoirs, but the marine ARG distribution and its associations with bacterial communities remain unclear.\\n\\nMethodswe have utilized the big-data mining techniques on ocean microbiome data to analysis the marine ARGs and bacterial distribution on a global scale, and applied comprehensive statistical analysis to unveil the associations between ARG contents, ocean microbial community structures, and environmental factors by reanalyzing 132 metagenomic samples from the Tara Oceans project.\\n\\nResultsWe identified in total 1,926 unique ARGs and found that: firstly, ARGs are more abundant and diverse in the mesopelagic zone than other water layers. Additionally, ARG-enriched genera are closely connected in co-occurrence network. We also found that ARG-enriched genera are often more abundant than their ARG-less neighbors. Furthermore, we found that samples from the Mediterranean that is surrounded by human activities often contain more ARGs.\\n\\nConclusionOur research for investigating the marine ARG distribution and revealing the association between ARG and bacterial communities provide a deeper insight into the marine bacterial communities.

    "abstract": "Invertebrate nervous systems are valuable models for fundamental principles of the control of behavior. Ventral nerve cord (VNC) motor neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans represent one of the best studied locomotor circuits, with known connectivity and functional information about most of the involved neuron classes. However, for one of those, the AS motor neurons (AS MNs), no physiological data is available. Combining specific expression and selective illumination, we precisely targeted AS MNs by optogenetics and addressed their role in the locomotion circuit. After photostimulation, AS MNs induce currents in post-synaptic body wall muscles (BWMs), exhibiting an initial asymmetry of excitatory output. This may facilitate complex regulatory motifs for adjusting direction during navigation. By behavioral and photo-inhibition experiments, we show that AS MNs contribute to propagation of the antero-posterior body wave during locomotion. By Ca2+-imaging in AS MNs and in their synaptic partners, we also reveal that AS MNs play a role in mediating forward and backward locomotion by integrating activity of premotor interneurons (PINs), as well as in coordination of the dorso-ventral body wave. AS MNs do not exhibit pacemaker properties, but potentially gate VNC central pattern generators (CPGs), as indicated by ceasing of locomotion when AS MNs are hyperpolarized. AS MNs provide positive feedback to the PIN AVA via gap junctions, a feature found also in other locomotion circuits. In sum, AS MNs have essential roles in coordinating locomotion, combining several functions, and emphasizing the compressed nature of the C. elegans nervous system in comparison to higher animals.\\n\\nHighlightsA class of motor neurons with unidentified function - AS cholinergic motor neurons - was characterized in C. elegans.\\n\\nAS neurons show asymmetry in both input and output and are specialized in coordination of dorso-ventral undulation bends.\\n\\nAS neurons mediate antero-posterior propagation of the undulatory body wave during locomotion.\\n\\nAS neurons integrate signals for forward and reverse locomotion from premotor interneurons and may gate ventral nerve cord central pattern generators (CPGs) via gap junctions.",

Using a new technique, cTag-PAPERCLIP, we discovered significant differences in APA between the principal types of mouse cerebellar neurons, the Purkinje and granule cells, as well as between proliferating and differentiated granule cells. Transcripts that differed in APA in these comparisons were enriched in key neuronal functions and many differed in coding sequence in addition to 3UTR length. We characterize Memo1, a transcript that shifted from expressing a short 3UTR isoform to a longer one during granule cell differentiation. We show that Memo1 regulates granule cell precursor proliferation and that its long 3UTR isoform is targeted by miR-124, contributing to its downregulation during development. Our findings provide insight into roles for APA in specific cell types and establish a platform for further functional studies.",

    "abstract": "A major hurdle in protein-based therapeutics is the interaction with the adaptive immune system, which can lead to neutralization by circulating antibodies and clearance of treated cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. One method of circumventing these issues is to use human or humanized proteins which avoid the immune response by self-recognition. However, this approach limits potential protein therapeutics to those of human origin, excluding many exciting effectors and delivery vehicles such as CRISPR-Cas9 and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To address this issue, we propose here the sequential use of orthologous proteins whose function is constrained by natural selection, but whose structure is subject to diversification by genetic drift. This would, in principle, allow for repeated treatments by  immune orthogonal orthologs without reduced efficacy due to lack of immune cross-reactivity among the proteins. To explore and validate this concept we chose 91 Type II CRISPR-Cas9 orthologs and 167 AAV capsid protein orthologs, and developed a pipeline to compare total sequence similarity as well as predicted binding to class I and class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. Interestingly, MHC binding predictions revealed wide diversity among the set of Cas9 orthologs, with 83% of pairs predicted to have non cross-reacting immune responses, while no global immune orthogonality among AAV serotypes was observed. To confirm these findings we selected two Cas9 orthologs, from S. pyogenes and S. aureus, predicted to be orthogonal in immune space, and delivered them into mice via multiple AAV serotypes. We observed cross-reacting antibodies against AAV but not Cas9 orthologs in sera from immunized mice, validating the computationally predicted immune orthogonality among these proteins. Moving forward, we anticipate this framework can be applied to prescribe sequential regimens of immune orthogonal protein therapeutics to circumvent pre-existing or induced immunity, and eventually, to rationally engineer immune orthogonality among protein orthologs.",

    "abstract": "Redox biochemistry plays a key role in the transduction of chemical energy in living systems. However, the compounds observed in metabolic redox reactions are a minuscule fraction of chemical space. It is not clear whether compounds that ended up being selected as metabolites display specific properties that distinguish them from non-biological compounds. Here we introduce a systematic approach for comparing the chemical space of all possible redox states of linear-chain carbon molecules to the corresponding metabolites that appear in biology. Using cheminformatics and quantum chemistry, we analyze the physicochemical and thermodynamic properties of the biological and non-biological compounds. We find that, among all compounds, aldose sugars have the highest possible number of redox connections to other molecules. Metabolites are enriched in carboxylic acid functional groups and depleted of carbonyls, and have higher solubility than non-biological compounds. Upon constructing the energy landscape for the full chemical space as a function of pH and electron donor potential, we find that over a large range of conditions metabolites tend to have lower Gibbs energies than non-biological molecules. Finally, we generate Pourbaix phase diagrams that serve as a thermodynamic atlas to indicate which compounds are local and global energy minima in redox chemical space across a set of pH values and electron donor potentials. Our work yields insight into the physicochemical principles governing redox metabolism, and suggests that thermodynamic stability in aqueous environments may have played an important role in early metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding view of the organization of human and animal behavior holds that behavior is hierarchically organized, meaning that it can be understood as directed towards achieving superordinate goals through subordinate goals, or subgoals. For example, the superordinate goal of making coffee can be broken down as accomplishing a series of subgoals, namely boiling water, grinding coffee, pouring cream, etc. Learning and behavioral adaptation depend on prediction-error signals, which have been observed in ventral striatum (VS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In past work, we have shown that prediction error signals (PEs) can be linked not only to superordinate goals, but also to subgoals. Here we present two functional magnetic resonance imagining experiments that replicate and extend these findings. In the first experiment, we replicated the finding that mPFC signals subgoal-related PEs, independently of goal PEs. Together with our past work, this experiment reveals that BOLD responses to PEs in mPFC are unsigned. In the second experiment, we showed that when a task involves both goal and subgoal PEs, mPFC shows only goal-related PEs, suggesting that context or attention can strongly impact hierarchical PE coding. Furthermore, we observed a dissociation between the coding of PEs in mPFC and VS. These experiments suggest that the mPFC selectively attends to information at different levels of hierarchy depending on the task context.",

Recent data indicates that cortical regions prominently associated with accumulating evidence, such as posterior parietal cortex and the frontal orienting fields, are not necessary for computing it. Which, then, are the regions responsible? Regions directly involved in evidence accumulation should satisfy the criteria of being necessary for accumulation-based decision-making behavior, having a graded neural encoding of accumulated evidence and causal contributing throughout the accumulation process. Here, we investigated the role of the anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) in a rodent auditory evidence accumulation task using a combination of behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic, electrophysiological and computational approaches. We find that the ADS is the first brain region known to satisfy these criteria. Thus, the ADS may be the first identified node in the network responsible for evidence accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity in frontoparietal cortex shows overlap across cognitive domains and has been proposed to reflect flexible information processing according to current task demands (Dosenbach et al., 2007; Duncan, 2001). However, a strong assertion of flexibility requires investigating activity across stages of cognitive processing. The current study assessed neural activity in Multiple Demand (MD) regions across the stages of processing that form the core of long-standing cognitive models (Welford, 1952). Specifically, many complex tasks share a comparable structure of subsequent operations: target selection, stimulus-response (SR) mapping, and response execution. We independently manipulated the difficulty of target selection and SR mapping in identical stimulus displays and assessed changes in frontoparietal activity with increased demands in either stage. The results confirmed flexibility in MD regions, with enhanced information representation during difficult target selection as well as SR mapping. Additionally, anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed preferential representation of SR stage information, whereas the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) showed preferential representation of target selection-stage information. Together these results suggest that MD regions dynamically alter the information they represent with changing task demands. This is the first study to demonstrate that MD regions support flexible goal-directed cognition across multiple processing stages. At the same time we show a preference for the representation of information from a specific processing stage in a subset of MD regions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGoal-directed cognition in complex tasks is critical to key life outcomes including longevity and academic performance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying cognition in complex tasks are not well understood. Distinct neural networks are critical to the navigation of specific cognitive domains (e.g. attention), but frontoparietal activity shows cross-domain and -task overlap and supports flexible representation of goal-critical information. This study links flexible frontoparietal processing to longstanding models of meta-cognition that propose a unifying structure of operations underlying most tasks: target selection, SR mapping, and response execution. Our results demonstrate that flexible information representation in frontoparietal cortex is not limited to the SR mapping stage, but applies across the functional stages of cognitive processing, thus maximizing neural efficiency and supporting flexible cognition.",

Here we find that conditional deletion of ErbB4 in locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons increases neuronal spontaneous firing through NMDA receptor hyperfunction, and elevates catecholamines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, ErbB4-deficient mice present mania-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased sucrose preference. These behaviors are completely rescued by the anti-manic drug lithium or antagonists of catecholaminergic receptors.

    "abstract": "There has been growing evidence that cooperative interactions and configurational rearrangements underpin protein functions. But in spite of vast genetic and structural data, the information-dense, heterogeneous nature of protein has held back the progress in understanding the underlying principles. Here we outline a general theory of protein that quantitatively links sequence, dynamics and function: The protein is a strongly-coupled amino acid network whose interactions and large-scale motions are captured by the mechanical propagator, also known as the Green function. The propagator relates the gene to the connectivity of the amino acid network and the transmission of forces through the protein. How well the force pattern conforms to the collective modes of the functional protein is measured by the fitness. Mutations introduce localized perturbations to the propagator which scatter the force field. The emergence of function is manifested by a topological transition when a band of such perturbations divides the protein into subdomains. Epistasis quantifies how much the combined effect of multiple mutations departs from additivity. We find that epistasis is the nonlinearity of the Green function, which corresponds to a sum over multiple scattering paths passing through the localized perturbations. We apply this mechanical framework to the simulations of protein evolution, and observe long-range epistasis which facilitates collective functional modes. Our model lays the foundation for understanding the protein as an evolved state of matter and may be a prototype for other strongly-correlated living systems.",

    "abstract": "Calcium triggered exocytosis is key to many physiological processes, including neurotransmitter and hormone release by neurons and endocrine cells. Dozens of proteins regulate exocytosis, yet the temporal and spatial dynamics of these factors during vesicle fusion remain unclear. Here we use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize local protein dynamics at single sites of exocytosis of small synaptic-like microvesicles in live cultured neuroendocrine PC12 cells. We employ two-color imaging to simultaneously observe membrane fusion (using vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) tagged to pHluorin) and the dynamics of associated proteins at the moments surrounding exocytosis. Our experiments show that many proteins, including the SNAREs syntaxin1 and VAMP2, the SNARE modulator tomosyn, and Rab proteins, are pre-clustered at fusion sites and rapidly lost at fusion. The ATPase NSF is locally recruited at fusion. Interestingly, the endocytic BAR domain-containing proteins amphiphysin1, syndapin2, and endophilins are dynamically recruited to fusion sites, and slow the loss of vesicle membrane-bound cargo from fusion sites. A similar effect on vesicle membrane protein dynamics was seen with the over-expression of the GTPases dynamin1 and dynamin2. These results suggest that proteins involved in classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis can regulate exocytosis of synaptic-like microvesicles. Our findings provide insights into the dynamics, assembly, and mechanistic roles of many key factors of exocytosis and endocytosis at single sites of microvesicle fusion in live cells.",

    "abstract": "At the initial stage of carcinogenesis single mutated cells appear within an epithelium. Mammalian in vitro experiments show that potentially cancerous cells undergo live apical extrusion from normal monolayers. However, the mechanism underlying this process in vivo remains poorly understood. Mosaic expression of the oncogene vSrc in a simple epithelium of the early zebrafish embryo results in apical extrusion of transformed cells. Here we find that during extrusion components of the cytokinetic ring are recruited to adherens junctions of transformed cells, stimulating formation of a misoriented pseudo cytokinetic ring. During extrusion, the ring constricts and separates the basal from the apical part of the cell releasing both from the epithelium. This process requires cell cycle progression and occurs immediately after vSrc-transformed cell enters mitosis. To achieve extrusion, vSrc coordinates cell cycle progression, junctional integrity, cell survival and apicobasal polarity. Without vSrc, modulating these cellular processes reconstitutes vSrc-like extrusion, confirming their sufficiency for this process.",

It has been shown that for 2 x 2 games the ranking of the strategies does not change as strength of selection is increased [11]. The point of the 2013 paper is that when there are three or more strategies the ordering can change as selection is increased. Wu et al [10] did numerical computations for fixed N. Here, we will instead let the strength of selection {beta} = c/N and let N [-&gt;] {infty} to obtain formulas for the invadability probabilities{phi} ij that determine the rankings. These formulas, which are integrals on [0, 1], are intractable calculus problems but can be easily evaluated numerically. Here, we concentrate on simple formulas for the ranking order when c is small or c is large. The results we have obtained for five concrete examples lead us to doubt the accuracy of insights that are derived in the small mutation limit for games with three strategies.",

    "abstract": "For many complex traits, gene regulation is likely to play a crucial mechanistic role. How the genetic architectures of complex traits vary between populations and subsequent effects on genetic prediction are not well understood, in part due to the historical paucity of GWAS in populations of non-European ancestry. We used data from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort to characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression within and between diverse populations. Genotype and monocyte gene expression were available in individuals with African American (AFA, n=233), Hispanic (HIS, n=352), and European (CAU, n=578) ancestry. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping in each population and show genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions. Using elastic net modeling with cross validation to optimize genotypic predictors of gene expression in each population, we show the genetic architecture of gene expression for most predictable genes is sparse. We found the best predicted gene, TACSTD2, was the same across populations with R2 > 0.86 in each population. However, we identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another. We show these differences in predictive performance are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Using genotype weights trained in MESA to predict gene expression in independent populations showed that a training set with ancestry similar to the test set is better at predicting gene expression in test populations, demonstrating an urgent need for diverse population sampling in genomics. Our predictive models and performance statistics in diverse cohorts are made publicly available for use in transcriptome mapping methods at .\\n\\nAuthor summaryMost genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in populations of European ancestry leading to a disparity in understanding the genetics of complex traits between populations. For many complex traits, gene regulation is critical, given the consistent enrichment of regulatory variants among trait-associated variants. However, it is still unknown how the effects of these key variants differ across populations. We used data from MESA to study the underlying genetic architecture of gene expression by optimizing gene expression prediction within and across diverse populations. The populations with genotype and gene expression data available are from individuals with African American (AFA, n=233), Hispanic (HIS, n=352), and European (CAU, n=578) ancestry. After calculating the prediction performance, we found that there are many genes that were well predicted in one population are poorly predicted in another. We further show that a training set with ancestry similar to the test set resulted in better gene expression predictions, demonstrating the need to incorporate diverse populations in genomic studies. Our gene expression prediction models and performance statistics are publicly available to facilitate future transcriptome mapping studies in diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are folded in a hierarchy of compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), subTADs and looping interactions. Currently, there is a great need to evaluate the link between chromatin topology and genome function across many biological conditions and genetic perturbations. Hi-C generates high quality, high resolution maps of looping interactions genome-wide, but is intractable for high-throughput screening of loops across conditions due to the requirement of an enormous number of reads (>6 Billion) per library. Here, we describe 5C-ID, an updated version of Chromosome-Conformation-Capture-Carbon-Copy (5C) with restriction digest and ligation performed in the nucleus (in situ Chromosome-Conformation-Capture (3C)) and ligation-mediated amplification performed with a new double alternating design. 5C-ID reduces spatial noise and enables higher resolution 3D genome folding maps than canonical 5C, allowing for a marked improvement in sensitivity and specificity of loop detection. 5C-ID enables the creation of high-resolution, high-coverage maps of chromatin loops in up to a 30 Megabase subset of the genome at a fraction of the cost of Hi-C.",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of genes in vertebrate genomes belongs to multigene families, with each family containing several gene copies whose presence/absence can be highly variable across individuals. For example, each Y chromosome ampliconic gene family harbors several nearly identical (up to 99.99%) gene copies. Existing de novo techniques for assaying the sequences of such highly-similar gene families fall short of reconstructing end to end transcripts with nucleotide-level precision or assigning them to their respective gene copies. We present IsoCon, a novel approach that combines experimental and computational techniques that leverage the power of long PacBio Iso-Seq reads to determine the full-length transcripts of highly similar multicopy gene families. IsoCon uses a cautiously iterative process to correct errors, followed by a statistical framework that allows it to distinguish errors from true variants with high precision. IsoCon outperforms existing methods for transcriptome analysis of Y ampliconic gene families in both simulated and real human data and is able to detect rare transcripts that differ by as little as one base pair from much more abundant transcripts. IsoCon has allowed us to detect an unprecedented number of novel isoforms, as well as to derive estimates on the number of gene copies in human Y ampliconic gene families.",

    "abstract": "The bromodomain protein BRD4 is a driver in both inflammatory diseases and cancers. It has multiple functions, contributing to chromatin structure and transcription through its intrinsic HAT and kinase activities. Despite the wide-ranging characterization of BRD4, little is known about its in vivo function. In the present study, we have examined the role of BRD4 in T cell development by conditional deletion at various stages of thymocyte differentiation. We found that BRD4 is critical for normal T cell development. Surprisingly, BRD4 selectively regulates the progression of immature CD8 single positive (ISP) thymocytes into quiescent DP thymocytes. In striking contrast, BRD4 deletion does not affect the extensive proliferation associated with the differentiation of double negative (DN) into ISP cells. Nor does it affect the maturation of double positive (DP) into conventional CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. These studies lead to the unexpected conclusion that BRD4 selectively regulates preselection ISP thymocytes.\\n\\nOn-line SummaryImmature CD8 single-positive (ISP) thymocytes are identified as a molecularly-distinct thymocyte subpopulation, dependent on BRD4 for progression to the DP stage. DN and DP are BRD4-independent. These findings provide new insights into BRD4, a therapeutic target in inflammation and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Dyslexia is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by reading and spelling difficulties. Beyond the behavioral and functional correlates of this condition, a growing number of studies have explored structural differences between individuals with dyslexia and typically developing individuals. To date, findings remain disparate - some studies suggest differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect measure of white matter integrity, whereas others do not identify significant disparities. Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of dyslexia via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of profound, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Sleep loss is associated with increased obesity risk, as demonstrated by correlations between sleep duration and change in body mass index or body fat percentage. Whereas previous studies linked this weight gain to disturbed endocrine parameters after sleep deprivation (SD) or restriction, neuroimaging studies revealed up-regulated neural processing of food rewards after sleep loss in reward-processing areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum and insula. To tackle this ongoing debate between homeostatic versus hedonic factors underlying sleep loss-associated weight gain, we rigorously tested the association between SD and food cue processing using high-resolution fMRI and assessment of hormones. After taking blood samples from thirty-two lean, healthy men, they underwent fMRI while performing a neuroeconomic, value-based decision making task with snack food and trinket rewards following a full night of habitual sleep (HS) and a night of SD in a repeated-measures cross-over design. We found that des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were increased after SD compared with HS. Despite similar hunger ratings due to fasting in both conditions, participants were willing to spend more money on food items only after SD. Furthermore, fMRI data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a food reward-specific up-regulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and amygdala-hypothalamic coupling after a single night of SD. Behavioral and fMRI results were not significantly correlated with changes in acyl, des-acyl or total ghrelin concentrations. Our results indicate that increased food valuation after sleep loss is due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.",

Two groups of bilinguals (either Spanish or Basque natives) performed a word matching task (WMT) and a picture matching task (PMT).

ERPs were time-locked to the gender-marked determiner preceding the predicted noun. In the WMT both groups showed a negative (~340 ms) effect. Basque natives displayed an earlier effect (~150 ms) for determiners preceding transparent nouns. In the PMT both groups showed an early effect (~160 ms) for determiners preceding opaque nouns. Transparent nouns' determiners elicited prediction at ~330 ms in Spanish natives, but at ~460 ms in Basque natives. It is concluded that bilinguals rely on the features of the L1 for predicting in the L2: native experience moulds prediction. Linguistic prediction is hierarchical, with different operation levels communicating at an interface stage.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra high magnetic fields (7 Tesla and above) enables researchers to study how anatomical and functional properties change within the cortical ribbon, along surfaces and across cortical depths. These studies require an accurate delineation of the gray matter ribbon, which often suffers from inclusion of blood vessels, dura mater and other non-brain tissue. Residual segmentation errors are commonly corrected by browsing the data slice-by-slice and manually changing labels. This task becomes increasingly laborious and prone to error at higher resolutions since both work and error scale with the number of voxels. Here we show that many mislabeled, non-brain voxels can be corrected more efficiently and semi-automatically by representing three-dimensional anatomical images using two-dimensional histograms. We propose both a uni-modal (based on first spatial derivative) and multi-modal (based on compositional data analysis) approach to this representation and quantify the benefits in 7 Tesla MRI data of nine volunteers. We present an openly accessible Python implementation of these approaches and demonstrate that editing cortical segmentations using two-dimensional histogram representations as an additional post-processing step aids existing algorithms and yields improved gray matter borders. By making our data and corresponding expert (ground truth) segmentations openly available, we facilitate future efforts to develop and test segmentation algorithms on this challenging type of data.",

We introduce and also compare two new methods, the Fast Adjacency Skewness (FASK) and Two-Step, which exploit non-Gaussian features of the BOLD signal in different ways. We give theoretical justifications for the latter two algorithms. Our test models include feedback structures with and without direct feedback (2-cycles), excitatory and inhibitory feedback, models using experimentally determined structural connectivities of macaques, and empirical resting state and task data. We find that averaged over all of our simulations, including those with 2-cycles, several of these methods have a better than 80% orientation precision (i.e., the probability a directed edge is in the true generating structure given that a procedure estimates it to be so) and the two new methods also have better than 80% recall (probability of recovering an orientation in the data generating model).

Among 1,190 identified, most prominent was the cumulative loss of target regulation by miR-29 family members. Integration of translational and time-course RNA profiles revealed a dynamic mode of miR-29 target de-regulation, led by acute translational activation and later increase in RNA levels, allowing rapid proteomic changes to take effect. These functional regulatory events rely on canonical and non-canonical miR-29 binding and engage glutamate reuptake signals to control local glutamate levels.

Analytical and simulation results indicate that even assuming unrealistically high efficacies for NAIs, drug intake starting on the onset of symptoms has a negligible effect on an individual's viral load and symptoms score. Increasing NAIs doses does not provide a better outcome as is generally believed.

We combined population-representative paired sera collected before and after the major 2013/14 dengue-3 outbreak in Fiji with surveillance data to determine how such factors influence dengue virus transmission and control in island settings. Our results suggested the 10-19 year-old age group had the highest risk of acquiring infection, but we did not find strong evidence that other demographic or environmental risk factors were linked to seroconversion. Mathematical modelling showed that temperature-driven variation in transmission and herd immunity could not fully explain observed dynamics. However, there was evidence of an additional reduction in transmission coinciding with a vector clean-up campaign, which may have contributed to the decline in cases and prevented transmission continuing into the following season.",

If it were possible to unpick the association between personality and smoking, it may be possible to develop more targeted smoking cessation programmes that could lead to both improved uptake and efficacy.\\n\\nMethodsRecent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants robustly associated with both smoking phenotypes and personality traits. Here we use publicly available GWAS summary statistics in addition to data from UK Biobank to investigate the link between smoking and personality. We first estimated genetic overlap between traits using LD score regression and then applied both one- and two-sample Mendelian randomization methods to unpick the nature of this relationship.\\n\\nResultsWe found clear evidence of a modest genetic correlation between smoking behaviours and both neuroticism and extraversion, suggesting shared genetic aetiology. We found some evidence to suggest an association between neuroticism and increased smoking initiation. We also found some evidence that personality traits appear to be causally linked to certain smoking phenotypes: higher neuroticism and heavier cigarette consumption, and higher extraversion and increased odds of smoking initiation. The latter finding could lead to more targeted smoking prevention programmes.\\n\\nConclusionThe association between neuroticism and cigarette consumption lends support to the self-medication hypothesis, while the association between extraversion and smoking initiation could lead to more targeted smoking prevention programmes.",

Through measurement of wavelength dependant scattering and using the model protein {beta}-lactoglobulin, it is possible to isolate the thermodynamic contributions to thermal unfolding. We show that increasing NaCl concentration decreases the free energy of unfolding which is dominated by the decrease of the enthalpy contribution.

Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients, we investigated an oncogenic role of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) in P53 mutation-associated OS development. Interestingly, we found that high sFRP2 expression in OS patient samples correlates with poor survival. Systems-level analyses identified that expression of sFRP2 increases during LFS OS development and can induce angiogenesis. Ectopic sFRP2 overexpression in normal osteoblast precursors is sufficient to suppress normal osteoblast differentiation and to promote OS phenotypes through induction of oncogenic molecules such as FOXM1 and CYR61 in a {beta}-catenin independent manner. Conversely, inhibition of sFRP2, FOXM1 or CYR61 represses the tumorigenic potential. In summary, these findings demonstrate the oncogenic role of sFRP2 in P53 mutation-associated OS development and that inhibition of sFRP2 is a potential therapeutic strategy.",

In eukaryotes, whose host lineage is descended from archaea, lateral gene transfer from organelles to the nucleus occurs at endosymbiotic events. Recent genome analyses studying gene distributions have uncovered evidence for sporadic, discontinuous events of gene transfer from bacteria to archaea during evolution. Other studies have used traditional birth-and-death phylogenetic models to investigate prokaryote genome evolution to claim that gene transfer to archaea was continuous during evolution, rather than involving occasional periodic mass gene influx events. Here we test the ability of Count, a birth-and-death based program, to recover known events of mass acquisition and differential loss using plastid genomes and eukaryotic protein families that were acquired from plastids. Count showed a strong bias towards reconstructed histories having gene acquisitions distributed uniformly across the tree. Sometimes as many as nine different acquisitions by plastid DNA were inferred for the same protein family. That is, Count recovered gradual and continuous lateral gene transfer among lineages, even when massive gains followed by gradual differential loss is the true evolutionary process that generated the gene distribution data.",

We developed a Bayesian algorithm, namely - GtTR - which combines information from a reference long-read dataset with a short read counting approach to genotype tandem repeats at population scale. PCR sizing analysis was used for validation.\\n\\nResultsWe used a PacBio long-read sequenced sample to generate a reference tandem repeat genotype dataset with on average 13% absolute deviation from PCR sizing results. Using this reference dataset GtTR generated estimates of VNTR copy number with accuracy within 95% high posterior density (HPD) intervals of 68% and 83% for capture sequence data and 200X WGS data respectively, improving to 87% and 94% with use of a PCR reference.

Whilst thymic Treg generation is well studied, it is not known whether and how Foxp3 transcription is induced and regulated in the periphery during immune responses. Here we use Foxp3 Timer of cell kinetics and activity (Tocky) mice, which report real-time Foxp3 gene transcription by measuring the spontaneous maturation of Fluorescent Timer protein from Blue to Red fluorescence, to identify the flux of Foxp3-to Foxp3+ T cells within the periphery and analyse the real-time activity of Foxp3 transcription. Using a murine model of skin allergy, we show that both the flux of new Foxp3 expressors and the rate of Foxp3 transcription are increased at inflamed sites. These persistent dynamics of Foxp3 transcription determine the effector Treg programme, and are dependent on a Foxp3 autoregulatory transcriptional circuit, as evidenced by analysis of T cells lacking functional Foxp3 protein. Such reactive and persistent Foxp3 transcriptional activity controls the expression of coinhibitory molecules including CTLA-4 and effector-Treg signature genes. Using RNA-seq, we identify two groups of surface proteins based on their relationship to the temporal dynamics of Foxp3 transcription, and we show proof-of-principle for the manipulation of Foxp3 dynamics by immunotherapy: new Foxp3 flux is promoted by anti-TNFRII antibody, and high frequency Foxp3 expressors are depleted by anti-OX40 antibody. Collectively, our study dissects time-dependent mechanisms behind Foxp3-driven T cell regulation, and establishes the Foxp3-Tocky system as a tool to investigate the mechanisms behind T cell immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHThe recent Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics highlight the explosive nature of arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes1,2. Vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) are two key entomological parameters used to assess the public health risk posed by arboviruses3. These are typically measured empirically by offering mosquitoes an infectious bloodmeal and temporally sampling mosquitoes to determine infection and transmission status. This approach has been used for the better part of a century; however, it does not accurately capture the biology and behavior of many mosquito vectors which refeed frequently (every 2-3 days)4. Here we demonstrate that administration of a second non-infectious bloodmeal significantly shortens the EIP of ZIKV-infected Ae. aegypti by enhancing virus escape from the mosquito midgut. Similarly, a second bloodmeal increased the competence of this species for dengue virus and CHIKV. This effect was also observed for ZIKV in Aedes albopictus, suggesting that this species might be a more important vector than once thought and that this phenomenon may be common among other virus-vector pairings. Modeling of these findings reveals that a shortened EIP would result in a significant increase in the basic reproductive number, R0. This increase helps explain how Ae.aegypti can sustain an explosive epidemic like ZIKV despite its relatively poor vector competence in single-feed laboratory trials. Together, these data demonstrate a direct and unrecognized link between mosquito feeding behavior, EIP, and vector competence.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is crucial for adaptation and is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders and psychopathology. Human studies of flexibility using reversal learning tasks typically contrast error trials before and after reversal, which provides little information about the mechanisms that support learning and expressing a new response. However, animal studies suggest a specific role in this latter process for the connections between the dorsal striatum and the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamus, a system which may recruit the striatal cholinergic interneurons, but which is not well understood in humans. This study investigated the role of this system in human probabilistic reversal learning, specifically with respect to learning a new response strategy, contrasting its function to that of the better understood orbitoftontal-striatal systems. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data we show that connectivity between the striatum and both the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and CM-Pf pathways increased during reversal, but not initial learning. However, while the strength of lOFC-striatal connectivity was associated with the speed of the reversal, the strength of CM-Pf-striatal connectivity was associated specifically with the quality of the reversal (reduced regressive errors).

    "abstract": "Visual signals originating in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual part of thalamus, on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOn route from the retina to primary visual cortex, visually evoked signals have to pass through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). However, this is not an exclusive feed forward flow of information as feedback exists from neurons in the cortex back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. The functional role of this feedback remains mostly unresolved. Here, we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. Our analysis indicates that a particular mix of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback agrees best with available experimental observations. In this configuration ON-center relay cells receive both excitatory and (indirect) inhibitory feedback from ON-center cortical cells (ON-ON feedback) where the excitatory feedback is fast and spatially narrow while the inhibitory feedback is slow and spatially widespread. In addition to the ON-ON feedback, the connections are accompanied by OFF-ON connections following a so-called phase-reversed (push-pull) arrangement. To facilitate further applications of the model, we have made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy modification and evaluation of the a priori quite general eDOG model to new situations.",

    "abstract": "Comparing the brains of related species faces the challenges of establishing homologies whilst accommodating evolutionary specializations. Here we propose a general framework for understanding similarities and differences between the brains of primates. The approach uses white matter blueprints of the whole cortex based on a set of white matter tracts that can be anatomically matched across species. The blueprints provide a common reference space that allows us to navigate between brains of different species, identify homologue cortical areas, or to transform whole cortical maps from one species to the other. Specializations are cast within this framework as deviations between the species blueprints. We illustrate how this approach can be used to compare human and macaque brains.",

    "abstract": "Invariant object recognition, which refers to the ability of precisely and rapidly recognizing objects in the presence of variations, has been a central question in human vision research. The general consensus is that the ventral and dorsal visual streams are the major processing pathways which undertake category and variation encoding in entangled layers. This overlooks the mounting evidence which support the role of peri-frontal areas in category encoding. These recent studies, however, have left open several aspects of visual processing in peri-frontal areas including whether these areas contributed only in active tasks, whether they interacted with peri-occipital areas or processed information independently and differently. To address these concerns, a passive EEG paradigm was designed in which subjects viewed a set of variation-controlled object images. Using multivariate pattern analysis, noticeable category and variation information were observed in occipital, parietal, temporal and prefrontal areas, supporting their contribution to visual processing. Using task specificity indices, phase and Granger causality analyses, three distinct stages of processing were identified which revealed transfer of information between peri-frontal and peri-occipital areas suggesting their parallel and interactive processing of visual information. A brain-plausible computational model supported the possibility of parallel processing mechanisms in peri-occipital and peri-frontal areas. These findings, while advocating previous results on the role of prefrontal areas in object recognition, extend their contribution from active recognition, in which peri-frontal to peri-occipital feedback mechanisms are activated, to the general case of object and variation processing, which is an integral part of visual processing and play role even during passive viewing.",

    "abstract": "Yeast have long been known to possess a cell wall integrity (CWI) system, and recently an analogous system has been described for the primary walls of plants (PCWI) that leads to changes in plant growth and cell wall composition. A similar system has been proposed to exist for secondary cell walls (SCWI). However, there is little data to support this. Here, we analysed the stem transcriptome of a set of cell wall biosynthetic mutants in order to investigate whether cell wall damage, in this case caused by aberrant xylan synthesis, activates a signalling cascade or changes in cell wall synthesis gene expression. Our data revealed remarkably few changes to the transcriptome. We hypothesise that this is because cells undergoing secondary cell wall thickening have entered a committed programme leading to cell death, and therefore a SCWI system would have limited impact. The absence of transcriptomic responses to secondary cell wall alterations may facilitate engineering of the secondary cell wall of plants.",

    "abstract": "A key decision in scientific work is whether to build on novel or well-established ideas. Because exploiting new ideas is often harder than more conventional science, novel work can be especially dependent on interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators. Location may thus influence the tendency to pursue work that is close to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent ideas. We calculate for each nation its position relative to the edge of the scientific frontier by measuring its propensity to build on relatively new ideas in biomedical research. Text analysis of 20+ million publications shows that the United States and South Korea have the highest tendencies for novel science. China has become a leader in favoring newer ideas when working with basic science ideas and research tools, but is still slow to adopt new clinical ideas. Many locations remain far behind the leaders in terms of their tendency to work with novel ideas, indicating that the world is far from flat in this regard.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial cells, gene expression, metabolism, and growth are highly interdependent and tightly coordinated. As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing > 1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.",
