    "abstract": "Bacterial cooperation can be disrupted by non-producers, which can profit from public goods without paying their production cost. A cheater can increase in frequency, exhausting the public good and causing a population collapse. Here we investigate how interactions among two cheaters for distinct social traits influence the short and long-term dynamics of polymorphic populations. Using as a model Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its extensively studied social traits, production of the siderophore pyoverdine and the quorum sensing regulated elastase, we analyzed the social dynamics of polymorphic populations under conditions where the two traits are required for optimal growth. We show that cheaters for either trait compete with both the wild type and each other, and that mutants for pyoverdine production can prevent a drastic population collapse caused by quorum sensing cheaters. A simple mathematical model suggests that the observed social dynamics are determined by the ratio of the costs of each social trait, such that the mutant which avoids paying the highest cost dominates the population. Finally, we demonstrate how quorum sensing regulation can avoid the full loss of cooperation.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100045). Parallel evolution, defined as identical changes arising in independent populations, is often attributed to similar selective pressures favoring the fixation of identical genetic changes. However, some level of parallel evolution is also expected if mutation rates are heterogeneous across regions of the genome. Theory suggests that mutation and selection can have equal impacts on patterns of parallel evolution, however empirical studies have yet to jointly quantify the importance of these two processes. Here, we introduce several statistical models to examine the contributions of mutation and selection heterogeneity to shaping parallel evolutionary changes at the gene-level. Using this framework we analyze published data from forty experimentally evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We can partition the effects of a number of genomic variables into those affecting patterns of parallel evolution via effects on the rate of arising mutations, and those affecting the retention versus loss of the arising mutations (i.e. selection). Our results suggest that gene-to-gene heterogeneity in both mutation and selection, associated with gene length, recombination rate, and number of protein domains drive parallel evolution at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. While there are still a number of parallel changes that are not well described, we show that allowing for heterogeneous rates of mutation and selection can provide improved predictions of the prevalence and degree of parallel evolution.\\n\\nData archival locationDryad, doi to be included later",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

    "abstract": "We report the first DNA amplification chemistry with switch-like characteristics: the chemistry is biphasic, with an expected initial phase followed by an unprecedented high gain burst of product oligonucleotide in a second phase. The first and second phases are separated by a temporary plateau, with the second phase producing 10 to 100 times more product than the first. The reaction is initiated when an oligonucleotide binds and opens a palindromic looped DNA template with two binding domains. Upon loop opening, the oligonucleotide trigger is rapidly amplified through cyclic extension and nicking of the bound trigger. Loop opening and DNA association drive the amplification reaction, such that reaction acceleration in the second phase is correlated with DNA association thermodynamics. Without a palindromic sequence, the chemistry resembles the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR). EXPAR terminates at the initial plateau, revealing a previously unknown phenomenon that causes early reaction cessation in this popular oligonucleotide amplification reaction. Here we present two distinct types of this biphasic reaction chemistry and propose dominant reaction pathways for each type based on thermodynamic arguments. These reactions create an endogenous switch-like output that reacts to approximately 1pM oligonucleotide trigger. The chemistry is isothermal and can be adapted to respond to a broad range of input target molecules such as proteins, genomic bacterial DNA, viral DNA, and microRNA. This rapid DNA amplification reaction could potentially impact a variety of disciplines such as synthetic biology, biosensors, DNA computing, and clinical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "The corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay is an experimental protocol for studying vessel network formation, or neovascularization, in vivo. The assay is attractive due to the ease with which the developing vessel network can be observed in the same animal over time. Measurements from the assay have been used in combination with mathematical modeling to gain insights into the mechanisms of angiogenesis. While previous modeling studies have adopted planar domains to represent the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea and asymmetric positioning of the angiogenic source can be seen to affect vascular patterning in experimental images. As such, we aim to better understand: i) how the geometry of the assay influences vessel network formation and ii) how to relate observations from planar domains to those in the hemispherical cornea. To do so, we develop a three-dimensional, off-lattice mathematical model of neovascularization in the cornea, using a spatially resolved representation of the assay for the first time. Relative to the detailed model, we predict that the adoption of planar geometries has a noticeable impact on vascular patterning, leading to increased vessel  merging, or anastomosis, in particular when circular geometries are adopted. Significant differences in the dynamics of diffusible aniogenesis simulators are also predicted between different domains. In terms of comparing predictions across domains, the  distance of the vascular front to the limbus metric is found to have low sensitivity to domain choice, while metrics such as densities of tip cells and vessels and  vascularized fraction are sensitive to domain choice. Given the widespread adoption and attractive simplicity of planar tissue domains, both in silico and in vitro, the differences identified in the present study should prove useful in relating the results of previous and future theoretical studies of neovascularization to in vivo observations in the cornea.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeovascularization, or the formation of new blood vessels, is an important process in development, wound healing and cancer. The corneal micropocket assay is used to better understand the process and, in the case of cancer, how it can be controlled with drug therapies for improved patient outcomes. In the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea can influence the way the vessel network forms. This makes it difficult to directly compare results from experiments with the predictions of mathematical models or cell culture experiments, which are typically performed on flat substrates or planar matrices. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to investigate how the hemispherical shape of the cornea affects vessel formation and to identify how sensitive different measurements of neovascularization are to geometry.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) can indirectly regulate mRNAs expression levels by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs), and act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or as sponges. Previous studies identified lncRNA-mediated sponge interactions in various cancers including the breast cancer. However, breast cancer subtypes are quite distinct in terms of their molecular profiles; therefore, ceRNAs are expected to be subtype-specific as well.\\n\\nResultsTo find lncRNA-mediated ceRNA interactions in breast cancer subtypes, we develop an integrative approach. We conduct partial correlation analysis and kernel independence tests on patient gene expression profiles and further refine the candidate interactions with miRNA target information. We find that although there are sponges common to multiple subtypes, there are also distinct subtype-specific interactions. Functional enrichment of mRNAs that participate in these interactions highlights distinct biological processes for different subtypes. Interestingly, some of the ceRNAs also reside in close proximity in the genome; for example, those involving HOX genes, HOTAIR, miR-196a-1 and miR-196a-2. We also discover subtype-specific sponge interactions with high prognostic potential. For instance, when grouping is based on the expression patterns of specific sponge interactions, patients differ significantly in their survival distributions. If on the other hand, patients are grouped based on the individual RNA expression profiles of the sponge participants, they do not exhibit a significant difference in survival. These results can help shed light on subtype-specific mechanisms of breast cancer, and the methodology developed herein can help uncover sponges in other diseases.",

    "abstract": "The genome of all organisms is constantly threatened by numerous agents that cause DNA damages. When the replication fork encounters an unrepaired DNA lesion, two DNA damage tolerance pathways are possible: error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) that requires specialized DNA polymerases, and error-free Damage Avoidance (DA) that relies on homologous recombination. The balance between these two mechanisms is essential since it defines the level of mutagenesis during lesion bypass, allowing genetic variability and adaptation to the environment, but also introducing the risk of generating genome instability. Here we report that the mere proximity of replication-blocking lesions that arise in Escherichia colis genome during a genotoxic stress, leads to a strong increase in the use of the error-prone TLS. We show that this increase is caused by the local inhibition of homologous recombination due to the overlapping of single-stranded DNA regions generated downstream the lesions. This increase in TLS is independent of SOS activation, but its mutagenic effect is additive with the one of SOS. Hence, the combination of SOS induction and lesions proximity leads to a strong increase in TLS that becomes the main lesion tolerance pathway used by the cell during a genotoxic stress.",

Dynamic causal modeling revealed feedback modulation from area V3A to areas V1 and LO for filling-in, contrasting with feedback from LO modulating areas V1 and V3A for a matched uniform chromaticity.

While KNa1.2 (Kcnt2 gene) is necessary for cardioprotection by volatile anesthetics, electrophysiologic evidence for a channel of this type in mitochondria is lacking. The endogenous physiologic role of a potential mito-KNa1.2 channel is also unclear. Herein, single channel patch-clamp of 27 independent cardiac mitochondrial inner membrane (mitoplast) preparations from wild type (WT) mice yielded 6 channels matching the known ion-sensitivity, ion-selectivity, pharmacology and conductance properties of KNa1.2 (slope conductance 138{+/-}1 pS). However, similar experiments on 40 preparations from Kcnt2-/- mice yielded zero such channels. The KNa opener bithionol uncoupled respiration in WT but not Kcnt2-/- cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, when oxidizing only fat as substrate, Kcnt2-/- cardiomyocytes and hearts were less responsive to increases in energetic demand. Kcnt2-/- mice also had elevated body fat, but no baseline differences in the cardiac metabolome. These data support the existence of a cardiac mitochondrial KNa1.2 channel, and a role for cardiac KNa1.2 in regulating metabolism under conditions of high energetic demand.",

Published normative reference values are nearly always for single time point performances rather than longitudinal change in performance. To gain insight into how we might tackle the problem of identifying worrisome trajectories, we borrow a method from anthropometry: the development of standards that are conditional on an individuals past measurements. We use quantile regression to create growth-curve-like models of performance on several common neuropsychological tests of memory and executive function while accounting for age, sex, education, estimated verbal ability, and past performance on the test, and then use these to estimate individuals percentile ranks. Choosing the 7th percentile as a threshold (corresponding to approximately 1.5 standard deviations below the expected mean), we then explore relationships between subthreshold performance, clinical outcomes, and subjective impairment. Participants whose performance fell below the 7th percentile were more likely to be given an abnormal research diagnosis at the current visit, but not at later visits. Performance below this threshold was also linked to subjective and informant reports of worsening memory function. We discuss potential uses of this method in theoretical and applied research and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Although evidence suggests a relationship between elevated beta-amyloid and cognitive decline, approximately 30% of older adults with positive markers of amyloid remain cognitively healthy. Our objective was to test if the presence of modifiable risk factors (i.e., central obesity, hypertension, and depressive symptoms) moderated the relationship between amyloid and longitudinal cognitive performance. Data were from 207 adults (140 females; age range=40-70) enriched for Alzheimers disease risk (73% parental history of Alzheimers disease) enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention study. Participants completed at least two neuropsychological evaluations and one biomarker visit ([C11] Pittsburgh Compound B PET scan or lumbar puncture). Participants were characterized as high or low on amyloid using cutoffs developed for [C11] Pittsburgh Compound B-PET distribution volume ratio or CSF amyloid beta 1-42 values. Participants were also coded as high or low risk on obesity, hypertension, and depressive symptoms. Linear mixed effects regression models examined three-way interactions between modifiable risk factor status x amyloid group x age at each study visit on longitudinal Verbal Learning & Memory and Speed & Flexibility factor scores. Results indicated that the relationship between beta-amyloid and Verbal Learning & Memory decline was associated with hypertension status (Likelihood ratio test for significance of hypertension status age x amyloid status x visit age interaction term;{chi} 2 (1) = 5.28, p = .02). The relationship between beta-amyloid and Speed & Flexibility decline was associated with depression status (Likelihood ratio test for significance of amyloid status x depression status x visit age interaction term;{chi} 2 (1) = 7.10, p = .03). The presence of obesity did not significantly moderate the relationship between beta-amyloid status and cognitive performance, although the direction of relationship was similar to above relationships (Likelihood ratio test for significance of obesity status x amyloid status x visit age interaction term;{chi} 2 (1) = 1.52, p = .21). In this at-risk for Alzheimers disease cohort, the modifiable risk factors of hypertension and depression significantly moderated the relationship between beta-amyloid and cognitive decline.

Prior research has identified numerous genetic (including sex), education, health and lifestyle factors that predict abnormal cognitive decline.Traditional model selection approaches (e.g., backward or stepwise selection), attempt to find models that best fit the observed data; these techniques risk interpretations that only the selected predictors are important. In reality, several models may fit similarly well but result in different conclusions (e.g., about size and significance of parameter estimates), and inference from a single model chosen after a selection procedure can lead to overly simplistic conclusions. Here we utilize longitudinal cognitive data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention to examine the effects of sex and the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele (non-modifiable factors), and reading literacy achievement (modifiable) on cognitive decline. For each outcome, we applied IT model averaging to a model set with combinations of interactions among sex, APOE, literacy, and age. For a list-learning test, model-averaged results showed better performance for women vs men, with faster decline among men; increased literacy was associated with better performance, particularly among men. APOE had less effect in this age range (~40-70). These results illustrate the utility of the IT approach and point to verbal ability as a potential modifier of decline. Whether the protective effect of literacy is due to educational attainment or intrinsic verbal intellectual ability is the topic of ongoing work.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on celiac disease (CeD) have shown the role of gut microbiota alterations in CeD pathogenesis. Whether this alteration in the microbial community is the cause or effect of the disease is not well understood, especially in adult onset of disease. The first-degree relatives (FDRs) of CeD patients may provide an opportunity to study gut microbiome in pre-disease state as FDRs are genetically susceptible to CeD. By using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed between the disease condition (CeD), pre-disease (FDR) and control subjects. However, differences were observed at the level of amplicon sequence variant (ASV), suggesting alterations in specific taxa between pre-diseases and diseased condition. Duodenal biopsies showed higher differences in ASVs compared to faecal samples indicating larger disruption of microbiota at disease site. Increased abundance of specific Helicobacter ASVs were observed in duodenum of CeD when compared to FDR (p < 0.01). In case of fecal samples CeD microbiome and Actinomyces. In addition, predicted functional metagenome showed reduced ability of gluten that ecosystem level diversity measures (except in the duodenum) were not significantly different is characterized by reduced abundance of beneficial taxa such as Akkermansia, Ruminococcus degradation by CeD faecal microbiota in comparison to FDRs and controls.",

    "abstract": "All known phototrophic metabolisms on Earth are based on one of three energy-converting pigments: chlorophyll-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, and retinal, which is the chromophore in rhodopsins [1]. While the contribution of chlorophylls to global energy flows and marine carbon cycling has been studied for decades, the role of retinal-based phototrophy remains largely unexplored [1,2]. We report the first vertical distributions of the three energy-converting pigments measured along a contrasting nutrient gradient through the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The highest proteorhodopsin concentrations were observed above the deep chlorophyll-a maxima, and their geographical distribution tended to be inversely related to that of chlorophyll-a. We further show that proteorhodopsins potentially absorb as much or more light energy than chlorophyll-a -based phototrophy and this energy is sufficient to sustain bacterial basal metabolism. Our results suggest that ubiquitous proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs are important contributors to the light energy captured in the sea.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effect of targeted kinase inhibitors can be significantly reduced by intrinsic or acquired resistance mutations that modulate the affinity of the drug for the kinase. In cancer, the majority of missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity. This complicates the practice of precision medicine, pairing of patients with clinical trials, and development of next-generation inhibitors. Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in binding free energy changes of [Formula] kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations as resistant or susceptible with [Formula] accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Movement in Parkinsons disease (PD) is fragmented, and the patients depend on visual information in their behavior. This suggests that the patients may have deficits in internally monitoring their own movements. Internal monitoring of movements is assumed to rely on corollary discharge signals that enable the brain to predict the sensory consequences of actions. We studied early-stage PD patients (N=14), and age-matched healthy control participants (N=14) to examine whether PD patients reveal deficits in updating their sensory representations after eye movements. The participants performed a double-saccade task where, in order to accurately fixate a second target, the participant must correct for the displacement caused by the first saccade. In line with previous reports, the patients had difficulties in fixating the second target when the eye movement was performed without visual guidance. Furthermore, the patients had difficulties in taking into account the error in the first saccade when making a saccade towards the second target, especially when eye movements were made towards the side with dominant motor symptoms. Across PD patients, the impairments in saccadic eye movements correlated with the integrity of the dopaminergic system as measured with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT: Patients with lower striatal (caudate, anterior putamen and posterior putamen) dopamine transporter binding made larger errors in saccades. This effect was strongest when patients made memory-guided saccades towards the second target. Our results provide tentative evidence that the motor deficits in PD may be partly accounted by deficits in internal monitoring of movements.",

A key advance for the TIGER pipeline is the ability to analyze both host and non-host sRNAs at genomic, parent RNA, and individual fragment levels. TIGER was able to identify approximately 60% of sRNAs on lipoproteins, and >85% of sRNAs in liver, bile, and urine, a significant advance compared to existing software. Results suggest that the majority of sRNAs on lipoproteins are non-host sRNAs derived from bacterial sources in the microbiome and environment, specifically rRNA-derived sRNAs from Proteobacteria.

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare, slow growing cancers that present in a diversity of tissues. To understand molecular underpinnings of gastrointestinal (GINET) and pancreatic NETs (PNETs), we profiled 45 tumours combining exome, RNA, and shallow whole genome sequencing, as well as fluorescent in situ hybridization. In addition to expected somatic mutations and copy number alterations, we found that PNETs contained a highly consistent copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) profile affecting over half of the genome; a greater percentage than any cancer analyzed to date. Our data indicates that onset of extreme autozygosity may be progressive, associated with metastasis, and initially triggered by the loss of DAXX/ATRX, and subsequent biallelic loss of MEN1. We confirmed this molecular timing model using targeted clinical sequencing data from an additional 43 NETs made available by the AACR GENIE project. Against this background of CN-LOH, several chromosomal regions consistently retained heterozygosity, suggesting selection for crucial allele-specific components specific to PNET progression and potential new therapeutic targets.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWe have discovered that pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours contain a characteristic pattern of copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity affecting the majority of the genome following mutations of MEN1 and ATRX/DAXX.

    "abstract": "Recombination is a fundamental feature of sexual reproduction, ensuring proper disjunction, preventing mutation accumulation and generating new allelic combinations upon which selection can act. However it is also mutagenic, and breaks up favourable allelic combinations previously built up by selection. Identifying the genetic drivers of recombination rate variation is a key step in understanding the causes and consequences of this variation, how lociassociated with recombination are evolving and how they affect the potential of a population to respond to selection. However, to date, few studies have examined the genetic architecture of recombination rate variation in natural populations. Here, we use pedigree data from -2,600 individuals genotyped at -38,000 SNPs to investigate the genetic architecture of individual autosomal recombination rate in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). Female red deer exhibited a higher mean and phenotypic variance in autosomal crossover counts (ACC). Animal models fitting genomic relatedness matrices showed that ACC was heritable in females (h2 = 0.12) but not in males. A regional heritability mapping approach showed that almost all heritable variation in female ACC was explained by a genomic region on deer linkage group 12 containing the candidate loci REC8 and RNF212B, with an additional region on linkage group 32 containing TOP2B approaching genome-wide significance. The REC8/RNF212B region and its paralogue RNF212 have been associated with recombination in cattle, mice, humans and sheep. Our findings suggest that mammalian recombination rates have a relatively conserved genetic architecture in both domesticated and wild systems, and provide a foundation for understanding the association between recombination lociand individual fitness within this population.",

We observed that infection of various cell types, including fibroblasts and epithelial cells resulted in the formation of unusually stable focal adhesions that resisted disassembly induced by the myosin II inhibitor, blebbistatin. Super-resolution microscopy revealed in infected cells the vertical displacement of paxillin and FAK from the signaling layer of focal adhesions; while vinculin remained in its normal position within the force transduction layer. The candidate type III effector TarP which localized to focal adhesions during infection and when expressed ectopically, was sufficient to mimic both the reorganization and blebbistatin-resistant phenotypes. These effects of TarP, including its localization to focal adhesions required interaction with the host protein vinculin through a specific domain at the C-terminus of TarP. The consequence of Chlamydia-stabilized focal adhesions was restricted cell motility and enhanced attachment to the extracellular matrix. Thus, via a novel mechanism, Chlamydia inserts TarP within focal adhesions to alter their organization and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Premature birth increases the risk of developing neurocognitive and neurobe-havioural disorders. The mechanisms of altered brain development causing these disorders are yet unknown. Studying the morphology and function of the brain during maturation provides us not only with a better understanding of normal development, but may help us to identify causes of abnormal development and their consequences. A particular difficulty is to distinguish abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment from normal variation. The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create a detailed four-dimensional (4D) connectome of early life. This connectome may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. As part of this project, more than a thousand healthy fetal and neonatal brains will be scanned in vivo. This requires computational methods which scale well to larger data sets. We propose a novel groupwise method for the construction of a spatio-temporal model of mean morphology from cross-sectional brain scans at different gestational ages. This model scales linearly with the number of images and thus improves upon methods used to build existing public neonatal atlases, which derive correspondence between all pairs of images. By jointly estimating mean shape and longitudinal change, the atlas created with our method overcomes temporal inconsistencies, which are encountered when mean shape and intensity images are constructed separately for each time point. Using this approach, we have constructed a spatio-temporal atlas from 275 healthy neonates between 35 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The resulting atlas qualitatively preserves cortical details significantly better than publicly available atlases. This is moreover confirmed by a number of quantitative measures of the quality of the spatial normalisation and sharpness of the resulting template brain images.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis results from the interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types. However, current methods to model morphogenic events offer little control over parallel cell type co-emergence and do not offer the capability to selectively perturb gene expression in specific subpopulations of cells. We have developed an in vitro system that can spatiotemporally interrogate cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. We examined the effects of independently knocking down molecular regulators of cortical tension and cell-cell adhesion using inducible CRISPRi: Rho-associated kinase-1 (ROCK1) and E-cadherin (CDH1), respectively. Induced mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 in hiPSC populations resulted in differential patterning events within hiPSC colonies indicative of cell-driven population organization. Patterned colonies retained an epithelial phenotype and nuclear expression of pluripotency markers. Gene expression within each of the mixed populations displayed a transient wave of differential expression with induction of knockdown that stabilized in coordination with intrinsic pattern formation. Mosaic patterning of hiPSCs enables the genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties of pluripotent cells, leading to a greater mechanistic understanding of the specific molecular pathways regulating the dynamics of symmetry breaking events that transpire during developmental morphogenesis.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEHuman embryonic development entails a series of multicellular morphogenic events that lead to primitive tissue formation. Attempts to study human morphogenic processes experimentally have been limited due to divergence from model organisms and the inability of current human in vitro models to accurately control the coincident emergence of heterogeneous cell populations in the spatially controlled manner necessary for proper tissue structure. We developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) in vitro model that enables temporal control over the emergence of heterotypic subpopulations of cells. We examined mosaic knockdown of two target molecules to create predictable and robust cell-patterning events within hiPSC colonies. This method allows for dynamic interrogation of intrinsic cell mechanisms that initiate symmetry breaking events and provides direct insight(s) into tissue developmental principles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe epidermis is a stratified epithelium whose differentiation program is triggered in part by calcium. Dysregulation of keratinocyte differentiation may lead to non-melanoma skin cancers, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). The compound 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) modulates calcium signaling by altering activity of calcium-permeable channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) and ORAI families, and is therefore poised to govern signaling pathways that control the balance of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation.\\n\\nObjectiveWe sought to determine whether 2-APB alters differentiation of normal human keratinocytes and progression of human cSCCs models in vitro.\\n\\nMethodsPrimary human keratinocyte cultures were treated with 2-APB and levels of proliferation (EdU incorporation) and differentiation markers [quantitative PCR (qPCR)] were assessed. Human cSCC biopsies and cell lines were analyzed for TRP and ORAI gene expression via qPCR. cSCC cell lines were cultured in organtypic cultures and analyzed for growth and invasiveness after 2-APB or vehicle treatment.\\n\\nResultsCulturing human keratinocytes with 2-APB arrested cell proliferation, triggered differentiation-gene expression and altered epidermal stratification, indicating that 2-APB application is sufficient to promote differentiation. In human organotypic cSCC cultures, 2-APB attenuated tumor growth and invasiveness. Finally, expression of a panel of 2-APB-targeted ion channels (TRPV3, TRPV1, TRPC1, OraI1, OraI2 and OraI3) was dysregulated in high-risk cSCC biopsies.\\n\\nConclusionsCollectively, these findings identify 2-APB as a potential therapeutic for high-risk cSCCs.",

    "abstract": "There is a need in modern neuroscience for accurate and automated image processing techniques for analyzing the large volume of neuroanatomical data. For e.g., the use of light microscopy to image whole mouse brains in a mesoscopic scale produces individual neuroanatomical data volumes in the TerraByte range.. A fundamental task involves the detection and quantification of objects of a given type, e.g. neuronal nuclei or somata, in whole mouse brains. Traditionally this quantification is performed by human visual inspection with high accuracy, that is not scalable.. When state-of-the-art CNN and SVM-based methods are used to solve this classification problem, they achieve accuracy levels between 85 - 92%. However, higher rates of precision and recall, close to that of humans are necessary. In this paper, we describe an unsupervised, iterative algorithm, which provides a high close to human performance for a specific problem of broad interest, i.e. detection of Green Fluorescent Protein labeled nuclei in whole mouse brains. The algorithm judiciously combines classical computer vision (CV) techniques and is focused on the complex problem of decomposing strong overlapped objects (nuclei). Our proposed iterative method uses features detected on ridge lines over distance transformation and an arc based iterative spatial-filling method to solve the problem. We demonstrate our results on two whole mouse brain data sets of Gigabyte resolution and compare it with manual annotation of the brains. Our results show that an aptly designed CV algorithm with classical feature extractors when tailored to this problem of interest achieves near-ideal human-like performance. Quantitative analysis, when compared with the manually annotated ground truth, reveals that our approach performs better on whole mouse brain scans than general purpose machine learning (including deep CNN) methods.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of liver cancer remains challenging, due to a paucity of drugs that target critical dependencies. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that is approved as the standard therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients, but it can only provide limited survival benefit for patients. To investigate the cause of this limited therapeutic effect, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 based synthetic lethality screen to search for kinases whose knockout synergize with sorafenib. We find that suppression of ERK2 sensitizes several liver cancer cell lines to sorafenib. Drugs inhibiting the MEK or ERK kinases reverse unresponsiveness to sorafenib in vitro and in vivo in a subset of liver cancer cell lines characterized by high levels of active phospho-ERK levels through synergistic inhibition of ERK kinase activity. Our data provide a combination strategy for treating liver cancer and suggest that tumors with activation of p-ERK, which is seen in some 30% of liver cancers, are most likely to benefit from such combinatorial treatment.",

    "abstract": "Single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH) allows the quantitative analysis of gene expression in single cells. The technique relies on the use of pools of end-labeled fluorescent oligonucleotides to detect specific cellular RNA sequences. These fluorescent probes are currently chemically synthesized. Here I describe a novel technique based on the use of routine molecular biology enzymes to generate smRNA FISH probes without the need for chemical synthesis of pools of oligonucleotides. The protocol comprises 3 main steps: purification of phagemid-derived single stranded DNA molecules comprising a segment complementary to a target RNA sequence; fragmentation of these molecules by limited DNase I digestion; and end-labeling of the resulting oligonucleotides with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase and fluorescent dideoxynucleotides. smRNA FISH probes that are obtained using the technique presented here are shown to perform as well as conventional probes. The main advantages of the method are the low cost of probes and the flexibility it affords in the choice of labels. Enzyme-based synthesis of probes should further increase the popularity of smRNA FISH as a tool to investigate gene expression at the cellular or subcellular level.",

    "abstract": "In rodents, hippocampal cell assemblies formed during learning of a navigation task are observed to re-emerge during resting (offline) periods, accompanied by high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). This phenomenon is believed to reflect mechanisms for strengthening newly-formed memory traces. Using magnetoencephalography recordings and a beamforming source location algorithm (synthetic aperture magnetometry), we investigated high-gamma (80 - 140 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampal region in 18 human participants during inter-trial rest periods in a virtual navigation task. We found right hippocampal gamma oscillations mirrored the pattern of theta power in the same region during navigation, varying as a function of environmental novelty. Gamma power during inter-trial rest periods was positively correlated with theta power during navigation in the first training set when the environment was new and predicted faster learning in the subsequent training set two where the environment became familiar. These findings provide evidence for human hippocampal reactivation accompanied by high-gamma activities immediately after learning and establish a link between hippocampal high-gamma activities and memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Combination of genome editing and human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offers a platform for in vitro disease modeling, drug discovery and personalized stem cell therapeutics. However, incorporation of large modifications using CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in hPSCs typically requires the use of selection markers due to low editing efficiencies. Here we report a novel editing technology in hPSCs using Cas9 protein complexed with chemically modified single guide RNA (sgRNA) and recombinant AAV6 (rAAV6) vectors for donor delivery without marker selection. With these components, we demonstrate targeted integration of a 2.2 kb DNA expression cassette in hPSCs at frequencies up to 94% and 67% at the HBB and MYD88 loci, respectively. We used this protocol to correct the homozygous sickle cell disease (SCD) mutation in an iPSC line derived from a SCD patient with a frequency of 63%. This Cas9/AAV6 system allows for both the integration of large gene cassettes and the creation of single nucleotide changes in hPSCs at high frequencies, eliminating the need for multiple editing steps and marker selection, thus increasing the potential of editing human pluripotent cells for both research and translational applications.",

In this study, orthogonal treatments of three CO2 concentrations (Ca) x five soil water contents (SWC) were conducted using Platycladus orientalis saplings to investigate the interaction of water stress and CO2 concentration on {delta}13C of leaf and twig phloem WSOM. Under the lowest SWC, the {delta}13C of leaf and twig phloem WSOM had the most positive values at any Ca and their values decreased as Ca increased.

In addition, a more significant relationship between SWC and {delta}13C of twig phloem WSOM than that between SWC and {delta}13C of leaf WSOM demonstrated that {delta}13C of twig phloem WSOM is a more sensitive indicator of SWC. Twig phloem WSOM was generally 13C-depleted compared with leaf WSOM for potential post-photosynthetic fractionation, and the 13C discrimination from leaves to twig phloem was insensitive to the interaction between SWC and Ca.

    "abstract": "The study of gene regulation is dominated by a focus on the control of gene activation or controlling an increase in the level of expression. Just as critical is the process of gene repression or silencing. Chromatin signatures have allowed for the global mapping of enhancer cis-regulatory elements, however, the identification of silencer elements by computational or experimental approaches in a genome-wide manner are lacking. We present a simple but powerful computational approach to identify putative silencers genome-wide. We used a series of consortia data to predict silencers in over 100 human and mouse cell or tissue types. We performed several analyses to determine if these elements exhibited characteristics expected of a silencers. Motif enrichment analyses on putative silencers determined that motifs belonging to known transcriptional repressors are enriched, as well as overlapping known transcription repressor binding sites. Leveraging promoter capture HiC data from several human and mouse cell types, we found that over 50% of putative silencer elements are interacting with gene promoters having very low to no expression. Next, to validate our silencer predictions, we quantified silencer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on 7500 selected elements in K562 cells. We trained a support vector machine model classifier on MPRA data and used it to refine potential silencers in other cell types. We also show that similar to enhancer elements, silencer elements are enriched in disease-associated variants. Our results suggest a general strategy for genome-wide identification and characterization of silencer elements.",

Typically they are linear combination of the genotypes of a large number of SNPs, with the weights calculated from an external source, such as summary statistics from large meta-analyses. Recently cohorts with genetic data have become very large, such that it would be a waste if the raw data were not made use of in constructing PGS. Making use of raw data in calculating PGS, however, presents us with problems of overfitting. Here we discuss the essence of overfitting as applied in PGS calculations and highlight the difference between overfitting due to the overlap between the target and the discovery data (OTD), and overfitting due to the overlap between the target the the validation data (OTV). We propose two methods -- cross prediction and split validation -- to overcome OTD and OTV respectively. Using these two methods, PGS can be calculated using raw data without overfitting. We show that PGSs thus calculated have better predictive power than those using summary statistics alone for six phenotypes in the UK Biobank data.",

We found a distinct decreasing content of cytosine (C) and increasing content of guanine (G) across each N region, suggesting that N regions are typically generated by concatenation of two 3-overhangs synthesized by addition of nucleoside triphosphates with a preference for dCTP. This challenges the general assumption that the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase favors dGTP in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the G and C gradients depended strongly on whether the germline gene segments were trimmed or not. Our data show that C-enriched N addition preferentially happens at trimmed 3-ends of VH-, D-, and JH-gene segments indicating a dependency of the transferase mechanism upon the nuclease mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Numerical format describes the way magnitude is conveyed, for example as a digit ( 3) or Roman Numeral ( III). In the field of numerical cognition, there is an ongoing debate of whether magnitude representation is independent of numerical format. Here, we examine the time course of magnitude processing when using different symbolic formats. We presented participants with a series of digits and dice patterns corresponding to the magnitudes of 1 to 6 while performing a 1-back task on magnitude. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers an opportunity to record brain activity with high temporal resolution. Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) applied to MEG data allows us to draw conclusions about brain activation patterns underlying information processing over time. The results show that we can crossdecode magnitude when training the classifier on magnitude presented in one symbolic format and testing the classifier on the other symbolic format. This suggests similar representation of these numerical symbols. Additionally, results from a time-generalisation analysis show that digits were accessed slightly earlier than dice, demonstrating temporal asynchronies in their shared representation of magnitude. Together, our methods allow a distinction between format-specific signals and format-independent representations of magnitude showing evidence that there is a shared representation of magnitude accessed via different symbols.",

    "abstract": "In root-nodule symbiosis, rhizobial invasion and nodule organogenesis is host controlled. In most legumes, rhizobia enter through infection-threads and nodule primordium in the cortex is induced from a distance. But in dalbergoid legumes like Arachis hypogaea, rhizobia directly invade cortical cells through epidermal cracks to generate the primordia. Herein we report the transcriptional dynamics with the progress of symbiosis in A. hypogaea at 1dpi: invasion; 4dpi: nodule primordia; 8dpi: spread of infection in nodule-like structure; 12dpi: immature nodules containing rod-shaped rhizobia; and 21dpi: mature nodules with spherical symbiosomes. Expression of putative orthologue of symbiotic genes in  crack-entry legume A. hypogaea was compared with infection thread adapted model legumes. The contrasting features were (i) higher expression of receptors like LYR3, EPR3 as compared to canonical NFRs (ii) late induction of transcription factors like NIN, NSP2 and constitutive high expression of ERF1, EIN2, bHLH476 and (iii) induction of divergent pathogenesis responsive PR-1 genes. Additionally, symbiotic orthologues of SymCRK, FLOT4, ROP6, RR9, NOOT and SEN1 were not detectable and microsynteny analysis indicated the absence of RPG and DNF2 homologues in diploid parental genomes of A. hypogaea. The implications are discussed and a molecular framework that guide  crack-entry symbiosis in A. hypogaea is proposed.",

A family of Catharanthus roseus Receptor Kinase-1 ( CrRLK1L) membrane receptors has been genetically implicated in this process. Here we present crystal structures of the CrRLK1Ls ANXUR1 and 2 at 1.48 and 1.1 [A] resolution, respectively. Our structures reveal a novel arrangement of two malectin-like domains connected by a short {beta}hairpin linker and stabilized by calcium ions. The canonical carbohydrate interaction surfaces of related animal and bacterial carbohydrate binding modules are not conserved among plant CrRLK1Ls. In line with this, we failed to detect binding of chemically diverse oligosaccharides to ANXUR1 and HERCULES1. Instead, CrRLK1Ls have evolved a protein-protein interface between their malectin domains, which forms a deep cleft lined by highly conserved aromatic and polar residues. Analysis of the glycosylation pattern of different CrRLK1Ls and their oligomeric states together suggests that this cleft could resemble a binding site for a ligand required for CrRLK1Ls receptor activation.",

    "abstract": "Life science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition, and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current semantic annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation.",

Whilst many molecular regulators have been established, how these connect to physical and geometrical aspects of tissue architecture is poorly understood. Here, using high-resolution timelapse imaging, we find that dense tissue packing and complex cell geometries play a significant role in regulating differentiation rate in the zebrafish neural tube. Specifically, in regions of high cell density, progenitors are physically pushed away from the apical surface, which, in a Notch-dependent manner, leads to their differentiation. Using simulations we show that this naturally performs negative feedback control on cell number. Our results suggest a model whereby differentiation rate is carefully tuned to correct fluctuations in cell number, originating from variable cell cycle progression and inherently probabilistic differentiation programs.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuins--a group of NAD+-dependent deacylases--have emerged as key in the connection between NAD+ metabolism and aging. This class of enzymes hydrolyze a range of{varepsilon} -N-acyllysine PTMs and determining the repertoire of catalyzed deacylation reactions is of high importance to fully elucidate the roles of a given sirtuin. Here we have identified and produced two potential sirtuins from the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and screening more than 80 different substrates, covering 26 acyl groups on five peptide scaffolds, showed that one of the investigated proteins--Sir2La--is a bona fide NAD+-dependent sirtuin, catalyzing hydrolysis of acetyl-, propionyl-, and butyryllysine. Further substantiating the identity as a sirtuin, known sirtuin inhibitors nicotinamide and suramin as well as a thioacetyllysine compound inhibit the deacylase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on steady-state kinetics Sir2La showed a slight preference for propionyllysine over acetyllysine and butyryllysine, driven both by KM (14 M vs 21 M and 15 M) and kcat (4.4{middle dot}10-3 s-1 vs 2.5{middle dot}10-3 s-1 and 1.21{middle dot}10-3 s-1). Moreover, while NAD+ is a prerequisite for Sir2La-mediated deacylation, Sir2La has very high KM for NAD+ compared to the expected levels of the dinucleotide in L. acidophilus. Sir2La is the first sirtuin from Lactobacillales and of the Gram-positive bacterial subclass of sirtuins to be functionally characterized. The ability to hydrolyze propionyl- and butyryllysine emphasizes the relevance of further exploring the role of other short-chain acyl moieties as PTMs.",

    "abstract": "DnaJ/Hsp40 chaperones deliver unfolded proteins and stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK/Hsp70 via their J-domain, a crucial event for the function that this system has in assisting protein folding. The interaction between Hsp40 and Hsp70 is transient and thus difficult to study, since mixing the binding partners can lead to quick dissociation due to their low affinity, creating a challenge for detailed analysis. As a consequence, knowledge of many important aspects of the mechanism of interaction is still lacking, for instance, the effect that J-domain binding has on Hsp70. In this study, we investigated whether it would be possible to gain understanding of this interaction by engineering a chimeric polypeptide where the J-domain of Hsp40 was covalently attached to the substrate binding domain (SBD) of Hsp70 by a flexible linker. The rationale for this is that an increase in the proximity between the interacting partners in this engineered chimera will promote the natural interaction and facilitate the characterization of the protein- protein interaction, which is a requirement to gain further understanding of many biological processes. The resulting chimera, termed J-SBD, was properly folded and had properties not present in the SBD alone. J-SBD behaved primarily as a monomer in all conditions tested and exhibited chaperone activity, as shown by aggregation protection and substrate binding assays, which revealed decreased binding to bis-ANS, a probe for hydrophobic patches. Collectively, our results suggest that Hsp40 binding to Hsp70 via the J-domain shifts the Hsp70 equilibrium towards the monomer state to expose hydrophobic sites prone to substrate accommodation.\\n\\nAbbreviationsBis-ANS (4,4-Dianilino-1,1-Binaphthyl-5,5-Disulfonic Acid; CD, circular dichroism; Hsp, heat shock protein; J-SBD, chimeric polypeptide in which the J-domain of Hsp40 (at the N-terminus) is covalently attached to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 (at the C-terminus) by a flexible linker; SBD: substrate binding domain of Hsp70.",

    "abstract": "Large (>10 kb) palindromic sequences are enriched on mammalian sex chromosomes. In mice, these palindromes harbor gene families ([&ge;]2 gene copies) expressed exclusively in post-meiotic testicular germ cells, at a time when most single-copy sex-linked genes are transcriptionally repressed. This distinct expression pattern led to the hypothesis that containment within palindrome structures or having [&ge;]2 gene enables post-meiotic gene expression. We tested these two hypotheses by using CRISPR to precisely engineer large (10s of kb) inversions and deletions of X chromosome palindrome arms for two regions carrying the mouse 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 gene families. We found that 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 gene expression is unaffected in mice carrying palindrome arm inversions, suggesting that palindromic structure is not important for mediating palindrome-associated gene expression. We also found that 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 gene expression is reduced by half in mice carrying palindrome arm deletions, allowing us to test whether palindrome-associated genes are sensitive to reduced expression levels resulting in spermatogenic defects. Male mice carrying palindrome arm deletions of 4930567H17Rik or Mageb5, however, are fertile, have normal testis histology, and show no aberrations in spermatogenic cell population frequencies via FACS quantification. Together, these findings suggest that large palindromic structures on the sex chromosomes are not necessary for their associated genes to evade post-meiotic transcriptional repression and that these genes are not sensitive to reduced expression levels. Large sex chromosome palindromes may thus be important for other reasons, such as the long-term evolutionary stability of their associated gene families.",

Using novel haplotype-based methods here we infer the sub-populations involved in admixture for over 6,500 Latin Americans and evaluate the impact of sub-continental ancestry on the physical appearance of these individuals. We find that pre-Columbian Native genetic structure is mirrored in Latin Americans and that sources of non-Native ancestry, and admixture timings, match documented migratory flows. We also detect South/East Mediterranean ancestry across Latin America, probably stemming from the clandestine colonial migration of Christian converts of non-European origin (Conversos). Furthermore, we find that Central Andean ancestry impacts on variation of facial features in Latin Americans, particularly nose morphology, possibly relating to environmental adaptation during the evolution of Native Americans.",

A membrane-bound ATPase protein, EssC in Staphylococcus aureus, lies at the heart of the secretion machinery. The EssC protein from S. aureus strains can be grouped into four variants (EssC1-EssC4) that display sequence variability in the C-terminal region. Here we show that the EssC2, EssC3 and EssC4 variants can be produced in a strain deleted for essC1 and that they are able to mediate secretion of EsxA, an essential component of the secretion apparatus. They are, however, unable to support secretion of the substrate protein EsxC, which is encoded only in essC1-specific strains. This finding indicates that EssC is a specificity determinant for T7 protein secretion. Our results support a model where the C-terminal domain of EssC interacts with substrate proteins whereas EsxA interacts elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Contact tracing requires reliable identification of closely related bacterial isolates. When we noticed the reporting of artefactual variation between M. tuberculosis isolates during routine next generation sequencing of Mycobacterium spp, we investigated its basis in 2,018 consecutive M. tuberculosis isolates. In the routine process used, clinical samples were decontaminated and inoculated into broth cultures; from positive broth cultures DNA was extracted, sequenced, reads mapped, and consensus sequences determined. We investigated the process of consensus sequence determination, which selects the most common nucleotide at each position. Having determined the high-quality read depth and depth of minor variants across 8,006 M. tuberculosis genomic regions, we quantified the relationship between the minor variant depth and the amount of non-Mycobacterial bacterial DNA, which originates from commensal microbes killed during sample decontamination. In the presence of non-Mycobacterial bacterial DNA, we found significant increases in minor variant frequencies of more than 1.5 fold in 242 regions covering 5.1% of the M. tuberculosis genome. Included within these were four high variation regions strongly influenced by the amount of non-Mycobacterial bacterial DNA. Excluding these four regions from pairwise distance comparisons reduced biologically implausible variation from 5.2% to 0% in an independent validation set derived from 226 individuals. Thus, we have demonstrated an approach identifying critical genomic regions contributing to clinically relevant artefactual variation in bacterial similarity searches. The approach described monitors the outputs of the complex multi-step laboratory and bioinformatics process, allows periodic process adjustments, and will have application to quality control of routine bacterial genomics.",

    "abstract": "Although many studies have focused on abnormal patterns of brain functional connectivity in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one important factor, the developmental effect of brain networks was largely overlooked. To clarify the abnormal developmental trajectory of brain functional connectivity in ASD, we focused on the age-related changes in three \\\"core\\\" neurocognitive networks: default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and central executive network (CEN, also divided into left and right CEN, i.e., lCEN and rCEN). The development of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) within and between these networks were analyzed in 107 Chinese participants, including children, adolescents, and adults (54 patients with ASD and 53 typically developed (TD) participants; ages 6-30 years). We found that diagnosis-related distinctions in age-related changes suggest three maturation patterns in networks or nodes iFC: delayed (iFC between SN and rCEN), ectopic (iFC between SN and DMN, and iFC between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right anterior insula/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)), and failure maturation (iFC between dACC and ventral medial prefrontal cortex). Compared with age-matched TD participants, ASD patients in children and adolescents exhibited hypo-connectivity, while that in adults showed hyper-connectivity. In addition, an independent verification based on Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) datasets confirmed our findings of developmental trajectories in ASD group, which also showed unchanged functional connectivity with age between DMN and SN and increasing iFC between rCEN and SN. The conspicuous differences in the development of three \\\"core\\\" networks in ASD were demonstrated, which may lead a nuanced understanding towards the abnormal brain network maturation trajectory of autism.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of brain subnetwork segregation and integration has previously focused on changes that are detectable at the level of entire sessions or epochs of imaging data. In this study, we applied time-varying functional connectivity analysis together with temporal network theory to calculate point-by-point estimates in subnetwork segregation and integration during an epoch-based (2-back, 0-back, baseline) working memory fMRI experiment as well as during resting-state. This approach allowed us to follow task-related changes in subnetwork segregation and integration at a high temporal resolution. At a global level, the cognitively more taxing 2-back epochs elicited an overall stronger response of integration between subnetworks compared to the 0-back epochs. Moreover, the visual and fronto-parietal subnetworks displayed characteristic and distinct temporal profiles of segregation and integration during the 0- and 2-back epochs. During the interspersed epochs of baseline, many subnetworks, including the default mode, visual, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular and dorsal attention subnetworks showed pronounced increases in segregation. Using a drift diffusion model we show that the response time for the 2-back trials are correlated with integration for the fronto-parietal subnetwork and correlated with segregation for the visual subnetwork. Our results elucidate the fast-evolving events with regard to subnetwork integration and segregation that occur in an epoch-related task fMRI experiment. Our findings suggest that minute changes in subnetwork integration are of importance for task performance.",

    "abstract": "SALM1, also known as LRFN2, is a PSD-95-interacting synaptic adhesion molecule implicated in the regulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) clustering largely based on in vitro data, although its in vivo functions remain unclear. Here, we found that mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (Lrfn2-/- mice) show a normal density of excitatory synapses but altered excitatory synaptic function, including enhanced NMDAR-dependent synaptic transmission but suppressed NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. Unexpectedly, SALM1 expression is detected in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and Lrfn2-/- CA1 pyramidal neurons show decreases in the density of inhibitory synapses and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, ultrasonic vocalization was suppressed in Lrfn2-/- pups separated from their mothers, and acoustic startle was enhanced, but locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and learning and memory were largely normal in adult Lrfn2-/- mice. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, and social communication and startle behaviors in mice.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSynaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and function, which govern neural circuit and brain functions. The SALM/LRFN family of synaptic adhesion proteins consists of five known members whose in vivo functions are largely unknown. Here we characterized mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (SALM1 knockout) known to associate with NMDA receptors and found that these mice showed altered NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission and plasticity, as expected, but unexpectedly also exhibited suppressed inhibitory synapse development and synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, SALM1 knockout pups showed suppressed ultrasonic vocalization upon separation from their mothers, and SALM1 knockout adults showed enhanced responses to loud acoustic stimuli. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, social communication, and acoustic startle behavior.",

In current study, the regulatory roles of seven kinds of plant growth regulators, including abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ethephon, ETP), gibberellins (GA4), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), kinetine (KT), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), were determined for soybeans under waterlogging conditions. Based on the results, the donor source of ethylene was selected and its role was further examined regarding physiochemical alteration and glutathione biosynthesis-related transcripts through application of exogenous ETP. ETP application mitigated waterlogging stress and significantly improved the efficiency of photosynthesis and increased bioactive GA4 contents compared to that of untreated plants. Element and amino acid contents among the treatments were significantly different. Total elements and amino acid contents were increased in 100 M ETP-treated soybean plants. ETP application induced adventitious root initiation, improved root surface area, and significantly increased glutathione transferases expression and glutathione relative to that of non-ETP treated soybean plants. Finally, 100 M-ETP application induced up-regulated protein content and glutathione s-transferase DHAR2 as compared to that of soybeans under waterlogging-conditions only. ETP could induce various biochemical and transcriptional modulations that strengthen plant growth and mitigate waterlogging stress.\\n\\nHighlightEthylene application to soybean plants after waterlogging up-regulates glutathione transferase genes.

Signal detection permits the discrimination of methylation signal from dynamic background noise that is induced by thermal fluctuation. Current genome-wide methylation analysis methods do not incorporate biophysical properties of DNA, and focus largely on DNA methylation density changes, which limits resolution of natural, more subtle methylome behavior in relation to gene activity.\\n\\nResultsWe present here a novel methylome analysis procedure, Methyl-IT, based on information thermodynamics and signal detection. Methylation analysis involves a signal detection step, and the method was designed to discriminate methylation regulatory signal from background variation. Comparisons with commonly used programs and two publicly available methylome datasets, involving stages of seed development and drought stress effects, were implemented. Information divergence between methylation levels from different groups, measured in terms of Hellinger divergence, provides discrimination power between control and treatment samples. Differentially informative methylation positions (DIMPs) achieved higher sensitivity and accuracy than standard differentially methylated positions (DMPs) identified by other methods. Differentially methylated genes (DMG) that are based on DIMPs were significantly enriched in biologically meaningful networks.\\n\\nConclusionsMethyl-IT analysis enhanced resolution of natural methylome reprogramming behavior to reveal network-associated responses, offering resolution of gene pathway influences not attainable with previous methods.",

How this biochemical property of microtubule acetylation relates to mechanosensation remains unknown, though prior studies have shown that microtubule acetylation plays a role in touch perception. Here, we identify the major Drosophila -tubulin acetylase (dTAT) and show that it plays key roles in several forms of mechanosensation while exerting little effect on other sensory modalities. dTAT is highly expressed in neurons of the larval peripheral nervous system (PNS), but is not required for normal neuronal morphogenesis. We show that mutation of the acetylase gene or the K40 acetylation site in -tubulin impairs mechanical sensitivity in sensory neurons and behavioral responses to gentle touch, harsh touch, gravity, and sound stimulus, but not thermal stimulus. Finally, we show that dTAT is required for mechanically-induced activation of NOMPC, a microtubule-associated transient receptor potential channel, and functions to maintain integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Chirality is a property of asymmetry between an object and its mirror image. Most biomolecules and cells are intrinsically chiral. Whether cellular chirality can be transferred to asymmetry at the tissue scale remains an unresolved issue. This question is particularly relevant in the left-right organizer (LRO), where cilia motility and chiral flow are thought to be the main drivers of left-right axis symmetry breaking. Here, we built a quantitative approach based on live imaging to set apart the contributions of various pathways to the spatial orientation of cilia in the Kupffers vesicle (KV, zebrafish LRO). We found that cilia populating the zebrafish LRO display an asymmetric orientation between the right and left side of the LRO. Cilia orientations, therefore, give the KV cells a sense of chirality which is different from the chirality of cilia rotation. Surprisingly, we found this asymmetry does not depend on the left-right signalling pathway or flow. Furthermore, we show the establishment of the chirality is dynamic and depends on planar cell polarity. Together, this work identifies a different type of asymmetry in the LRO and sheds light on the complexity of chirality genesis in developing tissues.",

We quantify the distribution of fitness effects of synonymous mutations and show that it is dominated by many mutations of small or no effect and few mutations of larger effect. We then compare the shape of the codon fitness landscape across amino-acid positions and environments, and quantify how the consideration of synonymous fitness effects changes the evolutionary dynamics on these fitness landscapes.

Variation in virulence among Pm. minimum isolates has been reported, but the underlying genetic basis of the phenotypic variability remains unknown. The goal of this study was to characterize intraspecific genetic diversity and explore its potential impact on virulence functions associated with secondary metabolism, cellular transport, and cell wall decomposition. We generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly, using single molecule real-time sequencing, and resequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of multiple isolates to identify sequence and structural polymorphisms. Numerous insertion and deletion events were found for a total of about 1 Mbp in each isolate. Structural variation in this extremely gene dense genome frequently caused presence/absence polymorphisms of multiple adjacent genes, mostly belonging to biosynthetic clusters associated with secondary metabolism. Because of the observed intraspecific diversity in gene content due to structural variation we concluded that a transcriptome reference developed from a single isolate is insufficient to represent the virulence factor repertoire of the species. We therefore compiled a pan-transcriptome reference of Pm. minimum comprising a non-redundant set of 15,245 protein-coding sequences. Using naturally infected field samples expressing Esca symptoms, we demonstrated that mapping of meta-transcriptomics data on a multi-species reference that included the Pm. minimum pan-transcriptome allows the profiling of an expanded set of virulence factors, including variable genes associated with secondary metabolism and cellular transport.",

We examined how temporal manipulation of the haptic and visual feedback affect stiffness perception and grip force adjustment during a stiffness discrimination task. We used delayed force feedback and delayed visual feedback to break the natural relations between these modalities when participants tried to choose the harder spring between pairs of springs. We found that visual delay caused participants to slightly overestimate stiffness while force feedback delay caused a mixed effect on perception; for some it caused underestimation and for some overestimation of stiffness. Interestingly and in contrast to previous findings without vision, we found that participants increased the magnitude of their applied grip force for all conditions. We propose a model that suggests that this increase was a result of coupling the grip force adjustment to their proprioceptive hand position, which was the only modality which we could not delay. Our findings shed light on how the sensorimotor system combines information from different sensory modalities for perception and action. These results are important for the design of improved teleoperation systems that suffer from unavoidable delays.",

    "abstract": "Repression of target genes by the transcriptional repressor neuronal restrictive silencing factor (NRSF)/repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) contributes to enduring plasticity in the developing brain. However, the cofactor(s) interacting with NRSF to enable target gene repressor are not well understood, and may vary among neuronal populations and brain regions as well as with different contexts. Here we employed the novel designer drug mS-11 to block the interactions of the cofactor Sin3 with NRSF. We tested if NRSF-Sin3 interaction is required for repression of NRSF target genes in developing hypothalamus after activity-dependent modulation of NRSF function. In the hypothalamus in vitro, blocking glutamatergic neurotransmission robustly increased NRSF binding to the target gene Crh, resulting in its repression. Blocking the binding of NRSF to the chromatin with decoy NRSE-oligodeoxynucleotides abrogated this repression. In contrast, mS-11 at several concentrations did not impede Crh repression. NRSF-mediated repression may underlie disease processes such as the onset of epilepsy. Therefore, identifying small-molecule antagonists of NRSF is crucial for the development of disease-preventing or modifying interventions.",

    "abstract": "Cytoskeletal filaments such as microtubules and actin filaments play important roles in the mechanical integrity of cells and the ability of cells to respond to their environment. Measuring the mechanical properties of cytoskeletal structures is crucial for gaining insight into intracellular mechanical stresses and their role in regulating cellular processes. One of the ways to characterize these mechanical properties is by measuring their persistence length, the average length over which filaments stay straight. There are several approaches in the literature for measuring filament deformations, including Fourier analysis of images obtained using fluorescence microscopy. Here, we show how curvature distributions can be used as an alternative tool to quantify bio-filament deformations, and investigate how the apparent stiffness of filaments depends on the resolution and noise of the imaging system. We present analytical calculations of the scaling curvature distributions as a function of filament discretization, and test our predictions by comparing Monte Carlo simulations to results from existing techniques. We also apply our approach to microtubules and actin filaments obtained from in vitro gliding assay experiments with high densities of non-functional motors, and calculate the persistence length of these filaments. The presented curvature analysis is significantly more accurate compared to existing approaches for small data sets, and can be readily applied to both in vitro or in vivo filament data through the use of an ImageJ plugin we provide.",
