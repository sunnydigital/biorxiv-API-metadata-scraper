    "abstract": "RNA viruses are notorious for their ability to evolve rapidly under selection in novel environments. It is known that the high mutation rate of RNA viruses can generate huge genetic diversity to facilitate viral adaptation. However, less attention has been paid to the underlying fitness landscape that represents the selection forces on viral genomes. Here we systematically quantified the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of about 1,600 single amino acid substitutions in the drug-targeted region of NS5A protein of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). We found that the majority of non-synonymous substitutions incur large fitness costs, suggesting that NS5A protein is highly optimized in natural conditions. We characterized the adaptive potential of HCV by subjecting the mutant viruses to selection by the antiviral drug Daclatasvir. Both the selection coefficient and the number of beneficial mutations are found to increase with the level of environmental stress, which is modulated by the concentration of Daclatasvir. The changes in the spectrum of beneficial mutations in NS5A protein can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model describing viral fitness as a function of drug concentration. We test theoretical predictions regarding the distribution of beneficial fitness effects of mutations. We also interpret the data in the context of Fishers Geometric Model and find an increased distance to optimum as a function of environmental stress. Finally, we show that replication fitness of viruses is correlated with the pattern of sequence conservation in nature and viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability.",

    "abstract": "The replacement of forest areas with human-dominated landscapes usually leads to fragmentation, altering the structure and function of the forest. Here we studied the dynamics of forest patch sizes at a global level, examining signals of a critical transition from an unfragmented to a fragmented state, using the MODIS vegetation continuous field. We defined wide regions of connected forest across continents and big islands, and combined five criteria, including the distribution of patch sizes and the fluctuations of the largest patch over the last sixteen years, to evaluate the closeness of each region to a fragmentation threshold. Regions with the highest deforestation rates--South America, Southeast Asia, Africa--all met these criteria and may thus be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This implies that if current forest loss rates are maintained, wide continental areas could suddenly fragment, triggering extensive species loss and degradation of ecosystems services.",

Despite more than a decade of effort and thousands of dedicated researchers, the hand-crafted and parameterized statistical models used for variant calling still produce thousands of errors and missed variants in each genome3,4. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network5 can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships (likelihoods) between images of read pileups around putative variant sites and ground-truth genotype calls. This approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing tools, even winning the \\\"highest performance\\\" award for SNPs in a FDA-administered variant calling challenge. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other mammalian species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes. DeepVariant represents a significant step from expert-driven statistical modeling towards more automatic deep learning approaches for developing software to interpret biological instrumentation data.",

    "abstract": "Some natural clays and synthetic nanofibres present in the environment have a severe impact on human health. After several decades of research, the molecular mechanism of how asbestos induce cancers is not well understood. Different fibres, including asbestos, can penetrate the membrane and introduce DNA in both, bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Incubating Escherichia coli with sepiolite, a clayey material, and asbestos under friction forces, both fibres cause double-strand breaks in bacteria. Since antibiotics and clays are used together in animal husbandry, the mutagenic effect of these fibres might constitute a pathway to antibiotic resistance due to the friction provided by peristalsis of the gut from farm animals in addition to the previously proposed horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, we raise the possibility that the same mechanism could generate bacteria diversity in natural scenarios with a role in the evolution of species. Finally, we provide a new model on how asbestos may promote mutagenesis and cancer based on the observed mechanical genotoxicity.",

Here, we recorded from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) while monkeys reached to randomly placed targets.

PMd, but not M1, neurons had increased activity when the monkeys hand position made it likely the upcoming movement would be in the neurons preferred directions.

    "abstract": "Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe human microbiome, the collection of microbial communities that colonize the human body, is a crucial component to health and disease. Two major components of the human microbiome are the bacterial and viral communities. These communities have primarily been studied separately using metrics of community composition and diversity. These approaches have failed to capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and phage communities, which frequently share genetic information and work together to maintain ecosystem homestatsis (e.g. kill-the-winner dynamics). Removal of bacteria or phage can disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems. Relationship-based network approaches allow us to capture this interaction information. Using this network-based approach with three independent human cohorts, we were able to present an initial understanding of how phage-bacteria networks differ throughout the human body, so as to provide a baseline for future studies of how and why microbiome networks differ in disease states.",

    "abstract": "1.Throughout their lifetime cells are subject to extrinsic and intrinsic mutational processes leaving behind characteristic signatures in the genome. One of these, DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency leads to hypermutation and is found in different cancer types. While it is possible to associate mutational signatures extracted from human cancers with possible mutational processes the exact causation is often unknown. Here we use C. elegans genome sequencing of pms-2 and mlh-1 knockouts to reveal the mutational patterns linked to C. elegans MMR deficiency and their dependency on endogenous replication errors and errors caused by deletion of the polymerase {varepsilon} subunit pole-4. Signature extraction from 215 human colorectal and 289 gastric adenocarcinomas revealed three MMR-associated signatures one of which closely resembles the C. elegans MMR spectrum. A characteristic difference between human and worm MMR deficiency is the lack of elevated levels of NCG>NTG mutations in C. elegans, likely caused by the absence of cytosine (CpG) methylation in worms. The other two human MMR signatures may reflect the interaction between MMR deficiency and other mutagenic processes, but their exact cause remains unknown. In summary, combining information from genetically defined models and cancer samples allows for better aligning mutational signatures to causal mutagenic processes.",

One goal is to account for the distributions of proteins from single-cell measurements by flow cytometry or mass cytometry as a readout of biological regulation. In that context, large cell-to-cell variability is often observed in biological quantities. We show here that these readouts, viewed in logarithmic scale may result in two easily-distinguishable modes, while the underlying distribution (in linear scale) is unimodal. We introduce a simple mathematical test to highlight this mismatch. We then dissect the flow of influence of cell-to-cell variability proposing a graphical model which motivates higher-dimensional analysis of the data. Finally we show how acquiring additional biological information can be used to reduce uncertainty introduced by cell-to-cell variability, helping to clarify whether the data is uni- or bimodal.

The ability to manipulate plant methylomes to generate populations of epigenetically distinct individuals could provide invaluable resources for breeding and research purposes. Here we describe \\\"epimutagenesis\\\", a novel method to rapidly generate variation of DNA methylation through random demethylation of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. This method involves the expression of a human Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme, and results in widespread hypomethylation that can be inherited to subsequent generations, mimicking mutants in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase met1. Application of TET-mediated epimutagenesis to agriculturally significant plants may result in differential expression of alleles normally silenced by DNA methylation, uncovering previously hidden phenotypic variations.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of corticocortical signaling is needed to understand and model information processing in cerebral networks. However, higher-order pathways, hodologically remote from sensory input, are not amenable to spatiotemporally precise activation by sensory stimuli. Here, we combined parametric channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) photostimulation with multi-unit electrophysiology to study corticocortical driving in a parietofrontal pathway from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to posterior secondary motor cortex (M2) in mice in vivo. Ketamine anesthesia was used both to eliminate complex activity associated with the awake state and to enable stable recordings of responses over a wide range of stimulus parameters. Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing neurons in RSC, the upstream area, produced local activity that decayed quickly. This activity in turn drove downstream activity in M2 that arrived rapidly (5-10 ms latencies), and scaled in amplitude across a wide range of stimulus parameters as an approximately constant fraction (~0.2) of the upstream activity. A model-based analysis could explain the corticocortically driven activity with exponentially decaying kernels (~20 ms time constant) and small delay. Reverse (antidromic) driving was similarly robust. The results show that corticocortical signaling in this pathway drives downstream activity rapidly and scalably, in a mostly linear manner. These properties, identified in anesthetized mice and represented in a simple model, suggest a robust basis for supporting complex non-linear dynamic activity in corticocortical circuits in the awake state.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe signaling properties of corticocortical connections are not well understood, particularly for higher-order inter-areal pathways. Here, we developed a paradigm based on parametric optogenetic photostimulation, linear-array electrophysiology, and mathematical modeling to characterize signaling along corticortical connections linking retrosplenial cortex to posterior secondary motor cortex (M2) in anesthetized mice. The results indicate that corticocortically driven activity in the downstream area followed the optogenetically evoked upstream activity in a rapid and scalable manner, and could be described with a simple linear integrator model. These findings suggest that this pathway, when activated selectively in the unconscious state, supports intrinsically linear inter-areal communication.",

    "abstract": "Natural populations often grow, shrink, and migrate over time. Demographic processes such as these can impact genome-wide levels of genetic diversity. In addition, genetic variation in functional regions of the genome can be altered by natural selection, which drives adaptive mutations to higher frequencies or purges deleterious ones. Such selective processes impact not only the sites directly under selection but also nearby neutral variation through genetic linkage through processes referred to as genetic hitch-hiking in the context of positive selection and background selection (BGS) in the context of purifying selection. While there is extensive literature examining the impact of selection at linked sites at demographic equilibrium, less is known about how non-equilibrium demographic processes impact the effects of hitchhiking and BGS. Utilizing a global sample of human whole-genome sequences from the Thousand Genomes Project and extensive simulations, we investigate how non-equilibrium demographic processes magnify and dampen the consequences of selection at linked sites across the human genome. When binning the genome by inferred strength of BGS, we observe that, compared to Africans, non-African populations have experienced larger proportional decreases in neutral genetic diversity in such regions. We replicate these findings in admixed populations by showing that non-African ancestral components of the genome have also been impacted more severely in these regions. We attribute these differences to the strong, sustained/recurrent population bottlenecks that non-Africans experienced as they migrated out of Africa and throughout the globe. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between FST and inferred strength of BGS, suggesting a stronger rate of genetic drift. Forward simulations of human demographic history with a model of BGS support these observations. Our results show that non-equilibrium demography significantly alters the consequences selection at linked sites and support the need for more work investigating the dynamic process of multiple evolutionary forces operating in concert.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPatterns of genetic diversity within a species are affected at broad and fine scales by population size changes (\\\"demography\\\") and natural selection. From both population genetics theory and observation of genomic sequence data, it is known that demography can alter genome-wide average neutral genetic diversity. Additionally, natural selection can affect neutral genetic diversity regionally across the genome via selection at linked sites. During this process, natural selection acting on adaptive or deleterious variants in the genome will also impact diversity at nearby neutral sites due to genetic linkage. However, less is well known about the dynamic changes to diversity that occur in regions impacted by selection at linked sites when a population undergoes a size change. We characterize these dynamic changes using thousands of human genomes and find that the population size changes experienced by humans have shaped the consequences of linked selection across the genome. In particular, population contractions, such as those experienced by non-Africans, have disproportionately decreased neutral diversity in regions of the genome inferred to be under strong background selection (i.e., selection at linked sites that is caused by natural selection acting on deleterious variants), resulting in large differences between African and non-African populations.",

The modulation effect was localized to the prefrontal cortices, the globus pallidus, and an interoceptive network including the right anterior insula (RAI) and anterior cingulate cortex (RACC). Importantly, our Granger causality analysis provides the first evidence for increased causal flow of heartbeat information from the RAI to the RACC during sad face perception. Moreover, this HEP modulation effect was neither an artefact nor an effect of visual-evoked potentials. These findings provide important progress in the understanding of brain-body interactions during emotion processing.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the negative effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bees in environment surrounding areas of pesticide use. The aim of the experiment is to identify possible contributors to the sudden decrease in honey bee population over the past 60 years, a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder. Analysis was performed on three sets of bees: the control group which was not in contact with pesticides, the infected dead group which was a set of bees suspected to have died due to neonicotinoids, and the infected alive group which was suspected to be under the influence of neonicotinoids. After dissecting the bee samples and extracting their fat bodies, the chemical composition and protein structures of the samples were analyzed using Mid-Infrared Beamline at the Canadian Light Source. Results from the spectra of bee samples exposed to neonicotinoids demonstrated possible residual pesticide chemicals within fat bodies. Several spectral peaks were also correlated with a possible change in protein secondary structures from primarily {beta}-sheet to -helix within fat bodies of neonicotinoid-affected bees. It is likely that the pesticides caused the growth of additional -helical structures, which is consistent with consequences of the inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) a current pathway of harm of Colony Collapse Disorder as identified in past literature.",

In contrast to what happens in natural situations, experimental studies of developmental plasticity typically use environmental factors held constant during development, precluding assessment of potential environment-by-environment interaction effects.\\n\\nResultsWe tested effects of circadian fluctuations in temperature on a series of thermally plastic traits in a model of adaptive seasonal plasticity, the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Comparing phenotypes from individuals reared under two types of fluctuations (warmer days with cooler nights, and cooler days with warmer nights) and those reared under a constant temperature of the same daily average allowed us to identify complex patterns of response to day and night temperatures. We found evidence of additive-like effects (for body size), but also different types of \\\"dominance\\\"-type effects where one particular period of the light cycle (for development time) or one particular extreme temperature (for eyespot size) had a relatively larger contribution to phenotype expression. We also gathered evidence against the hypothesis that thermal plasticity in development time drives thermal plasticity in other traits.\\n\\nConclusionsCombined effects of fluctuating day and night temperatures include additive-like effects as well as different types of environmental-dominance interaction effects. Differences between plastic traits reveal independent responses to temperature, and possible independent assessment of temperature conditions.

This means that the demand for mitochondrial supply is changing in space and time in neurons. Since the architecture ultimately determines the output performance of these organelles, we hypothesized that the ultrastructure of axonal mitochondria could well be a major parameter of adjusting their performance to the actual energetic needs of the synapse. Our results - describing a cell-type independent and synapse-specific correlation between mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial molecular fingerprints and synaptic performance - highlight the importance of activity-dependent ultrastructural plasticity of these organelles in neurons, and suggest an even more prominent role for mitochondria in neuroplasticity, than it was thought previously.\\n\\nABSTRACTMitochondrial function in neurons is tightly linked with metabolic and signalling mechanisms that ultimately determine neuronal performance. The subcellular distribution of these organelles is dynamically regulated as they are directed to axonal release sites on demand, but whether mitochondrial internal ultrastructure and molecular properties would reflect the actual performance requirements in a synapse-specific manner, remains to be established. Here, we examined performance-determining ultrastructural features of presynaptic mitochondria in GABAergic and glutamatergic axons of mice and human. Using electron-tomography and super-resolution microscopy we found, that these features were coupled to synaptic strength: mitochondria in boutons with high synaptic activity exhibited an ultrastructure optimized for high rate metabolism and contained higher levels of the respiratory chain protein cytochrome-c than mitochondria in boutons with lower activity. The strong, cell-type independent correlation between mitochondrial ultrastructure, molecular fingerprints and synaptic performance suggests that changes in synaptic activity could trigger ultrastructural plasticity of presynaptic mitochondria, likely to adjust their performance to the actual metabolic demand.",

Population-based studies suggest a marked decline in incidence, prevalence and deaths, mostly likely due to treatment expansion, in countries in East and Southern Africa. This calls into question the ART efficacy, effectiveness and coverage parameters used by many modelers to project HIV incidence and prevalence.\\n\\nMethodsFor 2015 and 2016 we reviewed global and national mathematical modeling studies regarding ART impact (with or without other HIV prevention interventions) and/or 90-90-90 on either new HIV infections or investment or both. We reviewed these HIV epidemiologic and costing models for their structure and parameterization around ART; we directly compared two models to illustrate differences in outcome.\\n\\nResultsThe nine models published in 2015 or 2016 included parameters for ART effectiveness ranging from 20% to 86% for ART effectiveness. Model 1 limits eligibility for ART initiation to 80% coverage of people living with HIV and with a CD4+ cell count below 350 cells/L, 70% retention, and ART reduces transmission by 80%, with a derived ART effectiveness of 20%. Model 2 assumes 90-90-90 by 2020 (i.e., 73% viral suppression of estimated PLHIV), ART reduces transmission by 96% in those on ART and virally suppressed, and by 88% in those on ART but not virally suppressed with a derived effectiveness of 86% and consequent decline towards ending AIDS and HIV elimination. ART parameter selection and assumptions dominate and low ART effectiveness translates into lower impact.\\n\\nDiscussionUsing more realistic parameters for ART effectiveness suggests that through expanding access and supporting sustainable viral suppression it will be possible to significantly reduce transmission and eliminate HIV in many settings.",

Finally, unlike previous observations in OSNs, ATF5 was found to be widespread in the mature VNO and co-expressed with mature VSN markers.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest that the initiation of ATF5 translation in VSNs and OSNs is under similar regulation, and that persistent/prolonged ATF5 translation in VSNs may serve VSN-specific gene regulatory programs.

    "abstract": "A deeper understanding of inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity is a critical factor for the advancement of next generation strategies against cancer. The heterogeneous morphology exhibited by solid tumors is mirrored by their metabolic heterogeneity. Defining the basic biological mechanisms that underlie tumor cell variability will be fundamental to the development of personalized cancer treatments. Variability in the molecular signatures found in local regions of cancer tissues can be captured through an untargeted analysis of their metabolic constituents. Here we demonstrate that DESI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) combined with network analysis can provide detailed insight into the metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC). We show that network modules capture signatures which differentiate tumor metabolism in the core and in the surrounding region. Moreover, module preservation analysis of network modules between patients with and without metastatic recurrence explains the inter-subject metabolic differences associated with diverse clinical outcomes such as metastatic recurrence.\\n\\nSignificanceNetwork analysis of DESI-MSI data from CRC human tissue reveals clinically relevant co-expression ion patterns associated with metastatic susceptibility. This delineates a more complex picture of tumor heterogeneity than conventional hard segmentation algorithms. Using tissue sections from central regions and at a distance from the tumor center, ion co-expression patterns reveal common features among patients who developed metastases (up of > 5 years) not preserved in patients who did not develop metastases. This offers insight into the nature of the complex molecular interactions associated with cancer recurrence. Presently, predicting CRC relapse is challenging, and histopathologically like-for-like cancers frequently manifest widely varying metastatic tendencies. Thus, the methodology introduced here more robustly defines the risk of metastases based on tumor biochemical heterogeneity.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsP.I., Z.T., R.C.G.: designed the study, developed the workflow, analyzed the data, interpreted the results, wrote the paper; N.S. collected the MS, performed the H...E staining, wrote the paper; L.D.: interpreted the results, wrote the paper; A.M.: collected the MS; A.S.: histological assessment; L.P.: collected the tissue specimens and clinical metadata; A.D.: collected the MS; H.K.: performed the H...E staining; R.M.: collected the tissue specimens and clinical metadata.

    "abstract": "Large-scale population based analyses coupled with advances in technology have demonstrated that the human genome is more diverse than originally thought. To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short read whole genome sequencing. However, standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the advantages of short reads. Starting from only [~]1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as  Linked-Reads. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes (Weisenfeld et al. 2017). In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short read approaches for reference based analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN1 and SMN2. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerge as important regulators of various biological processes. Many lncRNAs with tumor-suppressor or oncogenic functions in cancer have been discovered. While many studies have exploited public resources such as RNA-Seq data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to study lncRNAs in cancer, it is crucial to choose the optimal method for accurate expression quantification of lncRNAs. In this benchmarking study, we compared the performance of pseudoalignment methods Kallisto and Salmon, and alignment-based methods HTSeq, featureCounts, and RSEM, in lncRNA quantification, by applying them to a simulated RNA-Seq dataset and a pan-cancer RNA-Seq dataset from TCGA. We observed that full transcriptome annotation, including both protein coding and noncoding RNAs, greatly improves the specificity of lncRNA expression quantification. Pseudoalignment-based methods detect more lncRNAs than alignment-based methods and correlate highly with simulated ground truth. On the contrary, alignment-based methods tend to underestimate lncRNA expression or even fail to capture lncRNA signal in the ground truth. These underestimated genes include cancer-relevant lncRNAs such as TERC and ZEB2-AS1. Overall, 10-16% of lncRNAs can be detected in the samples, with antisense and lincRNAs the two most abundant categories. A higher proportion of antisense RNAs are detected than lincRNAs. Moreover, among the expressed lncRNAs, more antisense RNAs are discordant from ground truth than lincRNAs when measured by alignment-based methods, indicating that antisense RNAs are more susceptible to mis-quantification. In addition, the lncRNAs with fewer transcripts, less than three exons, and lower sequence uniqueness tend to be more discordant. In summary, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto or Salmon in combination with the full transcriptome annotation is our recommended strategy for RNA-Seq analysis for lncRNAs.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerge as important regulators of various biological processes. Our benchmarking work on both simulated RNA-Seq dataset and pan-cancer dataset provides timely and useful recommendations for wide research community who are studying lncRNAs, especially for those who are exploring public resources such as TCGA RNA-Seq data. We demonstrate that using full transcriptome annotation in RNA-Seq analysis is strongly recommended as it greatly improves the specificity of lncRNA quantification. Whats more, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto and Salmon outperform alignment-based methods in lncRNA quantification. It is worth noting that the default workflow for TCGA RNA-Seq data stored in Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal uses HTSeq, an alignment-based method. Thus, reanalyzing the data might be considered when checking gene expression in TCGA datasets. In summary, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto or Salmon in combination with full transcriptome annotation is our recommended strategy for RNA-Seq analysis for lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Combining anti-cancer drugs has the potential to increase treatment efficacy. Because patient responses to drug combinations are highly variable, predictive biomarkers of synergy are required to identify which patients are likely to benefit from a drug combination. To aid biomarker identification, the DREAM challenge consortium has recently released data from a screen containing 85 cell lines and 167 drug combinations. The main challenge of these data is the low sample size: per drug combination, a median of 14 cell lines have been screened. We found that widely used methods in single drug response prediction, such as Elastic Net regression per drug, are not predictive in this setting. Instead, we propose to use multi-task learning: training a single model simultaneously on all drug combinations, which we show results in increased predictive performance. In contrast to other multi-task learning approaches, our approach allows for the identification of biomarkers, by using a modified random forest variable importance score, which we illustrate using artificial data and the DREAM challenge data. Notably, we find that mutations in MYO15A are associated with synergy between ALK / IGFR dual inhibitors and PI3K pathway inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCombining drugs is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, it is often not known which patients will benefit from a particular drug combination. To identify patients that are likely to benefit, we need to identify biomarkers, such as mutations in the tumors DNA, that are associated with favorable response to the drug combination. In this work, we identified such biomarkers using the drug combination data released by the DREAM challenge consortium, which contain 85 tumor cell lines and 167 drug combinations. The main challenge of these data is the extremely low sample size: a median of 14 cell lines have been screened per drug combination. We found that traditional methods to identify biomarkers for monotherapy response, which analyze each drug separately, are not suitable in this low sample size setting. Instead, we used a technique called multi-task learning to jointly analyze all drug combinations in a single statistical model. In contrast to existing multi-task learning algorithms, which are black-box methods, our method allows for the identification of biomarkers. Notably, we find that, in a subset of breast cancer cell lines, MYO15A mutations associate with response to the combination of ALK / IGFR dual inhibitors and PI3K pathway inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "In the face of the biodiversity crisis, it is argued that we should prioritize species in order to capture high functional diversity (FD). Because species traits often reflect shared evolutionary history, many researchers have advocated for a \\\"phylogenetic gambit\\\": maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD) should indirectly capture FD. For the first time, we empirically test this gambit using data from >15,000 vertebrate species and ecologically-relevant traits. Maximizing PD results in an average gain of 18% of FD relative to random choice. However, this average gain hides the fact that in over 1/3 of the comparisons, maximum PD sets contain less FD than randomly chosen sets of species. These results suggest that, while maximizing PD protection can help to protect FD, it represents a risky strategy.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipFM, MP, MC, SD, GVDR, RG, AOM, CT and WP conceived the design of the study.

    "abstract": "GABA is a robust regulator of both developing and mature neural networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABAA receptors, which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19 different GABAA subunit types, which are divided into the , {beta}, {gamma}, {delta}, {varepsilon}, {pi}, {theta} and {rho} subfamilies. The immense diversity of GABAA receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA. Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABAA receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian {theta} and {varepsilon} subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while five mammalian GABAA subunits have two zebrafish orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, {beta}4, which does not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABAA receptors, the zebrafish  subfamily is the largest and most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight  subunits, and RNA in situ hybridization across early zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific expression patterns were similar between zebrafish, frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different GABAA receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates. This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABAA receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABAA receptors.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPObjective. Currently, a challenge in electrical stimulation of the retina is to excite only the cells lying directly under the electrode in the ganglion cell layer, while avoiding excitation of the axons that pass over the surface of the retina in the nerve fiber layer. Since these passing fibers may originate from distant regions of the ganglion cell layer. Stimulation of both target retinal ganglion cells and overlying axons results in irregular visual percepts, significantly limiting perceptual efficacy. This research explores how differences in fiber orientation between the nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer leads to differences in the activation of the axon initial segment and axons of passage. Approach. Axons of passage of retinal ganglion cells in the nerve fiber layer are characterized by a narrow distribution of fiber orientations, causing highly anisotropic spread of applied current. In contrast, proximal axons in the ganglion cell layer have a wider distribution of orientations. A four-layer computational model of epiretinal extracellular stimulation that captures the effect of neurite orientation in anisotropic tissue has been developed using a modified version of the standard volume conductor model, known as the cellular composite model. Simulations are conducted to investigate the interaction of neural tissue orientation, stimulating electrode configuration, and stimulation pulse duration and amplitude. Main results. The dependence of fiber activation on the anisotropic nature of the nerve fiber layer is first established. Via a comprehensive search of key parameters, our model shows that the simultaneous stimulation with multiple electrodes aligned with the nerve fiber layer can be used to achieve selective activation of axon initial segments rather than passing fibers. This result can be achieved with only a slight increase in total stimulus current and modest increases in the spread of activation in the ganglion cell layer, and is shown to extend to the general case of arbitrary electrode array positioning and arbitrary target neural volume. Significance. These results elucidate a strategy for more targeted stimulation of retinal ganglion cells with experimentally-relevant multi-electrode geometries and readily achievable stimulation requirements.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative understanding of the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions is essential for accurately modeling metabolism. The group contribution method (GCM) is one of the most widely used approaches to estimating standard Gibbs energies and redox potentials of reactions for which no experimental measurements exist. Previous work has shown that quantum chemical predictions of biochemical thermodynamics are a promising approach to overcome the limitations of GCM. However, the quantum chemistry approach is significantly more expensive. Here we use a combination of quantum chemistry and machine learning to obtain a fast and accurate method for predicting the thermodynamics of biochemical redox reactions. We focus on predicting the redox potentials of carbonyl functional group reductions to alcohols and amines, two of the most ubiquitous carbon redox transformations in biology. Our method relies on semi-empirical quantum chemistry calculations calibrated with Gaussian Process (GP) regression against available experimental data. Our approach results in higher predictive power than the GCM at a low computational cost. We design and implement a network expansion algorithm that iteratively reduces and oxidizes a set of natural seed metabolites, and demonstrate the high-throughput applicability of our method by predicting the standard potentials of more than 315,000 redox reactions involving approximately 70,000 compounds. Additionally, we developed a novel fingerprint-based framework for detecting molecular environment motifs that are enriched or depleted across different regions of the redox potential landscape.

Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern during stress and disease correlates with increased fat mass and obesity in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics affect the process of adipocyte differentiation. By using live, single-cell imaging of the key adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system, leading to very low adipocyte differentiation rates. In striking contrast, equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushings disease, and other conditions for which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility can lead to obesity. Given the ubiquitous nature of oscillating hormone secretion in mammals, the filtering mechanism we uncovered may represent a general temporal control principle for differentiation.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTO_LIWe found that the fraction of differentiated cells is controlled by rhythmic and pulsatile hormone stimulus patterns.\\nC_LIO_LITwelve hours is the cutoff point for daily hormone pulse durations below which cells fail to differentiate, arguing for a circadian code for hormone-induced cell differentiation.\\nC_LIO_LIIn addition to fast positive feedback such as between PPARG and CEBPA, the adipogenic transcriptional architecture requires added parallel slow positive feedback to mediate temporal filtering of circadian oscillatory inputs\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the legs epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments",

    "abstract": "Endometrial or uterine glands secrete substances essential for uterine receptivity to the embryo, implantation, conceptus survival, development, and growth. Adenogenesis is the process of gland formation within the stroma of the uterus that occurs after birth. In the mouse, uterine gland formation initiates at postnatal day (P) 5. Subsequently, the developing uterine glands invade into the adjacent stroma. Mouse uterine gland morphology is poorly understood because it is based on two-dimensional (2D) histological observations. To more fully describe uterine gland morphogenesis, we generated three-dimensional (3D) models of postnatal uterine glands from P0 to P21, using light sheet microscopy. At birth (P0), there were no glands. At P8, we found bud- and teardrop-shaped epithelial invaginations. By P11, the forming glands were elongated epithelial tubes. By P21, the elongated tubes had a sinuous morphology. These morphologies are homogeneously distributed along the anterior-posterior axis of the uterus. To facilitate uterine gland analyses, we propose a novel 3D staging system of uterine gland morphology during postnatal development in the mouse. We define 6 stages: Stage 0: Aglandular, Stage 1: Bud, Stage 2: Teardrop, Stage 3: Elongated, Stage 4: Sinuous, and Stage 5: Primary Branches. This staging system provides a standardized key to assess and quantify uterine gland morphology that can be used for studies of uterine gland development and pathology. In addition, our studies suggest that gland formation initiation occurs during P8 and P11. However, between P11 and P21 gland formation initiation stops and all glands elongate and become sinuous.",

    "abstract": "Adult skeletal muscle tissue harbors the capacity for self-repair due to the presence of tissue resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Advances in the area of prospective MuSC isolation demonstrated the potential of cell transplantation therapy as a regenerative medicine strategy to restore strength and long-term regenerative capacity to aged, injured, or diseased skeletal muscle tissue. However, cell loss during ejection, limits to post-injection proliferation, and poor donor cell dispersion distal to the injection site are amongst hurdles to overcome to maximize MuSC transplant impact. Here, we assess a physical blend of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC) as a bioactive, shear thinning hydrogel cell delivery system to improve MuSC transplantation efficiency. Using in vivo transplantation studies, we found that the HAMC delivery system results in a >45% increase in the number of donor-derived fibers as compared to saline delivery. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in donor fiber dispersion when transplanted MuSCs were delivered in the HAMC hydrogel. Studies to assess primary myoblast and MuSC viability in HAMC culture revealed no differences compared to the media control even when the cells were first ejected through a syringe and needle or exposed to regenerating skeletal muscle extract to mimic the transplantation procedure. However, when we quantified absolute numbers, we found that more cells pass through the syringe and needle when delivered in HAMC. Culture in HAMC also increased the proportion of MuSCs in cell cycle, via a CD44-independent mechanism. An effect on myoblast proliferation was not observed, suggesting a hierarchical effect. Finally, a series of transplant studies indicated that HAMC delivery does not influence passive cell clearance or alter the host immune response, but instead may serve to support in vivo expansion by delaying differentiation following transplant. Therefore, we conclude that MuSC engraftment efficacy is improved by delivering the therapeutic cell population within HAMC.",

Defective chromocenter formation leads to micronuclei formation due to budding off of interphase nucleus and cell death. We propose that chromocenter and satellite DNA serves a fundamental role to achieve the universal characteristic of eukaryotic cells: full complement of the genome within a single nucleus.",

Comparisons of virus genomes using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform allowed us to phase SNVs within large gene copy arrays for the first time, and uncovered a mechanism of adaptive SNV homogenization reminiscent of gene conversion, which is actively driven by selection. Our work reveals a new mechanism for the fluid gain of beneficial mutations in genetic regions undergoing active recombination in viruses, and illustrates the value of long read sequencing technologies for investigating complex genome dynamics in diverse biological systems.",

We analyze response time data from an on-line repository of 15 million blitz chess games, and show that our model fits not just the mean and variance, but the entire response time distribution (over several response-time orders of magnitude) at every stage of the game. We apply the model to show that (a) higher cognitive expertise corresponds to the exploration of more complex solution spaces, and (b) reaction times of users at an on-line buying website can be similarly explained. Our model can be seen as a synergy between diffusion models used to model simple two-choice decision-making and planning agents in complex problem solving.",

Hence, accurately quantifying the thermodynamics of redox reactions should reveal key design principles that shape cellular metabolism. However, only a limited number of redox potentials have been measured experimentally, and mostly with inconsistent, poorly-reported experimental setups. Here, we develop a quantum chemistry approach for the calculation of redox potentials of biochemical reactions. We demonstrate that our method predicts experimentally measured potentials with unparalleled accuracy. We calculate the reduction potentials of all redox pairs that can be generated from biochemically relevant compounds and highlight fundamental thermodynamic trends that define cellular redox biochemistry. We further use the calculated potentials to address the question of why NAD/NADP are used as the primary cellular electron carriers, demonstrating how their physiological redox range specifically fits the reactions of central metabolism and minimizes the concentration of reactive carbonyls. The use of quantum chemistry tools, as demonstrated in this study, can revolutionize our understanding of key biochemical phenomena by enabling fast and accurate calculation of large datasets of thermodynamic values.",

A well characterized RNA aptamer, i. e., knowing its Kd and adaptive structural features, is an essential ingredient of the described design process. We exemplify the principles using the well-known theophylline aptamer throughout this work. The aptamer in its ligand-binding competent structure represents one structural conformation of the switch while an alternative fold that disrupts the binding-competent structure forms the other conformation. To keep it simple we do not incorporate any regulatory mechanism to control transcription or translation. We elucidate a commonly used design process by explicitly dissecting and explaining the necessary steps in detail. We developed a novel objective function which specifies the mechanistics of this simple, ligand-triggered riboswitch and describe an extensive in silico analysis pipeline to evaluate important kinetic properties of the designed sequences. This protocol and the developed software can be easily extended or adapted to fit novel design scenarios and thus can serve as a template for future needs.",

It is a DNA binding protein that recognizes a specific 17-nt sequence present in the centromeric alphoid satellite repeats. CENP-B importance for centromere stability has only been revealed recently. In addition to its DNA binding properties, CENP-B interacts with the histone H3 variant CENP-A and CENP-C. These interactions confer a mechanical strength to the kinetochore that enables accurate sister chromatids segregation to avoid aneuploidy. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate CENP-B stability at the centromere is a major unresolved issue for the comprehension of centromere function. In this study, we demonstrate that lysine K402 of CENP-B is a substrate for SUMO post-translational modifications. We show that K402 regulates CENP-B stability at centromeres through a SUMOylation/ubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent degradation mechanism involving the SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin E3 Ligase RNF4/SNURF. Our study describes SUMOylation of CENP-B as a major post-translational modification involved in centromere dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Genes orthologous to the 30K-superfamily of movement proteins (MP) from plant viruses have been recently discovered by bioinformatics analyses as integrated elements in the genome of most vascular plants. However, their functional relevance for plants is still unclear. Here, we undertake some preliminary steps into the functional characterization of one of these putative MP genes found in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the AtMP gene is expressed at different stages of the plant development, with accumulation being highest in flowers but lowest in mature siliques. We also found down-regulation of the gene may result in a small delay in plant development and in an exacerbation of the negative effect of salinity in germination efficiency. We have also explored whether changes in expression of the endogenous AtMP have any effect on susceptibility to infection with several viruses, and found that the infectivity of tobacco rattle tobravirus was strongly dependent on the expression of the endogenous AtMP. Finally, we have cloned the endogenous MP from four different plant species into an expression vector that allows for specifically assessing their activity as cell-to-cell movement proteins and have shown that though some may still retain the ancestral activity, they do so in a quite inefficient manner, thus suggesting they have acquired a novel function during adaptation to the host genome.",

The PacBio protocol for preparation of sequencing templates employs blunt-end hairpin adapter ligation, which enables a short turnaround time for sequence production. However, we have found a significant portion of sequencing yield contains chimeric reads resulting from blunt-end ligation of multiple template molecules to each other prior to adapter ligation. These artefactual fusion DNA sequences pose a major challenge to analysis and can lead to false-positive detection of fusion events. We assessed the frequency of artefactual fusion when using blunt-end adapter ligation and compared it to an alternative method using A/T overhang adapter ligation.

Analysis of {small tilde}27M variants ({small tilde}21M with minor allele frequency [MAF]<5%), identified 243 genome-wide significant loci (p<5x10-8; MAF 0.02%-50%; odds ratio [OR] 1.04-8.05), 135 not previously-implicated in T2D-predisposition. Conditional analyses revealed 160 additional distinct association signals (p<10-5) within the identified loci. The combined set of 403 T2D-risk signals includes 56 low-frequency (0.5%[&le;]MAF<5%) and 24 rare (MAF<0.5%) index SNPs at 60 loci, including 14 with estimated allelic OR>2. Forty-one of the signals displayed effect-size heterogeneity between BMI-unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Increased sample size and improved imputation led to substantially more precise localisation of causal variants than previously attained: at 51 signals, the lead variant after fine-mapping accounted for >80% posterior probability of association (PPA) and at 18 of these, PPA exceeded 99%. Integration with islet regulatory annotations enriched for T2D association further reduced median credible set size (from 42 variants to 32) and extended the number of index variants with PPA>80% to 73. Although most signals mapped to regulatory sequence, we identified 18 genes as human validated therapeutic targets through coding variants that are causal for disease. Genome wide chip heritability accounted for 18% of T2D-risk, and individuals in the 2.5% extremes of a polygenic risk score generated from the GWAS data differed >9-fold in risk. Our observations highlight how increases in sample size and variant diversity deliver enhanced discovery and single-variant resolution of causal T2D-risk alleles, and the consequent impact on mechanistic insights and clinical translation.",

CYP703 and GPAT3, two genes critical to male flower development in other monocots, appear fully deleted in females while maintained as single copy in males.

    "abstract": "Measurements of the carbon stable isotope ratio ({delta}13C) are widely used in biology to address major questions regarding food sources and metabolic pathways used by organisms. Measurement of these so called stable carbon isotope fingerprints (SIFs) for microbes involved in biogeochemical cycling and microbiota of plants and animals have led to major discoveries in environmental microbiology. Currently, obtaining SIFs for microbial communities is challenging as the available methods either only provide limited taxonomic resolution, such as with the use of lipid biomarkers, or are limited in throughput, such as NanoSIMS imaging of single cells.\\n\\nHere we present \\\"direct Protein-SIF\\\" and the Calis-p software package (https://sourceforge.net/projects/calis-p/), which enable high-throughput measurements of accurate {delta}13C values for individual species within a microbial community. We benchmark the method using 20 pure culture microorganisms and show that the method reproducibly provides SIF values consistent with gold standard bulk measurements performed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Using mock community samples, we show that SIF values can also be obtained for individual species within a microbial community. Finally, a case study of an obligate bacteria-animal symbiosis showed that direct Protein-SIF confirms previous physiological hypotheses and can provide unexpected new insights into the symbionts metabolism. This confirms the usefulness of this new approach to accurately determine {delta}13C values for different species in microbial community samples.\\n\\nSignificanceTo understand the roles that microorganisms play in diverse environments such as the open ocean and the human intestinal tract, we need an understanding of their metabolism and physiology. A variety of methods such as metagenomics and metaproteomics exist to assess the metabolism of environmental microorganisms based on gene content and gene expression. These methods often only provide indirect evidence for which substrates are used by a microorganism in a community. The direct Protein-SIF method that we developed allows linking microbial species in communities to the environmental carbon sources they consume by determining their stable carbon isotope signature. Direct Protein-SIF also allows assessing which carbon fixation pathway is used by autotrophic microorganisms that directly assimilate CO2.",

Under laboratory conditions, V. cholerae uses the T6SS to outcompete many Gram-negative species, including other V. cholerae strains and human commensal bacteria. However, the role of these interactions has not been resolved in an in-vivo setting. We used the Drosophila melanogaster model of cholera to define the contribution of the T6SS to V. cholerae pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that interactions between the T6SS and host commensals impact pathogenesis. Inactivation of the T6SS, or removal of commensal bacteria attenuates disease severity. Re-introduction of the Gram-negative commensal bacterium Acetobacter pasteurianus into a germ-free host is sufficient to restore T6SS-dependent pathogenesis. Together, our data demonstrate that the T6SS acts on commensal bacteria to promote the pathogenesis of V. cholerae.",

    "abstract": "Movement in Parkinsons disease (PD) is fragmented, and the patients depend on visual information in their behavior. This suggests that the patients may have deficits in internally monitoring their own movements. Internal monitoring of movements is assumed to rely on corollary discharge signals that enable the brain to predict the sensory consequences of actions. We studied early-stage PD patients (N=14), and age-matched healthy control participants (N=14) to examine whether PD patients reveal deficits in updating their sensory representations after eye movements. The participants performed a double-saccade task where, in order to accurately fixate a second target, the participant must correct for the displacement caused by the first saccade. In line with previous reports, the patients had difficulties in fixating the second target when the eye movement was performed without visual guidance. Furthermore, the patients had difficulties in taking into account the error in the first saccade when making a saccade towards the second target, especially when eye movements were made towards the side with dominant motor symptoms. Across PD patients, the impairments in saccadic eye movements correlated with the integrity of the dopaminergic system as measured with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT: Patients with lower striatal (caudate, anterior putamen and posterior putamen) dopamine transporter binding made larger errors in saccades. This effect was strongest when patients made memory-guided saccades towards the second target. Our results provide tentative evidence that the motor deficits in PD may be partly accounted by deficits in internal monitoring of movements.",

    "abstract": "The central nucleus of the amygdala plays a significant role in alcohol use and other affective disorders; however, the genetically-defined neuronal subtypes and their projections that govern these behaviors are not well known. Here we show that neurotensin neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala of male mice are activated by in vivo ethanol consumption and that genetic ablation of these neurons decreases ethanol consumption and preference in non-ethanol dependent animals. This ablation did not impact preference for sucrose, saccharin, or quinine. We found that the most robust projection of the central amygdala neurotensin neurons was to the parabrachial nucleus, a brain region known to be important in feeding behaviors, conditioned taste aversion, and alarm. Optogenetic stimulation of projections from these neurons to the parabrachial nucleus is reinforcing, and increases ethanol drinking as well as consumption of sucrose and saccharin solutions. These data suggest that this central amygdala to parabrachial nucleus projection influences the expression of reward-related phenotypes and is a novel circuit promoting consumption of ethanol and palatable fluids.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation can contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity and regulation of gene expression. In most situations, DNA methylation patterns are inherited quite stably. However, changes in DNA methylation can occur at some loci as a result of tissue culture resulting in somaclonal variation. A sequence-capture bisulfite sequencing approach was implemented to monitor context-specific DNA methylation patterns in ~15Mb of the maize genome for a population of plants that had been regenerated from tissue culture. Plants that have been regenerated from tissue culture exhibit gains and losses of DNA methylation at a subset of genomic regions. There was evidence for a high rate of homozygous changes to DNA methylation levels that occur consistently in multiple independent tissue culture lines suggesting the existence of a targeted process for altering epigenetic state during tissue culture. The consistent changes induced by tissue culture include both gains and losses of DNA methylation and can affect CG, CHG or both contexts within a region. The majority of changes in DNA methylation exhibit stable inheritance although there is some evidence for stochastic reacquisition of the initial epigenetic state in some individuals. This study provides insights into the susceptibility of some loci and potential mechanisms that could contribute to altered DNA methylation and epigenetic state that occur during tissue culture in plant species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIxodes ricinus is the most important vector of tick-borne-diseases in Europe. A better knowledge of its genome and transcriptome is important for developing control strategies. Previous transcriptomic studies of I. ricinus have focused on gene expression during the blood meal in specific tissues. To obtain a broader picture of changes in gene expression during the blood meal, our study analysed the transcriptome at the level of the whole body for both nymphal and adult ticks. I. ricinus ticks from a highly inbred colony at the University of Neuchatel were used. We also analysed previously published RNAseq studies to compare the genetic variation between three wild strains and three lab strains, including the strain from Neuchatel.\\n\\nResultsRNA was extracted from whole tick bodies and the cDNA was sequenced, producing 162,872,698 paired-end reads. Our reference transcriptome contained 179,682 contigs, of which 31% were annotated using Trinotate. Gene expression was compared between ticks that differed with respect to stage (nymph, adult), sex (female, male), and feeding status (unfed, partially fed). We found that blood feeding in nymphs and female adult ticks increased the expression of cuticle-associated genes. Using a set of 5,422 single nucleotide polymorphisms to calculate the heterozygosity, we found that the wild tick populations of I. ricinus had much higher levels of heterozygosity than the three lab populations.\\n\\nConclusionUsing high throughput strand-oriented sequencing for whole ticks in different stages and feeding conditions, we obtained a de novo assembly that significantly increased the genomic resources available for I. ricinus. Our study illustrates the importance of analysing the transcriptome at the level of the whole body to gain additional insights into how gene expression changes over the life cycle of an organism. Our comparison of several RNAseq datasets shows the power of transcriptomic data to accurately characterize genetic polymorphism and for comparing different populations or sources of sequencing material.",

    "abstract": "All vertebrates share a segmented body axis. Segments form periodically from the rostral end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and this periodicity is regulated by the segmentation clock, a molecular oscillator that drives dynamic clock gene expression across the PSM with a periodicity that matches somite formation. Notch signalling is crucial to this process. Altering Notch intracellular domain (NICD) stability affects both the clock period and somite size. However, the mechanistic details of how NICD stability is regulated are unclear.\\n\\nWe identified a highly conserved site crucial for NICD recognition by the SCF E3 ligase, which targets NICD for degradation. We demonstrate both CDK1 and CDK2 can phosphorylate NICD in the domain where this crucial residue lies and that NICD levels vary in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Inhibiting CDK1 or CDK2 activity increases NICD levels both in vitro and in vivo, leading to a delay of clock gene oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation regulates yeast spindle pole body (SPB) duplication and separation and likely regulates microtubule nucleation. We report a phosphoproteomic analysis using tandem mass spectrometry of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPBs for two cell cycle arrests, G1/S and the mitotic checkpoint, expanding on previously reported phosphoproteomic data sets. We present a novel phosphoproteomic state of SPBs arrested in G1/S by a cdc4-1 temperature sensitive mutation, with particular interest in phosphorylation events on the {gamma}-tubulin small complex ({gamma}-TuSC). The cdc4-1 arrest is the earliest arrest at which microtubule nucleation has occurred at the newly duplicated SPB. Several novel phosphorylation sites were identified in G1/S and during mitosis on the microtubule nucleating {gamma}-TuSC. These sites were analyzed in vivo by fluorescence microscopy and were shown to be required for proper regulation of spindle length. Additionally, in vivo analysis of two mitotic sites in Spc97 found that phosphorylation of at least one of these sites is required for progression through the cell cycle. This phosphoproteomic data set not only broadens the scope of the phosphoproteome of SPBs, it also identifies several {gamma}-TuSC phosphorylation sites influencing microtubule regulation.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cell nucleus displays a remarkable spatial segregation of active euchromatic from inactive heterochromatic genomic regions. In conventional nuclei, euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals have inverted nuclei, with a dense heterochromatic core and a thin euchromatic outer shell. This inverted architecture likely converts rod nuclei into microlenses to facilitate nocturnal vision, and may relate to the absence of particular proteins that tether heterochromatin to the lamina. However, both the mechanism of inversion and the role of interactions between different types of chromatin and the lamina in nuclear organization remain unknown. To elucidate this mechanism we performed Hi-C and microscopy on cells with inverted nuclei and their conventional counterparts. Strikingly, despite the inversion evident in microscopy, both types of nuclei display similar Hi-C maps. To resolve this paradox we developed a polymer model of chromosomes and found a universal mechanism that reconciles Hi-C and microscopy for both inverted and conventional nuclei. Based solely on attraction between heterochromatic regions, this mechanism is sufficient to drive phase separation of euchromatin and heterochromatin and faithfully reproduces the 3D organization of inverted nuclei. When interactions between heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model recreates the conventional nuclear organization. To further test our models, we eliminated lamina interactions in models of conventional nuclei and found that this triggers a spontaneous process of inversion that qualitatively reproduces the pathway of morphological changes during nuclear inversion in vivo. Together, our experiments and modeling suggest that interactions among heterochromatic regions are central to phase separation of the active and inactive genome in inverted and conventional nuclei, while interactions with the lamina are essential for building the conventional architecture from these segregated phases. Ultimately our data suggest that an inverted organization constitutes the default state of nuclear architecture.",

The mutant hairless gene mRNA is expressed during the embryonic and post-natal development of the hair follicle. A mutant HR protein was identified in bmh mouse skin at different stages of development by a specific antibody. We demonstrated that the HR bmh protein is able to interact with the vitamin D receptor, but is not able to repress VDR-mediated transactivation. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that HR bmh protein displays an abnormal cellular localization in transfected cell lines, as well as in the epidermis and hair follicle of bmh mutant mice. Here we analyse the patterns of HR bmh extra-nuclear localization in cell transfection experiments. Using a candidate approach, double transfection experiments, immunofluorescent staining and IP protocols we established that HR bmh co-localizes specifically with the proteins HDAC6 in the cytoplasm is able to physically interact with it. Blast analysis allowed to show that HDAC6 and share high sequence homologies with specific motifs of HR bmh. We studied the association of these potential interactors with various cytoplasmic compartments. We discuss the relevance of the mutant hairless protein mis-localization in endosomal processing and in proteasome related pathways with respect to the specific skin phenotype of mouse hairless mutants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection and the causative organism of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Trachoma is diagnosed clinically by observation of conjunctival inflammation and/or scarring, however, there is evidence that monitoring Ct infection may be required for elimination programs. There are many commercial and  in-house nucleic acid amplification tests for the detection of Ct DNA, but the vast majority have not been validated for use with ocular swabs. This study evaluated a commercial assay, the Fast-Track Vaginal swab kit, using conjunctival samples from two trachoma-endemic areas. An objective, biostatistical-based method for binary classification of continuous PCR data was also developed, to limit potential user-bias in diagnostic settings.\\n\\nResultsThe Fast-Track Vaginal swab assay was run on 210 ocular swab samples from Guinea-Bissau and Tanzania. Fit of individual amplification curves to exponential or sigmoid models, derivative and second derivative of the curves and final fluorescence value were examined for utility in thresholding for determining positivity. The results from the Fast-Track Vaginal swab assay were evaluated against a commercial test (Amplicor CT/NG) as well as a non-commercial test (in-house ddPCR) both of whose performance has previously been evaluated.\\n\\nSignificant evidence of exponential amplification (R2 > 0.99) and final fluorescence > 0.15 were combined for thresholding. This objective approach identified a population of positive samples, however there were a subset of samples that amplified towards the end of the cycling protocol (at or later than 35 cycles), which were less clearly defined. The Fast-Track Vaginal swab assay showed good sensitivity against the commercial (95.71) and non-commercial (97.18) tests. Specificity was lower against both tests (90.00 and 96.55 respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study defined a simple, automated protocol for binary classification of continuous, real time qPCR data, for use in an end-point diagnostic test. This method identified a population of positive samples, however, as with manual thresholding, a subset of samples that amplified towards the end of the thermal cycling program were less easily classified. When used with ocular swabs, the Fast-Track Vaginal swab assay had good sensitivity but for Ct detection lower specificity than the commercial and non-commercial assays it was evaluated against, possibly leading to false positives.",

    "abstract": "Historically, cognitive processing has been thought to rely on cortical areas such as prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the outputs of these areas modulating activity in lower, putatively simpler spatiomotor regions, such as the midbrain superior colliculus (SC). Using a rat task in which subjects switch rapidly between task contexts that demand changes in sensorimotor mappings, we report a surprising role for the SC in non-spatial cognitive processes. Before spatial response choices could be formed, neurons in SC encoded task context more strongly than neurons in PFC, and bilateral SC silencing impaired behavioral performance. Once spatial choices could begin to be formed, SC neurons encoded the choice faster than PFC, while bilateral SC silencing no longer impaired choices. A set of dynamical models of the SC replicates our findings. Our results challenge cortically-focused views of cognition, and suggest that ostensibly spatiomotor structures can play central roles in non-spatiomotor cognitive processes.",

Thus, it would be critical to understanding the role of different regions of the brain in initiation and progression of AD, However, owing to complex and multifactorial nature of this disease, the molecular mechanism of AD has yet to be fully elucidated. To confront with this challenge, we launched a meta-analytical study of current transcriptomics data in four different regions of the brain in AD (Entorhinal, Hippocampus, Temporal and Frontal) with systems analysis of identifying involved signaling and metabolic pathways. We found different regulatory patterns in Entorhinal and Hippocampus regions to be associated with progression of AD. We also identified shared versus unique biological pathways and critical proteins among different brain regions. ACACB, GAPDH, ACLY, and EGFR were the most important proteins in Entorhinal, Frontal, Hippocampus and Temporal regions, respectively. Moreover, eight proteins including CDK5, ATP5G1, DNM1, GNG3, AP2M1, ALDOA, GPI, and TPI1 were differentially expressed in all four brain regions, among which, CDK5 and ATP5G1 were enriched in KEGG Alzheimers disease pathway as well.",
