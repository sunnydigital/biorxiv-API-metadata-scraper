    "abstract": "Phylogenetic reconstruction of tumor evolution has emerged as a crucial tool for making sense of the complexity of emerging cancer genomic data sets. Despite the growing use of phylogenetics in cancer studies, though, the field has only slowly adapted to many ways that tumor evolution differs from classic species evolution. One crucial question in that regard is how to handle inference of structural variations (SVs), which are a major mechanism of evolution in cancers but have been largely neglected in tumor phylogenetics to date, in part due to the challenges of reliably detecting and typing SVs and interpreting them phylogenetically. We present a novel method for reconstructing evolutionary trajectories of SVs from bulk whole-genome sequence data via joint deconvolution and phylogenetics, to infer clonal subpopulations and reconstruct their ancestry. We establish a novel likelihood model for joint deconvolution and phylogenetic inference on bulk SV data and formulate an associated optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the approach to be efficient and accurate for realistic scenarios of SV mutation on simulated data. Application to breast cancer genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) shows it to be practical and effective at reconstructing features of SV-driven evolution in single tumors.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe ecological specialization of parasites - whether they can obtain high fitness on very few or very many different host species - is a determining feature of their ecology. In order to properly assess specialization, it is imperative to measure parasite fitness across host species; to understand its origins, fitness must be decomposed into the underlying traits. Despite the omnipresence of parasites with multiple hosts, very few studies assess and decompose their specialization in this way. To bridge this gap, we quantified the infectivity, virulence, and transmission rate of two parasites, the horizontally transmitted microsporidians Anostracospora rigaudi and Enterocytospora artemiae, in their natural hosts, the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica and Artemia franciscana. Our results demonstrate that each parasite performs well on one of the two host species (A. rigaudi on A. parthenogenetica, and E. artemiae on A. franciscana), and poorly on the other. This partial specialization is driven by high infectivity and transmission rates in the preferred host, and is associated with maladaptive virulence and large costs of resistance in the other. Our study represents a rare empirical contribution to the study of parasite evolution in multi-host systems, highlighting the negative effects of under- and over-exploitation when adapting to multiple hosts.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) heritability has been estimated to be around 30%. However, mutations in the known CRC susceptibility genes explain CRC risk in under 10% of the cases. Germline mutations in DNA-repair genes (DRGs) have recently been reported in CRC but their contribution to CRC risk is largely unknown. We evaluated the gene-level germline mutation enrichment of 40 DRGs in 680 unselected CRC individuals compared to 27728 ancestry-matched cancer-free adults. Significant findings were then examined in independent cohorts of 1661 unselected CRC cases and 1456 early-onset CRC cases. Of 680 individuals in the discovery set, 31 (4.56%) individuals harbored germline pathogenic mutations in known CRC susceptibility genes while another 33 (4.85%) individuals had DRG mutations that have not been previously associated with CRC risk. Germline pathogenic mutations in ATM and PALB2 were enriched in both the discovery (OR= 2.81; P= 0.035 and OR= 4.91; P= 0.024, respectively) and validation sets (OR= 2.97; Adjusted P= 0.0013 and OR= 3.42; Adjusted P= 0.034, for ATM and PALB2 respectively). Biallelic loss of ATM was evident in all cases with matched tumor profiling. CRC cases also had higher rates of actionable mutations in the HR pathway that can substantially increase the risk of developing cancers other than CRC. Our analysis provides evidence for ATM and PALB2 as CRC risk genes, underscoring the importance of the homologous recombination pathway in CRC. In addition, we identified frequent complete homologous recombination deficiency in CRC tumors, representing a unique opportunity to explore targeted therapeutic interventions such as PARPi.",

    "abstract": "Cell - free lysates have found a utility in performing cellular functions and providing biologically-relevant metabolic products without the optimal biological conditions for growth and proliferation. By teasing out the biological components and constructing artificial conditions that enable for biological transcription and translation processes to occur, specific cell - like functions can be reconstituted in vitro without requiring the entire cell and milieu of cellular organelles. This enables for optimization of biological circuits, either by concentration or on/off switches, simply through the addition or removal of genetic components (plasmids, inducers, or repressors) of regulatory elements. Here, we demonstrate an application of cell - free process that is robust and portable, independent of a substrate, to apply for sensing and reporting functions of a quorum sensing molecule N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12HSL) found crucial for pathological Pseudomonas infections. Using droplet microfluidics to integrate cell - free related functions into hydrogel scaffolds, we show that these cell - free circuits can be encapsulated, delivered, and activated in most environments--even in conditions with very little hydration.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is the second-most prevalent mental disorder, with no sufficient treatment available. Despite a substantial role of genetic factors, only a handful of genes have been implicated and insight into the associated neurobiological pathways remains limited. Here, we use an unprecedented large genetic association sample (N=1,331,010) to allow detection of a substantial number of genetic variants and gain insight into biological functions, cell types and tissues involved in insomnia complaints. We identify 202 genome-wide significant loci implicating 956 genes through positional, eQTL and chromatin interaction mapping. We show involvement of the axonal part of neurons, of specific cortical and subcortical tissues, and of two specific cell-types in insomnia: striatal medium spiny neurons and hypothalamic neurons. These cell-types have been implicated previously in the regulation of reward processing, sleep and arousal in animal studies, but have never been genetically linked to insomnia in humans. We found weak genetic correlations with other sleep-related traits, but strong genetic correlations with psychiatric and metabolic traits. Mendelian randomization identified causal effects of insomnia on specific psychiatric and metabolic traits. Our findings reveal key brain areas and cells implicated in the neurobiology of insomnia and its related disorders, and provide novel targets for treatment.",

    "abstract": "Molecular switches, such as the protein kinase CaMKII, play a fundamental role in cell signalling by decoding inputs into either high or low states of activity; because the high activation state can be turned on and persist after the input ceases, these switches have earned a reputation as  digital. Although this on/off, binary perspective has been valuable for understanding long timescale synaptic plasticity, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that the CaMKII switch can also control plasticity on short timescales. To investigate this idea further, a non-autonomous, nonlinear ordinary differential equation, representative of a general bistable molecular switch, is analyzed. The results suggest that switch activity in regions surrounding either the high- or low-stable states of activation could act as a reliable analog signal, whose short timescale fluctuations relative to equilibrium track instantaneous input frequency. The model makes intriguing predictions and is validated against previous work demonstrating its suitability as a minimal representation of switch dynamics; in combination with existing experimental evidence, the theory suggests a multiplexed encoding of instantaneous frequency information over short timescales, with integration of total activity over long timescales.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBistable molecular switches can decode cellular inputs into distinct high- or low-states of persistent enzymatic activity.

    "abstract": "Over 60 years ago Waddington proposed an epigenetic landscape model of cellular differentiation, whereby cell-fate transitions are modelled as canalization events, with stable cell states occupying the basins or attractor states1, 2. A key ingredient of this landscape is the energy potential, or height3, which correlates with cell-potency. To date, very few explicit biophysical models for estimating single-cell potency have been proposed. Using 9 independent experiments, encompassing over 6,600 high-quality single-cell RNA-Seq profiles, we here demonstrate that single-cell potency can be approximated as the graph entropy of a Markov Chain process on a model signaling network. Our analysis highlights that other proposed single-cell potency measures are not robust, whilst also revealing that integration with orthogonal systems-level information improves potency estimates. Thus, this study provides a foundation for an improved systems-level understanding of single-cell potency, which may have profound implications for the discovery of novel stem-and progenitor cell phenotypes.",

In this work, we explore whether methods that have been developed previously for the analysis of bulk Hi-C data can be applied to scHi-C data. In this work, we apply methods designed for analysis of bulk Hi-C data to scHi-C data in conjunction with unsupervised embedding. We find that one of these methods, HiCRep, when used in conjunction with multidimensional scaling (MDS), strongly outperforms three other methods, including a technique that has been used previously for scHi-C analysis. We also provide evidence that the HiCRep/MDS method is robust to extremely low per-cell sequencing depth, that this robustness is improved even further when high-coverage and low-coverage cells are projected together, and that the method can be used to jointly embed cells from multiple published datasets.",

We used Cox models and random survival forests with and without imputation on 27 expert-selected variables to predict all-cause mortality. We also used Cox models, random forests and elastic net regression on an extended dataset with 586 variables to build prognostic models and identify novel prognostic factors without prior expert input.\\n\\nWe observed that data-driven models used on an extended dataset can outperform conventional models for prognosis, without data preprocessing or imputing missing values, and with no need to scale or transform continuous data. An elastic net Cox regression based with 586 unimputed variables with continuous values discretised achieved a C-index of 0.801 (bootstrapped 95% CI 0.799 to 0.802), compared to 0.793 (0.791 to 0.794) for a traditional Cox model comprising 27 expert-selected variables with imputation for missing values.\\n\\nWe also found that data-driven models allow identification of novel prognostic variables; that the absence of values for particular variables carries meaning, and can have significant implications for prognosis; and that variables often have a nonlinear association with mortality, which discretised Cox models and random forests can elucidate.\\n\\nThis demonstrates that machine-learning approaches applied to raw EHR data can be used to build reliable models for use in research and clinical practice, and identify novel predictive variables and their effects to inform future research.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the allele ancestral to the variation at a polymorphic nucleotide site cannot be assigned with certainty, and that the most frequently used method to assign the ancestral state - maximum parsimony - is prone to mis-inference. Estimates of counts of sites that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, uSFS) made by parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the uSFS for a focal species, using information from two outgroups and assuming simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this approach to infer the uSFS, allowing multiple outgroups, potentially any phylogenetic tree topology and more complex models of nucleotide substitution. We find, however, that two outgroups and assuming the Kimura 2-parameter model is adequate for uSFS inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony for ancestral state inference at a specific site seriously breaks down in two situations. The first is where the outgroups provide no information about the ancestral state of variation in the focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be under-estimated if such sites are removed from the data. The second is where the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to over-estimate the probability of the major allele being derived, because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare in most data sets. We present a method that corrects this deficiency, which is capable of providing unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a site-by-site basis and the uSFS.",

    "abstract": "A range of gene drive systems have been proposed that are predicted to increase their frequency and that of associated desirable genetic material even if they confer a fitness cost on individuals carrying them. Engineered underdominance (UD) is such a system and, in one version, is based on the introduction of two independently segregating transgenic constructs each carrying a lethal gene, a suppressor for the lethal at the other locus and a desirable genetic \\\"cargo\\\". Under this system individuals carrying at least one copy of each construct (or no copies of either) are viable whilst those that possess just one of the transgenic constructs are non-viable. Previous theoretical work has explored various properties of these systems, concluding that they should persist indefinitely in absence of resistance or mutation. Here we study a population genetics model of UD gene drive that relaxes past assumptions by allowing for loss-of-function mutations in each introduced gene. We demonstrate that mutations are likely to cause UD systems to break down, eventually resulting in the elimination of introduced transgenes. We then go on to investigate the potential of releasing \\\"free suppressor\\\" carrying individuals as a new method for reversing UD gene drives and compare this to the release of wild-types; the only previously proposed reversal strategy for UD. This reveals that while free suppressor carrying individuals may represent an inexpensive reversal strategy due to extremely small release requirements, they are not able to return a fully wild-type population as rapidly as the release of wild-types.",
