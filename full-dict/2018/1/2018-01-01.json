    "abstract": "Translating the ever-increasing wealth of information on microbiomes (environment, host, or built environment) to advance the understanding of system-level processes is proving to be an exceptional research challenge. One reason for this challenge is that relationships between characteristics of microbiomes and the system-level processes they influence are often evaluated in the absence of a robust conceptual framework and reported without elucidating the underlying causal mechanisms. The reliance on correlative approaches limits the potential to expand the inference of a single relationship to additional systems and advance the field. We propose that research focused on how microbiomes influence the systems they inhabit should work within a common framework and target known microbial processes that contribute to the system-level processes of interest. Here we identify three distinct categories of microbiome characteristics (microbial processes, microbial community properties, and microbial membership) and propose a framework to empirically link each of these categories to each other and the broader system level processes they affect. We posit that it is particularly important to distinguish microbial community properties that can be predicted from constituent taxa (community aggregated traits) from and those properties that are currently unable to be predicted from constituent taxa (emergent properties). Existing methods in microbial ecology can be applied to more explicitly elucidate properties within each of these categories and connect these three categories of microbial characteristics with each other. We view this proposed framework, gleaned from a breadth of research on environmental microbiomes and ecosystem processes, as a promising pathway with the potential to advance discovery and understanding across a broad range of microbiome science.",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity is important to biological processes, including cancer and development. However, proteome heterogeneity is largely unexplored because of the limitations of existing methods for quantifying protein levels in single cells. To alleviate these limitations, we developed Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), and validated its ability to identify distinct human cancer cell types based on their proteomes. We used SCoPE-MS to quantify over a thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled us to deconstruct cell populations and infer protein abundance relationships. Comparison between single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes indicated coordinated mRNA and protein covariation. Yet many genes exhibited functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the mRNA and the protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to proteome remodeling during lineage specification, especially for developmental genes. SCoPE-MS is broadly applicable to measuring proteome configurations of single cells and linking them to functional phenotypes, such as cell type and differentiation potentials.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequences for hundreds of mammalian species are available, but an understanding of their genomic regulatory regions, which control gene expression, is only beginning. A comprehensive prediction of potential active regulatory regions is necessary to functionally study the roles of the majority of genomic variants in evolution, domestication, and animal production. We developed a computational method to predict regulatory DNA sequences (promoters, enhancers and transcription factor binding sites) in production animals (cows and pigs) and extended its broad applicability to other mammals. The method utilizes human regulatory features identified from thousands of tissues, cell lines, and experimental assays to find homologous regions that are conserved in sequences and genome organization and are enriched for regulatory elements in the genome sequences of other mammalian species. Importantly, we developed a filtering strategy, including a machine learning classification method, to utilize a very small number of species-specific experimental datasets available to select for the likely active regulatory regions. The method finds the optimal combination of sensitivity and accuracy to unbiasedly predict regulatory regions in mammalian species. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of the predicted regulatory datasets in cattle for prioritizing variants associated with multiple production and climate change adaptation traits, and identifying potential genome editing targets.",

Such heterogeneities lead to demixing of lipid constituents and formation of distinct liquid domains in the membrane. We study lateral heterogeneities in terms of topological rearrangements of lipids to identify the liquid-liquid phase coexistence in model membranes. By quantifying the degree of non-affine deformation associated with individual lipid, we are able to characterize the liquid ordered (Lo) and liquid disordered (Ld) phases in model lipid bilayers, without any prior knowledge about the chemical identity of the lipids. We explore the usage of this method on all atom and coarse-grained lipid bilayer trajectories. This method is helpful in defining the instantaneous Lo-Ld domain boundaries in complex multi-component bilayer systems.\\n\\nThe characterization is also used to highlight the effect of line-active molecules on the phase boundaries and domain mixing. Overall, we propose a framework to explore the molecular origin of spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in biomembrane systems, which can be exploited not only in computer simulations but also in experiments.",

    "abstract": "While ciliates of the genus Stentor are known for their ability to regenerate when their cells are damaged or even fragmented, the physical and molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. To identify genes involved in the regenerative capability of Stentor cells, RNA sequencing of individual Stentor polymorphus cell fragments was performed. After splitting a cell over the anterior-posterior axis, the posterior fragment has to regenerate the oral apparatus, while the anterior part needs to regenerate the hold fast. Altogether, differential expression analysis of both posterior and anterior S. polymorphus cell fragments for four different post-split time points revealed over 10,000 up-regulated genes throughout the regeneration process. Among these, genes involved in cell signaling, microtubule-based movement and cell cycle regulation seemed to be particularly important during cellular regeneration. We identified roughly nine times as many up-regulated genes in regenerating S. polymorphus posterior fragments as compared to anterior fragments, indicating that regeneration of the anterior oral apparatus is a complex process that involves many genes. Our analyses identified several expanded groups of genes such as dual-specific tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinases and MORN domain containing proteins that seemingly act as key-regulators of cellular regeneration. In agreement with earlier morphological and cell biological studies, our differential expression analyses indicate that cellular regeneration and vegetative division share many similarities.",

NGLY1 is evolutionarily conserved in model organisms, including the Drosophila melanogaster NGLY1 homolog, Pngl. Here we conducted a natural history study and chemical-modifier screen on a new fly model of NGLY1 Deficiency engineered with a nonsense mutation in Pngl at codon 420, resulting in truncation of the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding PAW domain. Homozygous mutant animals exhibit global development delay, pupal lethality and small body size as adults. We developed a 96-well-plate, image-based, quantitative assay of Drosophila larval size for use in a screen of the 2,650-member Microsource Spectrum compound library of FDA approved drugs, bioactive tool compounds, and natural products. We found that the cholesterol-derived ecdysteroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) rescued the global developmental delay in mutant homozygotes. Targeted expression of a human NGLY1 transgene to tissues involved in ecdysteroidogenesis, e.g., prothoracic gland, also rescues global developmental delay in mutant homozygotes. Finally, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a potent enhancer of global developmental delay in our fly model, evidence of a defective proteasome \\\"bounce-back\\\" response that is also observed in nematode and cellular models of NGLY1 Deficiency. Together, these results demonstrate the therapeutic relevance of a new fly model of NGLY1 Deficiency for drug discovery, biomarker discovery, pharmacodynamics studies, and gene modifier screens.",

Despite this, the exact impact of its parameters on colony growth has not been extensively studied. A common protocol involves the shaking of glass beads within a petri dish containing solid growth media. We investigated the effects of multiple parameters in this protocol - the number of beads, the shape of movement, and the number of movements. Standard suspensions of Escherichia coli were spread while varying these parameters to assess their impact on colony growth. Results were assessed by a variety of metrics - the number of colonies, the mean distance between closest colonies, and the variability and uniformity of their spatial distribution. Finally, we devised a mathematical model of shifting billiard to explain the heterogeneities in the observed spatial patterns. Exploring the parameters that affect the most fundamental techniques in microbiology allows us to better understand their function, giving us the ability to precisely control their outputs for our exact needs.",

    "abstract": "Specialized epithelia produce apical matrices with distinctive topographies by enigmatic mechanisms. Here, we describe a holistic mechanism that integrates cortical actomyosin dynamics with apical matrix remodeling to pattern C. elegans cuticles. Therein, axial AFBs appear near the surface of lateral epidermal syncytia during an interval of transverse apical constriction (AC). AC gives rise to three temporary semi-circular cellular protrusions beneath a provisional matrix (sheath). In turn, sheath components pattern durable ridges along the midline of adult cuticles (alae). We propose that forces generated by AC are relayed via the sheath to sculpt the the acellular adult cuticle manifest several hours later. Furthermore, we provide evidence that circumferential actin filament bundles (CFBs) near the surface of the adjacent syncytia (hyp7) are largely dispensable for the propagation of annular cuticle structures from one larval stage to the next. Rather, the temporary CFBs extend from actin bundles overlying body wall muscles, which are situated between Ce. hemidesmosomes. Similar mechanisms may contribute to the morphogenesis of integumentary organs in higher metazoans.",

    "abstract": "Neurological and psychiatric diseases often involve the dysfunction of specific neural circuits in particular regions of the brain. Existing treatments, including drugs and implantable brain stimulators, aim to modulate the activity of these circuits, but are typically not cell type-specific, lack spatial targeting or require invasive procedures. Here, we introduce an approach to modulating neural circuits noninvasively with spatial, cell-type and temporal specificity. This approach, called acoustically targeted chemogenetics, or ATAC, uses transient ultrasonic opening of the blood brain barrier to transduce neurons at specific locations in the brain with virally-encoded engineered G-protein-coupled receptors, which subsequently respond to systemically administered bio-inert compounds to activate or inhibit the activity of these neurons. We demonstrate this concept in mice by using ATAC to noninvasively modify and subsequently activate or inhibit excitatory neurons within the hippocampus, showing that this enables pharmacological control of memory formation. This technology allows a brief, noninvasive procedure to make one or more specific brain regions capable of being selectively modulated using orally bioavailable compounds, thereby overcoming some of the key limitations of conventional brain therapies.",

    "abstract": "Division of labour is a hallmark of eusocial insect colonies, with different groups of workers engaged in different tasks at the same time. Foraging is a task done by older workers in honey bee colonies. Foragers use the waggle dance behaviour to inform and recruit nest mates to food sources in the environment. The recruitment process incorporates information about the food reward, the colony food stores and the environmental food availability and plays a major role in ensuring efficient exploitation of the food sources available to the colony. However, the role that individual foragers play in driving recruitment is largely unexplored. We observed the dance activity of individual foragers from the same foraging group and showed that there are consistent inter-individual differences within a foraging group leading to a division of labour in the recruitment activity. Next, we studied the effect of changing social interactions on these individual differences. Removing foragers from the group led to an increase in the dance activity of the group of remaining foragers. This was mainly driven by an increase in the dance activity of certain individuals within the foraging groups. In contrast, allowing recruits to join the foraging group had a strong negative effect on the dance activity of all the individual foragers. Our study shows that there is a fine scale division of labour in the recruitment activity within foraging groups and that this is further regulated by changing social interactions. Thus, a complex interplay between individual differences and social interactions drive recruitment activity in honey bees.",

We develop an algorithm, called DECODE, to assess the extent of joint presence/absence of genes across different cells, and to infer a gene dependency network. We show that this network captures biologically-meaningful pathways, cell-type specific modules, and connectivity patterns characteristic of complex networks. We develop a model that uses this network to discriminate biological vs. technical zeros, by exploiting each genes local network neighborhood. For inferred non-biological zeros, we build a predictive model that imputes the missing value of each gene based on activity patterns of its most informative neighbors. We show that our framework accurately infers gene-gene functional dependencies, pinpoints technical zeros, and predicts biologically-meaningful missing values in three diverse datasets.",

We screened 448 specimens for the presence of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) using qPCR and a custom nested PCR. qPCR appeared versatile and under-estimated the prevalence of Xf. Nested PCR showed that Xf was present in all populations. Molecular results were validated by prediction on the distribution of Xf made from tests conducted on plants, which shows the pertinence of using vectors in risk assessment studies. Xf was detected in tenerals and adults. Thus, P. spumarius could acquire Xf from its host plant, mostly Cistus monspeliensis in Corsica, which may act as reservoir for the next season. This contrasts with other observations and suggests that management strategies may have to be adapted on a case-by-case basis. At least two genetic entities and several variants of Xf not yet identified on plants were present in the insects, which suggests ancient introductions of Xf and a probable underestimation of the current diversity of the strains present in Corsica. Interestingly 6% of the specimens carried two subspecies. Studies are wanted to better characterize the strains present in Corsica and know how the disease was introduced, spread and why no sign of a potential epidemic was detected earlier. This study shows that, when sensitive enough methods are implemented, insects can be used to predict and better assess the exact distribution of Xf.

    "abstract": "The degradation of particulate organic matter in the ocean is a central process in the global carbon cycle, the  mode and tempo of which is determined by the bacterial communities that assemble on particle surfaces. Although recent studies have shed light on the dynamics of community assembly on particles -which serve as hotspots of microbial activity in the ocean, the mapping from community composition to function, i.e. particle degradation, remains completely unexplored. Using a collection of marine bacteria cultured from different stages of succession on chitin micro-particles we found that the hydrolytic power of communities is highly dependent on community composition. Different particle degrading taxa -all of which were early successional species during colonization- displayed characteristic particle half-lives that differed by ~170 hours, comparable to the residence time of particles in the oceans mixed layer1. These half-lives were in general longer in multispecies communities, where the growth of obligate cross-feeders limited the ability of degraders to colonize and consume particles. Remarkably, above a certain critical initial ratio of cross-feeder to degrader cells, particle degradation was completely blocked along with the growth of all members of the community. We showed that this interaction occurred between a variety of strains of different taxonomic origins and that it only appears when bacteria interact with particles, suggesting a mechanism by which non-degrading secondary consumers occlude access to the particle resource. Overall, our results show that micro-scale community ecology on particle surfaces can have significant impact on carbon turnover in the ocean.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of two-photon imaging as a tool for systems neuroscience, the mouse has become a preeminent model system for studying sensory processing. One notable difference that has been found however, between mice and traditional model species like cats and primates is the responsiveness of the cortex. In the primary visual cortex of cats and primates, nearly all neurons respond to simple visual stimuli like drifting gratings. In contrast, imaging studies in mice consistently find that only around half of the neurons respond to such stimuli. Here we show that visual responsiveness is strongly dependent on the cortical depth of neurons. Moving from superficial layer 2 down to layer 4, the percentage of responsive neurons increases dramatically, ultimately reaching levels similar to what is seen in other species. Over this span of cortical depth, neuronal response amplitude also increases and orientation selectivity moderately decreases. These depth dependent response properties may be explained by the distribution of thalamic inputs in mouse V1. Unlike in cats and primates where thalamic projections to the granular layer are constrained to layer 4, in mice they spread up into layer 2/3, qualitatively matching the distribution of response properties we see. These results show that the analysis of neural response properties must take into consideration not only the overall cortical lamina boundaries but also the depth of recorded neurons within each cortical layer. Furthermore, the inability to drive the majority of neurons in superficial layer 2/3 of mouse V1 with grating stimuli indicates that there may be fundamental differences in the role of V1 between rodents and other mammals.",

    "abstract": "Primates--including humans--can typically recognize objects in visual images at a glance even in the face of naturally occurring identity-preserving image transformations (e.g. changes in viewpoint). A primary neuroscience goal is to uncover neuron-level mechanistic models that quantitatively explain this behavior by predicting primate performance for each and every image. Here, we applied this stringent behavioral prediction test to the leading mechanistic models of primate vision (specifically, deep, convolutional, artificial neural networks; ANNs) by directly comparing their behavioral signatures against those of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys. Using high-throughput data collection systems for human and monkey psychophysics, we collected over one million behavioral trials for 2400 images over 276 binary object discrimination tasks. Consistent with previous work, we observed that state-of-the-art deep, feed-forward convolutional ANNs trained for visual categorization (termed DCNNIC models) accurately predicted primate patterns of object-level confusion. However, when we examined behavioral performance for individual images within each object discrimination task, we found that all tested DCNNIC models were significantly non-predictive of primate performance, and that this prediction failure was not accounted for by simple image attributes, nor rescued by simple model modifications. These results show that current DCNNIC models cannot account for the image-level behavioral patterns of primates, and that new ANN models are needed to more precisely capture the neural mechanisms underlying primate object vision. To this end, large-scale, high-resolution primate behavioral benchmarks--such as those obtained here--could serve as direct guides for discovering such models.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecently, specific feed-forward deep convolutional artificial neural networks (ANNs) models have dramatically advanced our quantitative understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying primate core object recognition. In this work, we tested the limits of those ANNs by systematically comparing the behavioral responses of these models with the behavioral responses of humans and monkeys, at the resolution of individual images. Using these high-resolution metrics, we found that all tested ANN models significantly diverged from primate behavior. Going forward, these high-resolution, large-scale primate behavioral benchmarks could serve as direct guides for discovering better ANN models of the primate visual system.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulation-based interventions continue to be evaluated across an array of appetitive disorders but broader implementation of these approaches remains limited due to variable treatment outcomes. We hypothesize that individual variation in treatment outcomes may be linked to differences in the networks underlying these disorders. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats received deep brain stimulation separately within each nucleus accumbens (NAc) sub-region (core and shell) using a within-animal crossover design in a rat model of binge eating. Significant reductions in binge size were observed with stimulation of either target but with significant variation in effectiveness across individuals. When features of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the NAc were used as predictors of the pre-defined stimulation outcomes (response or non-response) from each rat using a machine-learning approach (lasso), stimulation outcomes could be predicted with greater accuracy than expected by chance (effect sizes: core = 1.13, shell = 1.05). Further, these LFP features could be used to identify the best stimulation target for each animal (core vs. shell) with an effect size = 0.96. These data suggest that individual differences in underlying network activity may contribute to the variable outcomes of circuit based interventions and that measures of network activity have the potential to individually guide the selection of an optimal stimulation target and improve overall treatment response rates.",

Here, using terrestrial paleocommunities of the Karoo Basin spanning the PTME, we show that a pre-extinction incumbent configuration of biotic interactions made significant ecological re-organizations or macroevolutionary innovations unlikely. The post-PTME ecosystem initially was more likely to be reorganized, but incumbency was re-established by the Middle Triassic. We argue that the stability of the pre-PTME ecosystem, its subsequent loss, and replacement, resulted from the in-fluence of community-level structure and dynamics on species evolution and survival.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryBiotic incumbency at the end of the Paleozoic, based on community functional organization, was destroyed by the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, allowing the development of novel community types.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA barcoding is an imperative implementation of chloroplast rbcL and matK regions exploited as standard molecular barcodes for species identification. MatK is highly conserved in plants and has been used extensively as a phylogenetic marker for classification of plants. In this study matK sequences of Leguminosae were retrieved for variant analysis and phylogentics. From online resources, maturase sequences were retrieved; redundant sequences and partials along with poor quality reads were filtered to compile 3639 complete non-redundant matK sequences and constructed into a database for ready reference. The database FabElm_BarcodeDb made available at app.bioelm.com was constructed using available sequence resources.\\n\\nResultsThe chloroplast genome of plants contains matK gene of 1500 bp, positioned between intron of trnK associated in-group II intron splicing. Mitochondrial matR and genomic matN sequences were compared with chloroplast matK. These maturase sequences share regions of homology with chloroplast and mitochondrial regions and are expected to be regulated by miRNA in producing splice variants contributing to speciation.\\n\\nConclusionBase substitution rates of nuclear maturase were comparable with mitochondrial maturase and are different from matK sequences. Hence, few identified species in this investigation were clustered with other tribes when analysed using matK. MatK is effective in resolving the species level variations as splicing contributes to speciation; but utilization of matK alone as a barcode marker for legumes is dubious, as it could not resolve some species identity.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Efficient quantification of the sophisticated shading patterns inside the 3D vegetation canopies may improve our understanding of canopy functions and status, which is possible now more than ever, thanks to the high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms. In order to evaluate the option of quantitative characterization of shading patterns, a simple image mining technique named \"green-gradient based canopy segmentation model (GSM)\" was developed based on the relative variations in the level of RGB triplets under different illuminations. For this purpose, an archive of ground-based nadir images of heterogeneous wheat canopies (cultivar mixtures) was analyzed. The images were taken from experimental plots of a two-year field experiment conducted during 2014-15 and 2015-16 growing seasons in the semi-arid region of southern Iran. In GSM, the vegetation pixels were categorized into the maximum possible number of 255 groups based on their green levels. Subsequently, mean red and mean blue levels of each group were calculated and plotted against the green levels. It is evidenced that the yielded graph could be readily used for (i) identifying and characterizing canopies even as simple as one or two equation(s); (ii) classification of canopy pixels in accordance with the degree of exposure to sunlight; and (iii) accurately prediction of various quantitative properties of canopy including canopy coverage (CC), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), canopy temperature, and also precise classification of experimental plots based on the qualitative characteristics such as subjecting to water and cold stresses, date of imaging, and time of irrigation. It seems that the introduced model may provide a multipurpose HTP platform and open new windows to canopy studies.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of self-organization that orchestrate embryonic cells to create astonishing patterns have been among major questions of developmental biology. It is recently shown that embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when cultured on particular micropatterns, can self-organize and mimic early steps of pre-implantation embryogenesis. A systems-biology model to address this observation from a dynamical systems perspective is essential. Here, we propose a multicellular mathematical model for pattern formation during in vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. This model enhances the basic principles of Waddington epigenetic landscape with cell-cell communication, in order to enable pattern and tissue formation. To prevent overfitting of the model, there is a minimal number of parameters in the model, which are sufficient to address different experimental observations such as the formation of three germ layers and trophectoderm, responses to altered culture conditions and micropattern diameters, and unexpected spotted forms of the germ layers under certain conditions. This model provides a basis for in-silico modeling of self-organization.",
