    "abstract": "The 3D organization of chromosome is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed - topologically constrained - polymers. The main challenge is therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we discussed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCNV analysis is an integral component to the study of human genomes in both research and clinical settings. Array-based CNV analysis is the current first-tier approach in clinical cytogenetics. Decreasing costs in high-throughput sequencing and cloud computing have opened doors for the development of sequencing-based CNV analysis pipelines with fast turnaround times. We carry out a systematic and quantitative comparative analysis for several low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) strategies to detect CNV in the human genome.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared the CNV detection capabilities of WGS strategies (short-insert, 3kb-, and 5kb-insert mate-pair) each at 1x, 3x, and 5x coverages relative to each other and to 17 currently used high-density oligonucleotide arrays. For benchmarking, we used a set of Gold Standard (GS) CNVs generated for the 1000-Genomes-Project CEU subject NA12878.\\n\\nResultsOverall, low-coverage WGS strategies detect drastically more GS CNVs compared to arrays and are accompanied with smaller percentages of CNV calls without validation. Furthermore, we show that WGS (at [&ge;]1x coverage) is able to detect all seven GS deletion-CNVs >100 kb in NA12878 whereas only one is detected by most arrays. Lastly, we show that the much larger 15 Mbp Cri-du-chat deletion can be readily detected with short-insert paired-end WGS at even just 1x coverage.\\n\\nConclusionsCNV analysis using low-coverage WGS is efficient and outperforms the array-based analysis that is currently used for clinical cytogenetics.",

    "abstract": "The collection of immunoglobulin genes in an individuals germline, which gives rise to B cell receptors via recombination, is known to vary significantly across individuals. In humans, for example, each individual has only a fraction of the several hundred known V alleles. Furthermore, the currently-accepted set of known V alleles is both incomplete (particularly for non-European samples), and contains a significant number of spurious alleles. The resulting uncertainty as to which immunoglobulin alleles are present in any given sample results in inaccurate B cell receptor sequence annotations, and in particular inaccurate inferred naive ancestors. In this paper we first show that the currently widespread practice of aligning each sequence to its closest match in the full set of IMGT alleles results in a very large number of spurious alleles that are not in the samples true set of germline V alleles. We then describe a new method for inferring each individuals germline gene set from deep sequencing data, and show that it improves upon existing methods by making a detailed comparison on a variety of simulated and real data samples. This new method has been integrated into the partis annotation and clonal family inference package, available at https://github.com/psathyrella/partis, and is run by default without affecting overall run time.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAntibodies are an important component of the adaptive immune system, which itself determines our response to both pathogens and vaccines. They are produced by B cells through somatic recombination of germline DNA, which results in a vast diversity of antigen binding affinities across the B cell repertoire. We typically learn about the development of this repertoire, and its history of interaction with antigens, by sequencing large numbers of the DNA sequences from which antibodies are derived. In order to understand such data, it is necessary to determine the combination of germline V, D, and J genes that was rearranged to form each such B cell receptor sequence. This is difficult, however, because the immunoglobulin locus exhibits an extraordinary level of diversity across individuals - encompassing both allelic variation and gene duplication, deletion, and conversion - and because the locuss large size and repetitive structure make germline sequencing very difficult. In this paper we describe a new computational method that avoids this difficulty by inferring each individuals set of immunoglobulin germline genes directly from expressed B cell receptor sequence data.",

    "abstract": "Intra-protein residue-level contact prediction has drawn a lot of attentions in recent years and made very good progress, but much fewer methods are dedicated to inter-protein contact prediction, which are important for understanding how proteins interact at structure and residue level. Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is popular for intra-protein contact prediction, but extending it to inter-protein contact prediction is challenging since it requires too many interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) to be effective, which cannot be easily fulfilled especially for a putative interacting protein pair in eukaryotes. We show that deep learning, even trained by only intra-protein contact maps, works much better than DCA for inter-protein contact prediction. We also show that a phylogeny-based method can generate a better multiple sequence alignment for eukaryotes than existing genome-based methods and thus, lead to better inter-protein contact prediction. Our method shall be useful for protein docking, protein interaction prediction and protein interaction network construction.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in educational attainment are linked to differences in intelligence, and predict important social, economic and health outcomes. Previous studies have found common genetic factors that influence educational achievement, cognitive performance and total brain volume (i.e., brain size). Here, in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank, we investigate the shared genetic basis between educational attainment and fine-grained cerebral cortical morphological features, and associate this genetic variation with a related aspect of cognitive ability. Importantly, we execute novel statistical methods that enable high-dimensional genetic correlation analysis, and compute high-resolution surface maps for the genetic correlations between educational attainment and vertex-wise morphological measurements. We conduct secondary analyses, using the UK Biobank verbal-numerical reasoning score, to confirm that variation in educational attainment that is genetically correlated with cortical morphology is related to differences in cognitive performance. Our analyses reveal the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and cortical thickness measurements in bilateral primary motor cortex and predominantly left superior temporal cortex and proximal regions. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the neurobiology that connects genetic variation to individual differences in educational attainment and cognitive performance.",

Current methods to monitor neural activity, however, lack the necessary conjunction of anatomical spatial coverage, temporal resolution, and long-term stability to measure this distributed activity. Here we introduce a large-scale, multi-site recording platform that integrates polymer electrodes with a modular stacking headstage design supporting up to 1024 recording channels in freely behaving rats. This system can support months-long recordings from hundreds of well-isolated units across multiple brain regions. Moreover, these recordings are stable enough to track 25% of single units for over a week. This platform enables large-scale electrophysiological interrogation of the fast dynamics and long-timescale evolution of anatomically distributed circuits, and thereby provides a new tool for understanding brain activity.",

    "abstract": "From August to November 2017, Madagascar endured an outbreak of plague. A total of 2417 cases of plague were confirmed, causing a death toll of 209. Public health intervention efforts were introduced and successfully stopped the epidemic at the end of November. The plague, however, is endemic in the region and occurs annually, posing the risk of future outbreaks. To understand on the plague transmission, we collected real-time data from official reports, described the outbreaks characteristics, and estimated transmission parameters using statistical and mathematical models. The pneumonic plague epidemic curve exhibited multiple peaks, coinciding with sporadic introductions of new bubonic cases. Optimal climate conditions for rat flea to flourish were observed during the epidemic. Estimate of the plague basic reproduction number during the large wave of the epidemic was high, ranging from 5-7 depending on model assumptions. The incubation and infection period for bubonic and pneumonic plague were 4.3 and 3.4 days and 3.8 and 2.9, respectively. Parameter estimation suggested that even with a small fraction of the population exposed to infected rat fleas (1/10000) and a small probability of transition from a bubonic case to a secondary pneumonic case (3%), the high human-to-human transmission rate can still generate a large outbreak. Controlling rodent and fleas can prevent new index cases, but managing human-to-human transmission is key to prevent large-scale outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Bone adaptation is modulated by the timing, direction, rate, and magnitude of mechanical loads. To investigate whether frequent slow, or infrequent fast, gaits could dominate bone adaptation to load, we compared scaling of the limb bones from two mammalian herbivore clades that use radically different high-speed gaits, bipedal hopping (suborder Macropodiformes; kangaroos and kin) and quadrupedal galloping (order Artiodactyla; goats, deer and kin). Forelimb and hindlimb bones were collected from 20 artiodactyl and 15 macropod species (body mass M 1.05 - 1536 kg) and scanned in computed tomography or X- ray microtomography. Second moment of area (Imax) and bone length (l) were measured. Scaling relations (y = axb) were calculated for l vs M for each bone and for Imax vs M and Imax vs l for every 5% of length. Imax vs M scaling relationships were broadly similar between clades despite the macropod forelimb being nearly unloaded, and the hindlimb highly loaded, during bipedal hopping. Imax vs l and l vs M scaling were related to locomotor and behavioural specialisations. Low-intensity loads may be sufficient to maintain bone mass across a wide range of species. Occasional high-intensity gaits might not break through the load sensitivity saturation engendered by frequent low-intensity gaits.",

    "abstract": "The effect of biochemical environmental signals on cell mechanisms has been the subject of numerous studies for a long time. However, the in-vitro studies of biophysical cues on cells and tissues have recently become a popular focus of research. The development of micro-fabrication techniques has allowed the study of certain aspects of cell-substrate interactions in a more detailed form. Micro-topographical patterns on the cell substrates have been used to study many cell functions such as cell migration, adhesion, gene expression, cell division and differentiation. An understanding of cell-substrate interactions and the potential ability to control the interactions have very important applications in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. We have fabricated ridge-groove micro patterns on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different ridge widths (8m, 10m, 12 m, 25m and 50m) using standard photolithography technique. We used these patterns to print fibronectin stripes on PDMS substrates. NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells were cultured on these stripes and the dynamics of morphological changes were monitored in steady spreading phase (S-phase). Our data revealed that the thickness of the cell, measured by confocal microscopy, is considerably larger (approximately 40%) among the cells spreading on narrower stripes (8m, 10m and 12m) compared to the cells expanding on wider (including control) patterns. The number of perinuclear actin stress fibers is significantly lower among narrower stripes which probably explains the cell thickness results. Confocal microscopy revealed that the cellular volume increases during cell adhesion processes and volume increase is positively correlated with the width of stripes. Nuclear volume also increases considerably during cell adhesion; however, confining cells on fibronectin stripes reduces nuclear volume enlargement independent from the of stripe size.",

Following filters applied through assessment of true expression and frame selection, open-source tools are leveraged to functionally annotate the translated proteins. Downstream features include fast similarity search across three repositories, protein domain assignment, orthologous gene family assessment, and Gene Ontology term assignment. The final annotation integrates across multiple databases and selects an optimal assignment from a combination of weighted metrics describing similarity search score, taxonomic relationship, and informativeness. Researchers have the option to include additional filters to identify and remove contaminants, identify associated pathways, and prepare the transcripts for enrichment analysis. This fully featured pipeline is easy to install, configure, and runs significantly faster than comparable annotation packages.

Moreover, we cannot use the results of these correlations to distinguish proportional recovery from recovery which is either not consistently proportional, or not proportional at all.\\n\\nInterpretationAnalyses relating baseline scores to subsequent change are a minefield: our formal analysis applies as consistently outside the area of stroke as it does within it. One implication of our analysis is that the proportional recovery rule is not as predictive of real recovery after stroke as recent empirical studies suggest.

To fill this gap, we systematically elucidated the key algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and developed mathematically valid quantitative metrics for evaluating them. We then created approaches to simulate realistic tumour genomes, harbouring all known mutation types and processes both clonally and subclonally.

For the well-characterized NA12878 human sample, Clairvoyante achieved 99.73%, 97.68% and 95.36% precision on known variants, and 98.65%, 92.57%, 87.26% F1-score for whole-genome analysis, using Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data, respectively. Training on a second human sample shows Clairvoyante is sample agnostic and finds variants in less than two hours on a standard server. Furthermore, we identified 3,135 variants that are missed using Illumina but supported independently by both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore reads. Clairvoyante is available open-source (https://github.com/aquaskyline/Clairvoyante), with modules to train, utilize and visualize the model.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic heads are ubiquitously used to record and read on magnetic tapes in technologies as diverse as old cassettes or VHS tapes, modern hard drive disks, or magnetic bands in credit/debit or subway cards. They are designed to convert electric signals into fluctuations on the magnetic field at very high frequencies, crucial for the high density storage which is demanded nowadays. Here, we twist this traditional use of magnetic heads and implement one in a new force spectrometer design, where the magnetic field is used to pull on proteins tethered to superparamagnetic beads. Our instrument offers the same features as magnetic tweezers--intrinsic force-clamp conditions, with accurate control of the force, and intrinsic stability--, but with the novel ability of changing the force instantaneously, which allows to investigate protein dynamics at very short timescales, or under arbitrary force signals. We calibrate our instrument by relying on Karlqvist approximation of the field created by a magnetic head--the first building block of magnetic recording theory--through the force scaling of the unfolding/folding step-sizes of protein L, used as a molecular template. This results in a force range between 0 and 50 pN, when working at distances above 250 m, and electric currents up to 1 A. We illustrate the potential of our instrument by studying the folding mechanism of protein L upon ultra-fast force quenches. This allows us to describe that, in a short timescale of 50 ms, the unfolded protein L evolves to an ensemble of weak collapsed states, eventually acquiring the native conformation in a timescale of seconds. Our instrumental development provides a unique capability of interrogating individual molecules under fast-changing force signals, which opens a range of novel force spectroscopy schemes of unexplored biological significance.",

Our understanding of genetic events which drive EAC development is limited and there are few molecular biomarkers for prognostication or therapeutics. We have accumulated a cohort of 551 genomically characterised EACs (73% WGS and 27% WES) with clinical annotation and matched RNA-seq. Using a variety of driver gene detection methods, we discover 77 EAC driver genes (73% novel) and 21 non-coding driver elements (95% novel), and describe mutation and CNV types with specific functional impact. We identify a mean of 4.4 driver events per case derived from both copy number events and mutations. We compare driver mutation rates to the exome-wide mutational excess calculated using Non-synonymous vs Synonymous mutation rates (dNdS). We observe mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of events within and between a number of EAC pathways (GATA factors, Core Cell cycle genes, TP53 regulators and the SWI/SNF complex) suggestive of important functional relationships. These driver variants correlate with tumour differentiation, sex and prognosis. Poor prognostic indicators (SMAD4, GATA4) are verified in independent cohorts with significant predictive value.

Tracts of identical amino acids accumulate in these regions and can vary in length over generations due to expansions and retractions of short tandem repeats at the genomic level. However, little attention has been paid to what extent length variation is shaped by natural selection. By environmental association analysis on 2,514 length variable tracts in 770 whole-genome sequenced wild Arabidopsis thaliana we show that length variation in glutamine and asparagine amino acid homopolymers, as well as in interaction hotspots, correlate with local bio-climatic habitat. We determined experimentally that the promoter activity of a light-stress gene depended on polyglutamine length variants in a disordered transcription factor. Our results show that length variations impact protein function and are substantially shaped by natural selection.

    "abstract": "The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans lacks a conventional sexual program and is thought to evolve, at least primarily, through the clonal acquisition of genetic changes. Here, we performed an analysis of heterozygous diploid genomes from 21 clinical isolates to determine the natural evolutionary processes acting on the C. albicans genome. Consistent with a model of inheritance by descent, most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shared between closely related strains. However, strain-specific SNPs and insertions/deletions (indels) were distributed non-randomly across the genome. For example, base substitution rates were higher in the immediate vicinity of indels, and heterozygous regions of the genome contained significantly more strain-specific polymorphisms than homozygous regions. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events also contributed substantially to genotypic variation, with most long-tract LOH events extending to the ends of the chromosomes suggestive of repair via break-induced replication. Importantly, some isolates contained highly mosaic genomes and failed to cluster closely with other isolates within their assigned clades. Mosaicism is consistent with strains having experienced inter-clade recombination during their evolutionary history and a detailed examination of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes revealed striking examples of recombination. Together, our analyses reveal that both (para)sexual recombination and mitotic mutational processes drive evolution of this important pathogen in nature. To further facilitate the study of genome differences we also introduce an online platform, SNPMap, to examine SNP patterns in sequenced C. albicans genomes.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMutations introduce variation into the genome upon which selection can act. Defining the nature of these changes is critical for determining species evolution, as well as for understanding the genetic changes driving important cellular processes such as carcinogenesis. The fungus Candida albicans is a heterozygous diploid species that is both a frequent commensal organism and a prevalent opportunistic pathogen. Prevailing theory is that C. albicans evolves primarily through the gradual build-up of mutations, and a pressing question is whether sexual or parasexual processes also operate within natural populations. Here, we determine the evolutionary patterns of genetic change that have accompanied species evolution in nature by examining genomic differences between clinical isolates. We establish that the C. albicans genome evolves by a combination of base-substitution mutations, insertions/deletion events, and both short-tract and long-tract loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. These mutations are unevenly distributed across the genome, and reveal that non-coding regions and heterozygous regions are evolving more quickly than coding regions and homozygous regions, respectively. Furthermore, we provide evidence that genetic exchange has occurred between isolates, establishing that sexual or parasexual processes have transpired in C. albicans populations and contribute to the diversity of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human pathogen that causes health-care associated blood stream infections (BSI). Although P. aeruginosa BSI are associated with high mortality rates, the clinical relevance of pathogen-derived prognostic biomarker to identify patients at risk for unfavorable outcome remains largely unexplored. We found novel pathogen-derived prognostic biomarker candidates by applying a multi-omics approach on a multicenter sepsis patient cohort. Multi-level Cox regression was used to investigate the relation between patient characteristics and pathogen features (2298 accessory genes, 1078 core protein levels, 107 parsimony-informative variations in reported virulence factors) with 30-day mortality. Our analysis revealed that presence of the helP gene encoding a putative DEAD-box helicase was independently associated with a fatal outcome (hazard ratio 2.01, p = 0.05). helP is located within a region related to the pathogenicity island PAPI-1 in close proximity to a pil gene cluster, which has been associated with horizontal gene transfer. Besides helP, elevated protein levels of the bacterial flagellum protein FliL (hazard ratio 3.44, p < 0.001) and of a bacterioferritin-like protein (hazard ratio 1.74, p = 0.003) increased the risk of death, while high protein levels of a putative aminotransferase were associated with an improved outcome (hazard ratio 0.12, p < 0.001). The prognostic potential of biomarker candidates and clinical factors was confirmed with different machine learning approaches using training and hold-out datasets. The helP genotype appeared the most attractive biomarker for clinical risk stratification due to its relevant predictive power and ease of detection.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, a major limitation of hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was that resolution of deuterium localization information was limited to the length of the peptide generated during proteolysis. Recently, however, it has been demonstrated that electron transfer dissociation (ETD) allows for preservation of deuterium label in the gas phase and therefore can be used to obtain more resolved information. To date, this technology has remained mostly limited to single, small, already well-characterized model proteins. Here, we optimize, expand, and adapt HDX-MS/MS capabilities to accommodate histone and nucleosomal complexes on top-down (TD) HDX-MS/MS and middle-down (MD) HDX-MS/MS platforms and demonstrate that near site-specific resolution of deuterium localization can be obtained with high reproducibility. We are able to study histone tail dynamics in unprecedented detail, which have evaded rigorous analysis by traditional structural biology techniques for decades, revealing important novel insights into chromatin biology. This work represents the first heterogeneous protein complex and protein-DNA complex to be analyzed by TD- and MD-HDX-MS/MS, respectively. Together, the results of these studies highlight the versatility, reliability, and reproducibility of ETD-based HDX-MS/MS methodology to interrogate large protein and protein/DNA complexes.",

    "abstract": "Rice yield is greatly reduced due to rice blast, a worldwide multi-cycle fungal disease caused by the ascomycete Magnaporthe oryzae. Previously, Bacillus cereus HS24 was isolated from rice growing area, which showed a strong bio-control effect on M. oryzae. In order to better exploit it as a bio-control agent, HS24 has been studied for its mechanism of controlling rice blast. Our results showed that conidial germination of M. oryzae was significantly inhibited by HS24 suspension, n and the inhibition rate reached to 97.83% at the concentration of 10 CFU/ml. The transcriptional level of CAMKII, PMC1 and CCH1, which are key genes involved in Ca2+ signaling pathway, were significantly decreased in HS24-treated conidia. The treatment of M. oryzae with Ca2+ signaling pathway inhibitors KN-93, Verapamil, and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) significantly reduced conidial germination rate and inhibited germ tube elongation. This inhibition effect was found to be concentration-dependent, similar to the HS24 treatment. By quantifying free Ca2+ in M. oryzae conidia, a significant reduction of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in HS24-treated conidia in comparison to sterile water-treated conidia was found. The addition of exogenous Ca2+ did not abolish the inhibitory effect of HS24 on the reduction of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and conidial germination. In conclusion, B. cereus HS24 can inhibit conidial germination by suppressing Ca2+ signaling in M. oryzae, and thus offers a great potential as a bio-control agent in rice blast management.\\n\\nImportanceIn the bio-control of rice blast, most of researches focused on the inhibitory effect of bio-control agents on development of M. oryzae, including inhibition of conidia germination, germ tube deformity, mycelium growth inhibition, etc, while little work has elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the various phenotypic change in M. oryzae. In order to better exploit HS24 as a potential bio-control agent, we studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppression of B. cereus HS24 on M. oryzae Guy11, and draw the conclusion that HS24 may inhibit conidia germination and germ tube elongation through inhibiting the Ca2+ signaling pathway. In this study, we characterized the morphological and physiological changes of M. oryzae when interacting with B. cereus HS24, and further investgated the responses of M. oryzae Ca2+ signallig pathway to HS24 treatment. Thus we have provided one more piece for the B. cereus / M. oryzae supression puzzle at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite considerable efforts, few drugs are available for the treatment of alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) use disorders (AUDs). Ethanol directly or indirectly modulates several aspects of the central nervous system, including neurotransmitter/neuromodulator systems. Relapse vulnerability is a challenge for the treatment of EtOH addiction. Ethanol withdrawal symptoms create motivational states that lead to compulsive EtOH drinking and relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Among the therapeutics to treat AUDs, naltrexone (NTX) is a pharmacological treatment for relapse. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of NTX on EtOH drinking in EtOH-dependent male and female rats during abstinence.\\n\\nMethodsWistar rats (males and females) were first trained to orally self-administer 10% EtOH. Half of them were then made dependent by chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) vapor exposure, and the other half were exposed to air. Using this model, rats exhibit somatic and motivational signs of withdrawal. At the end of EtOH vapor (or air) exposure, the rats were tested for the effects of NTX (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on EtOH self-administration at three abstinence time points: acute abstinence (8 h, A-Abst), late abstinence (2 weeks, L-Abst), and protracted abstinence (6 weeks, P-Abst).\\n\\nResultsNTX decreased EtOH intake in nondependent rats, regardless of sex and abstinence time point. In post-dependent rats, the effects of NTX improved with a longer abstinence time (i.e., L-Abst and P-Abst) in males, whereas it similarly reduced EtOH drinking in females at all abstinence points.\\n\\nConclusionsThe data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of NTX depends on the time of intervention during abstinence and sex. The data further suggest that EtOH dependence induces different neuroadaptations in male and female rats, reflected by differential effects of NTX. The results underscore the significance of considering the duration of EtOH abstinence and sex for the development of pharmacotherapeutic treatments for AUD.",

Here we study one such system, which is broadly inspired by the interaction between an mRNA molecule and an antagonistic microRNA molecule encoded by the same gene. The two reaction species are synchronously produced, individually degraded, and the second species (microRNA) exerts an antagonistic pressure on the first species (mRNA). Using linear-noise approximation, we show that the noise in the first species, which we quantify by the Fano factor, is sub-Poissonian, and exhibits a nonmonotonic response both to the species lifetime ratio and to the strength of the antagonistic interaction. Additionally, we use the Chemical Reaction Network Theory to prove that the first species distribution is Poissonian if the first species is much more stable than the second. Finally, we identify a special parametric regime, supporting a broad range of behaviour, in which the distribution can be analytically described in terms of the confluent hypergeometric limit function. We verify our analysis against large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.

    "abstract": "Animal individuals show patterns of behavior that are stable within individuals but different among individuals. Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences effect foraging performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of foraging performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of foraging performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging performance depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavior syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria anchor to their host cells through their adhesive pili, which must resist the large mechanical stresses induced by the host as it attempts to dislodge the pathogens. The pili of Gram-positive bacteria are constructed as a single polypeptide made of hundreds of pilin repeats, which contain intramolecular isopeptide bonds strategically located in the structure to prevent their unfolding under force, protecting the pilus from degradation by extant proteases and oxygen radicals. Here, we demonstrate the design of a short peptide that blocks the formation of the isopeptide bond present in the pilin Spy0128 from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, resulting in mechanically labile pilin domains. We use a combination of protein engineering and AFM force spectroscopy to demonstrate that the peptide blocks the formation of the native isopeptide bond and compromises the mechanics of the domain. While an intact Spy0128 is inextensible at any force, peptide-modified Spy0128 pilins readily unfold at very low forces, marking the abrogation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond as well as the absence of a stable pilin fold. We propose that isopeptide-blocking peptides could be further developed as a novel type of highly-specific anti-adhesive antibiotics to treat Gram-positive pathogens.\\n\\nSignificanceAt the onset of an infection, Gram-positive bacteria adhere to host cells through their pili, filamentous structures built by hundreds of repeats of pilin proteins. These proteins can withstand large mechanical challenges without unfolding, remaining anchored to the host and resisting cleavage by proteases and oxygen radicals present in the targeted tissues. The key structural component that gives pilins mechanical resilience are internal isopeptide bonds, strategically placed so that pilins become inextensible structures. We target this bond by designing a blocking peptide that interferes with its formation during folding. We demonstrate that peptide-modified pilins lack mechanical stability and extend at low forces. We propose this strategy as a rational design of mechanical antibiotics, targeting the Achilles Heel of bacterial adhesion.",

    "abstract": "DsbA is a ubiquitous bacterial oxidoreductase that associates with substrates during and after translocation, yet its involvement in protein folding and translocation remains an open question. Here we demonstrate a redox-controlled chaperone activity of DsbA, on both cysteine-containing and cysteine-free substrate, using a magnetic tweezers-based single molecule force spectroscopy that enables independent measurements of oxidoreductase activity and chaperone behavior. Interestingly we found, this chaperone activity is tuned by the oxidation state of DsbA; oxidized DsbA is a strong promoter of folding, but the effect is weakened by reduction of the catalytic CXXC motif. We further localize the chaperone binding site of DsbA using a seven-residue peptide which effectively blocks the chaperone activity. We calculated that DsbA assisted folding of proteins in the periplasm generates enough mechanical work to decrease the ATP consumption needed for periplasmic translocation by up to 33%. In turn, pharmacologic inhibition of this chaperone activity may open up a new class of anti-virulence agents.",

In particular, the conformational changes occurring in the pore domain and resulting in ionic conduction have not been identified yet. Here, we suggest a hypothetical molecular mechanism for TRPV1 activation, which involves the rotation of a conserved asparagine in S6 from the S4-S5 linker toward the pore. This rotation is correlated with the dehydration of four peripheral cavities located between S6 and the S4-S5 linker and the hydration of the pore. In light of our hypothesis, we perform bioinformatics analyses of TRP and other evolutionary related ion channels, analyze newly available structures and re-examine previously reported water accessibility and mutagenesis experiments. Overall, we provide several independent lines of evidence that corroborate our hypothesis. Finally, we show that the proposed molecular mechanism is compatible with the currently existing idea that in TRPV1 the selectivity filter acts as a secondary gate.",

    "abstract": "Novel insect identification techniques often lead to speculation on whether the method could cope with any intraspecific variation that might occur in a species. Using I3S Classic (Interactive Individual Identification System, Classic) and images of mosquito wings, different mosquito strains were tested with a copy of the strain present or absent from the database which contained images of other strains of the test species. When a wing image of the exact species, strain and sex was present in the database, there was 100% (or near 100%) retrieval of the correct species and strain at rank one. When the exact strain was absent from the database, but other strains of the same species were present, the retrieval rates at rank one were again high (100%) in the majority of cases and when they were not, the correct species was generally retrieved at rank two. Out of 40 different species and strains tested, only three were significantly different at rank one when the exact strain was absent from the database. In general, images of field strains selected for each other and therefore were similar to each other in greater numbers and instances than for the laboratory strains tested. When a copy of a strain was absent from the database, but other strains/sibling species were present, I3S retrieved the correct strains/sibling species at rank one in the majority of cases. In the one case of transgenic mosquitoes tested, I3S could reliably be used to identify transgenic mosquitoes from the parent stock as they were retrieved 100% at rank one when both the transgenic and unmodified parent strains were present in the database. This indicates the potential of using I3S to distinguish transgenic or other selectively bred strains from a parent strain, also selectively bred and wild mosquitoes, at least in the first phase after field release. Similarly, hybrid strains, sibling species and members of species complexes as in the Anopheles gambiae species complex could also be correctly identified when copies of all the relevant species/strains/siblings were in the database. This contradicts the belief that only molecular characterisation could separate A. gambiae s.s. from A. coluzzii, or A. arabiensis; I3S could accurately separate them all. I3S worked as it was set up to do, retrieving closely resembling images of the test insects from the database and ranking them in order of similarity. Dealing with any intraspecific variation was therefore not an issue if the software (I3S) was used systematically. I3S complements molecular and traditional taxonomic methods for species identification and the separation of sibling complexes and strains. In future, it should become the norm to maintain databases of insect wings and other body part images for use in image recognition.",

    "abstract": "Sequence analysis of the various ribosomal genetic markers is the dominant molecular method for identification and description of fungi. However, there is little agreement on what ribosomal markers should be used, and research groups utilize different markers depending on what fungal groups are targeted. New environmental fungal lineages known only from DNA data reveal significant gaps in the coverage of the fungal kingdom both in terms of taxonomy and marker coverage in the reference sequence databases. In order to integrate references covering all of the ribosomal markers, we present three sets of general primers that allow the amplification of the complete ribosomal operon from the ribosomal tandem repeats. The primers cover all ribosomal markers (ETS, SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, LSU, and IGS) from the 5 end of the ribosomal operon all the way to the 3 end. We coupled these primers successfully with third generation sequencing (PacBio and Nanopore sequencing) to showcase our approach on authentic fungal herbarium specimens. In particular, we were able to generate high-quality reference data with Nanopore sequencing in a high-throughput manner, showing that the generation of reference data can be achieved on a regular desktop computer without the need for a large-scale sequencing facility. The quality of the Nanopore generated sequences was 99.85 %, which is comparable with the 99.78 % accuracy described for Sanger sequencing. With this work, we hope to stimulate the generation of a new comprehensive standard of ribosomal reference data with the ultimate aim to close the huge gaps in our reference datasets.",

    "abstract": "With an ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic strains, new strategies are required to prepare for the next emergent coronavirus (CoV). Previously, groups had targeted conserved coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a conserved 2O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, combining a 2O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2O MTase in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.\\n\\nSignificanceEmergent coronaviruses remain a significant threat to global public health and rapid response vaccine platforms are needed to stem future outbreaks. However, failure of many previous CoV vaccine formulations has clearly highlighted the need to test efficacy under different conditions and especially in vulnerable populations like the aged and immune-compromised. This study illustrates that despite success in young models, the NSP16 mutant carries too much risk for pathogenesis and reversion in vulnerable models to be used as a stand-alone vaccine strategy. Importantly, the NSP16 mutation can be paired with other attenuating approaches to provide robust protection from heterologous challenge and in vulnerable populations. Coupled with increased safety and reduced pathogenesis, the study highlights the potential for NSP16 attenuation as a major component of future live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Significance StatementObesity is a serious and widespread health problem which has become a growing concern in many societies. Most currently available weight-loss medications do not work for everyone, and the effects decline over time. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify new molecular targets to improve drug development for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases. In this study, we discovered that the histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) enzyme is a key regulator of metabolism and obesity, and the absence of HDAC11 prevents obesity in mice. Our findings will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to treat obesity by targeting HDAC11.\\n\\nAbstractObesity and its associated metabolic syndromes are the consequence of susceptible genes and obesogenic environments. We report here that histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) plays a critical role in the development of obesity and in metabolic homeostasis. HDAC11 knockout mice display resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and associated syndromes by enhancing glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, attenuating hypercholesterolemia and hyperinsulinemia, and blocking hepatosteatosis and liver damage. Mechanistically, HDAC11 deficiency boosts energy expenditure through promoting thermogenic capacity, which attributes to the elevation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression and activity in brown adipose tissue. Moreover, loss of HDAC11 stimulates mitochondrial oxidation, elevates plasma adiponectin, and activates the adiponectin-AdipoR-AMPK pathway in the liver, which may contribute to a reversal in hepatosteatosis. These findings establish HDAC11 as a key regulator of metabolism and indicate that HDAC11 inhibitors may hold promise for treating overweight and obesity-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated experiments focused on transcriptional responses and chromatin states are well-equipped to capture different epigenomic and transcriptomic levels governing the circuitry of a regulatory network. We propose a workflow for the genome-wide identification of epigenomic and transcriptional cooperation to elucidate transcriptional networks in cancer. Gene promoter annotation in combination with network analysis and sequence-resolution of enriched transcriptional motifs in epigenomic data reveals transcription factor families that act synergistically with epigenomic master regulators. A close teamwork of the transcriptional and epigenomic machinery was discovered. The network is tightly connected and includes the histone lysine demethylase KDM3A, basic helix-loop-helix factors MYC, HIF1A, and SREBF1, as well as differentiation factors AP1, MYOD1, SP1, MEIS1, ZEB1 and ELK1. In such a cooperation network, one component opens the chromatin, another one recognizes gene-specific DNA motifs, others scaffold between histones, cofactors, and the transcriptional complex. In cancer, due to the ability to team up with transcription factors, epigenetic factors concert mitogenic and metabolic gene networks, claiming the role of a cancer master regulators or epioncogenes.\\n\\nSpecific histone modification patterns are commonly associated with open or closed chromatin states, and are linked to distinct biological outcomes by transcriptional activation or repression. Disruption of patterns of histone modifications is associated with loss of proliferative control and cancer. There is tremendous therapeutic potential in understanding and targeting histone modification pathways. Thus, investigating cooperation of chromatin remodelers and the transcriptional machinery is not only important for elucidating fundamental mechanisms of chromatin regulation, but also necessary for the design of targeted therapeutics.",

To understand junction formation during cytokinesis, we explored in Drosophila epithelium, de novo formation of tricellular septate junctions (TCJs). We found that upon midbody formation, the membranes of the two daughter cells and of the neighbouring cells located below the adherens junction (AJ) remain entangled in a 4-cell structure apposed to the midbody. The septate junction protein Discs-Large and components of the TCJ, Gliotactin and Anakonda accumulate in this 4-cell structure. Subsequently, a basal movement of the midbody parallels the detachment of the neighbouring cell membranes from the midbody, the disengagement of the daughter cells from their neighbours and the reorganisation of TCJs between the two daughter cells and their neighbouring cells. While the movement of midbody is independent of the Alix and Shrub abscission regulators, the loss of Gliotactin or Anakonda function impedes both the resolution of the connection between the daughter-neighbour cells and midbody movement. TCJ proteins therefore control an additional step of cytokinesis necessary for the disentanglement of the daughter cells and their neighbours during cytokinesis.",

Here, we characterize century-scale growth records of inner and outer reef corals across ~200 km of the Florida Keys Reef Tract (FKRT) using skeletal cores extracted from two ubiquitous reef-building species, Siderastrea siderea and Pseudodiploria strigosa. We find that corals across the FKRT have sustained extension and calcification rates over the past century but have experienced a long-term reduction in skeletal density, regardless of reef zone. Notably, P. strigosa colonies exhibit temporary reef zone-dependent reductions in extension rate corresponding to two known extreme temperature events in 1969-70 and 1997-98. We propose that the subtropical climate of the FKRT may buffer corals from chronic growth declines associated with climate warming, though the significant reduction in skeletal density may indicate underlying vulnerability to present and future trends in ocean acidification.",

In C. elegans, we conducted an unbiased genetic screen to identify mutations that could ameliorate the developmental arrest phenotype of a heat-shock factor mutant. Here we show that loss of the conserved translational activator rsks-1/S6-Kinase, a downstream effector of TOR kinase, can rescue the developmental-arrest phenotype of hsf-1 partial loss-of-function mutants. Unexpectedly, we show that the rescue is not likely caused by reduced translation, nor to activation of any of a variety of stress-protective genes and pathways.

Ribosome biogenesis is central to cellular metabolic regulation, and several diseases are associated with rDNA dysfunction, notably cancer, However, its highly repetitive nature has severely limited characterization of the elements responsible for rDNA function. Here we make use of phylogenetic footprinting to provide a comprehensive list of novel, potentially functional elements in the human rDNA. Complete rDNA sequences for six non-human primate species were constructed using de novo whole genome assemblies. These new sequences were used to determine the conservation profile of the human rDNA, revealing 49 conserved regions in the rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS). To provide insights into the potential roles of these conserved regions, the conservation profile was integrated with functional genomics datasets. We find two major zones that contain conserved elements characterised by enrichment of transcription-associated chromatin factors, and transcription. Conservation of some IGS transcripts in the apes underpins the potential functional significance of these transcripts and the elements controlling their expression. Our results characterize the conservation landscape of the human IGS, and suggest that noncoding transcription and chromatin elements are conserved and important features of this unique genomic region.",

    "abstract": "Polymyxin B and E (colistin) have been pivotal in the treatment of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections, with increasing use over the past decade. Unfortunately, resistance to these antibiotics is rapidly emerging. The structurally-related octapeptin C4 (OctC4) has shown significant potency against XDR bacteria, including against polymyxin-resistant (Pmx-R) strains, but its mode of action remains undefined. We sought to compare and contrast the acquisition of XDR Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST258) resistance in vitro with all three lipopeptides to help elucidate the mode of action of the drugs and potential mechanisms of resistance evolution. Strikingly, 20 days of exposure to the polymyxins resulted in a dramatic (1000-fold) increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the polymyxins, reflecting the evolution of resistance seen in clinical isolates, whereas for OctC4 only a 4-fold increase was witnessed. There was no cross-resistance observed between the polymyxin - and octapeptin-induced resistant strains. Sequencing revealed previously known gene alterations for polymyxin resistance, including crrB, mgrB, pmrB, phoPQ and yciM, and novel mutations in qseC. In contrast, mutations in mlaDF and pqiB, 1genes related to phospholipid transport, were found in octapeptin-resistant isolates. Mutation effects were validated via complementation assays. These genetic variations were reflected in phenotypic changes to lipid A. Pmx-R isolates increased 4-amino-4-deoxy-arabinose fortification to phosphate groups of lipid A, whereas OctC4 induced strains harbored a higher abundance of hydroxymyristate and palmitoylate. The results reveal a differing mode of action compared to polymyxins which provides hope for future therapeutics to combat the increasingly threat of XDR bacteria.",

    "abstract": "A recent study posted on bioRxiv by Bowring, Maumet and Nichols aimed to compare results of FMRI data that had been processed with three commonly used software packages (AFNI, FSL and SPM). Their stated purpose was to use \\\"default\\\" settings of each softwares pipeline for task-based FMRI, and then to quantify overlaps in final clustering results and to measure similarity/dissimilarity in the final outcomes of packages. While in theory the setup sounds simple (implement each packages defaults and compare results), practical realities make this difficult. For example, different softwares would recommend different spatial resolutions of the final data, but for the sake of comparisons, the same value must be used across all. Moreover, we would say that AFNI does not have an explicit default pipeline available: a wide diversity of datasets and study designs are acquired across the neuroimaging community, often requiring bespoke tailoring of basic processing rather than a \\\"one-size-fits-all\\\" pipeline. However, we do have strong recommendations for certain steps, and we are also aware that the choice of a given step might place requirements on other processing steps. Given the very clear reporting of the AFNI pipeline used in Bowring et al. paper, we take this opportunity to comment on some of these aspects of processing with AFNI here, clarifying a few mistakes therein and also offering recommendations. We provide point-by-point considerations of using AFNIs processing pipeline design tool at the individual level, afni_proc.py, along with supplementary programs; while specifically discussed in the context of the present usage, many of these choices may serve as useful starting points for broader processing. It is our intention/hope that the user should examine data quality at every step, and we demonstrate how this is facilitated in AFNI, as well.",

    "abstract": "Vocalizations are an essential medium for communication and courtship in numerous mammalian species ranging from mice to humans. In mammals, the midbrain PAG serves as an obligatory node in a vocalization-related network that spans the forebrain and brainstem1-3, as bilateral lesions of the PAG result in mutism2-5. Despite the PAGs importance for vocal production, the identity, function, and connectivity of PAG neurons involved in vocalization has remained elusive, in part because the PAG is a functionally and anatomically heterogeneous structure that serves myriad roles including nociception, defensive behaviors, and autonomic regulation6-9. Here we used a viral genetic \\\"tagging\\\" method10,11 to identify a distinct subset of PAG neurons in the male mouse that are selectively activated during the production of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) elicited by female cues. Silencing these PAG-USV neurons rendered males mute without affecting their other courtship behaviors and also impaired their ability to attract female mice in a social choice assay. Activating these neurons using chemogenetic or optogenetic methods strongly elevated USV production, even in the absence of female cues. Notably, the timing of individual USVs was entrained to the expiratory phase of breathing but not to the pattern of optogenetic stimulation, suggesting that PAG-USV neural activity initiates and sets the duration of vocal bouts and recruits downstream premotor circuits that precisely pattern vocal output. Consistent with this idea, we found that PAG-USV neurons extend axons into pontine and medullary regions that are speculated to contain premotor central pattern generators important for vocalization3,12,13. These experiments establish the identity of the PAG neurons selectively required for USV production in mice, map their efferent connections, and demonstrate the communicative salience of male USVs in promoting female social affiliation.",

    "abstract": "To ensure accurate DNA replication, a replisome must effectively overcome numerous obstacles on its DNA substrate. After encountering an obstacle, a progressing replisome often aborts DNA synthesis but continues to unwind the DNA, resulting in a gap in the newly replicated DNA. However, little is known about how DNA synthesis is resumed downstream of an obstacle. Here, we examine the consequences of a non-replicating replisome collision with a co-directional RNA polymerase (RNAP). Using single-molecule and ensemble methods, we find that T7 helicase interacts strongly with a non-replicating T7 DNA polymerase (DNAP) at a replication fork. As the helicase advances the fork, the DNAP also moves forward processively, via its association with the helicase. The presence of the DNAP, in turn, increases both helicases processivity and unwinding rate. We show that such a DNAP, together with its helicase, is indeed able to actively disrupt a stalled transcription elongation complex, and then initiates replication using the RNA transcript as a primer. These observations exhibit T7 helicases novel role in replication re-initiation, independent of replication restart proteins or primase.",

    "abstract": "We have performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the structural mechanism for relief of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by phospholamban (PLB) at saturating Ca2+ conditions. Reversal of SERCA-PLB inhibition by saturating Ca2+ operates as a physiological rheostat to reactivate SERCA function in the absence of PLB phosphorylation. Simulation of the inhibitory complex at super-physiological Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]=10 mM) revealed that calcium ions interact primarily with SERCA and the lipid headgroups, but not with the cytosolic domain of PLB or the cytosolic side of the SERCA-PLB interface. At this [Ca2+], a single Ca2+ ion is translocated from the cytosol to the transmembrane transport sites. We used this Ca2+-bound complex as an initial structure to simulate the effects of saturating Ca2+ at physiological conditions ([Ca2+]total{approx}400 M). At these conditions, ~30% of the Ca2+-bound complexes exhibit structural features that correspond to an inhibited state. However, in ~70% of the Ca2+-bound complexes, Ca2+ moves to transport site I, recruits Glu771 and Asp800, and disrupts key inhibitory contacts involving conserved PLB residue Asn34. Structural analysis showed that Ca2+ induces only local changes in interresidue inhibitory interactions, but does not induce dissociation, repositioning or changes in the structural dynamics of PLB. Upon relief of SERCA inhibition, Ca2+ binding produces a productive site I configuration that is sufficient for subsequent SERCA activation. We propose that at saturating [Ca2+] and in the absence of PLB phosphorylation, binding of a single Ca2+ ion in the transport sites rapidly shifts the equilibrium toward a non-inhibited SERCA-PLB complex.",

    "abstract": "Genomic datasets continue to increase in size and ease of production for a wider selection of species including non-model organisms. For many of these species highly contiguous and well-annotated genomes are unavailable due to their prohibitive complexity and cost. As a result, a common starting point for genomic work in non-model species is the production of a linkage map, which involves the grouping and relative ordering of genetic markers along the genome. Dense linkage maps facilitate the analysis of genomic data in a variety of ways, from broad scale observations regarding genome structure e.g. chromosome number and type or sex-related structural differences, to fine scale patterns e.g. recombination rate variation and co-localisation of differentiated regions. Here we present both a sex-averaged and sex-specific linkage maps for Coregonus sp. \\\"Albock\\\" containing 5395 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci across 40 linkage groups to facilitate future investigation into the genomic basis of whitefish adaptation and speciation. The map was produced using restriction-site associated digestion (RAD) sequencing data from two wild-caught parents and 156 F1 offspring in Lep-MAP3. We discuss the differences between our sex-avagerated and sex-specific maps and identify synteny between C. sp. \\\"Albock\\\" linkage groups and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) genome. Our synteny analysis confirms that many patterns of homology observed between Atlantic salmon and Oncorhynchus and Salvelinus species are also shared by members of the Coregoninae subfamily.",

Here, we measured genomic transcriptional responses and mRNA accumulation changes after PH and sham surgeries.\\n\\nResultsDuring the first 10-20 hours, the PH- and sham-surgery responses were very similar, including parallel early activation of cell-division-cycle genes. After 20 hours, however, whereas post-PH livers continued with a robust and coordinate cell-division-cycle gene-expression response before returning to the resting state by one week, sham-surgery livers returned directly to a resting gene-expression state. Localization of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and 36 (H3K36me3) on genes dormant in the resting liver and activated during the PH response revealed a general de novo promoter Pol II recruitment and H3K4me3 increase during the early 10-20 hour phase followed by Pol II elongation and H3K36me3 accumulation in gene bodies during the later proliferation phase. H3K36me3, generally appearing at the first-internal exon, was preceded 5' by H3K36me2; 3' of the first-internal exon, in about half of genes H3K36me3 predominated and in the other half H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 co-existed. Further, we observed some unusual gene profiles with abundant Pol II but little evident H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 modification, indicating that these modifications are neither universal nor essential partners to Pol II transcription.\\n\\nConclusionsPH and sham surgical procedures on mice reveal striking early post-operatory gene expression similarities followed by synchronized mRNA accumulation and epigenetic histone mark changes specific to PH.",

    "abstract": "Virulence of Yersinia pestis in mammals requires the type III secretion system, which delivers seven effector proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells to undermine immune responses. All seven of these effectors are conserved across Y. pestis strains, but three - YopJ, YopT, and YpkA - are apparently dispensable for virulence. Some degree of functional redundancy between effector proteins would explain both observations. Here, we use a combinatorial genetic approach to define the minimal subset of effectors required for full virulence in mice following subcutaneous infection. We found that a Y. pestis strain lacking YopJ, YopT, and YpkA is attenuated for virulence in mice, and that addition of any one of these effectors to this strain increases lethality significantly. YopJ, YopT, and YpkA likely contribute to virulence via distinct mechanisms. YopJ is uniquely able to cause macrophage cell death in vitro and to suppress accumulation of inflammatory cells to foci of bacterial growth in deep tissue, whereas YopT and YpkA cannot. The synthetic phenotypes that emerge when YopJ, YopT, and YpkA are removed in combination provide evidence that each enhances Y. pestis virulence, and that YopT and YpkA act through a mechanism distinct from that of YopJ.",

    "abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) arrival in Brazilian territory brought to light the need for preparedness regarding arboviruses in Brazil. Compound screening is a cumbersome process dependent upon in vitro testing and validation. Recently, virtual screening methods have improved precision and reliability providing a framework for in silico testing of lead compound candidates. Here we have applied these methods on compounds that were previously shown to be active against Dengue virus in vitro, taking the structural information of such compounds and applying docking methods to identify putative binding sites. A molecular dynamics approach was also used to refine the docking results. The computational experiments ran here suggests that compounds such as Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ergotamine and Avermectin-B1a bind to active sites on the viral enzymes NS5 and NS3, as well as on its Envelope protein. Refinement shows that such bindings were not lost during the production run and key regions on both enzymes were structurally displaced on average over the simulation time. Interestingly there is no documented drug interactions among these candidates, raising the possibility of drug combinations during treatments. Moreover, the candidate compounds have been extensively studied, thus providing important information regarding intracellular interactions caused by them, which are also associated with pathways exploited by the virus, suggesting possible side interactions hindering the replication process.",

However, exact cleavage site within LcnB bacteriocin, as well as the activity of the resulting peptides remained unknown. Here we further explored the interplay between these two proteins and defined, using mass spectrometry, that the hydrolysis occurs between the sixth and seventh amino acid on the N terminus of LcnB. Although it was suspected that the cleaved form of LcnB could retain some level of activity, both chemically synthesized and recombinant variant of truncated LcnB exhibited no antimicrobial activity. Wild type form of LcnB was recombinantly overexpressed using the same expression system, its antimicrobial activity was tested before and after the treatment with PrtP proteinase, and the degradation products were analyzed with reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The results confirmed the inactivity of the truncated LcnB and additionally corroborated the PrtP cleavage site in LcnB bacteriocin.\\n\\nImportanceLactococcal enzyme PrtP, considered as a growth promoting factor, is involved in casein breakdown and enabling bacteria efficient growth in amino acids-poor, but protein-rich media. However, its interaction with bacteriocins was not known until recently. Bacteriocin LcnB can also be considered as growth promoting factor, since its known physiological role mirrors in preventing competing bacteria of reaching high growth densities. In this manuscript, we define the exact peptide bond inside the bacteriocin LcnB which is recognized by PrtP. This N-terminal removal of six amino acids completely inactivates the bacteriocin. The biological function of such action remains elusive. It is unexpected that in the same strain one enzyme inactivates a protein important for survival, unless it is some type of regulation.",

    "abstract": "Integrating evidence over time is crucial for effective decision making. For simple perceptual decisions, a large body of work suggests that humans and animals are capable of integrating evidence over time fairly well, but that their performance is far from optimal. This suboptimality is thought to arise from a number of different sources including: (1) noise in sensory and motor systems, (2) unequal weighting of evidence over time, (3) order effects from previous trials and (4) irrational side biases for one choice over another. In this work we investigated these di.erent sources of suboptimality and how they are related to pupil dilation, a putative correlate of norepinephrine tone. In particular, we measured pupil response in humans making a series of decisions based on rapidly-presented auditory information in an evidence accumulation task. We found that people exhibited all four types of suboptimality, and that some of these suboptimalities covaried with each other across participants. Pupillometry showed that only noise and the uneven weighting of evidence over time, the  integration kernel, were related to the change in pupil response during the stimulus. Moreover, these two different suboptimalities were related to different aspects of the pupil signal, with the individual differences in pupil response associated with individual differences in integration kernel, while trial-by-trial fluctuations in pupil response were associated with trial-by-trial fluctuations in noise. These results suggest that di.erent sources of suboptimality in human perceptual decision making are related to distinct pupil-linked processes possibly related to tonic and phasic norepinephrine activity.",

    "abstract": "The gradual accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD); playing a key role in disease progression. A{beta} is generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by {beta}- and {gamma}-secretases, with BACE-1 ({beta}-site APP cleaving enzyme-1) cleavage as the rate limiting step 1-3. CRISPR/Cas9 guided gene-editing is emerging as a promising tool to edit pathogenic mutations and hinder disease progression 4,5,6 However, few studies have applied this technology to neurologic diseases 7-9. Besides technical caveats such as low editing efficiency in brains and limited in vivo validation 7, the canonical approach of  mutation-correction would only be applicable to the small fraction of neurodegenerative cases that are inherited (i.e. < 10% of AD, Parkinsons, ALS); with a new strategy needed for every gene. Moreover, feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9 as a therapeutic possibility in sporadic AD has not been explored. Here we introduce a strategy to edit endogenous APP at the extreme C-terminus and reciprocally manipulate the amyloid pathway - attenuating {beta}-cleavage and A{beta}, while up-regulating neuroprotective a-cleavage. APP N-terminus, as well as compensatory APP homologues remain intact, and key physiologic parameters remain unaffected. Robust APP-editing is seen in cell lines, cultured neurons, human embryonic stem cells/iPSC-neurons, and mouse brains. Our strategy works by limiting the physical association of APP and BACE-1, and we also delineate the mechanism that abrogates APP/BACE-1 interaction in this setting. Our work offers an innovative  cut and silence gene-editing strategy that could be a new therapeutic paradigm for AD.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are associated with body weight changes in humans. However, mechanisms underlying anxiety-related weight changes remain poorly understood. Using Emx1Cre/+ mice, we deleted the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cortex, hippocampus, and some parts of the amygdala. The resulting mutant mice displayed elevated anxiety levels and were markedly lean when fed either chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). The mice showed higher levels of sympathetic activity, thermogenesis and lipolysis in both brown and white adipose tissues, and higher oxygen consumption and body temperature, compared with control mice. They were still lean at thermoneurality when fed HFD, indicating elevated basal metabolism in addition to activated thermogenesis. Anxiety induced by site-specific Bdnf deletion similarly increased energy expenditure and minimized HFD-induced weight gain. These results reveal that anxiety can stimulate adaptive thermogenesis and basal metabolism by activating sympathetic nervous system, which enhances lipolysis and limits weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

We investigated the 33F-1 capsular polysaccharide locus to better understand the genetic variation and its potential impact on serotyping results.\\n\\nMethodsWhole genome sequencing was conducted on ten 33F-1 pneumococcal isolates. Initially, sequence reads were used for molecular serotyping by PneumoCaT. Phenotypic typing of 33F-1 isolates was then performed using the Quellung reaction and latex agglutination. Genome assemblies were used in phylogenetic analyses of each gene in the capsular locus to investigate genetic divergence.\\n\\nResultsAll ten pneumococcal isolates with the 33F-1 cps locus typed as 33F by Quellung and latex agglutination. Unlike the reference 33F capsule locus sequence, DNA microarray and PneumoCaT analyses found that 33F-1 pneumococci lack the wcjE gene, and instead contain wcyO with a frameshift mutation. Phylogenetic analyses found the wzg, wzh, wzd, wze, wchA, wciG and glf genes in the 33F-1 cps locus had higher DNA sequence similarity to homologues from other serotypes than to the 33F reference sequence.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have discovered a novel genetic variant of serotype 33F, which lacks wcjE and contains a wcyO pseudogene. This finding adds to the understanding of molecular epidemiology of pneumococcal serotype diversity, which is poorly understood in low and middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "AimsThe present work focuses on studies on squalene improvement in the S. cerevisiae and development of squalene extraction procedure based on mechanical disruption of cells.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsIn this study, a homogenization-based extraction method was developed and was compared to five conventional methods of squalene extraction. Squalene recovered from this novel procedure gave 3.5- fold, 10-fold, 16-fold and 8.1-fold higher yield than standard procedures viz., saponification with 60% KOH, acidic saponification, saponification with 18% KOH and glass beads method, respectively. Furthermore, this procedure has been evaluated on laboratory S. cerevisiae strains such as BY4742 and CEN.PK2-1C (native), deletion strains (ERG6 and ERG11) and tHMGl overexpressed S. cerevisiae strains. When sonication method of cell lysis was replaced with homogenization it was found that the yields were significantly higher and reached a value of 9 mg/g DCW in case of BY4742. In addition, Squalene yield in ergosterol mutant strains has been analyzed and was found to be 1.8-fold and 3.4-fold higher in ERG6 and ERG11 deletion strains, respectively, than BY4742. Squalene was also found to be higher at the optimized temperature of 30{degrees}C and pH 6.0. Furthermore, tolerance of S. cerevisiae to external squalene at various concentration has been carried and found that the organism was tolerant up to 25 g/L of squalene.\\n\\nConclusionsHomogenization based mechanical disruption was observed to yield higher squalene and the SEM analysis corroborates these findings. The synergistic effect of ERG11 downregulation and tHMG1 over-expression has led to significant increase in squalene yield.\\n\\nSignificance and Impact of the StudySonication and homogenization has been used as a cell-disruption method for the first time in squalene extraction and squalene yield from homogenization method of cell lysis in BY4742 has been found to be 9 mg/g DCW which is the highest reported so far in a wild-type strain.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a markedly heterogeneous condition with a varied phenotypic presentation. Its high concordance among siblings, as well as its clear association with specific genetic disorders, both point to a strong genetic etiology. However, the molecular basis of ASD is still poorly understood, although recent studies point to the existence of sex-specific ASD pathophysiologies and biomarkers. Despite this, little is known about how exactly sex influences the gene expression signatures of ASD probands. In an effort to identify sex-dependent biomarkers (and characterise their function), we present an analysis of a single paired-end post-mortem brain RNA-Seq data set and a meta-analysis of six blood-based microarray data sets. Here, we identify several genes with sex-dependent dysregulation, and many more with sex-independent dysregulation. Moreover, through pathway analysis, we find that these sex-independent biomarkers have substantially different biological roles than the sex-dependent biomarkers, and that some of these pathways are ubiquitously dysregulated in both post-mortem brain and blood. We conclude by synthesizing the discovered biomarker profiles with the extant literature, by highlighting the advantage of studying sex-specific dysregulation directly, and by making a call for new transcriptomic data that comprise large female cohorts.",

Although the source of the primitive wave is well characterized, the origin of erythrocytes later in embryogenesis is less clear due to overlaps between the different erythroid waves. Using the miR144/451-GFP mouse model to track cells expressing the erythroid microRNAs miR144/451, we identified cells co-expressing VE-Cadherin and GFP in the yolk sac between E9.5 and E12. This suggested the existence of hemogenic endothelial cells committed to erythropoiesis (Ery-HEC). We showed that these cells were capable of generating erythrocytes ex vivo and we demonstrated that the formation of Ery-HEC was independent of the Runx1 gene expression. Using transcriptome analysis, we demonstrated that these cells coexpressed endothelial and erythroid genes such as Hbb-bh1 and Gata1 but we were surprised to detect the primitive erythroid genes Aqp3 and Aqp8 suggesting the formation of primitive erythrocytes at a much later time point than initially thought. Finally, we showed that enforced expression of Gata1 in endothelial cells was enough to initiate the erythroid transcriptional program.",

When applied to a pair of GWAS, the LD score regression (LDSC) methodology produces a statistic, referred to as the bivariate LDSC intercept, which deviation from 0 is classically interpreted as an indication of sample overlap between the two GWAS. Here we propose an extension of the theory underlying the bivariate LDSC methodology, which accounts for population stratification within and between GWAS. Our extended theory predicts an inflation of the bivariate LDSC intercept when sample sizes and heritability are large, even in the absence of sample overlap. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations based on actual SNP genotypes and we propose a re-interpretation of previously published results in the light of our extended theory.",

We identified the product of At4g32190 locus as a chloroplast-targeted PROTEIN INVOLVED IN STARCH INITIATION (named PII1). Arabidopsis mutants devoid of PII1 display an alteration of starch initiation process and accumulate, on average, one starch granule per plastid instead of the 5 to 7 granules found in plastids of wild-type plants. These granules are larger than in wild type and they remain flat and lenticular. pii1 mutants display wild-type growth rates and accumulate standard starch amounts. Moreover, starch characteristics, such as amylopectin chain length distribution, remain unchanged.

We examine macroecological patterns in a fire-dependent forest of Bishop pine (Pinus muricata). We target two different-aged stands in a stand-replacing fire regime, one a characteristically mature stand with a diverse understory, and one more recently disturbed by a stand-replacing fire (17 years prior to measurement). We compare the stands using macroecological metrics of species richness, abundance and spatial distributions that are predicted by the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE), an information-entropy based theory that has proven highly successful in predicting macroecological metrics across a wide variety of systems and taxa. Ecological patterns in the mature stand more closely match METE predictions than do data from the recently disturbed stand. This suggests METEs predictions are more robust in late-successional, slowly changing, or steady-state systems than those in rapid flux with respect to species composition, abundances, and organisms sizes. Our findings highlight the need for a macroecological theory that incorporates natural disturbance and other ecological perturbations into its predictive capabilities, because most natural systems are not in a steady state.",

There are currently no cognate animal models that recapitulate the biology of mutant Gnas-induced IPMNs, and the underlying mechanisms that lead to the cystic pathway of neoplasia in the pancreas remain unknown.\\n\\nMethodsWe generated p48-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D; Rosa26R-LSL-rtTA-TetO-GnasR201C mice (Kras; Gnas mice) where pancreas-specific GnasR201C expression was induced by doxycycline administration. In this model, mutant Kras is constitutively expressed, and control mice were produced through absence of doxycycline. Separate cohorts of mice were utilized for timed necropsies and for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Isogenic cell lines (with doxycycline inducible mutant Gnas expression) were propagated from the resulting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\\n\\nResultsCo-expression of KrasG12D and GnasR201C resulted in the development of pancreatic cystic lesions resembling human IPMNs in 100% of mice, with higher grades of epithelial dysplasia observed over time. Approximately one-third of Kras; Gnas mice developed PDAC at a median of 38 weeks post doxycycline induction. GnasR201C did not accelerate oncogenic transformation with KrasG12D, but rather, reprogrammed Ras-induced neoplasms towards a well-differentiated phenotype. GnasR201C induction led to activation of the inhibitory Hippo kinase cascade and cytoplasmic sequestration of phosphorylated YAP1 protein, a phenomenon that was also observed in human IPMN with GNAS mutations.\\n\\nConclusionsGNASR201C functions not as a traditional oncogene, but rather as an \\\"oncomodulator\\\" of KRAS-mediated pancreatic neoplasia, through suppression of YAP1 and transcriptional reprogramming towards a differentiated (large ductal) phenotype.",

    "abstract": "We identified a novel mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) lineage derived from the common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) that is dependent on expression of BCL11A. These CLP-derived pDCs, which we refer to as \"B-pDCs\", have a unique gene expression profile that includes hallmark B cell genes, normally not expressed in conventional pDCs. Despite expressing most classical pDC markers such as SIGLEC-H and PDCA1, B-pDCs lack IFN- secretion, exhibiting a distinct inflammatory profile. Functionally, induce T cell proliferation more robustly than canonical pDCs following Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. B-pDCs also display elevated levels of the cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, mirroring human AXL+ transitional DCs in function and transcriptional profile. Murine B-pDCs therefore represent a phenotypically and functionally distinct CLP-derived DC lineage specialized in T cell activation and previously not described in mice.",

    "abstract": "High levels of prenatal alcohol exposure are known to cause an array of adverse outcomes including foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS); however, the effects of low to moderate exposure are less-well characterised. Previous findings suggest that differences in normal-range facial morphology may be a marker for alcohol exposure and related adverse effects. Therefore, in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we tested for an association between maternal alcohol consumption and six FAS-related facial phenotypes in their offspring, using both self-report questionnaires and the maternal genotype at rs1229984 in ADH1B as measures of maternal alcohol consumption. In both self-reported alcohol consumption (N=4,233) and rs1229984 genotype (N=3,139) analyses, we found no strong statistical evidence for an association between maternal alcohol consumption and facial phenotypes tested. The directions of effect estimates were compatible with the known effects of heavy alcohol exposure, but confidence intervals were largely centred around zero. We conclude that, in a sample representative of the general population, there is no strong evidence for an effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on normal-range variation in facial morphology.",

    "abstract": "Deficient emotion regulation and exaggerated anxiety represent a major transdiagnostic psychopathological marker. On the neural level these deficits have been closely linked to impaired, yet treatment-sensitive, prefrontal regulatory control over the amygdala. Gaining direct control over these pathways could therefore provide an innovative and promising strategy to regulate exaggerated anxiety. To this end the current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-informed real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. In a randomized within-subject sham-controlled design high anxious subjects (n = 26) underwent real-time fMRI-guided training to enhance connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the amygdala (target pathway) during threat exposure. Maintenance of regulatory control was assessed after three days and in the absence of feedback. Training-induced changes in functional connectivity of the target pathway and anxiety ratings served as primary outcomes. Training of the target, yet not the sham-control, pathway significantly increased amygdala-vlPFC connectivity and decreased subjective anxiety levels. On the individual level stronger connectivity increases were significantly associated with anxiety reduction. At follow-up, volitional control over the target pathway and decreased anxiety level were maintained in the absence of feedback. The present results demonstrate for the first time that successful self-regulation of amygdala-prefrontal top-down regulatory circuits may represent a novel strategy to control anxiety. As such, the present findings underscore both the critical contribution of amygdala-prefrontal circuits to emotion regulation and the therapeutic potential of connectivity-informed real-time neurofeedback.",

    "abstract": "In order to colonize the human gastrointestinal tract and exert their beneficial effects, bifidobacteria must effectively cope with the toxic bile salts in the intestine, but the molecular mechanism underlying bile tolerance is poorly understood. In this study, heterologous expression of a MarR family transcriptional regulator BmrR significantly reduced ox-bile resistance of Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, suggesting that it might play a role in bile stress response. In silico analysis combined with RT-PCR assay demonstrated that bmrR was co-transcribed with bmrA and bmrB, which encoded multidrug resistance (MDR) ABC transporters. Promoter prediction and EMSA assay revealed that BmrR could autoregulate the bmrRAB operon by binding to bmr box (ATTGTTG-6nt-CAACAAT) in the promoter region. Moreover, heterologous expression of bmrA and bmrB in L. lactis showed 20.77-fold higher tolerance to 0.10% ox-bile compared to wild type strain. In addition, ox-bile could disrupt the DNA binding activity of BmrR as a ligand. Taken together, our findings indicate that bmrRAB operon is autoregulated by transcriptional regulator BmrR and ox-bile serves as an inducer to activate the bile efflux transporter BmrAB in response to bile stress in B. longum BBMN68.\\n\\nImportanceBifidobacteria are natural inhabitants of the human intestinal tract. Some bifidobacterial strains are used as probiotics in fermented dairy production because of their health-promoting effects. Following consumption, bifidobacteria finally colonize the lower intestinal tract where the concentration of bile salts remains nearly 0.05% to 2.0%. Bile salts as detergent-like antimicrobial compounds can cause disruption of the cellular membrane, protein misfolding and DNA damage. Therefore, tolerance to physiological bile stress is indeed essential for bifidobacteria to survive and exert the probiotic effects in gastrointestinal tract. In B. longum BBMN68, the MarR-type regulator BmrR was involved in bile stress response by auto-regulating bmrRAB operon and ox-bile as an inducer could increase the expression of BmrAB transporter to enhance the bile tolerance of BBMN68.This is the first report about functional analysis of bmrRAB operon in bile stress response, which will provide new insight into bile tolerance mechanisms in Bifidobacterium and other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The deep ocean is the largest habitat on earth and holds diverse microbial life forms. Significant advances have been made in microbial diversity and their genomic potential in the deep ocean, however, little is known about microbial metabolic activity that is crucial to regulate the bathypelagic carbon sequestration. Here, we characterized proteomes covering large particulate (>0.7 m), small particulate (0.2-0.7 m) and dissolved (10 kDa-0.2 m) fractions collected at a depth of 3000 m in the South China Sea. The Rhodospirillales, SAR324, SAR11, Nitrosinae/Tectomicrobia were the major contributors in the particulate fraction whereas Alteromonadales and viruses dominated the dissolved counterpart. Frequent detection of transcription or translation proteins in the particulate fractions indicated active metabolism of SAR324, Archaea, SAR11, and possible viable surface microbes, e.g. Prochlorococcus. Transporters for diverse substrates were the most abundant functional groups, and numerous spectra of formate dehydrogenases and glycine betaine transporters unveiled the importance of methylated compounds for the survival of deep-sea microbes. Notably, abundant non-viral proteins, especially transporters and cytoplasmic proteins, were detected in the dissolved fraction, indicating their potential roles in nutrient scavenging and the stress response. Our size-based proteomic study implied the holistic microbial activity mostly acting on the labile dissolved organic matter as well as the potential activities of surface microbes and dissolved non-viral proteins in the deep ocean.\\n\\nImportanceThe deep ocean produces one third of the biological CO2 in the ocean. However, little is known about metabolic activity of the bathypelagic microbial community which is crucial for understanding the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter, especially the formation of bulk refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM), one of the largest reservoirs of reduced carbon on Earth. This study provided the protein evidence firstly including both particulate and dissolved fractions to comprehensively decipher the active microbes and metabolic processes involved in the DOM recycling in the deep ocean. Our data supported the hypothesis of the carbon and energy supply from the labile DOM after the solution of sinking particles to the bathypelagic microbial community.",
