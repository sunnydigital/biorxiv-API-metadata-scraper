    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites that impose fitness costs on their hosts by producing deleterious mutations and disrupting gametogenesis. Host genomes avoid these costs by regulating TE activity, particularly in germline cells where new insertions are heritable and TEs are exceptionally active. However, the capacity of different TE-associated fitness costs to select for repression in the host, and the role of selection in the evolution of TE regulation more generally, remain controversial. In this study, we use forward, individual-based simulations to examine the evolution of small-RNA-mediated TE regulation, a conserved mechanism for TE repression that is employed by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. To design and parameterize a biologically realistic model, we drew on an extensive survey of empirical studies of the transposition and regulation of P-element DNA transposons in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that even under conservative assumptions, where small-RNA-mediated regulation reduces transposition only, repression evolves rapidly and adaptively after the genome is invaded by a new TE. We further show that the spread of repressor alleles is greatly enhanced by two additional TE-imposed fitness costs: dysgenic sterility and ectopic recombination. Finally, we demonstrate that the mutation rate to repression (i.e., the size of the mutational target) is a critical parameter that influences both the evolutionary trajectory of host repression and the associated proliferation of TEs after invasion. Our findings suggest that adaptive evolution of TE regulation may be stronger and more prevalent than previously appreciated, and provide a framework for evaluating empirical data.",

    "abstract": "The schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated gene, BRD1, encodes a scaffold protein that in complex with epigenetic modifiers regulate gene sets enriched for psychiatric disorder risk. Preclinical evidence from male Brd1+/- mice has previously implicated BRD1 with phenotypes of translational relevance to schizophrenia. Here we describe the phenotype of female Brd1+/- mice and report attenuated dendritic architecture and monoaminergic dysregulation accompanied by sex-specific changes in affective behaviors. In accordance, global gene expression profiling reveals regional dysregulation of gene sets enriched with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia risk in female and male Brd1+/- mice, respectively. Independent of sex, however, differentially expressed genes cluster in common functional pathways associated with psychiatric disorders, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation as well as G-protein coupled-, and nuclear receptor mediated signaling. Accordingly, we provide in vitro evidence that BRD1 modulates the transcriptional drive of a subset of nuclear receptors (e.g. the vitamin D and glucocorticoid receptors). Moreover, we demonstrate enrichment of psychiatric disorder risk in the target genes of nuclear receptors, sex-biased expression of several nuclear receptor genes in the adult brain of Brd1+/- mice, and that sex-biased genes in general are enriched with nuclear receptor genes particularly at the earliest developmental stage of the human brain. Overall, our data suggests that the spatio-temporal interaction between BRD1 and subsets of nuclear receptors in the brain is sex-biased and that hampered BRD1 mediated regulation of target genes governed by certain nuclear receptors may significantly contribute to sex differences in psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has identified many factors influencing student acceptance of biological evolution, but few of these factors have been measured in a longitudinal context of changing knowledge and acceptance of evolution over a period of instruction. This study investigates factors previously associated with evolution acceptance as well as other potential factors among students over the course of a year-long majors and non-majors introductory biology sequence at a private, research-intensive university in the northeastern United States. Acceptance of evolution was measured using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument, and other factors were measured using well-established instruments and a demographic survey. As expected given the context, evolution was widely accepted among the population (71% of our sample scored in the \\\"high\\\" or \\\"very high\\\" acceptance range), but 160 students were in the very low to moderate acceptance range. Over the course of the academic year, regressions on measures of normalized change revealed that as knowledge of the Nature of Science (NOS) increased, evolution acceptance increased (R2 = .378, p << 0.001). Increasing levels of genetic literacy (R2 = .214, p << 0.001) and Evolutionary Knowledge (R2 = .177, p << 0.001) were also significantly associated with increases in acceptance of evolution. We also examined the longitudinal effect of combining various factors into unified working models of acceptance of evolution, and this is the first study by our knowledge to do so. From fall to spring, the influence of student knowledge of NOS on evolution acceptance increased, as did the influence of genetic literacy. Conversely, the influence of religious variables decreased, as did the influence of political inclinations and race/ethnicity. Our results indicate that as students learn more about the nature of science, they may rely more on scientific explanations for natural phenomena. This study also underscores the importance of using longitudinal, multifactorial analyses to understand acceptance of evolution.",

    "abstract": "The human inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a ventral, temporo-occipital association tract. Though described in early neuroanatomical works, its existence was later questioned. Application of in vivo tractography to the neuroanatomical study of the ILF has generally confirmed its existence, however consensus is lacking regarding its subdivision, laterality and connectivity. Further, there is a paucity of detailed neuroanatomic data pertaining to the exact anatomy of the ILF. Generalized Q-Sampling imaging (GQI) is a non-tensor tractographic modality permitting high resolution imaging of white-matter structures. As it is a non-tensor modality, it permits visualization of crossing fibers and accurate delineation of close-proximity fiber-systems. We applied deterministic GQI tractography to data from 30 healthy subjects and a large-volume diffusion atlas, to delineate ILF anatomy. Post-mortem white matter dissection was also carried out in a cadaveric specimen for further validation. The ILF was found in all 60 hemispheres. At its occipital extremity, it demonstrated a trifurcated termination pattern which was used to separate the ILF into 3 distinct sub-fascicles: Dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial. These divisions were consistent across the subject set and within the atlas. We applied quantitative techniques to study connectivity strength of the ILF at its anterior and posterior extremities. Overall, the 3 sub-fascicles, and the whole ILF, demonstrated strong leftward-lateralized connectivity patterns. Leftward-lateralization was also found for ILF volumes across the subject set. Due to connective and volumetric leftward-dominance and ventral location, we postulate the ILFs role in the semantic system. Further, our results are in agreement with functional and lesion-based postulations pertaining to the ILFs role in facial recognition.",

We focus on producing results detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enabling comparison with future studies. Here we report our examination of intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons. We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell types and layers we sampled, with the most sparse connections in layers 5 and 6. Almost all mouse synapses exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics. Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons; however, exhibited facilitation. These results contribute to a body of evidence describing recurrent excitatory connectivity as a conserved feature of cortical microcircuits.",

    "abstract": "Animals use the distribution of chemicals in their environment to guide behaviors essential for life, including finding food and mates, and avoiding predators. The presence of this general class of behavior is extremely widespread, even though the olfactory sensory apparatus and strategies used may vary between animals. The strategies and cues used by mammals to localize and track odor sources have recently become of interest to neuroscientists, but are still poorly understand. In order to study how mice localize odors, we trained mice to perform a trail following task using a novel behavioral paradigm and behavioral monitoring setup. We find that mice, in order to follow an odor trail, use both sniff by sniff odor concentration comparisons and internares comparisons to guide their behavior. Furthermore, they employ olfactory information to guide adaptive behaviors with remarkably short latencies of approximately 80ms. This study and its findings establish a rich, quantifiable olfactory localization behavior in mice that is amenable to physiological investigations and motivates investigation into the neural substrates of the identified olfactory cues.\\n\\nSignificanceMany animals, like rodents, rely heavily on their sense smell to guide them as they navigate their environment, to find food and mates and to avoid predators. Yet, in mammals, this function of the olfactory system is much less well studied than odor identification. We created a behavioral task where mice had to follow odor trails in order to efficiently find food and then tracked their movements around those trails. We found that they respond to sniff-by-sniff changes in odor intensity, using those changes to guide movements in less than one tenth of a second and also confirm that they use stereo cues to guide behavior. These results lay the groundwork for determining the brain circuits underlying olfactory navigation.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastid parasites - trypanosomes and leishmanias - infect millions of humans and cause economically devastating diseases of livestock, and the few existing drugs have serious deficiencies. Benzoxaborole-based compounds are very promising potential novel anti-trypanosomal therapies, with candidates already in human and animal clinical trials. Their targets in trypanosomes were hitherto unknown. We investigated the mechanism of action of several benzoxaboroles, including AN7973, an early candidate for veterinary trypanosomosis.\\n\\nIn all kinetoplastids, transcription is polycistronic. Individual mRNA 5-ends are created by trans splicing of a short leader sequence, with coupled polyadenylation of the preceding mRNA. Treatment of Trypanosoma brucei with AN7973 inhibited trans splicing within 1h, as judged by loss of the Y-structure splicing intermediate and reduced levels of mRNA, and accumulation of peri-nuclear granules which are typical for splicing inhibition. Methylation of the spliced leader precursor RNA was not affected, but more prolonged AN7973 treatment caused an increase in S-adenosyl methionine and methylated lysine. Together, these results indicate that mRNA processing is the primary target of AN7973. Polyadenylation is required for kinetoplastid trans splicing. The EC50 for AN7973 in T. brucei was increased three-fold by over-expression of the T. brucei cleavage and polyadenylation factor CPSF3, identifying CPSF3 as a potential molecular target. Our results thus chemically validate mRNA processing as a viable drug target in trypanosomes.\\n\\nSeveral other benzoxaboroles showed metabolomic and splicing effects that were similar to those of AN7973, identifying splicing inhibition as a common mode of action, and suggesting that it might be linked to subsequent changes in methylated metabolites. Granule formation, splicing inhibition, and resistance after CPSF3 expression did not, however, always correlate, and prolonged selection of trypanosomes in AN7973 resulted in only 1.5-fold resistance. This suggests that the modes of action of oxaboroles that target trypanosome mRNA processing may extend beyond CPSF3 inhibition.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTrypanosomes and leishmanias infect millions of humans and cause economically devastating diseases of livestock; the few existing drugs have serious deficiencies. Trypanosomosis of cattle, caused mainly by Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax, is a serious problem in Africa, because bovids are used not only for meat and milk, but also for traction. Only two drugs are in routine use for chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis of bovine trypanosomosis. A single injection of the benzoxaborole compound AN7973 was sufficient to cure T. congolense infection in cattle and goats, but AN7973 was less effective against T. vivax. This precluded development of AN7973 as a commercially viable treatment against cattle trypanosomosis, but it could still have potential for diseases caused by other salivarian trypanosomes.\\n\\nWe used a large range of methods to find out how AN7973 kills trypanosomes, and compared it with several other benzoxaboroles. AN7973 and some of the other compounds had effects on parasite metabolism that resembled those previously seen for a benzoxaborole that is being tested for human sleeping sickness. The most rapid effect of AN7973, however, was on processing of trypanosome mRNA. As a consequence, amounts of mRNA decreased and synthesis of proteins stopped. We conclude that AN7973 and some other benzoxaboroles kill trypanosomes by stopping gene expression.",

Here we have used genome-wide and single cell analyses to examine the folding patterns of plasma cell genomes. We found that plasma cells adopt a cartwheel configuration and undergo large-scale changes in chromatin folding at genomic regions associated with a plasma cell specific transcription signature. During plasma cell differentiation, Blimp1 assembles into an inter-chromosomal transcription hub with genes associated with the UPR, biosynthesis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as a cluster of genes linked with Alzheimers disease.

Currently, there is no analogous, standardized instrument for quantifying household-level water insecurity, which prevents us from understanding both its prevalence and consequences. Therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a household water insecurity scale appropriate for use in our cohort in western Kenya. We used a range of qualitative techniques to develop a preliminary set of 29 household water insecurity questions, and administered those questions at 15 and 18 months postpartum, concurrent with a suite of other survey modules. These data were complemented by data on quantity of water used and stored, and microbiological quality. Inter-item and item-total correlations were performed to reduce scale items to 20. Exploratory factor and parallel analyses were used to determine the latent factor structure; a unidimensional scale was hypothesized and tested using confirmatory factor and bifactor analyses, along with multiple statistical fit indices. Reliability was assessed using Cronbachs alpha and the coefficient of stability, which produced a coefficient alpha of 0.97 at 15 and 18 months postpartum and a coefficient of stability of 0.62. Predictive, convergent and discriminant validity of the final household water insecurity scale were supported, based on relationships with food insecurity, perceived stress, per capita household water use, and time and money spent acquiring water. The resultant scale is a valid and reliable instrument. It can be used in this setting to test a range of hypotheses about the role of household water insecurity in numerous physical and psychosocial health outcomes, to identify the households most vulnerable to water insecurity, and to evaluate the effects of water-related interventions. To extend its applicability, we encourage efforts to develop a cross-culturally valid scale using robust qualitative and quantitative techniques.",

    "abstract": "The endemic circulation of bovine brucellosis in cattle herds has a markedly negative impact on economy, due to decreased fertility, increased abortion rates, reduced milk and meat production. It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks, thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms, with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures. By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north, likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment.",

However, declines in IPD due to vaccine-targeted serotypes have been partially offset by increases in IPD due to non-vaccine serotypes. The goal of this study was to quantify serotype-specific changes in the incidence of IPD that occurred in different age groups, with or without certain co-morbidities, following the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13 in the childhood vaccination program in Denmark.\\n\\nMethodsWe used nationwide surveillance data for IPD in Denmark and a hierarchical Bayesian regression framework to estimate changes in the incidence of IPD associated with the introduction of PCV7 (2007) and PCV13 (2010) while controlling for serotype-specific epidemic cycles and unrelated secular trends.\\n\\nResults and ConclusionsFollowing the introduction of PCV7 and 13 in children, the net impact of serotype replacement varied considerably by age group and the presence of comorbid conditions. Serotype replacement offset a greater fraction of the decline in vaccine-targeted serotypes following the introduction of PCV7 compared with the period following the introduction of PCV13. Differences in the magnitude of serotype replacement were due to variations in the incidence of non-vaccine serotypes in the different risk groups before the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13. The relative increases in the incidence of IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes did not differ appreciably in the post-vaccination period. Serotype replacement offset a greater proportion of the benefit of PCVs in strata in which the non-vaccine serotypes comprised a larger proportion of cases prior to the introduction of the vaccines. These findings could help to predict the impact of next-generation conjugate vaccines in specific risk groups.",

    "abstract": "Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1), the primary effector of nuclear GTPase Ran, is a cytoplasmic-enriched and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, playing important roles in nuclear transport through preventing RanGTP from being trapped with karyopherin proteins and dissociating cargoes from nuclear export factor CRM1. Much of what we know about RanBP1 is learned from fungi. Here we show that animal RanBP1 has distinct cargo dissociation and nuclear export mechanisms. In contrast to CRM1-RanGTP sequestration mechanism of cargo dissociation in fungi, animal RanBP1 solely sequesters RanGTP from nuclear export complexes. In fungi, RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP form a 1:1:1 nuclear export complex; in contrast, animal RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP form a 1:1:2 nuclear export complex. The key feature for the two mechanistic changes from fungi to animals is the loss of affinity between RanBP1-RanGTP and CRM1, since residues mediating their interaction in fungi are not conserved in animals.

    "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. It results from expansion of a CGG nucleotide repeat in the 5 untranslated region of FMR1. Large expansions elicit repeat and promoter hyper-methylation, heterochromatin formation, FMR1 transcriptional silencing, and loss of the Fragile X protein, FMRP. Efforts aimed at correcting the sequelae resultant from FMRP loss have thus far proven insufficient, perhaps because of FMRPs pleiotropic functions. As the repeats do not disrupt the FMRP coding sequence, reactivation of endogenous FMR1 gene expression could correct the proximal event in FXS pathogenesis. Here we utilize the CRISPR/dCAS9 system to selectively re-activate transcription from the silenced FMR1 locus. Fusion of the transcriptional activator VP192 to dCAS9 robustly enhances FMR1 transcription and increases FMRP levels when targeted directly to the CGG repeat in human cells. Using a previously uncharacterized FXS human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line which acquires transcriptional silencing with serial passaging, we achieved locus-specific transcriptional re-activation of FMR1 mRNA expression despite promoter and repeat methylation. These studies demonstrate that FMR1 mRNA expression can be selectively reactivated in human patient cells, creating a pathway forward for therapeutic development in Fragile X Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Odor memories are exceptionally robust and essential for animal survival. The olfactory (piriform) cortex has long been hypothesized to encode odor memories, yet the cellular substrates for olfactory learning and memory remain unknown. Here, using intersectional, cFos-based genetic manipulations (\\\"Fos-tagging\\\"), we show that olfactory fear conditioning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons in mouse piriform cortex. We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fos-tagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall. Together, our experiments identify odor-specific ensembles of piriform neurons as necessary and sufficient for odor fear memory recall.",

Loss of YAP/TAZ cause the hydrocephalus after birth, leads to aberrant development and dilated ventricle in adult stage, this phenotype can be detected as early as P0. YAP/TAZ are expressed in Sox2+ neural progenitor cells, when YAP/TAZ are deleted, the neuroepithelial cell junctions are disrupted; the numbers of Sox2+ cell and Tbr2+ cell are reduced and the ratio of tbr2/Sox2 is also reduced at E15.5. Results of cell cycle analyzing experiments display YAP/TAZ deletion increased the cell cycle exit. The improperly increased expression of Tuj1+ in progenitor cells in the YAP/TAZ deleted cortex indicates the premature of Sox2+ progenitor cells. Together, our results reveal that YAP/TAZ deletion changed the polarity of neuroepithelial cells, and increased the cell cycle exit, reduced the differentiation of Sox2+ cells into Tbr2+ cells through promoting the premature of Tuj1+ cells. These results define the functions of YAP/TAZ in keeping the cell polarity neural progenitors and ensuring their proliferation and differentiation, and also reveal the roles of YAP/TAZ in developing cortex.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing of genes increases the number of distinct proteins in a cell. In the brain it is highly prevalent, presumably because proteome diversity is crucial for establishing the complex circuitry between trillions of neurons. To provide individual cells with different repertoires of protein isoforms, however, this process must be regulated. Previously, we found that the mutually exclusive alternative splicing of a cell surface protein, Dscam2 produces two isoforms (exon 10A and 10B) with unique binding properties. This splicing event is tightly regulated and crucial for maintaining axon terminal size, dendritic morphology and synaptic numbers. Here, we show that Drosophila Muscleblind (Mbl), a conserved splicing factor implicated in myotonic dystrophy, controls Dscam2 alternative splicing. Removing mbl from cells that normally express isoform B induces the expression of isoform A and eliminates the expression of B, demonstrating that Mbl represses one alternative exon and selects the other. Mbl mutants exhibit phenotypes that are also observed in flies engineered to express a single isoform. Consistent with these observations, mbl expression is cell-type-specific and correlates with the expression of isoform B. Our study demonstrates how the regulated expression of a splicing factor is sufficient to provide neurons with unique protein isoforms crucial for development.",

However, it remains unclear by which molecular mechanisms ERCs would trigger the irreversible cell cycle slow-down leading to cell death. We show that ERCs accumulation is concomitant with a nucleolar stress, characterized by a massive accumulation of pre-rRNAs in the nucleolus, leading to a loss of nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, decreased growth rate and cell-cycle slow-down. This nucleolar stress, observed in old mothers, is not inherited by rejuvenated daughters. Unlike WT, in the long-lived mutant fob1{triangleup}, a majority of cells is devoid of nucleolar stress and does not experience replicative senescence before death.

    "abstract": "Impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity is increasingly considered to play an important role in cognitive impairment in Huntingtons disease (HD). However, the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity defects is not fully understood. Combining live-cell nanoparticle tracking and super-resolution imaging, we show that dysregulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) surface diffusion represents a molecular basis underlying the aberrant hippocampal synaptic plasticity during HD. AMPARs surface diffusion is increased in various HD neuronal models, which results in the failure of AMPARs surface stabilization after long-term potentiation (LTP) stimuli. This appears to result from a defective brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) - Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling pathway that impacts the interaction between the AMPAR auxiliary subunit stargazin and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). Notably, the disturbed AMPAR surface diffusion is rescued, via BDNF signaling pathway and by the antidepressant tianeptine. Tianeptine also restores the impaired LTP and hippocampus-dependent memory as well as anxiety/depression-like behavior in different HD mouse models. We thus unveil a mechanistic framework underlying hippocampal synaptic and memory dysfunction and propose a new perspective in HD treatment by targeting AMPAR surface diffusion.",

Actively probing chromosome mobility further in time, we find that this viscous suspension of chromatin transitions into a gel after nuclear breakdown. This gel state, in which chromosomes cannot be moved by flows, persists even when chromosomes start moving to form the metaphase plate.

We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets and study the realism of the simulated datasets. We then use the simulated data to study the impact of the increased treatment efforts on epidemiological outcomes.

In addition to the previously well-characterized sRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), recent emerging studies have spotlighted on tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rsRNAs) as new categories of sRNAs that bear versatile functions. Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipeline optimized for rRNA- and tRNA- derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate which is consistent with their highly modified nature.

A lytic strategy corresponds to viruses that exclusively infect and lyse their hosts to release new virions. A chronic strategy corresponds to viruses that infect hosts and then continually release new viruses via a budding process without cell lysis. The chronic virus can also be passed on to daughter cells during cell division. The long-term association of virus and microbe in the chronic mode drives differences in selective pressures with respect to the lytic mode. We utilize invasion analysis of the corresponding nonlinear differential equation model to study the ecology and evolution of heterogenous viral strategies. We first investigate stability of equilibria, and characterize oscillatory and bistable dynamics in some parameter regions. Then, we derive fitness quantities for both virus types and investigate conditions for competitive exclusion and coexistence. In so doing we find unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival and invasion.",

Several studies demonstrated the usefulness of WGS data analysis through Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) calling from a reference sequence analysis for Brucella melitensis, whereas gene-by-gene comparison through core-genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) has not been explored so far. The current study developed an allele-based method cgMLST and compared its performance to the genome-wide SNP approach and the traditional MLVA on a defined sample collection. The dataset comprised of 37 epidemiologically linked animal cases of brucellosis as well as 71 epidemiologically unrelated human and animal isolates collected in Italy. The cgMLST scheme generated in this study contained 2,687 targets of the B. melitensis 16M reference genome (75.4% of the complete genome). We established the potential criteria necessary for inclusion of an isolate into a brucellosis outbreak cluster to be [&le;]4 loci in the cgMLST and [&le;]10 in WGS SNP analysis. CgMLST and SNP analysis provided much higher phylogenetic distance resolution than MLVA, particularly for strains belonging to the same lineage thus allowing diverse and unrelated genotypes to be identified with greater confidence. The application of this cgMLST scheme to the characterization of B. melitensis strains provided insights into the epidemiology of this pathogen and it is a candidate to be a benchmark tool for outbreak investigations in human and animal brucellosis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by any region not currently involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.",

We propose a modeling framework based on a novel interpretation of Bayes theorem to integrate optimization of energetic constraints with both prior biases and specific sources of new information gathered by individuals. We present methods for inferring distributions of prior biases within populations rather than assuming known priors, as is common in Bayesian approaches to modelling behavior, and for evaluating the goodness of fit of overall model descriptions. We apply this framework to predict optimal escape during predator-prey encounters, based on prior biases and variation in what information prey use. Using this approach we collected and analyzed data characterizing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) escape behavior in response to human approaches. We found that distance to predator alone was not sufficient for predicting deer flight response, and have shown that the inclusion of additional information is necessary. Additionally, we compared differences in the inferred distributions of prior biases across different populations and discuss the possible role of human activity in influencing these distributions.",

    "abstract": "Our perceptions result from the brains ability to make inferences, or predictive models, of sensory information. Recently, it has been proposed that psychotic traits may be linked to impaired predictive processes. Here, we examine the brain dynamics underlying sensory learning and inference in stable and volatile environments, in a population of healthy individuals (N=75) with a range of psychotic-like experiences. We measured prediction error responses to sound sequences with electroencephalography, gauged sensory inference explicitly by behaviourally recording sensory  regularity learning errors, and used dynamic causal modelling to tap into the underlying neural circuitry. We discuss the findings that were robust to replication across the two experiments (N=31 and N=44 for the discovery and the validation datasets, respectively). First, we found that during stable conditions, participants demonstrated a stronger predictive model, reflected in a larger prediction error response to unexpected sounds, and decreased regularity learning errors. Moreover, individuals with attenuated prediction errors in stable conditions were found to make greater incorrect predictions about sensory information. Critically, we show that greater errors in sensory learning and inference are related to increased psychotic-like experiences. These findings link neurophysiology to behaviour during sensory learning and prediction formation, as well as providing further evidence for the idea of a continuum of psychosis in the healthy, non-clinical population.\n\nSignificance StatementWhilst perceiving the world, we make inferences by learning the regularities present in the sensory environment. It has been argued that psychosis may emerge due to a failure to learn sensory regularities, resulting in an impaired representation of the world. Recently it has been proposed that psychosis exists on a continuum; however, there is conflicting evidence on whether sensory learning deficits align on the non-clinical end of the psychosis continuum. We found that sensory learning is associated with brain prediction errors, and critically, it is impaired in healthy people who report more psychotic-like experiences. We replicated these findings in an independent sample, demonstrating strengthened credibility to support that the continuum of psychosis extends into the non-clinical population.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for a strong genetic basis for autism, with many genetic models being developed in an attempt to replicate autistic symptoms in animals. However, current animal behaviour paradigms rarely match the social and cognitive behaviours exhibited by autistic individuals. Here we instead assay another functional domain - sensory processing - known to be affected in autism to test a novel genetic autism model in Drosophila melanogaster. We show similar visual response alterations and a similar development trajectory in Nhe3 mutant flies (total N=72) and in autistic human participants (total N=154). We report a dissociation between first- and second-order electrophysiological visual responses to steady-state stimulation in adult mutant fruit flies that is strikingly similar to the response pattern in human adults with ASD as well as that of a large sample of neurotypical individuals with high numbers of autistic traits. We explain this as a genetically driven, selective signalling alteration in transient visual dynamics. In contrast to adults, autistic children show a decrease in the first-order response that is matched by the fruit fly model, suggesting that a compensatory change in processing occurs during development. Our results provide the first animal model of autism comprising a differential developmental phenotype in visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Previous psychophysical and modelling studies suggest that cathodic stimulation by a cochlear implant (CI) may preferentially activate the peripheral processes of the auditory nerve, whereas anodic stimulation may preferentially activate the central axons. Because neural degeneration typically starts with loss of the peripheral processes, lower thresholds for cathodic than for anodic stimulation may indicate good local neural survival. We measured thresholds for 99-pulse-per-second trains of triphasic (TP) pulses where the central high-amplitude phase was either anodic (TP-A) or cathodic (TP-C). Thresholds were obtained in monopolar mode from four or five electrodes and a total of eight ears from subjects implanted with the Advanced Bionics CI. When between-subject differences were removed, there was a modest but significant correlation between the polarity effect (TP-C threshold minus TP-A threshold) and the average of TP-C and TP-A thresholds, consistent with the hypothesis that a large polarity effect corresponds to good neural survival. When data were averaged across electrodes for each subject, relatively low thresholds for TP-C correlated with a high \\\"upper limit\\\" (the pulse rate up to which pitch continues to increase) from a previous study [Cosentino S, Carlyon RP, Deeks JM, Parkinson W, Bierer JA (2016) Rate discrimination, gap detection and ranking of temporal pitch in cochlear implant users.

However, in real life the prevalence of EFV-induced mitochondrial toxicity is relatively low. We hypothesized that the agents given in combination with EFV might moderate the effect of EFV on mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, we cultured human T lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM cells) with EFV alone and in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to investigate the effects on mitochondrial respiration and function and cholesterol biosynthesis.\\n\\nThere was a statistically significant concentration- and time-dependent apoptosis, reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}), and increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells treated with either EVF alone or in combination with TDF/FTC. EFV treated cells compared to DMSO treated cells had significant reduction in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) contributed by mitochondrial respiration, ATP production-linked respiration, and spare respiratory capacity (SRC). Treatment with EFV resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial DNA content, and perturbation of more coding genes (n=13); among these were 11 genes associated with lipid or cholesterol biosynthesis. Our findings support the growing body of knowledge on the effects of EFV on mitochondrial respiration and function and cholesterol biosynthesis.\\n\\nInterestingly, combining TDF/FTC with EFV did not alter the effects of EFV on mitochondrial respiration and function and cholesterol biosynthesis. The gap between the prevalence of EFV-induced mitochondrial toxicity in vitro and in vivo studies may be explained by individual differences in the pharmacokinetic of EFV.",

Here, in particular, we study T cells through T cell receptor sequencing, as T cells play a vital role in immune response. One important feature of T cell receptor sequencing data is the frequencies of each receptor in a given sample. These frequencies harbor global information about the landscape of the immune response. We introduce a flexible method that extracts this information by modeling the distribution of these frequencies, and show that it can be used to quantify differences in samples from individuals of different biological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The genus Torovirus (subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) encompasses a range of species that infect domestic ungulates including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses, causing an acute self-limiting gastroenteritis. Using the prototype species equine torovirus (EToV) we performed parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to analyse the relative expression levels of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimaeric sequences produced via discontinuous RNA synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle) and changes in host transcription and translation as a result of EToV infection. RNA sequencing confirmed that EToV utilises a unique combination of discontinuous and non-discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs; indeed, we identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated ORFs, located within the so-called 5 UTR. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed that these ORFs are conserved across all available torovirus sequences and the inferred amino acid sequences are subject to purifying selection, indicating that U1 and U2 are functionally relevant. This study provides the first high-resolution analysis of transcription and translation in this neglected group of livestock pathogens.\\n\\nImportanceToroviruses infect cattle, goats, pigs and horses worldwide and can cause gastrointestinal disease. There is no treatment or vaccine and their ability to spill over into humans has not been assessed. These viruses are related to important human pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and they share some common features, however the mechanism that they use to produce subgenomic RNA molecules differs. Here we performed deep sequencing to determine how equine torovirus produces subgenomic RNAs. In doing so, we also identified two previously unknown open reading frames \\\"hidden\\\" within the genome. Together these results highlight the similarities and differences between this domestic animal virus and related pathogens of humans and livestock.",

    "abstract": "Sequence to activity mapping technologies are rapidly developing, enabling the isolation of mutations that confer novel phenotypes. Here we used the CRISPR EnAbled Trackable genome Engineering (CREATE) technology to investigate the inhibition of the essential IspC gene in Escherichia coli. IspC gene product, Deoxyxylulose Phosphate Reductoisomerase (DXR), converts 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate in the DXP pathway. Since this pathway is shared with many pathogenic bacteria and protozoa and is missing in humans, it is an appealing target for inhibition. We created a full saturation library of 33 sites proximal to ligand binding and other sites and challenged it with the DXR-specific inhibitor, fosmidomycin. We identified several mutations that confer fosmidomycin resistance. All sites are highly conserved and also exist in pathogens including the malaria-inducing Plasmodium falciparum. These findings may have general implications on the isolation of resistance-conferring mutations and specifically, may affect the design of future generations of fosmidomycin-based drugs.\\n\\nSignificanceThe emergence of acquired drug resistance is a natural process that is likely to occur under most circumstances. Recently-developed technologies allow to map relative fitness contribution of multiple mutations in parallel. Such approaches may be used to predict which mutations are most likely to confer resistance, instead of waiting for them to evolve spontaneously. In this study, a rationally-designed IspC mutant library was generated genomically in E. coli. Mutants resistant to fosmidomycin, an antimalarial drug were identified, and most were in the highly conserved proline at position 274. These results may have implications on next-generation fosmidomycin drug design, and more broadly, this approach may be used for predicting mutational acquired resistance.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years several studies have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying spatial orientation in Drosophila melanogaster. Convergent results suggest that this mechanism is associated with specific neural circuits located within the Central Complex (CC). Furthermore such circuits appear to be associated with visual attention, specifically with selective attention processes implicated in the control of action. Our aim was to understand how wild-type flies react to the abrupt appearance of a visual distractor during an ongoing locomotor action. Thus, we adapted the well-known  Buridan paradigm, used to study walking behaviour in flies, so we could specifically address the mechanisms involved in action selection. We found that flies tended to react in one of two ways when confronted with a visual distractor during ongoing locomotion. Flies either: (i) committed to a new path situated midway between the original target and the distractor, consistent with a novelty effect; or (ii) remained on the original trajectory with a slight deviation in direction of the distractor. We believe that these results provide the first indication of how flies react, from the motor point of view, in a bi-stable context requiring the presence of selection-for-action mechanisms. Some considerations on the neural circuits underlying such behavioural responses are advanced.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 is a metazoan heterodimeric transcription factor that senses changes in O2 levels. HIF-1 subunit abundance is post-translationally regulated by prolyl-hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs), which use molecular O2 and -ketoglutarate to hydroxylate two prolyl-residues in HIF-1. Three PHDs have been identified and PHD2 is the most critical regulator of HIF-1. HIF-1 can also be activated independently of hypoxia and in some cases this is due to changes in PHD2 abundance through poorly understood mechanisms. Previously, we reported that under O2-replete conditions that the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii activates HIF-1 by reducing PHD2 protein abundance. Here, we demonstrate that Toxoplasma regulates PHD2 through a multistep process. First, PHD2 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein and Toxoplasma induces PHD2 cytoplasmic accumulation to separate it from nuclear HIF-1. PHD2 is then degraded by lysosomes independently of the major autophagic processes, macroautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy. Rather, PHD2 interacts with the major lysosomal membrane protein, LAMP1, which is required for HIF-1 activation. These data therefore highlight for the first time that cytoplasmic trapping and subsequent lysosomal degradation of a host nucleocytoplasmic protein is a mechanism used by a microbial pathogen to regulate host gene expression.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the ability of a randomly connected attractor network with dynamic synapses to discriminate between similar sequences containing multiple stimuli and suggest such networks provide a general basis for neural computations in the brain. The network is based on units representing assemblies of pools of neurons, with preferentially strong recurrent excitatory connections within each unit. Such excitatory feedback to a unit can generate bistability, though in many networks only under conditions of net excitatory input from other units. Weak interactions between units leads to a multiplicity of attractor states, within which information can persist beyond stimulus offset. When a new stimulus arrives, the prior state of the network impacts the encoding of the incoming information, with short-term synaptic depression ensuring an itinerancy between sets of active units. We assess the ability of such a network to encode the identity of sequences of stimuli, so as to provide a template for sequence recall, or decisions based on accumulation of evidence. Across a range of parameters, such networks produce the primacy (better final encoding of the earliest stimuli) and recency (better final encoding of the latest stimuli) observed in human recall data and can retain the information needed to make a binary choice based on total number of presentations of a specific stimulus. Similarities and differences in the final states of the network produced by different sequences lead to predictions of specific errors that could arise when an animal or human subject generalizes from training data, when the training data comprises a subset of the entire stimulus repertoire. We suggest that such networks can provide the robust general purpose computational engines needed for us to solve many cognitive tasks.",
