    "abstract": "BackgroundThe importance of transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modifications in the control of gene expression is widely accepted. However, causal relationships between changes in TF binding, histone modifications, and gene expression during the response to extracellular stimuli are not well understood. Here, we analyzed the ordering of these events on a genome-wide scale in dendritic cells (DCs) in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.\\n\\nResultsUsing a ChIP-seq time series dataset, we found that the LPS-induced accumulation of different histone modifications follow clearly distinct patterns. Increases in H3K4me3 appear to coincide with transcriptional activation. In contrast, H3K9K14ac accumulates early after stimulation, and H3K36me3 at later time points. Integrative analysis with TF binding data revealed potential links between TF activation and dynamics in histone modifications. Especially, LPS-induced increases in H3K9K14ac and H3K4me3 were associated with binding by STAT1/2, and were severely impaired in Stat1-/- cells.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile the timing of short-term changes of some histone modifications coincides with changes in transcriptional activity, this is not the case for others. In the latter case, dynamics in modifications more likely reflect strict regulation by stimulus-induced TFs, and their interactions with chromatin modifiers.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic enzyme function and evolution is influenced by the larger context of a biochemical pathway - deleterious mutations or perturbations in one enzyme can often be compensated by mutations to others. To explore strategies for mapping adaptive dependencies between enzymes, we used a combination of comparative genomics and experiments to examine interactions with the model metabolic enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR). Biochemically, DHFR shares a metabolic intermediate with numerous folate metabolic enzymes. In contrast, comparative genomics analyses of synteny and gene co-occurrence indicate a sparse pattern of evolutionary couplings in which DHFR is coupled to the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS), but is relatively independent from the rest of folate metabolism. To test this apparent modularity, we used quantitative growth rate measurements and forward evolution in E. coli to demonstrate that the two enzymes are coupled to one another, and can adapt independently from the remainder of the genome. Mechanistically, the coupling between DHFR and TYMS is driven by a constraint wherein TYMS activity must not greatly exceed that of DHFR - both to avoid depletion of reduced folates and prevent accumulation of the metabolic intermediate dihydrofolate. Extending our comparative genomics analyses genome-wide reveals over 200 gene pairs with statistical signatures similar to DHFR/TYMS, suggesting the possibility that cellular pathways might be decomposed into small adaptive units.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs around the world are under threat due to anthropogenic impacts on the environment. It is therefore important to develop methods to monitor the status of the reefs and detect changes in the health condition of the corals at an early stage before severe damage occur. In this work, we evaluate underwater hyperspectral imaging as a method to detect changes in health status of both orange and white color morphs of the coral species Lophelia pertusa.\\n\\nDiffering health status was achieved by exposing 66 coral samples to the toxic compound 2-methylnaphthalene in concentrations of 0 mg L-1 to 3.5 mg L-1. A machine learning model was utilized to classify corals according to lethal concentration (LC) levels LC5 (5 % mortality) and LC25 (25 % mortality), solely based on their reflectance spectra. All coral samples were classified to correct concentration group. This is a first step towards developing a remote sensing technique able to assess environmental impact on deep-water coral habitats over larger areas.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe resistome, which refers to all of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, is frequently studied using shotgun metagenomic data [14, 47]. Unfortunately, few existing methods are able to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within metagenomic data, and to the best of our knowledge, no methods exist to detect SNPs within AMR genes within the resistome. The ability to identify SNPs in AMR genes across the resistome would represent a significant advance in understanding the dissemination and evolution of AMR, as SNP identification would enable \\\"fingerprinting\\\" of the resistome, which could then be used to track AMR dynamics across various settings and/or time periods.\\n\\nResultsWe present LueVari, a reference-free SNP caller based on the read colored de Bruijn graph, an extension of the traditional de Bruijn graph that allows repeated regions longer than the k-mer length and shorter than the read length to be identified unambiguously. We demonstrate LueVari was the only method that had reliable sensitivity (between 73% and 98%) as the performance of competing methods varied widely. Furthermore, we show LueVari constructs sequences containing the variation which span 93% of the gene in datasets with lower coverage (15X), and 100% of the gene in datasets with higher coverage (30X).\\n\\nAvailabilityCode and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/baharpan/cosmo/tree/LueVari.",

However, the relationship between target RNA binding and HEPN (higher-eukaryotes-and-prokaryotes nucleotide-binding)- domain nuclease activation is not well understood. Using sequencing experiments coupled with in vitro biochemistry, we find that Cas13as target RNA binding affinity and HEPN-nuclease activity are differentially affected by the number of and position of mismatches between the guide and target. We identify a central  binding seed where perfect base pairing is absolutely required for target binding, and a separate  nuclease switch where imperfect base-pairing results in tight binding but no HEPN-nuclease activation. These results demonstrate that the binding and cleavage activities of Cas13a are decoupled, highlighting a complex specificity landscape. Our findings underscore a need to consider the range of effects off-target recognition has on Cas13as RNA binding and cleavage behavior for RNA-targeting tool development.",

    "abstract": "To behave adaptively in environments that are noisy and non-stationary, humans and other animals must monitor feedback from their environment and adjust their predictions and actions accordingly. An under-studied approach for modeling these adaptive processes comes from the engineering field of control theory, which provides general principles for regulating dynamical systems, often without requiring a generative model. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is one of the most popular models of industrial process control. The proportional term is analogous to the \\\"delta rule\\\" in psychology, adjusting estimates in proportion to each successive error in prediction. The integral and derivative terms augment this update to simultaneously improve accuracy and stability. Here, we tested whether the PID algorithm can describe how people sequentially adjust their predictions in response to new information. Across three experiments, we found that the PID controller was an effective model of participants decisions in noisy, changing environments. In Experiment 1, we re-analyzed a change-point detection experiment, and showed that participants behavior incorporated elements of PID updating. In Experiments 2-3 we developed a task with gradual transitions that we optimized to detect PID-like adjustments. In both experiments, the PID model offered better descriptions of behavioral adjustments than both the classical delta-rule model and its more sophisticated variant, the Kalman filter. We further examined how participants weighted different PID terms in response to salient environmental events, finding that these control terms were modulated by reward, surprise, and outcome entropy. These experiments provide preliminary evidence that adaptive behavior in dynamic environments resembles PID control.",

    "abstract": "Social challenges like territorial intrusions evoke behavioral responses in widely diverging species. Recent work has revealed that evolutionary \\\"toolkits\\\" - genes and modules with lineage-specific variations but deep conservation of function - participate in the behavioral response to social challenge. Here, we develop a multi-species computational-experimental approach to characterize such a toolkit at a systems level. Brain transcriptomic responses to social challenge was probed via RNA-seq profiling in three diverged species - honey bees, mice, and three-spined stickleback fish - following a common methodology, allowing fair comparisons across species. Data were collected from multiple brain regions and multiple time points after social challenge exposure, achieving anatomical and temporal resolution substantially greater than previous work. We developed statistically rigorous analyses equipped to find homologous functional groups among these species at the levels of individual genes, functional and coexpressed gene modules, and transcription factor sub-networks. We identified six orthogroups involved in response to social challenge, including groups represented by mouse genes Npas4 and Nr4a1, as well as common modulation of systems such as transcriptional regulators, ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and synaptic proteins. We also identified conserved coexpression modules enriched for mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and heat shock that constitute the shared neurogenomic response. Our analysis suggests a toolkit wherein nuclear receptors, interacting with chaperones, induce transcriptional changes in mitochondrial activity, neural cytoarchitecture, and synaptic transmission after social challenge. It reveals systems-level mechanisms that have been repeatedly co-opted during evolution of analogous behaviors, thus advancing the genetic toolkit concept beyond individual genes.",

    "abstract": "The Full Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) is challenging to fit to behavioural data. Precision of the fits are usually poor for some if not all parameters, and computationally expensive to obtain. Moreover, inference at the trial level for each and every parameters, threshold included, has so far been considered as impossible. Most approaches rely on strong assumptions about the model structure, such as selection of the parameters that are subject to trial-to-trial variability or prior distribution of these parameters, that usually lack precise mathematical or empirical justifications. The fact that, in most versions of the DDM, the sequence of participants choices are considered as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), has been mainly overlooked so far. Our contribution to the field is threefold: first, we introduce Variational Bayes as a method to fit the full DDM. Second, we relax the i.i.d. assumption, and propose a data-driven algorithm based on a Recurrent Auto-Encoder, that estimates the local posterior probability of the DDM parameters at each trial based on the sequence of parameters and data preceding the data. Finally, we show that inference at the trial level can be achieved efficiently for each and every parameter of the DDM, threshold included. This data-driven approach is highly generic and self-contained, in the sense that no external input (e.g. regressors or physiological measure) is necessary to fit the data. Using simulations and real-world examples, we show that this method outperforms by several order of magnitude the i.i.d.-based ones, either Markov Chain Monte Carlo or i.i.d.-VB.",

    "abstract": "More than a hundred years after Griggs influential analysis of species borders, the causes of limits to species ranges still represent a puzzle that has never been understood with clarity. The topic has become especially important recently as many scientists have become interested in the potential for species ranges to shift in response to climate change - and yet, nearly all of those studies fail to recognise or incorporate evolutionary genetics in a way that relates to theoretical developments. I show that range margins can be understood based on just two measurable parameters: i) the fitness cost of dispersal - a measure of environmental heterogeneity - and ii) the strength of genetic drift, which reduces genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an expansion threshold: adaptation fails when genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below that required for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. When the key parameters drop below this expansion threshold locally, a sharp range margin forms. When they drop below this threshold throughout the species range, adaptation collapses everywhere, resulting in either extinction, or formation of a fragmented meta-population. Because the effects of dispersal differ fundamentally with dimension, the second parameter - the strength of genetic drift - is qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat. In two-dimensional habitats, genetic drift becomes effectively independent of selection. It decreases with neighbourhood size - the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation. Moreover, in contrast to earlier predictions, which neglected evolution of genetic variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions, dispersal into small marginal populations aids adaptation. This is because the reduction of both genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger effect than the cost of dispersal through increased maladaptation. The expansion threshold thus provides a novel, theoretically justified and testable prediction for formation of the range margin and collapse of the species range.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGene flow across environments has conflicting effects: while it increases the genetic variation necessary for adaptation and counters the loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift, it may also swamp adaptation to local conditions. This interplay is crucial for the dynamics of a species range expansion, which can thus be understood based on two dimensionless parameters: i) the fitness cost of dispersal - a measure of environmental heterogeneity - and ii) the strength of genetic drift - a measure of reduction of genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an expansion threshold: adaptation fails when the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation is so small that genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below the level required for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. This threshold provides a novel, theoretically justified and testable prediction for formation of a range margin and a collapse of a species range in two-dimensional habitats.",

Confirming our hypothesis based on previous psychophysics studies, we found that subjects showed liberal biases for unattended locations when detecting specific colors of pedestrians clothing. A second experiment showed that this finding was not simply due to a confirmation bias in decision-making when subjects were uncertain.

However, how the integration of antagonistic signals occurs upon NK cell-target cell interaction is not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that NK cell inhibition via the inhibitory receptor Ly49A is dependent on its relative colocalization at the nanometer scale with the activating receptor NKG2D upon immune synapse (IS) formation. NKG2D and Ly49A signal integration and colocalization was studied using NKG2D-GFP and Ly49A-RFP-expressing primary NK cells, forming ISs with NIH3T3 target cells, with or without expression of single chain trimer (SCT) H2-Dd and an extended form of SCT H2-Dd-CD4 MHC-I molecules. Nanoscale colocalization was assessed by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between NKG2D-GFP and Ly49A-RFP and measured for each synapse. In the presence of their respective cognate ligands, NKG2D and Ly49A colocalize at a nanometer scale leading to NK cell inhibition. However, increasing the size of the Ly49A ligand reduced the nanoscale colocalization with NKG2D consequently impairing Ly49A-mediated inhibition. Thus, our data shows NK cell signal integration is critically dependent on the dimensions of NK cell ligand-receptor pairs by affecting their relative nanometer-scale colocalization at the IS. Together, our results suggest the balance of NK cell signals, and NK cell responses, are determined by the relative nanoscale colocalization of activating and inhibitory receptors in the immune synapse.",

Here, we demonstrate usefulness and applicability of our method through example use cases, showing how it can be used to prioritise the development of new in-vitro models and to effectively unveil patient-derived multivariate prognostic and therapeutic markers.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/275032v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11f46b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5a207aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10a57edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b332_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Earths biota is changing over time in complex ways. A critical challenge is to test whether specific biomes, taxa or types of species benefit or suffer in a time of accelerating global change. We analysed nearly 10 000 abundance time series from over 2000 vertebrate species part of the Living Planet Database. We integrated abundance data with information on geographic range, habitat preference, taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and IUCN Red List Categories and threats. We found that 15% of populations declined, 18% increased, and 67% showed no net changes over time. Against a backdrop of no biogeographic and phylogenetic patterning in population change, we uncovered a distinct taxonomic signal. Amphibians were the only taxa that experienced net declines in the analysed data, while birds, mammals and reptiles experienced net increases. Population trends were poorly captured by species rarity and global-scale threats. Incorporation of the full spectrum of population change will improve conservation efforts to protect global biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "One key problem in precision genome editing is the resultant unpredictable plurality of sequence outcomes at the site of targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This is due to the typical activation of the versatile Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. Such unpredictability limits the utility of somatic gene editing for applications including gene therapy and functional genomics. For germline editing work, the accurate reproduction of identical alleles using NHEJ is a labor intensive process. In this study, we propose inducing Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ) as a viable solution for improving somatic sequence homogeneity in vivo, capable of generating a single predictable allele at high rates (56% ~ 86% of the entire mutant allele pool). Using a combined dataset from zebrafish (Danio rerio) in vivo and human HeLa cell in vitro as a training dataset, we identified specific contextual sequence determinants surrounding genomic DSBs for robust MMEJ pathway activation. We then applied our observation and prospectively designed MMEJ-inducing sgRNAs against a variety of proof-of-principle genes and demonstrated a high level of mutant allele homogeneity at these loci. F0 mutant zebrafish embryos and larvae generated with these gRNAs faithfully recapitulated previously reported, recessive loss-of-function phenotypes. We also provide a novel algorithm MENTHU (http://genesculpt.org/menthu/) for improved prediction of candidate MMEJ loci, suitable for both targeted and genome-wide applications. We believe that this MMEJ-centric approach will have a broad impact on genome engineering and its applications. For example, whereas somatic mosaicism hinders efficient recreation of a knockout mutant allele at base pair resolution via the standard NHEJ-based approach, we demonstrate that F0 founders transmitted the identical MMEJ allele of interest at high rates. Most importantly, the ability to directly dictate the reading frame of an endogenous target will have important implications for gene therapy applications in human genetic diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNew gene editing tools precisely break DNA at pre-defined genomic locations, but cells repair these lesions using diverse pathways that often lead to unpredictable outcomes in the resulting DNA sequences. This sequence diversity in gene editing outcomes represents an important obstacle to the application of this technology for human therapies. Using a vertebrate animal as a model system, we provide strong evidence that we can overcome this obstacle by selectively directing DNA repair of double-stranded breaks through a lesser-described pathway termed Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ). Unlike other, better-understood pathways, MMEJ uses recurring short sequence patterns surrounding the site of DNA breakage. This enables the prediction of repair outcomes with improved accuracy. Importantly, we also show that preferential activation of MMEJ is compatible with effective gene editing. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm and software for designing DNA-breaking reagents that have high chance of activating the MMEJ pathway. We believe that the MMEJ-centric approach to be broadly applicable for a variety of gene editing applications both within the laboratory and for human therapies.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionHA contributed in Conceptualization, Data Curation, Formal Analysis, Investigation, Funding Acquisition, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - Original draft preparation, and Writing - Review and Editing.

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages shape microbial communities by predating on them and by accelerating their adaptation through horizontal gene transfer. The former is the basis of phage therapy, whereas the latter drives the evolution of numerous bacterial pathogens. We present a novel computational approach (eVIVALDI - eco-eVolutionary mIcrobial indiViduAL-baseD sImulations) to study phage-bacteria ecological interactions that integrates a large number of processes, including population dynamics, environmental structure, genome evolution, and phage-mediated horizontal transfer. We validate and illustrate the relevance of the model by focusing on three specific questions: the ecological interactions between bacteria and virulent phage during phage and antibiotic therapy, the role of prophages as competitive weapons, and how autotransduction facilitates bacterial acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes upon lysis of antibiotic resistant competitors. Our model recapitulates experimental and theoretical observations and provides novel insights. In particular, we find that environmental structure has a strong effect on community dynamics and evolutionary outcomes in all three case studies. Strong environmental structure, relative to well-mixed environments and especially if antibiotics are heterogeneously distributed, enhances the rate of acquisition of resistance to both phages and antibiotics, and leads to more accurate predictions of the dynamics of lysogen invasion in the gastrointestinal tract. We predicted the co-existence of invaders and resident lysogens in autotransduction under a range of parameters, and validated this key prediction experimentally. By linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics, our modelling approach sheds light on the factors that influence the dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions. It can also be expanded to put forward novel hypotheses, facilitating the design of phage therapy treatments and the assessment of the role of phages in the spread of antibiotic resistance.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn the face of a growing threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria, bacteriophages have re-emerged as a potential alternative to clinical treatments of infections, as they are efficient bacterial predators. However, bacteriophages can also promote, through a mechanism called transduction, the dissemination of adaptive traits between bacteria, including antibiotic resistance genes. Importantly, these two types of interactions (predation and transduction) can co-occur, which creates difficulties in predicting their outcome. We have developed eVIVALDI (eco-eVolutionary mIcrobial indiViduAL-baseD sImulations), a computational model that allows the simulation of microbial communities with a focus on the mechanisms involved in phage-bacteria interactions, across time and in different types of environments. eVIVALDI can be used to understand the conditions where phages are more likely to be successfully used to eliminate bacteria or, in the other hand, the conditions where they increase the probability of dissemination of adaptive traits. Our research highlights the importance of considering the diverse ways that phage and bacteria interact, and the relevant ecological conditions where these interactions take place, to understand how bacteriophages shape microbial communities and how they can be used as a clinical tool.",

Here, to determine the regionalized morphogenetic impact of Dlx5/6 expression, we specifically target their inactivation or overexpression to NCCs. NCC-specific Dlx5/6 inactivation (NCC{Delta}Dlx5/6) generates severely hypomorphic lower jaws that present typical maxillary traits. Therefore, differently from the symmetric jaws obtained after constitutive Dlx5/6 inactivation, NCC{Delta}Dlx5/6 embryos present a strikingly asymmetric mouth. Reciprocally, forced Dlx5 expression in maxillary NCCs provokes the appearance of distinct mandibular characters in the upper jaw. We conclude that: 1) Dlx5/6 activation in NCCs invariably determines lower jaw identity; 2) the morphogenetic processes that generate functional matching jaws depend on the harmonization of Dlx5/6 expression in NCCs and in distinct ectodermal territories. The co-evolution of synergistic opposing jaws requires the coordination of distinct regulatory pathways involving the same transcription factors in distant embryonic territories.",

However, increasing research demonstrates significant overlap between these constructs such that as working memory availability decreases, individuals perform worse on attention-based tasks. To date, the neural mechanisms involved in this interaction are unknown. We measured three candidate lateralized event-related potential components (N2pc, Ptc, and SPCN) to observe the effects of increased working memory load on selective processing of targets and distractors. We found that increased working memory load impaired the processing of distractors, but not targets, and this was reflected in attentuation of the Ptc to distractors. We also found that individual performance on the task is related to the neural response to both targets and distractors. This study suggests that working memory availability impacts individuals ability to disengage from irrelevant stimuli, and that individual differences in visual search ability under load are related to both target and distractor processing.",

Recently, sequence based classification was performed on distantly related crAss-like phages from multiple environments, leading to the proposal of a familial level taxonomic group [Yutin N, et al. (2018) Discovery of an expansive bacteriophage family that includes the most abundant viruses from the human gut. Nat Microbiol 3(1):38-46]. Here, we assembled the metagenomic sequencing reads from 702 human faecal virome/phageome samples and obtained 98 complete circular crAss-like phage genomes and 145 contigs [&ge;]70kb. In silico comparative genomics and taxonomic analysis was performed, resulting in a classification scheme of crAss-like phages from human faecal microbiomes into 4 candidate subfamilies composed of 10 candidate genera. Moreover, laboratory analysis was performed on faecal samples from an individual harbouring 7 distinct crAss-like phages. We achieved propagation of crAss-like phages in ex vivo human faecal fermentations and visualised Podoviridae virions by electron microscopy. Furthermore, detection of a crAss-like phage capsid protein could be linked to metagenomic sequencing data confirming crAss-like phage structural annotations.\\n\\nSignificanceCrAssphage is the most abundant biological entity in the human gut, but it remains uncultured in the laboratory and its host(s) is unknown. CrAssphage was not identified in metagenomic studies for many years as its sequence is so different from anything present in databases. To this day, it can only be detected from sequences assembled from metagenomics or viromic datasets (crAss - cross Assembly). In this study, we identified 243 new crAss-like phages from human faecal metagenomic studies. Taxonomic analysis of these crAss-like phages highlighted their extensive diversity within the human microbiome. We also present the first propagation of crAssphage in faecal fermentations and provide the first electron micrographs of this extraordinary bacteriophage.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing of genes increases the number of distinct proteins in a cell. In the brain it is highly prevalent, presumably because proteome diversity is crucial for establishing the complex circuitry between trillions of neurons. To provide individual cells with different repertoires of protein isoforms, however, this process must be regulated. Previously, we found that the mutually exclusive alternative splicing of a cell surface protein, Dscam2 produces two isoforms (exon 10A and 10B) with unique binding properties. This splicing event is tightly regulated and crucial for maintaining axon terminal size, dendritic morphology and synaptic numbers. Here, we show that Drosophila Muscleblind (Mbl), a conserved splicing factor implicated in myotonic dystrophy, controls Dscam2 alternative splicing. Removing mbl from cells that normally express isoform B induces the expression of isoform A and eliminates the expression of B, demonstrating that Mbl represses one alternative exon and selects the other. Mbl mutants exhibit phenotypes that are also observed in flies engineered to express a single isoform. Consistent with these observations, mbl expression is cell-type-specific and correlates with the expression of isoform B. Our study demonstrates how the regulated expression of a splicing factor is sufficient to provide neurons with unique protein isoforms crucial for development.",

    "abstract": "Our perceptions result from the brains ability to make inferences, or predictive models, of sensory information. Recently, it has been proposed that psychotic traits may be linked to impaired predictive processes. Here, we examine the brain dynamics underlying sensory learning and inference in stable and volatile environments, in a population of healthy individuals (N=75) with a range of psychotic-like experiences. We measured prediction error responses to sound sequences with electroencephalography, gauged sensory inference explicitly by behaviourally recording sensory  regularity learning errors, and used dynamic causal modelling to tap into the underlying neural circuitry. We discuss the findings that were robust to replication across the two experiments (N=31 and N=44 for the discovery and the validation datasets, respectively). First, we found that during stable conditions, participants demonstrated a stronger predictive model, reflected in a larger prediction error response to unexpected sounds, and decreased regularity learning errors. Moreover, individuals with attenuated prediction errors in stable conditions were found to make greater incorrect predictions about sensory information. Critically, we show that greater errors in sensory learning and inference are related to increased psychotic-like experiences. These findings link neurophysiology to behaviour during sensory learning and prediction formation, as well as providing further evidence for the idea of a continuum of psychosis in the healthy, non-clinical population.\n\nSignificance StatementWhilst perceiving the world, we make inferences by learning the regularities present in the sensory environment. It has been argued that psychosis may emerge due to a failure to learn sensory regularities, resulting in an impaired representation of the world. Recently it has been proposed that psychosis exists on a continuum; however, there is conflicting evidence on whether sensory learning deficits align on the non-clinical end of the psychosis continuum. We found that sensory learning is associated with brain prediction errors, and critically, it is impaired in healthy people who report more psychotic-like experiences. We replicated these findings in an independent sample, demonstrating strengthened credibility to support that the continuum of psychosis extends into the non-clinical population.",

As part of their function, they withstand extrinsic mechanical stresses applied at high strain rate. However, little is known about how monolayers respond to mechanical deformations. In stress relaxation tests, monolayers respond in a biphasic manner and stress dissipation is accompanied by an increase in monolayer resting length, pointing to active remodelling of cell architecture during relaxation. Consistent with this, actomyosin remodels at a rate commensurate with mechanical relaxation and governs the rate of monolayer stress relaxation - as in single cells. By contrast, junctional complexes and intermediate filaments form stable connections between cells, enabling monolayers to behave rheologically as single cells. Together, these data show actomyosin cytoskeletal dynamics govern the rheological properties of monolayers by enabling active, ATP-dependent changes in the resting length.

    "abstract": "Random polyampholytes (PAs) contain positively and negatively charged monomers that are distributed randomly along the polymer chain. The interaction between charges is assumed to be given by the Debye-Huckel potential. We show that the size of the PA is determined by an interplay between electrostatic interactions, giving rise to the polyelectrolyte (PE) effect due to net charge per monomer ({sigma}), and an effective attractive PA interaction due to charge fluctuations,{delta}{sigma} . The interplay between these terms gives rise to non-monotonic dependence of the radius of gyration, Rg on the inverse Debye length,{kappa} when PA effects are important [Formula]. In the opposite limit, Rg decreases monotonically with increasing{kappa} . Simulations of PA chains, using a charged bead-spring model, further corroborates our theoretical predictions. The simulations unambiguously show that conformational heterogeneity manifests itself among sequences that have identical PA parameters. A clear implication is that the phases of PA sequences, and by inference IDPs, cannot be determined using only the bare PA parameters ({sigma} and{delta}{sigma} ).The theory is used to calculate the changes in Rg on N, the number of residues for a set of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). For a certain class of IDPs, with N between 24 to 441, the size grows as Rg ~ N0.6, which agrees with data from Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments.",

    "abstract": "A cell can divide only upon completion of chromosome segregation, or its daughters would lose genetic material [1, 2]. In E. coli bacteria, the prevalent view is that cells divide a fixed amount of time after they start to copy the chromosomes [3, 4], and a known pathway prevents cells from dividing if the chromosomes interfere with the cytokinesis machinery [5]. However, whether completion of segregation is typically the bottleneck process for the decision to divide has never been stringently tested on single cells. We show how key trends in single-cell data lead to challenge the classic idea of replication-segregation limiting cell division. Instead, the data agree with a model where two concurrent processes (setting replication initiation and inter-division time) set cell division on competing time scales. During each cell cycle, division is set by the slowest process (an \\\" ...",

    "abstract": "The ordered assembly of tau protein into abnormal filamentous inclusions underlies many human neurodegenerative diseases1. Tau assemblies appear to spread through specific neural networks in each disease2, with short filaments having the greatest seeding activity3. The abundance of tau inclusions strongly correlates with disease symptoms4. Six tau isoforms are expressed in normal adult human brain - three isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats each (4R tau) and three isoforms lacking the second repeat (3R tau)1. In various diseases, tau filaments can be composed of either 3R tau or 4R tau, or of both 3R and 4R tau. They have distinct cellular and neuroanatomical distributions5, with morphological and biochemical differences suggesting that they may be able to adopt disease-specific molecular conformations6,7. Such conformers may give rise to different neuropathological phenotypes8,9, reminiscent of prion strains10. However, the underlying structures are not known. Using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), we recently reported the structures of tau filaments from Alzheimers disease, which contain both 3R and 4R tau11. Here we have determined the structures of tau filaments from Picks disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by frontotemporal dementia. They consist of residues K254-F378 of 3R tau, which are folded differently when compared to tau in Alzheimers disease filaments, establishing the existence of conformers of assembled tau. The Pick fold explains the selective incorporation of 3R tau in Pick bodies and the differences in phosphorylation relative to the tau filaments of Alzheimers disease. Our findings show how tau can adopt distinct folds in human brain in different diseases, an essential step for understanding the formation and propagation of molecular conformers.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome is the main microtubule-organizing centre. It also organizes a local network of actin filaments. However, the precise function of the actin network at the centrosome is not well understood. Here we show that increasing densities of actin filaments at the centrosome of lymphocytes were correlated with reduced amounts of microtubules. Furthermore, lymphocyte activation resulted in centrosomal-actin disassembly and an increase in microtubule number. To further investigate the direct crosstalk between actin and microtubules at the centrosome, we performed in vitro reconstitution assays based on (i) purified centrosomes and (ii) on the co-micropatterning of microtubule seeds and actin filaments. The two assays demonstrated that actin filaments perturb microtubule growth by steric hindrance. Finally, we showed that cell adhesion and spreading leads to lower densities of centrosomal actin thus resulting in higher microtubule growth. Hence we propose a novel mechanism by which the number of centrosomal microtubules is regulated by cell adhesion and actin-network architecture.",

    "abstract": "The impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics, often coupled with exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, is emerging as a common mechanism in diseases of organs with a high demand for energy, such as the heart. Building a more robust cellular powerhouse holds promise for protecting these organs in stressful conditions. Here, we demonstrate that NDUFAB1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1), acts as a powerful cardio-protector by enhancing mitochondrial energy biogenesis. In particular, NDUFAB1 coordinates the assembly of respiratory complexes I, II, and III and supercomplexes, conferring greater capacity and efficiency of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Cardiac-specific deletion of Ndufab1 in mice caused progressive dilated cardiomyopathy associated with defective bioenergetics and elevated ROS levels, leading to heart failure and sudden death. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of Ndufab1 effectively enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetics and protected the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our findings identify NDUFAB1 as a central endogenous regulator of mitochondrial energy and ROS metabolism and thus provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure and other mitochondrial bioenergetics-centered diseases.",

In zebrafish, genetic mutants and chemical perturbations affecting FGF signaling have uncovered key developmental processes; however, these approaches cause embryo-wide FGF signaling perturbations, rendering assessment of cell-autonomous versus non-autonomous requirements for FGF signaling in individual processes difficult. Here, we created the novel transgenic line fgfr1-dn-cargo, encoding dominant-negative Fgfr1 with fluorescent tag under combined Cre/lox and heatshock control to provide spatio-temporal perturbation of FGF signaling. Validating efficient perturbation of FGF signaling by fgfr1-dn-cargo primed with ubiquitous CreERT2, we established that primed, heatshock-induced fgfr1-dn-cargo behaves akin to pulsed treatment with the FGFR inhibitor SU5402. Priming fgfr1-dn-cargo with CreERT2 in the lateral plate mesoderm, we observed selective cardiac and pectoral fin phenotypes without drastic impact on overall embryo patterning. Harnessing lateral plate mesoderm-specific FGF inhibition, we recapitulated the cell-autonomous and temporal requirement for FGF signaling in pectoral fin outgrow, as previously hypothesized from pan-embryonic FGF inhibition. Altogether, our results establish fgfr1-dn-cargo as a genetic tool to define the spatio-temporal requirements for FGF signaling in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory has been successful in describing phenomena from bacterial population dynamics to the evolution of social behavior. Interactions between individuals are usually captured by a single game. In reality, however, individuals take part in many interactions. Here, we include multiple games and analyze their individual and combined evolutionary dynamics. A typical assumption is that the evolutionary dynamics of individual behavior can be understood by constructing one big comprehensive interactions structure, a single big game. But if any one of the multiple games has more than two strategies, then the combined dynamics cannot be understood by looking only at individual games. Devising a method to study multiple games - where each game could have an arbitrary number of players and strategies - we provide a concise replicator equation, and analyze its resulting dynamics. Moreover, in the case of finite populations, we formulate and calculate a basic and useful property of stochasticity, fixation probability. Our results reveal that even when interactions become incredibly complex, their properties can be captured by relatively simple concepts of evolutionary game(s) theory.",

    "abstract": "Orthologs document the evolution of genes and metabolic capacities encoded in extant and ancient genomes. Orthologous genes that are detected across the full diversity of contemporary life allow reconstructing the gene set of LUCA, the last universal common ancestor. These genes presumably represent the functional repertoire common to - and necessary for - all living organisms. Design of artificial life has the potential to test this. Recently, a minimal gene (MG) set for a self-replicating cell was determined experimentally, and a surprisingly high number of genes have unknown functions and are not represented in LUCA. However, as similarity between orthologs decays with time, it becomes insufficient to infer common ancestry, leaving ancient gene set reconstructions incomplete and distorted to an unknown extent. Here we introduce the evolutionary traceability, together with the software protTrace, that quantifies, for each protein, the evolutionary distance beyond which the sensitivity of the ortholog search becomes limiting. We show that the LUCA set comprises only high-traceable proteins most of which have catalytic functions. We further show that proteins in the MG set lacking orthologs outside bacteria mostly have low traceability, leaving open whether their eukaryotic orthologs have just been overlooked. On the example of REC8, a protein essential for chromosome cohesion, we demonstrate how a traceability-informed adjustment of the search sensitivity identifies hitherto missed orthologs in the fast-evolving microsporidia. Taken together, the evolutionary traceability helps to differentiate between true absence and non-detection of orthologs, and thus improves our understanding about the evolutionary conservation of functional protein networks.",

    "abstract": "Gaze saccades -rapid shifts of the eyes and head toward a goal-- have provided fundamental insights into the neural control of movement. For example, it has been shown that the superior colliculus (SC) transforms a visual target (T) code to future gaze (G) location commands after a memory delay. However, this transformation has not been observed in  reactive saccades made directly to a stimulus, so its contribution to normal gaze behavior is unclear. Here, we tested this using a quantitative measure of the spatial continuum between T and G coding based on variable gaze errors. We demonstrate that a rapid T-G transformation occurs between SC visual and motor responses during reactive saccades, even within visuomotor cells, with a continuous spatiotemporal shift in coding occurring in cell types (visual, visuomotor, motor). We further show that the primary determinant of this spatial code was not the intrinsic visual-motor index of different cells or populations, but rather the timing of the response in all cells. These results suggest that the SC provides a rapid spatiotemporal transformation for normal gaze saccades, that its motor responses contribute to variable gaze errors, and that those errors arise from a noisy spatiotemporal transformation involving all SC neurons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOculomotor studies have demonstrated visuomotor transformations in structures like the superior colliculus with the use of trained behavioral manipulations, like the memory delay and antisaccades tasks, but it is not known how this happens during normal saccades. Here, using a spatiotemporal model fitting method based on endogenous gaze errors in  reactive gaze saccades, we show that the superior colliculus provides a rapid spatiotemporal transformation from target to gaze coding that involves visual, visuomotor, and motor neurons. This technique demonstrates that SC spatial codes are not fixed, and may provide a quantitative biomarker for assessing the health of sensorimotor transformations.",

For decades these Fourier-based approaches have successfully uncovered links between oscillations and cognition or disease. However, because of the fundamental sinusoidal basis, these methods might not fully capture neural oscillatory dynamics, because neural data are both nonsinusoidal and non-stationary. Here, we present a new analysis framework, complementary to Fourier analysis, that quantifies cycle-by-cycle time-domain features. For each cycle, the amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry are measured, the latter of which is missed using conventional approaches. Additionally, oscillatory bursts are algorithmically identified, allowing us to investigate the variability of oscillatory features within and between bursts. This approach is validated on simulated noisy signals with oscillatory bursts and outperforms conventional metrics. Further, these methods are applied to real data--including hippocampal theta, motor cortical beta, and visual cortical alpha--and can differentiate behavioral conditions.",

We combined a reinforcement learning task with a computational model to study pupil responses during value-based decisions, and decision evaluations. We found that the pupil closely tracks reinforcement learning both across trials and participants. Prior to choice, the pupil dilated as a function of trial-by-trial fluctuations in value beliefs. After feedback, early dilation scaled with value uncertainty, whereas later constriction scaled with reward prediction errors. Our computational approach systematically implicates the pupil in value-based decisions, and the subsequent processing of violated value beliefs.

    "abstract": "In genomics, transcriptomics, and related biological fields (collectively known as omics), it is common to work with n << p datasets with the dimensionality much larger than the sample size. In recent years, combinations of experimental techniques began to yield multiple sets of features for the same set of biological replicates. One example is Patch-seq, a method combining single-cell RNA sequencing with electrophysiological recordings from the same cells. Here we present a framework based on sparse reduced-rank regression for obtaining an interpretable visualization of the relationship between the transcriptomic and the electrophysiological data. We use an elastic net regularization penalty that yields sparse solutions and allows for an efficient computational implementation. Using several publicly available Patch-seq datasets, we show that sparse reduced-rank regression outperforms both sparse full-rank regression and non-sparse reduced-rank regression in terms of predictive performance, and can outperform existing methods for sparse partial least squares and sparse canonical correlation analysis in terms of out-of-sample correlations. We introduce a bibiplot visualization in order to display the dominant factors determining the relationship between transcriptomic and electrophysiological properties of neurons. We believe that sparse reduced-rank regression can provide a valuable tool for the exploration and visualization of paired multivariate datasets, including Patch-seq.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropic effects of mutations may underlie diverse biological phenomena such as ageing and specialization. In particular, antagonistic pleiotropy (\\\"AP\\\": when a mutation has opposite fitness effects in different environments) generates tradeoffs, which may constrain adaptation. Models of adaptation typically assume that AP is common - especially among large-effect mutations - and that pleiotropic effect sizes are positively correlated. The rare empirical tests of these assumptions have largely focused on beneficial mutations observed under strong selection, whereas most mutations are actually deleterious or neutral, and are removed by selection. We quantified the incidence, nature and effect size of pleiotropy for carbon utilization across 80 single mutations in Escherichia coli that arose under mutation accumulation (i.e. weak selection). Although ~46% of the mutations were pleiotropic, only 11% showed AP, which is lower than expected given the distributions of fitness effects for each resource. In some environments, AP was more common in large-effect mutations (but not synergistic pleiotropy, SP); whereas pleiotropic effect sizes were positively correlated for SP (but not AP). Thus, AP is generally rare, is not consistently enriched in large-effect mutations, and often involves weakly deleterious antagonistic effects. Our unbiased quantification of mutational effects therefore suggests that antagonistic pleiotropy is unlikely to cause maladaptive tradeoffs.",

    "abstract": "Genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - is a disruptive method that has widely been adopted by animal and plant breeders to increase productivity. It was recently shown that other sources of molecular variations such as those resulting from transcripts or metabolites could be used to accurately predict complex traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of capturing the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex regulatory networks that occur in the different layers between the genome and the phenotype. However, obtaining such omics data at very large scales, such as those typically experienced in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput, low cost and non-destructive tool to indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute relationship matrices for predicting complex traits and coined this new approach \\\"phenomic selection\\\" (PS). We tested PS on two species of economic interest (Triticum aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various tissues (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers, for developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, even in environments radically different from the one in which NIRS were collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and provides new perspectives for the breeding community, as PS is theoretically applicable to any organism at low cost and does not require any molecular information.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYDespite its widely adopted interest in breeding, genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - remains difficult to implement for many species because of genotyping costs. As an alternative or complement depending on the context, we propose \\\"phenomic selection\\\" (PS) as the use of low-cost and high-throughput phenotypic records to reconstruct similarities between genotypes and predict their performances. As a proof of concept of PS, we made use of near infrared spectroscopy applied to different tissues in poplar and wheat to predict various key traits and showed that PS could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers.",

    "abstract": "Fungi expressing P450nor, an unconventional nitric oxide (NO) reducing cytochrome P450, are thought to be significant contributors to soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, fungal contributions to N2O emissions remain uncertain due to inconsistencies in measurements of N2O formation by fungi. Much of the N2O emitted from antibiotic-amended soil microcosms is attributed to fungal activity, yet fungal isolates examined in pure culture are poor N2O producers. To assist in reconciling these conflicting observations and produce a benchmark genomic analysis of fungal denitrifiers, genes underlying fungal denitrification were examined in >700 fungal genomes. Of 167 p450nor-containing genomes identified, 0, 30, and 48 also harbored the denitrification genes narG, napA or nirK, respectively. Compared to napA and nirK, p450nor was twice as abundant and exhibited two to five-fold more gene duplications, losses, and transfers, indicating a disconnect between p450nor presence and denitrification potential. Furthermore, co-occurrence of p450nor with genes encoding NO-detoxifying flavohemoglobins (Spearman r = 0.87, p = 1.6e-10) confounds hypotheses regarding P450nors primary role in NO detoxification. Instead, ancestral state reconstruction united P450nor with actinobacterial cytochrome P450s (CYP105) involved in secondary metabolism (SM) and 19 (11 %) p450nor-containing genomic regions were predicted to be SM clusters. Another 40 (24 %) genomes harbored genes nearby p450nor predicted to encode hallmark SM functions, providing additional contextual evidence linking p450nor to SM. These findings underscore the potential physiological implications of widespread p450nor gene transfer, support the novel affiliation of p450nor with fungal SM, and challenge the hypothesis of p450nors primary role in denitrification.",

    "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous, persistent environmental contaminants, of which 16 are EPA-designated priority pollutants. Cardiotoxicity is observed in fish with developmental exposures to certain PAHs; however, the mechanism of toxicity can differ. Phenanthrene (PHE) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are both cardiotoxic to fish, but PHE acts independently of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation while BaP-associated cardiotoxicity is AHR-dependent. To further understanding of mechanisms of toxicity, we compared the effects of early exposure to the priority PAHs pyrene (PYR), fluoranthene (FLA), PHE and BaP on cardiac function and cytochrome P450 type 1A (cyp1a) mRNA expression, an indicator of AHR activation, in a model system with lower AHR sensitivity than that of fish, the embryos and larvae of Xenopus laevis. Exposure to PYR, PHE, and FLA (0.25 - 25 M) caused ventricular tachycardia early in heart development, but bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block in later stages. Elevated cyp1a mRNA levels indicate that FLA and BaP, but not PHE or PYR, are AHR agonists. The finding of FLA-induced cardiotoxicity and cyp1a expression (35-fold) is particularly surprising as FLA inhibits CYP1A activity in fish and, as a single compound, is not cardiotoxic. Our results suggest that early exposure to PHE, PYR, and FLA, but not to BaP, compromises cardiac function by altering normal pacemaker activity and conduction in Xenopus, effects associated with increased mortality. Our findings also reveal a considerable degree of species specificity between fish and frog regarding cardiac sensitivity to developmental PAH exposures and have implications for the cardiovascular health of PAH-exposed humans and wild amphibians.",

Here, we report an allosteric inhibitor peptide targeting an unexploited SH3-docking platform of retroviral IN. The crystal structure of the peptide in complex with the HIV-1 IN core domain reveals a steric interference that would inhibit conserved docking of SH3-containing domain with the core domain vital for IN multimerization, providing a template for the development of novel anti-IN allosteric inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "NADHX and NADPHX are hydrated and redox inactive forms of the NADH and NADPH cofactors, known to inhibit several dehydrogenases in vitro. A metabolite repair system that is conserved in all domains of life and that comprises the two enzymes NAD(P)HX dehydratase and NAD(P)HX epimerase, allows reconversion of both the S- and R-epimers of NADHX and NADPHX to the normal cofactors. An inherited deficiency in this system has recently been shown to cause severe neurometabolic disease in children. Although evidence for the presence of NAD(P)HX has been obtained in plant and human cells, little is known about the mechanism of formation of these derivatives in vivo and their potential effects on cell metabolism. Here, we show that NAD(P)HX dehydratase deficiency in yeast leads to an important, temperature-dependent NADHX accumulation in quiescent cells with a concomitant depletion of intracellular NAD+ and serine pools. We demonstrate that NADHX potently inhibits the first step of the serine synthesis pathway in yeast. Human cells deficient in the NAD(P)HX dehydratase also accumulated NADHX and showed decreased viability. In addition, those cells consumed more glucose and produced more lactate, potentially indicating impaired mitochondrial function. Our results provide first insights into how NADHX accumulation affects cellular functions and pave the way for a better understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the rapid and severe neurodegeneration leading to early death in NADHX repair deficient children.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing technologies have greatly improved the throughput of sequencing and reduced the cost to under $1000 per genome propelling ambitious projects across the globe that are pursuing sequencing million or more genomes. In addition, the sequencing throughput is increasing and the cost is decreasing at a rate much faster than the Moores law. This necessitates equivalent rate of acceleration of NGS secondary analysis that assembles the reads into full genomes and identifies variants between genomes. Conventional improvement in hardware can at best help accelerate this according to the Moores law if the corresponding software is able to use the hardware efficiently. This is currently not the case for majority of the dozens of software tools used for NGS secondary analysis. Thus, to keep pace with the rate of advancement of sequencers, we need - 1) hardware that is designed taking into account the computational requirements of NGS secondary analysis and 2) software tools that use the hardware efficiently.\\n\\nIn this work, we take the first step towards that goal by identifying the computational requirements of NGS secondary analysis. We surveyed dozens of software tools from all the three major problems in secondary analysis - sequence mapping, de novo assembly, and variant calling - to select seven popular tools and a workflow for an in depth analysis. We performed runtime profiling of the tools using multiple real datasets to find that the majority of the runtime is dominated by just four building blocks - Smith Waterman alignment, FM-index based sequence search, Debruijn graph construction and traversal and pairwise hidden markov model algorithm. Together, these building blocks cover 80.5%-98.2% of the runtime for sequence mapping, 63.9%-99.4% of the runtime for De novo assembly, and 72%-93% of the runtime for variant calling. The beauty of this result is that by just tailoring our software and hardware for these building blocks, we can get a major performance improvement of NGS secondary analysis.",

In the LH, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and hypocretin/orexin (HO) containing neurons differentially regulate these processes. Naked mole-rats (NMR) (Heterocephalus glaber) are eusocial mammals with remarkable physiological peculiarities including extreme longevity without significant weight gain and absence of thermoregulation. Altered hypothalamic function could potentially underlie the unusual NMR phenotypes, but to date electrophysiological characterization of LH NMR neurons and expression of MCH and HO is missing. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from LH neurons in acute NMR and mouse brain slices and found that NMR and mouse neuronal basic properties and activities were comparable. Additionally, we showed that both MCH-positive and HO-positive neuronal populations exist in the NMR hypothalamus and although the majority of MCH- and HO-positive neurons are located in the LH, as previously described in rodents, significant differences exist in MCH/HO distribution in other NMR hypothalamic areas. These results indicate that NMR LH neurons are comparable to mouse neurons with respect to their electrophysiological properties, but differences in the neuronal MCH and HO populations in hypothalamic regions exist and may contribute to the adaptive changes seen in NMR homeostatic processes.",

We used reaction times and EEG time-series decoding to test the hypothesis that the information flow is reversed when an event is reconstructed from memory, compared to when the same event is initially being perceived. Across three experiments, we found highly consistent evidence supporting such a reversed stream. When seeing an object, low-level perceptual features were discriminated faster behaviourally, and could be decoded from brain activity earlier, than high-level conceptual features. This pattern reversed during associative memory recall, with reaction times and brain activity patterns now indicating that conceptual information was reconstructed more rapidly than perceptual details. Our findings support a neurobiologically plausible model of human memory, suggesting that memory retrieval is a hierarchical, multi-layered process that prioritizes semantically meaningful information over perceptual detail.",

Putrescine (Put), a main polyamine in chloroplasts, plays a critical role in stress tolerance. To elucidate the mechanism of Put regulating CEF for salt-tolerance in cucumber leaves, we measured chlorophyll fluorescence, P700 redox state, ATP and NADPH accumulation and so on. The maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) was not influenced by NaCl and/or Put, but the activity of PSI reaction center (P700) was seriously inhibited by NaCl. Salt stress induced high level of CEF, moreover, NaCl and Put treated plants exhibited much higher CEF activity and ATP accumulation than single salt-treated plants to provide adequate ATP/NADPH ratio for plants growth. Furthermore, Put decreased the trans-membrane proton gradient ({Delta}pH), accompanied by reducing the pH-dependent non-photochemical quenching (qE) and increasing efficient quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)). The ratio of NADP+/NADPH in salt stressed leaves was significantly increased by Put, indicating that Put relieved over-reduction pressure at PSI accepter side. Taken together, our results suggest that exogenous Put enhances CEF to supply extra ATP for PSI recovery and CO2 assimilation, decreases {Delta}pH for electron transport related proteins staying active, and enable the non-photochemical quenching transformed into photochemical quenching.",

Like other tissues, skin is subject to temporal fluctuations in physiological responses under both homeostatic and stressed states. To gain insight into these fluctuations, we investigated the role of the circadian clock in the transcriptional regulation of epidermis using a hybrid experimental design, where a limited set of human subjects (n=20) were sampled throughout the 24 h cycle and a larger population (n=219) were sampled once. By looking at pairwise correlations of core clock genes in 298 skin samples, we found a robust circadian oscillator in skin at the population level. Encouraged by this, we used CYCLOPS to reconstruct the temporal order of all samples and identified hundreds of rhythmically-expressed genes at the population level in human skin. We compared these results with published time-series skin data from mouse and show strong concordance in circadian phase across species for both transcripts and pathways. Further, like blood, skin is readily accessible and a potential source of biomarkers. Using ZeitZeiger, we identified a biomarker set for human skin that is capable of reporting circadian phase to within 3 h from a single sample. In summary, we show rhythms in human skin that persist at the population scale and a path to develop robust single-sample circadian biomarkers.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryHuman epidermis shows strong circadian rhythms at the population scale and provides a better source for developing robust, single-sample circadian phase biomarkers than human blood.",

    "abstract": "Protein engineering is one of the foundations of biotechnology, used to increase protein stability, re-assign the catalytic properties of enzymes or increase the interaction affinity between antibody and target. To date, strategies for protein engineering have focussed on systematic, random or computational methods for introducing new mutations. Here, we introduce the statistical approach of fractional factorial design as a convenient and powerful tool for the design and analysis of protein mutations, allowing sampling of a large mutational space whilst minimising the tests to be done. Our test case is the integral membrane protein, Acridine resistance subunit B (AcrB), part of the AcrAB-TolC multi-protein complex, a multi-drug efflux pump of Gram-negative bacteria. E. coli AcrB is naturally histidine-rich, meaning that it is a common contaminant in the purification of recombinantly expressed, histidine-tagged membrane proteins. Coupled with the ability of AcrB to crystallise from picogram quantities causing false positives in 2-D and 3-D crystallisation screening, AcrB contamination represents a significant hindrance to the determination of new membrane protein structures. Here, we demonstrate the use of fractional factorial design for protein engineering, identifying the most important residues involved in the interaction between AcrB and nickel resin. We demonstrate that a combination of spatially close, but sequentially distant histidine residues are important for nickel binding, which were different from those predicted a priori. Fractional factorial methodology has the ability to decrease the time and material costs associated with protein engineering whilst expanding the depth of mutational space explored; a revolutionary concept.\\n\\nSignificance statementProtein engineering is important for the production of enzymes for bio-manufacturing, stabilised protein for research and production of therapeutic antibodies against human diseases.

    "abstract": "Abstract.To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e. natures contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenarios selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem service models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modelling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modelling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMutation rates vary across the genome. Whereas many trans factors that influence mutation rates have been identified, as have specific sequence motifs at the 1-7 bp scale, cis elements remain poorly characterized. The lack of understanding why different sequences have different mutation rates hampers our ability to identify positive selection in evolution and to identify driver mutations in tumorigenesis.\\n\\nResultsHere we show, using a combination of synthetic genes and sequencing of thousands of isolated yeast colonies, that intrinsic DNA curvature is the major cis determinant of mutation rate. Mutation rate negatively correlates with DNA curvature within genes, and a 10% decrease in curvature results in a 70% increase in mutation rate. Consistently, both yeast cells and human tumors accumulate mutations in regions with small curvature. We further show that this effect is due to differences in the intrinsic mutation rate, likely due to differences in mutagen sensitivity, and not due to differences in the local activity of DNA repair.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study establishes a framework in understanding the cis properties of DNA sequence in modulating the local mutation rate and identifies a novel causal source of non-uniform mutation rates across the genome.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of nucleotide polymorphism within populations of Drosophila melanogaster suggest that insecticides have been the selective agents driving the strongest recent bouts of positive selection. However, there is a need to explicitly link selective sweep loci to the particular insecticide phenotypes that could plausibly account for the drastic selective responses that are observed in these non-target insects. Here, we screen the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel with two common insecticides; malathion (an organophosphate) and permethrin (a pyrethroid). Genome wide association studies map  survival-on-malathion to two of the largest sweeps in the D. melanogaster genome; Ace and Cyp6g1. Malathion survivorship also correlates with lines which have high levels of Cyp12d1 and Jheh1 and Jheh2 transcript abundance. Permethrin phenotypes map to the largest cluster of P450 genes in the Drosophila genome, however in contrast to a selective sweep driven by insecticide use, the derived state seems to be associated with susceptibility. These results underscore previous findings that highlight the importance of structural variation to insecticide phenotypes: Cyp6g1 exhibits copy number variation and transposable element insertions, Cyp12d1 is tandemly duplicated, the Jheh loci are associated with a Bari1 transposable element insertion, and a Cyp6a17 deletion is associated with susceptibility.",

Because of the high frequency of antibiotic resistance among Enterococcus clinical isolates, interest in using phage to treat enterococcal infections and to decolonize high-risk patients for antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus is rising. Bacteria can evolve phage resistance, but there is little published information on these mechanisms in E. faecalis. In this report, we identified genetic determinants of E. faecalis resistance to {phi}NPV1. We found that loss-of-function mutations in epaR confer {phi}NPV1 resistance by blocking phage adsorption. We attribute the inability of the phage to adsorb to the modification or loss of an extracellular polymer in strains with inactivated epaR. Phage-resistant epaR mutants exhibited increased daptomycin and osmotic stress susceptibilities. Our results demonstrate that in vitro spontaneous resistance to {phi}NPV1 comes at a cost in E. faecalis OG1RF.",

    "abstract": "The process of aging can be characterized by a decline in cognitive performance, which may be accompanied by deterioration in specific structural properties of the brain. In this study we sought to investigate to what extent mindfulness changes over the aging process, and which alterations in brain structure can be associated to aging and concomitant changes in mindfulness. We collected Mindful Attention Awareness Scale questionnaire data to assess trait mindfulness and acquired diffusion-weighted imaging data fitted to the diffusion tensor model in a group of 97 middle-aged to elderly participants. Our results showed that trait mindfulness increased with age. In terms of white matter structure our results suggested that there was a general increase of omnidirectional diffusion, which favored radial over axial diffusivity, leading to a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in older participants. We further showed that trait mindfulness mediated the FA-age effect in a localized area consisting of the internal and external capsule, as well as the corona radiata. The implication of this mediation analysis is that trait mindfulness may deter age-associated neurocognitive decline, perhaps by preventing age-associated microlesions specifically in cortico-subcortical white matter tracts. This study can be considered a pioneer of using DTI studies to investigate the relationship between age and trait mindfulness.\\n\\nDisclosure statementConflict of Interest: The authors have no actual or potential conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTo gain insights into complex biological processes, genome-scale data (e.g., RNA-Seq) are often overlaid on biochemical networks. However, many networks do not have a one-to-one relationship between genes and network edges, due to the existence of isozymes and protein complexes. Therefore, decisions must be made on how to overlay data onto networks. For example, for metabolic networks, these decisions include (1) how to integrate gene expression levels using gene-protein-reaction rules, (2) the approach used for selection of thresholds on expression data to consider the associated gene as \\\"active\\\", and (3) the order in which these steps are imposed. However, the influence of these decisions has not been systematically tested.\\n\\nResultsWe compared 20 decision combinations using a transcriptomic dataset across 32 tissues and showed that definition of which reaction may be considered as active is mainly influenced by thresholding approach used. To determine the most appropriate decisions, we evaluated how these decisions impact the acquisition of tissue-specific active reaction lists that recapitulate organ-system tissue groups. These results will provide guidelines to improve data analyses with biochemical networks and facilitate the construction of context-specific metabolic models.\\n\\nContactnlewisres@ucsd.edu",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe design of an experiment influences both what a researcher can measure, as well as how much confidence can be placed in the results. As such, it is vitally important that experimental design decisions do not systematically bias research outcomes. At the same time, making optimal design decisions can produce results leading to statistically stronger conclusions. Deciding where and when to sample are among the most critical aspects of many experimental designs; for example, we might have to choose the time points at which to measure some quantity in a time series experiment. Choosing times which are too far apart could result in missing short bursts of activity. On the other hand, there may be time points which provide very little information regarding the overall behaviour of the quantity in question.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we design a survey to analyse how biologists use previous research outcomes to inform their decisions about which time points to sample in subsequent experiments. We then determine how the choice of time points affects the type of perturbations in gene expression that can be observed. Finally, we present our main result: NITPicker, a computational strategy for selecting optimal time points (or spatial points along a single axis), that eliminates some of the biases caused by human decision-making while maximising information about the shape of the underlying curves, utilising ideas from the field of functional data analysis.\\n\\nAvailabilityNITPicker is available on GIThub (https://github.com/ezer/NITPicker).",

    "abstract": "We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) generates a k-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (b) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate. The method was validated on 167 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (virulence), 200 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (ciprofloxacin resistance) and 460 Clostridium difficile isolates (azithromycin resistance). The phenotype prediction models trained from these datasets performed with 88% accuracy on the K. pneumoniae test set, 88% on the P. aeruginosa test set and 96.5% on the C. difficile test set. Prediction accuracy was the same for assembled sequences and raw sequencing data; however, building the model from assembled genomes is significantly faster. On these datasets, the model building on a mid-range Linux server takes approximately 3 to 5 hours per phenotype if assembled genomes are used and 10 hours per phenotype if raw sequencing data are used. The phenotype prediction from assembled genomes takes less than one second per isolate. Thus, PhenotypeSeeker should be well-suited for predicting phenotypes from large sequencing datasets.\\n\\nPhenotypeSeeker is implemented in Python programming language, is open-source software and is available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/PhenotypeSeeker/).\\n\\nSummaryPredicting phenotypic properties of bacterial isolates from their genomic sequences has numerous potential applications. A good example would be prediction of antimicrobial resistance and virulence phenotypes for use in medical diagnostics. We have developed a method that is able to predict phenotypes of interest from the genomic sequence of the isolate within seconds. The method uses statistical model that can be trained automatically on isolates with known phenotype. The method is implemented in Python programming language and can be run on low-end Linux server and/or on laptop computers.",

    "abstract": "Model-based epidemiological assessment is useful to support decision-making at the beginning of an emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreak. However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015-2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (Chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.",

However, the same narrative can be heard quite differently based on differences in listeners previous experiences and knowledge, as the semantics and mental imagery elicited by words and phrases in the story vary extensively between any given two individuals. Here, we capitalized on such inter-individual differences to disclose brain regions that support transformation of narrative into individualized propositional meanings and associated mental imagery by analyzing brain activity associated with behaviorally-assessed individual meanings elicited by a narrative. Sixteen subjects listed words best describing what had come to their minds during each 3-5 sec segment of an eight-minute narrative that they listened during fMRI of brain hemodynamic activity. Similarities in these word listings between subjects, estimated using latent-semantic analysis combined with WordNet knowledge, predicted similarities in brain hemodynamic activity in supramarginal and angular gyri as well as in cuneus. Our results demonstrate how inter-individual differences in semantic representations can be measured and utilized to identify specific brain regions that support the elicitation of individual propositional meanings and the associated mental imagery when one listens to a narrative.",

Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that internal dynamics play a crucial functional role in MarR proteins. Streptococcus pneumoniae AdcR (adhesin-competence repressor) regulates ZnII homeostasis and ZnII functions as an allosteric activator of DNA binding. ZnII coordination triggers a transition from independent domains to a more compact structure. We identify residues that impact allosteric activation on the basis of ZnII-induced perturbations of atomic motions over a wide range of timescales. These findings reconcile the distinct allosteric mechanisms proposed for other MarRs and highlight the importance of conformational dynamics in biological regulation.",

However, current studied epigenetic and genetic signatures of the GBM outliers have failed to identify unifying criteria to characterize this unique group of patients. In this study, we profiled the global DNA methylation pattern of mainly IDH1 wild type survival outliers of glioblastoma and performed comprehensive enrichment analyses with genomic and epigenomic signatures. We found that the genome of long-term survivors in glioblastoma is differentially methylated relative to short-term survivor patients depending on CpG density: hypermethylation near CpG islands (CGIs) and hypomethylation far from CGIs. Interestingly, these two patterns are associated with distinct oncogenic aspects in gliomagenesis. The hypomethylation pattern at the region distant from CGI is associated with lower rates of de novo mutations while the hypermethylation at CGIs correlates with transcriptional downregulation of genes involved in cancer progression pathways. These results extend our understanding of DNA methylation of survival outliers in glioblastoma in a genome-wide level, and provide insight on the potential impact of DNA hypomethylation in cancer genome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNo regenerative approach has thus far been shown to be effective in skeletal muscle injuries, despite high frequency and associated functional deficits. We sought to address surgical trauma related muscle injuries using local intraoperative application of allogeneic placenta-derived, mesenchymal-like adherent cells (PLX-PAD), using hip arthroplasty as a standardized injury model, because of the high regenerative and immunomodulatory potency of this cell type.\\n\\nMethodsOur pilot phase I/IIa study was prospective, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled. Twenty patients undergoing hip arthroplasty via a direct lateral approach were injected with 3.0x108 or 1.5x108 PLX-PAD or a placebo into the gluteus medius muscle.\\n\\nResultsWe did not observe any relevant PLX-PAD-related adverse events at the 2-year follow-up. Improved gluteus medius strength was noted as early as week 6 in the treatment-groups. Surprisingly, until week 26 the low-dose outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared to placebo, mirrored by an increase in muscle volume. Histology indicated accelerated healing after cell therapy. Biomarker studies revealed that low-dose treatment reduced the surgery-related immunological stress reaction more than high-dose. Signs of late-onset immune reactivity after high-dose treatment corresponded to reduced functional improvement.\\n\\nConclusionAllogeneic PLX-PAD therapy improved strength and volume of injured skeletal muscle with a reasonable safety profile. Outcomes could be positively correlated with the modulation of early postoperative stress-related immunological reactions.\\n\\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01525667) and EudraCT (number 2011-003934-16)\\n\\nFundingThe study was funded by the Sponsor, Pluristem Therapeutics, the Israeli innovation authority and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.\\n\\nConflict of interestT.

    "abstract": "The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic that began in Dec 2016 in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian Aedes sp. vectors highlights the urgent need to monitor the risk of re-establishment of domestic YFV transmission in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial and genomic approaches to characterize YFV transmission. We show that the age- and sex-distribution of human cases in Brazil is characteristic of sylvatic transmission. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally using a new protocol reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV transmission restricted to Minas Gerais, followed in late 2016 by a rise in viral spillover to humans, and the southwards spatial expansion of the epidemic towards previously YFV-free areas. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV transmission in real-time, contributing to the global strategy of eliminating future yellow fever epidemics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGiven clear evidence that smoking lowers weight, it is possible that individuals with higher body mass index (BMI) smoke in order to lose or maintain their weight.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe undertook Mendelian randomization analyses using 97 genetic variants associated with BMI. We performed two sample Mendelian randomization analyses of the effects of BMI on smoking behaviour in UK Biobank (N=335,921) and the Tobacco and Genetics consortium genomewide association study (GWAS) (N[&le;]74,035) respectively, and two sample Mendelian randomization analyses of the effects of BMI on cotinine levels (N[&le;]4,548) and nicotine metabolite ratio (N[&le;]1,518) in published GWAS, and smoking-related DNA methylation in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N[&le;]846).\\n\\nIn inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization analysis, there was evidence that higher BMI was causally associated with smoking initiation (OR for ever vs never smoking per one SD increase in BMI: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.27) and smoking heaviness (1.45 additional cigarettes smoked per day per SD increase in BMI, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.86), but little evidence for a causal effect with smoking cessation. Results were broadly similar using pleiotropy robust methods (MR-Egger, median and weighted mode regression). These results were supported by evidence for a causal effect of BMI on DNA methylation at the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) locus. There was no strong evidence that BMI was causally associated with cotinine, but suggestive evidence for a causal negative association with the nicotine metabolite ratio.\\n\\nConclusionsThere is a causal bidirectional association between BMI and smoking, but the relationship is likely to be complex due to opposing effects on behaviour and metabolism. It may be useful to consider BMI and smoking together when designing prevention strategies to minimise the effects of these risk factors on health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryO_ST_ABSBackground and aimsC_ST_ABSUnderstanding the aetiology, clinical presentation and prognosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and optimizing its treatment might be facilitated by biomarkers that help predict a persons susceptibility to the risk factors that cause diabetes or its complications, or response to treatment. The IMI DIRECT (Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification) Study is a European Union (EU) Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project that seeks to test these hypotheses in two recently established epidemiological cohorts. Here, we describe the characteristics of these cohorts at baseline and at the first main follow-up examination (18-months).\\n\\nMaterials and methodsFrom a sampling-frame of 24,682 European-ancestry adults in whom detailed health information was available, participants at varying risk of glycaemic deterioration were identified using a risk prediction algorithm and enrolled into a prospective cohort study (n=2127) undertaken at four study centres across Europe (Cohort 1: prediabetes). We also recruited people from clinical registries with recently diagnosed T2D (n=789) into a second cohort study (Cohort 2: diabetes). The two cohorts were studied in parallel with matched protocols. Endogenous insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were modelled from frequently sampled 75g oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) in Cohort 1 and with mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTT) in Cohort 2. Additional metabolic biochemistry was determined using blood samples taken when fasted and during the tolerance tests. Body composition was assessed using MRI and lifestyle measures through self-report and objective methods.\\n\\nResultsUsing ADA-2011 glycaemic categories, 33% (n=693) of Cohort 1 (prediabetes) had normal glucose regulation (NGR), and 67% (n=1419) had impaired glucose regulation (IGR). 76% of the cohort was male, age=62(6.2) years; BMI=27.9(4.0) kg/m2; fasting glucose=5.7(0.6) mmol/l; 2-hr glucose=5.9(1.6) mmol/l [mean(SD)]. At follow-up, 18.6(1.4) months after baseline, fasting glucose=5.8(0.6) mmol/l; 2-hr OGTT glucose=6.1(1.7) mmol/l [mean(SD)]. In Cohort 2 (diabetes): 65% (n=508) were lifestyle treated (LS) and 35% (n=271) were lifestyle + metformin treated (LS+MET). 58% of the cohort was male, age=62(8.1) years; BMI=30.5(5.0) kg/m2; fasting glucose=7.2(1.4)mmol/l; 2-hr glucose=8.6(2.8) mmol/l [mean(SD)]. At follow-up, 18.2(0.6) months after baseline, fasting glucose=7.8(1.8) mmol/l; 2-hr MMTT glucose=9.5(3.3) mmol/l [mean(SD)].\\n\\nConclusionThe epidemiological IMI DIRECT cohorts are the most intensely characterised prospective studies of glycaemic deterioration to date. Data from these cohorts help illustrate the heterogeneous characteristics of people at risk of or with T2D, highlighting the rationale for biomarker stratification of the disease - the primary objective of the IMI DIRECT consortium.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTracking recent transmission is a vital part of controlling widespread pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Multiple methods with specific performance characteristics exist for detecting recent transmission chains, usually by clustering strains based on genotype similarities. With such a large variety of methods available, informed selection of an appropriate approach for determining transmissions within a given setting/time period is difficult.\\n\\nMethodsThis study combines whole genome sequence (WGS) data derived from 324 isolates collected 2005-2010 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a high endemic setting, with phylodynamics to unveil the timing of transmission events posited by a variety of standard genotyping methods. Clustering data based on Spoligotyping, 24-loci MIRU-VNTR typing, WGS based SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and core genome multi locus sequence typing (cgMLST) typing were evaluated.\\n\\nFindingsOur results suggest that clusters based on Spoligotyping could encompass transmission events that occurred over 70 years prior to sampling while 24-loci-MIRU-VNTR often represented two or more decades of transmission. Instead, WGS based genotyping applying low SNP or cgMLST allele thresholds allows for determination of recent transmission events in timespans of up to 10 years e.g. for a 5 SNP/allele cut-off.\\n\\nInterpretationWith the rapid uptake of WGS methods in surveillance and outbreak tracking, the findings obtained in this study can guide the selection of appropriate clustering methods for uncovering relevant transmission chains within a given time-period. For high resolution cluster analyses, WGS-SNP and cgMLST based analyses have similar clustering/timing characteristics even for data obtained from a high incidence setting.",

    "abstract": "Recent analyses have shown educational attainment to be associated with a number of health outcomes. This association may, in part, be due to an effect of educational attainment on smoking behaviour. In this study we apply a multivariable Mendelian randomisation design to determine whether the effect of educational attainment on smoking behaviour could be due to educational attainment or general cognitive ability. We use individual data from the UK Biobank study (N = 120,050) and summary data from large GWAS studies of educational attainment, cognitive ability and smoking behaviour. Our results show that more years of education are associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking which is not due to an effect of general cognitive ability on smoking behaviour. Given the considerable physical harms associated with smoking, the effect of educational attainment on smoking is likely to contribute to the health inequalities associated with differences in educational attainment.",

    "abstract": "The mounting challenge of preserving the quality of life in an aging population directs the focus of longevity science to the regulatory pathways controlling healthspan. To understand the nature of the relationship between the healthspan and lifespan and uncover the genetic architecture of the two phenotypes, we studied the incidence of major age-related diseases in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. We observed that the incidence rates of major chronic diseases increase exponentially. The risk of disease acquisition doubled approximately every eight years, i.e., at a rate compatible with the doubling time of the Gompertz mortality law. Assuming that aging is the single underlying factor behind the morbidity rates dynamics, we built a proportional hazards model to predict the risks of the diseases and therefore the age corresponding to the end of healthspan of an individual depending on their age, gender, and the genetic background. We suggested a computationally efficient procedure for the determination of the effect size and statistical significance of individual gene variants associations with healthspan in a form suitable for a Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Using the UKB sub-population of 300,447 genetically Caucasian, British individuals as a discovery cohort, we identified 12 loci associated with healthspan and reaching the whole-genome level of significance. We observed strong (|{rho}g| > 0.3) genetic correlations between healthspan and the incidence of specific age-related disease present in our healthspan definition (with the notable exception of dementia). Other examples included all-cause mortality (as derived from parental survival, with{rho} g = -0.76), life-history traits (metrics of obesity, age at first birth), levels of different metabolites (lipids, amino acids, glycemic traits), and psychological traits (smoking behaviour, cognitive performance, depressive symptoms, insomnia). We conclude by noting that the healthspan phenotype, suggested and characterized here, offers a promising new way to investigate human longevity by exploiting the data from genetic and clinical data on living individuals.",

Fumarase insufficiencies can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), the mechanism of which, however, is not clear. A proteomic analysis indicated fumarase knockdown in HK-2 cells resulted in changes in the expression or activity of NADPH oxidase, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and III, ATP synthase subunits, and -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, all of which are sites of ROS formation. Meantime, the activities of key antioxidant enzymes such as G6PD, 6PGD, GR, GPx and GST increased significantly too. The apparent activation of antioxidant defense appeared insufficient as glutathione precursors, glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio were decreased. SS rats exhibited changes in redox metabolism similar to HK-2 cells with fumarase knockdown. Supplementation with fumarate and malate, the substrate and product of fumarase, increased and decreased, respectively, blood pressure and the levels of H2O2 and MDA in kidney tissues of SS rats. These results indicate fumarase insufficiencies cause a wide range of changes at several sites of ROS production and antioxidant mechanisms.",

To address MLL3/4 enzymatic activity in enhancer regulation, we have generated two mouse lines: one expressing H3.3K4M, a lysine-4-to-methionine (K4M) mutation of histone H3.3 that inhibits H3K4 methylation, and the other carrying conditional double knockout of MLL3/4 enzymatic SET domains. Expression of H3.3K4M in lineage-specific precursor cells depletes H3K4 methylation and prevents adipogenesis and adipose tissue development. Mechanistically, H3.3K4M prevents enhancer activation in adipogenesis by destabilizing MLL3/4 proteins but not other Set1-like H3K4 methyltransferases. Notably, deletion of the enzymatic SET domain of MLL3/4 in lineage-specific precursor cells mimics H3.3K4M expression and prevents adipose tissue development. Interestingly, destabilization of MLL3/4 by H3.3K4M in adipocytes does not affect adipose tissue maintenance and function. Together, our findings indicate that H3.3K4M destabilizes enhancer epigenomic writers MLL3/4 and impairs adipose tissue development.",

Our understanding of root immunity is still limited relative to our knowledge of immune responses in leaves. In an effort to reveal the organisation of immunity in roots, we undertook a cell type-specific transcriptome analysis to identify gene networks activated in epidermis, cortex and pericycle cells of Arabidopsis roots upon treatment with two immunity elicitors, the bacterial microbe-associated molecular pattern flagellin, and the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern Pep1. Our analyses revealed that both elicitors induced immunity gene networks in a cell type-specific manner. Interestingly, both elicitors did not alter cell identity-determining gene networks. Using sophisticated paired motif promoter analyses, we identified key transcription factor pairs involved in the regulation of cell type-specific immunity networks. In addition, our data show that cell identity networks integrate with cell immunity networks to activate cell type-specific immune response according to the functional capabilities of each cell type.\\n\\nMaterial Distribution FootnoteThe author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Patrick Schafer (p.schafer@warwick.ac.uk).",

AMPPNP-bound Cut7 adopts a kinesin-conserved ATP-like conformation, with a closed nucleotide binding pocket and docked neck linker that supports cover neck bundle formation. Compared to mammalian tubulin microtubules, Cut7s footprint on S. pombe microtubule surface is subtly different because of their different architecture. However, the core motor-microtubule interaction that stimulates motor ATPase is tightly conserved, reflected in similar Cut7 ATPase activities on each microtubule type. The S. pombe microtubules were bound by the drug epothilone, which is visible in the taxane binding pocket. Stabilization of S. pombe microtubules is mediated by drug binding at this conserved site despite their noncanonical architecture and mechanochemistry.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIS. pombe Cut7 has a distinct binding footprint on S. pombe microtubules\\nC_LIO_LIThe core interface driving microtubule activation of motor ATPase is conserved\\nC_LIO_LIThe neck linker is docked in AMPPNP-bound Cut7 and the cover neck bundle is formed\\nC_LIO_LIEpothilone binds at the taxane binding site to stabilize S. pombe microtubules\\nC_LI\\n\\neTOC textTo investigate coevolution of the motor-microtubule interface, we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the near-atomic structure of the motor domain of Cut7, the fission yeast kinesin-5, bound to microtubules polymerized from natively purified fission yeast tubulin and stabilised by the drug epothilone.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microbial pathogens has become an essential part of modern epidemiological investigations. Although WGS data can be analyzed using a number of different approaches, such as traditional phylogenetic methods, a critical requirement for global systems for pathogen surveillance is the development of approaches for transforming sequence data into WGS-based subtypes, which creates a nomenclature that describes their higher-order relationships to one another. To this end, subtype similarity thresholds are needed to define clusters of subtypes representing lineages of interest. WGS-based subtyping presents a challenge since both the addition of novel genome sequences and small adjustments in similarity thresholds can have a dramatic impact on cluster composition and stability. We present the Neighbourhood Adjusted Wallace Coefficient (nAWC), a method for evaluating cluster stability based on computing cluster concordance between neighbouring similarity thresholds. The nAWC can be used to identify areas in in which distance thresholds produce robust clusters. Using datasets from Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni, representing strongly and weakly clonal bacterial species respectively, we show that clusters generated using such thresholds are both stable and reflect basic units in their overall population structure. Our results suggest that the nAWC could be useful for defining robust clusters compatible with nomenclatures for global WGS-based surveillance networks, which require stable clusters to be defined that both harness the discriminatory power of WGS data while allowing for long-term tracking of strains of interest.",

    "abstract": "In order to tackle heterogeneity of cancer samples and high data space dimensionality, we propose a method NEAmarker for finding sensitive and robust biomarkers at the pathway level. In this method, scores from network enrichment analysis transform the original space of altered genes into a lower-dimensional space of pathways, which is then correlated with phenotype variables. The analysis was first done on in vitro anti-cancer drug screen datasets and then on clinical data. In parallel, we tested a panel of state-of-the-art enrichment methods. In this comparison, our method proved superior in terms of 1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, 2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and 3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients. Our new in vitro screen validated performance of the discovered multivariate models. Finally, NEAmarker was the only method to discover predictors of both in vitro response and patient survival given administration of the same drug.",

    "abstract": "The effect of biochemical environmental signals on cell mechanisms has been the subject of numerous studies for a long time. However, the in-vitro studies of biophysical cues on cells and tissues have recently become a popular focus of research. The development of micro-fabrication techniques has allowed the study of certain aspects of cell-substrate interactions in a more detailed form. Micro-topographical patterns on the cell substrates have been used to study many cell functions such as cell migration, adhesion, gene expression, cell division and differentiation. An understanding of cell-substrate interactions and the potential ability to control the interactions have very important applications in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. We have fabricated ridge-groove micro patterns on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different ridge widths (8m, 10m, 12 m, 25m and 50m) using standard photolithography technique. We used these patterns to print fibronectin stripes on PDMS substrates. NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells were cultured on these stripes and the dynamics of morphological changes were monitored in steady spreading phase (S-phase). Our data revealed that the thickness of the cell, measured by confocal microscopy, is considerably larger (approximately 40%) among the cells spreading on narrower stripes (8m, 10m and 12m) compared to the cells expanding on wider (including control) patterns. The number of perinuclear actin stress fibers is significantly lower among narrower stripes which probably explains the cell thickness results. Confocal microscopy revealed that the cellular volume increases during cell adhesion processes and volume increase is positively correlated with the width of stripes. Nuclear volume also increases considerably during cell adhesion; however, confining cells on fibronectin stripes reduces nuclear volume enlargement independent from the of stripe size.",

    "abstract": "Early identification of the risk for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the asymptomatic phase could lead to better prognosis. Here we developed a machine learning method to quantify systematic impact of all rare germline mutations on each pathway. We collected 106 TNBC patients and 287 elder healthy women controls. The spectra of activity profiles in multiple pathways were mapped and most pathway activities exhibited globally suppressed by the portfolio of individual germline mutations in TNBC patients. Accordingly, all individuals were delineated into two types: A and B. Type A patients could be differentiated from controls (AUC = 0.89) and sensitive to BRCA1/2 damages; Type B patients can be also differentiated from controls (AUC = 0.69) but probably being protected from BRCA1/2 damages. Further we found that Individuals with the lowest activity of selected pathways had extreme high relative risk (up to 21.67 in type A) and increased lymph node metastasis in these patients. Our study showed that genomic DNA contains information of unimaginable pathogenic factors. And this information is in a distributed form that could be applied to risk assessment for more cancer types.\n\nSignificanceWe identified individuals who are more susceptible to triple negative breast cancer. Our method performs much better than previous assessments based on BRCA1/2 damages, even polygenic risk scores. We disclosed previously unimaginable pathogens in a distributed form on genome and extended risk prediction to scenarios for other cancers.",

    "abstract": "In mechanical manipulation experiments, a single DNA molecule overwound at constant force undergoes a discontinuous drop in extension as it buckles and forms a superhelical loop (a plectoneme). Further overwinding the DNA, we observe an unanticipated cascade of highly regular discontinuous extension changes associated with stepwise plectoneme lengthening. This phenomenon is consistent with a model in which the force-extended DNA forms barriers to plectoneme lengthening caused by topological writhe. Furthermore, accounting for writhe in a fluctuating solenoid gives an improved description of the measured force-dependent effective torsional modulus of DNA, providing a reliable formula to estimate DNA torque. Our data and model thus provide context for further measurements and theories that capture the structures and mechanics of supercoiled biopolymers.",

    "abstract": "Inadequate tissue oxygen, or hypoxia, is a central concept in pathophysiology of ischemic disorders and cancer. Hypoxia promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cellular metabolic adaptation and metastasis. To determine how cells respond to hypoxia-induced ECM remodeling, we performed a large-scale forward genetic screen in C. elegans. We identified a previously uncharacterized receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) named HIR-1 as a key mediator in a pathway that orchestrates transcriptional responses to hypoxia-induced ECM remodeling. Impaired ECM integrity caused by hypoxia or deficiency of the oxygen-dependent procollagen hydroxylases, heme peroxidases or cuticular collagens activates gene expression through inhibition of HIR-1. Genetic suppressor screens identified NHR-49 and MDT-15 as transcriptional regulators downstream of HIR-1. Cellular responses through HIR-1 maintain ECM homeostasis and promote animal adaptation to severe hypoxia. We propose that C. elegans HIR-1 defines an unprecedented type of RTK that mediates responses to hypoxia-induced ECM remodeling by mechanisms that are likely conserved in other organisms.\\n\\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYA regulatory pathway for ECM homeostasis underlies adaptation to hypoxia and re-oxygenation",

    "abstract": "Repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) are evolutionarily conserved proteins implicated in repulsive axon guidance. Here we report the function of the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog DRAG-1 in axon branching. The axons of hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) branch at the region abutting the vulval muscles and innervate these muscles to control egg laying. The drag-1 mutants exhibited defects in HSN axon branching in addition to a small body size and egg laying-defective phenotype. DRAG-1 expression in the hypodermal cells was required for the branching of these axons. The C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of DRAG-1 was important for its function. Genetic analyses suggested that the membrane receptor UNC-40, but neither SMA-1/{beta}H-spectrin nor SMA-5/MAP kinase 7, acts in the same pathway with DRAG-1 in HSN branching. We propose that DRAG-1 expressed in the hypodermis signals via the UNC-40 receptor expressed in HSNs to elicit branching activity of HSN axons.",
