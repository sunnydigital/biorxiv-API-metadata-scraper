    "abstract": "BackgroundBayesian networks are directed acyclic graphical models widely used to represent the probabilistic relationships between random variables. They have been applied in various biological contexts, including gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions inference. Generally, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results. However, in cases when the acyclicity of the graph can be externally ensured, it is possible to find the optimal network in polynomial time. While our previously developed tool BNFinder implements polynomial time algorithm, reconstructing networks with the large amount of experimental data still leads to computations on single CPU growing exceedingly.\\n\\nResultsIn the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder - tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks. The new algorithm has been tested on different simulated and experimental datasets showing that it has much better efficiency of parallelization than the previous version. BNFinder gives comparable results in terms of accuracy with respect to current state-of-the-art inference methods, giving significant advantage in cases when external information such as regulators list or prior edge probability can be introduced.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that the new method can be used to reconstruct networks in the size range of thousands of genes making it practically applicable to whole genome datasets of prokaryotic systems and large components of eukaryotic genomes. Our benchmarking results on realistic datasets indicate that the tool should be useful to wide audience of researchers interested in discovering dependencies in their large-scale transcriptomic datasets.",

    "abstract": "We all vary in our mental health, even among healthy (undiagnosed) individuals. Understanding this variability may reveal factors driving the onset of mental illness, as well as factors driving sub-clinical mental health problems that can still influence quality of life. To better understand the large-scale brain network mechanisms underlying this variability in mental health we examined the relationship between mental health symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity patterns in cognitive control systems. The frontoparietal cognitive control network (FPN) consists of flexible hubs that can regulate distributed systems depending on current goals, and dysfunction in the FPN has been identified in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Alterations in FPN connectivity may influence mental health by disrupting the ability to regulate symptoms in a goal-directed manner. This suggests that the FPN may play an important role in the promotion and maintenance of mental health generally. Here we test the hypothesis that disruptions in FPN connectivity are related to mental health (depression) symptoms even among healthy individuals. This hypothesis is consistent with a general role of FPN in the regulation of mental health symptoms. We found that depression symptoms were negatively correlated with between-network global connectivity (BGC) of the FPN as well as the default mode network (DMN). This suggests that decreased connectivity between the FPN (and, separately, DMN) and the rest of the brain is related to increased depression symptoms among undiagnosed individuals. These findings complement previous clinical studies to support the hypothesis that global FPN connectivity contributes to the regulation of mental health symptoms across both mentally healthy and unhealthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "The behavioral effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can change qualitatively when stimulation is preceded by initial state manipulations such as priming or adaptation. In addition, baseline performance level of the participant has been shown to play a role in modulating the impact of TMS. Here we examined the link between these two. This was done using data from a previous study using a TMS-priming paradigm, in which, at group level, TMS selectively facilitated targets incongruent with the prime while having no statistically significant effects on other prime-target congruencies. Correlation and linear mixed-effects analyses indicated that, for all prime-target congruencies, a significant linear relationship between baseline performance and the magnitude of the induced TMS effect was present: low levels of baseline performance were associated with TMS-induced facilitations and high baseline performance with impairments. Thus as performance level increased, TMS effects turned from facilitation to impairment. The key finding was that priming shifted the transition from facilitatory to disruptive effects for targets incongruent with the prime, such that TMS-induced facilitations were obtained until a higher level of performance than for other prime-target congruencies. Given that brain state manipulations such as priming operate via modulations of neural excitability, this result is consistent with the view that neural excitability, coupled with nonlinear neural effects, underlie behavioral effects of TMS.",

Here we showed haploinsufficiency is strongly associated with epigenomic patterns, and then developed a new computational method (Episcore) to predict haploinsufficiency from epigenomic data from a broad range of tissue and cell types using machine learning methods. Based on data from recent exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders, Episcore achieved better performance in prioritizing loss of function de novo variants than current methods. We further showed that Episcore was less biased with gene size, and was complementary to mutation intolerance metrics for prioritizing loss of function variants.

    "abstract": "The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is widely implicated in supporting episodic memory and navigation, but its precise functional role in organizing memory across time and space remains elusive. Here we examine the specific cognitive processes implemented by MTL structures (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) to organize memory by using electrical brain stimulation, leveraging its ability to establish causal links between brain regions and features of behavior. We studied neurosurgical patients who performed spatial-navigation and verbal-episodic memory tasks while brain stimulation was applied in various regions during learning. During the verbal memory task, stimulation in the MTL disrupted the temporal organization of encoded memories such that items learned with stimulation tended to be recalled in a more randomized order. During the spatial task, MTL stimulation impaired subjects abilities to remember items using view-independent (allocentric) navigation strategies. These stimulation effects were specific to the MTL. Our findings thus provide the first causal demonstration in humans of the specific memory processes that are performed by the MTL to encode when and where events occurred.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNumerous studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in encoding spatial and temporal memories, but they have not been able to causally demonstrate the nature of the cognitive processes by which this occurs in real-time. Electrical brain stimulation is able to demonstrate causal links between a brain region and a given function with high temporal precision. By examining behavior in a memory task as subjects received MTL stimulation, we provide the first causal evidence demonstrating the role of the MTL in organizing the spatial and temporal aspects of episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium that natively colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract and opportunistically causes life-threatening infections. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis strains have emerged that are replete with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Non-MDR E. faecalis strains frequently possess CRISPR-Cas systems, which reduce the frequency of mobile genetic element (MGE) acquisition. We demonstrated in previous studies that E. faecalis populations can transiently maintain both a functional CRISPR-Cas system and a CRISPR-Cas target. In this study, we used serial passage and deep sequencing to analyze these populations. In the presence of antibiotic selection for the plasmid, mutants with compromised CRISPR-Cas defense and enhanced ability to acquire a second antibiotic resistance plasmid emerged. Conversely, in the absence of selection, the plasmid was lost from wild-type E. faecalis populations, but not E. faecalis populations that lacked the cas9 gene. Our results indicate that E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas can become compromised under antibiotic selection, generating populations with enhanced abilities to undergo horizontal gene transfer.\n\nImportanceEnterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and disseminator of antibiotic resistance plasmids among Gram-positive bacteria. We have previously shown that E. faecalis strains with an active CRISPR-Cas system can prevent plasmid acquisition and thus limit the transmission of antibiotic resistance determinants. Yet, CRISPR-Cas was not a perfect barrier. In this study, we observed populations of E. faecalis with transient co-existence of CRISPR-Cas and one of its plasmid targets. Our experimental data demonstrate that antibiotic selection results in compromised E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas function, thereby facilitating the acquisition of additional resistance plasmids by E. faecalis.",

We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data.

    "abstract": "The ability to quickly and inexpensively describe taxonomic diversity is critical in this era of rapid climate and biodiversity changes. The currently preferred molecular technique, barcoding, has been very successful, but is based on short organelle markers. Recently, an alternative genome-skimming approach has been proposed: low-pass sequencing (100Mb - several Gb per sample) is applied to voucher and/or query samples, and marker genes and/or organelle genomes are recovered computationally. The current practice of genome-skimming discards the vast majority of the data because the low coverage of genome-skims prevents assembling the nuclear genomes. In contrast, we suggest using all unassembled reads directly, but existing methods poorly support this goal. We introduce a new alignment-free tool, Skmer, to estimate genomic distances between the query and each reference genome-skim using the k-mer decomposition of reads. We test Skmer on a large set of insect and bird genomes, sub-sampled to create genome-skims. Skmer shows great accuracy in estimating genomic distances, identifying the closest match in a reference dataset, and inferring the phylogeny.

In cancer, the majority of missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity.

Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in binding free energy changes of [Formula] kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations as resistant or susceptible with [Formula] accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Bystander selection -- the selective pressures exerted by antibiotics on microbial flora that are not the target pathogen of treatment -- is critical to understanding the total impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic use; however, to our knowledge, this effect has never been quantified. Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS), the Human Microbiome Project, and additional carriage and etiological data from existing literature, we estimate the magnitude of bystander selection for a range of clinically relevant antibiotic-species pairs as the proportion of all exposures of an antibiotic experienced by a species for conditions in which that species was not the causative pathogen (\\\"proportion of bystander exposures\\\"). For outpatient prescribing in the United States, we find that this proportion over all included antibiotics is over 80% for 8 out of 9 organisms of interest. Low proportions of bystander exposure are often associated with infrequent bacterial carriage or a high proportion of antibiotic prescribing focused on conditions caused by the species of interest. Using the proportion of bystander exposures, we roughly estimate that S. aureus and E. coli may benefit from 90.7% and 99.7%, respectively, of the estimated reduction in antibiotic use due to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, despite not being the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. These results underscore the importance of considering antibiotic exposures to bystanders, in addition to the targeted pathogen, in measuring the impact of antibiotic resistance interventions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe forces that contribute to changing population prevalence of antibiotic resistance are not well understood. Bystander selection -- the inadvertent pressures imposed by antibiotics on the microbial flora other than the pathogen targeted by treatment -- is hypothesized to be a major factor in the propagation of antibiotic resistance, but its extent has not been characterized. We estimate the proportion of bystander exposures across a range of antibiotics and organisms and describe factors driving variability of these proportions. Impact estimates for antibiotic resistance interventions, including vaccination, are often limited to effects on a target pathogen. However, the reduction of antibiotic treatment for illnesses caused by the target pathogen may have the broader potential to decrease bystander selection pressures for resistance on many other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Endolysosomal system is linked to almost all aspects of cell life and diseases, and Rab7 occupies a critical node in this crucial pathway. However, there have been conflicting views about the exact role of Rab7 in membrane trafficking, since some studies have reported that Rab7 regulates the trafficking from early to late endosomes, while others highlighted its role in late endosomes to lysosomes progression. In the present study, we have revisited this issue from a new viewpoint. In COS-7 cells, a GDP-bound Rab7 mutant, T22N, was located to vesicular membranes as well as in cytoplasm. Similarly, the GTPase-deficient Q67L mutant of Rab7 resided in cytoplasm as well as on membranes. Additionally, we found that RabGDI interacted with both GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Rab7 in vitro. These results have prompted us to propose a four-state transition model for Rab7. This four-state model matches with our recent findings that Rab7 was initially recruited to macropinosomes in a GDP-bound inactive form and subsequently became activated during endocytic maturation in EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB) is a comprehensive database of health insurance claims data under Japans National Health Insurance system. The NDB uses two types of personal identification variables (referred to in the database as \\\"ID1\\\" and \\\"ID2\\\") to link the insurance claims of individual patients. However, the information entered against these ID variables is prone to change for several reasons, such as when claimants find or change employment, or due to variations in the spelling of their name. In the present study, we developed a new patient-matching technique that improves upon the existing system of using ID1 and ID2 variables. We also sought to validate a new personal ID variable (ID0) that we propose in order to enhance the efficiency of patient matching in the NDB database.\\n\\nMethodsOur study targeted data from health insurance claims filed between April 2013 and March 2016 for hospitalization, combined diagnostic procedures, outpatient treatment, and dispensing of prescription medication. We developed a new patient-matching algorithm based on the ID1 and ID2 variables, as well as variables for treatment date and clinical outcome. We then attempted to validate our algorithm by comparing the number of patients identified by patient matching with the current ID1 variable and our proposed ID0 variable against the estimated patient population as of 1 October 2015.\\n\\nResultsThe numbers of patients in each sex and age group that were identified with the ID0 variable were lower than those identified using the ID1 variable. By using the ID0 variable, we were able to reduce the number of duplicate records for male and female patients by 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively. The numbers of children, adults older than 75 years, and women of reproductive age identified using the ID1 patient-matching variable were all higher than their corresponding estimates. Conversely, the numbers of these patients identified with the ID0 patient-matching variable were all within their corresponding estimates.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings show that the proposed ID0 variable delivers more precise patient-matching results than the existing ID1 variable. The ID0 variable is currently the best available technique for patient matching in the NDB database. Future patient population estimates should therefore rely on the ID0 variable instead of the ID1 variable.",

    "abstract": "Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is a conifer species of substanital economic and ecological importance. In common with most conifers, the P. abies genome is very large ([~]20 Gbp) and contains a high fraction of repetitive DNA. The current P. abies genome assembly (v1.0) covers approximately 60% of the total genome size but is highly fragmented, consisting of >10 million scaffolds. The genome annotation contains 66,632 gene models that are at least partially validated (www.congenie.org), however, the fragmented nature of the assembly means that there is currently little information available on how these genes are physically distributed over the 12 P. abies chromosomes. By creating an ultra-dense genetic linkage map, we anchored and ordered scaffolds into linkage groups, which complements the fine-scale information available in assembly contigs. Our ultra-dense haploid consensus genetic map consists of 21,056 markers derived from 14,336 scaffolds that contain 17,079 gene models (25.6% of the validated gene models) that we have anchored to the 12 linkage groups. We used data from three independent component maps, as well as comparisons with previously published Picea maps to evaluate the accuracy and marker ordering of the linkage groups. We demonstrate that approximately 3.8% of the anchored scaffolds and 1.6% of the gene models covered by the consensus map have likely assembly errors as they contain genetic markers that map to different regions within or between linkage groups. We further evaluate the utility of the genetic map for the conifer research community by using an independent data set of unrelated individuals to assess genome-wide variation in genetic diversity using the genomic regions anchored to linkage groups. The results show that our map is sufficiently dense to enable detailed evolutionary analyses across the P. abies genome.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient availability, growth rate and cell size are closely linked. For example, in budding yeast, the rate of cell growth is proportional to nutrient availability, cell size is proportional to growth rate, and growth rate is proportional to cell size. Thus, cells grow slowly in poor nutrients and are nearly half the size of cells growing in rich nutrients. Moreover, large cells grow faster than small cells. A signaling network that surrounds Tor kinase complex 2 (TORC2) plays an important role in enforcing these proportional relationships. Cells that lack components of the TORC2 network fail to modulate their growth rate or size in response to changes in nutrient availability. Here, we show that budding yeast homologs of the Lkb1 tumor suppressor kinase are required for normal modulation of TORC2 signaling and in response to changes in carbon source. Lkb1 kinases activate Snf1/AMPK to initiate transcription of genes required for utilization of poor carbon sources. However, Lkb1 influences TORC2 signaling via a novel pathway that is independent of Snf1/AMPK. Of the three Lkb1 homologs in budding yeast, Elm1 plays the most important role in modulating TORC2. Elm1 activates a pair of related kinases called Gin4 and Hsl1. Previous work found that loss of Gin4 and Hsl1 causes cells to undergo unrestrained growth during a prolonged mitotic arrest, which suggests that play a role in linking cell cycle progression to cell growth. We found that Gin4 and Hsl1 also control the TORC2 network. In addition, Gin4 and Hsl1 are themselves influenced by signals from the TORC2 network, consistent with previous work showing that the TORC2 network constitutes a feedback loop. Together, the data suggest a model in which the TORC2 network sets growth rate in response to carbon source, while also relaying signals via Gin4 and Hsl1 that set the critical amount of growth required for cell cycle progression. This kind of close linkage between control of cell growth and size would suggest a simple mechanistic explanation for the proportional relationship between cell size and growth rate.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advent of genetically engineered pig production has revealed a wide array of opportunities to enhance both biomedical and agricultural industries. One powerful method to develop these models is transgenesis; however, selection of a suitable promoter to drive transgene expression is critical. The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is the most commonly used viral promoter as it robustly drives transgene expression in a ubiquitous nature. However, recent reports suggest that the level of CMV promoter activity is tissue-dependent in the pig. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the activity of the CMV promoter in a wide range of porcine tissues. Swine harboring a CMV-ZsGreen1 transgene with a single integration site were utilized for this study. Thirty five tissue samples were collected from neonatal hemizygous (n = 3) and homozygous (n = 3) transgenic piglets and analyzed for ZsGreen1 abundance via immunoblot.\\n\\nResultsZsGreen1 was detected in all tissues examined; however, quantification revealed that ZsGreen1 protein levels were tissue-specific. Within organs of the digestive system, for example, ZsGreen1 was most abundant in the salivary gland, moderately produced in the esophagus and levels were lowest in the stomach. Interestingly, abundance of ZsGreen1 also differed within organ. For instance, levels were highest in the right ventricle compared with other chambers of the heart. There was no effect of transgene dose as ZsGreen1 expression patterns were similar between homozygous and hemizygous piglets.\\n\\nConclusionsUltimately, these results elucidate the tissue-specific activity of the CMV promoter in the neonatal pig. Moreover, this model can serve as a useful tool for research applications requiring reporter gene activity in mammalian organs.",

    "abstract": "Object recognition is thought to be mediated by rapid feed-forward activation of object-selective cortex, with limited contribution of feedback. However, disruption of visual evoked activity beyond feed-forward processing stages has been demonstrated to affect object recognition performance. Here, we unite these findings by reporting that the detection of target objects in natural scenes is selectively characterized by enhanced feedback when these objects are embedded in high complexity scenes. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a biologically plausible computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was enhanced during categorization of scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was selectively enhanced for target objects in scenes with high complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by high complexity scenes were selectively enhanced from 220 ms after stimulus-onset. Third, behavioral performance deteriorated for highly complex scenes when participants were pressed for time, but not when they could process the scenes fully and thereby benefit from the enhanced feedback. Formal modeling of the reaction time distributions revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes (resulting in more errors especially for fast decisions), and directly related to the build-up of the feedback activity that was observed exclusively for high complexity scenes. Together, these results suggest that while feed-forward activity may suffice for simple scenes, the brain employs recurrent processing more adaptively in naturalistic settings, using minimal feedback for sparse, coherent scenes and increasing feedback for complex, fragmented scenes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHow much neural processing is required to detect objects of interest in natural scenes? The astonishing speed of object recognition suggests that fast feed-forward buildup of perceptual activity is sufficient. However, this view is contradicted by findings that show that disruption of slower neural feedback leads to decreased detection performance. Our study unites these discrepancies by identifying scene complexity as a critical driver of neural feedback. We show how feedback is enhanced for complex, cluttered scenes compared to simple, well-organized scenes. Moreover, for complex scenes, more feedback is associated with better performances. These findings relate the flexibility of neural processes to perceptual decision-making by demonstrating that the brain dynamically directs neural resources based on the complexity of real-world visual inputs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMachine learning methods have gained popularity and practicality in identifying linear and non-linear effects of variants associated with complex disease/traits. Detection of epistatic interactions still remains a challenge due to the large number of features and relatively small sample size as input, thus leading to the so-called \\\"short fat data\\\" problem. The efficiency of machine learning methods can be increased by limiting the number of input features. Thus, it is very important to perform variable selection before searching for epistasis. Many methods have been evaluated and proposed to perform feature selection, but no single method works best in all scenarios. We demonstrate this by conducting two separate simulation analyses to evaluate the proposed collective feature selection approach.\\n\\nResultsThrough our simulation study we propose a collective feature selection approach to select features that are in the \\\"union\\\" of the best performing methods. We explored various parametric, non-parametric, and data mining approaches to perform feature selection. We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisingers MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration).\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies. We were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of collective feature selection along with a comparison of many methods in our simulation analysis. We also applied our method to identify non-linear networks associated with obesity.",

    "abstract": "We present a locality-sensitive hashing strategy for summarizing semi-structured data (e.g., in JSON or XML formats) into  data fingerprints: highly compressed representations which cannot recreate details in the data, yet simplify and greatly accelerate the comparison and clustering of semi-structured data by preserving similarity relationships. Computation on data fingerprints is fast: in one example involving complex simulated medical records, the average time to encode one record was 0.53 seconds, and the average pairwise comparison time was 3.75 microseconds. Both processes are trivially parallelizable.\\n\\nApplications include detection of duplicates, clustering and classification of semi-structured data, which support larger goals including summarizing large and complex data sets, quality assessment, and data mining. We illustrate use cases with three analyses of electronic health records (EHRs): (1) pairwise comparison of patient records, (2) analysis of cohort structure, and (3) evaluation of methods for generating simulated patient data.",

    "abstract": "Pathological changes of penetrating arteries (PAs) within deep white matter (WM) may be an important contributing factor of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Quantitative characterization of the PAs is important for further illuminating their roles in SVD but remains challenging due to their sub-voxel sizes. We propose a quantitative MRI approach for measuring the diameters and flow velocities of PAs based on model based analysis of complex difference images in phase contrast MRI. The complex difference image of each PA is fitted by a model image calculated by taking into account the partial volume effect and signal enhancement due to in flow effects to obtain velocity [Formula], diameter (D), and volume flow rate (VFR) of the PAs. Simulation, phantom, and in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate the accuracy and measurement errors of the proposed method. Our results suggest that PAs with velocities [&ge;] 0.8 cm/s can be accurately measured with [Formula], D, and VFR errors of 0.28 cm/s, 20 m, and 0.024 mm3/s, respectively, although the mean lumen area occupies only 18% of the acquired pixel area. The PAs have a [Formula] distribution peak at ~1.2 cm/s and diameters distribution mostly in the range of 88 - 200 m Quantitative measurements of PAs with the MBAC method may serve as an invaluable tool for illuminating the role of PAs in the aetiopathogenesis of cerebral SVD.",

Additionally, comparing these regulatory mechanisms among morphologically diverse tissues allows for rigorous testing of evolutionary hypotheses. Zebrafish skin is endowed with a coat of precisely patterned bony scales. We use in-toto live imaging during scale development and manipulations of cell signaling activity to elucidate core features of scale patterning and morphogenesis. These analyses show that scale development requires the concerted activity of Wnt/{beta}-catenin, Ectodysplasin (Eda) and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling. This regulatory module coordinates Hedgehog (HH) dependent collective cell migration during epidermal invagination, a cell behavior not previously implicated in skin appendage morphogenesis.

    "abstract": "Experimental evidence shows that synonymous mutations can have important consequences on genetic fitness. Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInterspecies epigenome comparisons yielded functional information that cannot be revealed by genome comparison alone, begging for theoretical advances that enable principled analysis approaches. Whereas probabilistic genome evolution models provided theoretical foundation to comparative genomics studies, it remains challenging to extend DNA evolution models to epigenomes.\\n\\nResultsWe present an effort to develop ab initio evolution models for epigenomes, by explicitly expressing the joint probability of multispecies DNA sequences and histone modifications on homologous genomic regions. This joint probability is modeled as a mixture of four components representing four evolutionary hypotheses, namely dependence and independence of interspecies epigenomic variations to sequence mutations and to sequence insertions and deletions (indels). For model fitting, we implemented a maximum likelihood method by coupling downhill simplex algorithm with dynamic programming. Based on likelihood comparisons, the model can be used to infer whether interspecies epigenomic variations depend on mutation or indels in local genomic sequences. We applied this model to analyze DNase hypersensitive regions and spermatid H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from human and rhesus macaque. Approximately 5.5% of homologous regions in the genomes exhibited H3K4me3 modification in either species, among which approximately 67% homologous regions exhibited sequence-dependent interspecies H3K4me3 variations. Mutations accounted for less sequence-dependent H3K4me3 variations than indels. Among transposon-mediated indels, ERV1 insertions and L1 insertions were most strongly associated with H3K4me3 gains and losses, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionThis work initiates a class of probabilistic evolution models that jointly model the genomes and the epigenomes, thus helps to bring evolutionary principles to comparative epigenomic studies.",

We traced the lineages deriving from each blastomere in two-cell mouse embryos and observed inequivalent contributions to the embryonic and abembryonic poles in 72% of the blastocysts evaluated. Rainbow-seq on four- and eight-cell embryos with lineage tracing triggered at two-cell stage exhibited remarkable transcriptome-wide differences between the two cell lineages at both stages, including genes involved in negative regulation of transcription and signaling.

    "abstract": "Maternal mRNAs are synthesized during oogenesis to initiate the development of future generations. Some maternal mRNAs are determinants of somatic or germline fate and must be translationally repressed until embryogenesis. However, the translational repressors themselves are also temporally regulated. We use polar granule component (pgc), a Drosophila maternal mRNA, as a model system to ask how maternal mRNAs are repressed while the regulatory landscape is continually shifting. pgc, a potent transcriptional silencer and germline determinant, is translationally regulated throughout oogenesis. We find that the 3UTR of pgc mRNA contains a conserved ten-nucleotide sequence that is bound by different conserved RNA binding proteins (RBPs) at different stages of oogenesis to continuously repress translation except for a brief expression in the stem cell daughter. Pumilio (Pum) binds to this sequence in undifferentiated and early differentiating oocytes and recruits other temporally restricted translational regulators to block pgc translation. After differentiation, Pum levels diminish and Bruno (Bru) levels increase, allowing Bru to bind the same 3UTR sequence and take over translational repression of pgc mRNA. We have identified a class of maternal mRNAs regulated during oogenesis by both Pum and Bru, including Zelda, activator of the zygotic genome, which contain this core 10-nt regulatory sequence. Our data suggests that this hand off mechanism is more generally utilized to inhibit translation of maternal mRNAs during oogenesis.",

This conflict would be intense in stress-adapted plants as stress can often reactivate TEs. Mangroves reduce TE load convergently in their adaptation to intertidal environments and thus provide a unique opportunity to address the host-TE conflict and its interaction with stress adaptation.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing the mangrove Rhizophora apiculata as a model, we investigated methylation and short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting patterns in relation to the abundance and age of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. We also examined LTR retrotransposons distance to genes, impact on neighboring gene expression, and population frequencies.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found differential accumulation among classes of LTR retrotransposons despite high overall methylation levels. This can be attributed to 24-nt siRNA-mediated CHH methylation preferentially targeting Gypsy elements, particularly in their LTR regions. Old Gypsy elements possess unusually abundant siRNAs which show cross-mapping to young copies. Gypsy elements appear to be closer to genes and under stronger purifying selection than other classes.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest a continuous host-TE battle masked by the TE load reduction in R. apiculata. This conflict may enable mangroves like R. apiculata to maintain genetic diversity and thus evolutionary potential during stress adaptation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Analysis of animal population status and change are core elements of ecological research and critical for prioritizing conservation actions. Traditionally, count-based data from structured surveys have been the main source of information used to estimate trends and changes in populations. In the past decade, advances in integrated population models (IPMs) have allowed these data to be combined with other data sources (e.g., observations of marked individuals). IPMs have allowed researchers to determine the direction and magnitude of a species population trajectory and to test underlying mechanisms. For many species, life-history characteristics (e.g., low site-fidelity), low abundance and/or low detection probability make it difficult to collect sufficient data; thus, IPMs for these species are difficult to employ. We used count data from eBird to estimate population trends for one such species, the tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor). We combined estimates of relative abundance with banding and nesting data. Our joint estimation of demographic rates allowed us to evaluate their individual contributions to the population growth rate. We suggest that investments in increasing reproductive success and recruitment are the most likely conservation strategies to increase the population. The extensive survey efforts of citizen scientists aided the employment of IPMs to inform conservation efforts.\\n\\nData AccessibilityShould the manuscript be accepted, the data supporting the results will be published along with the manuscript.

Many new applications in drug discovery and functional genomics require capturing the morphology of individual cells as comprehensively as possible. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn powerful visual representations, but require ground truth for training; this is rarely available in biomedical profiling experiments. While we do not know which experimental treatments produce cells that look alike, we do know that cells exposed to the same experimental treatment should generally look similar. Thus, we explore training CNNs using a weakly supervised approach that uses this information for feature learning. In addition, the training stage is regularized to control for unwanted variations using mixup or RNNs. We conduct experiments on two different datasets; the proposed approach yields single-cell embeddings that are more accurate than the widely adopted classical features, and are competitive with previously proposed transfer learning approaches.",

Fish allocate carotenoids to their eggs, which gives them the typical yellow to red colouration and supports their resistance against microbial infections. However, it is still unclear whether carotenoids act mainly as a shield against infection or are used up during the embryos immune defence. We investigated this question with experimental families produced from wild-caught brown trout (Salmo trutta). Singly raised embryos were either exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas fluorescens or sham-treated at one of two stages during their development. A previous study on these experimental families reported positive effects of egg carotenoids on embryo growth and resistance against the infection. Here, we quantified carotenoid consumption in these infected and sham-infected maternal sib groups. We found that carotenoid contents mostly decreased during embryogenesis. However, these decreases were neither linked to the virulence induced by the pathogen nor dependent on the time point of infection. We conclude that egg carotenoids are not significantly used up by the embryos immune defence.",

The frequency of the inactive and active form of this receptor is nearly equal in many human populations and heterozygotes (with one copy of the active form and another copy of the inactive form) have the most common diplotype. However, heterozygotes differ markedly in their perception of bitterness, in part perhaps because of differences in TAS2R38 mRNA expression. Other tissues including the nasal sinuses express this receptor, where it contributes to pathogen defense. We asked whether heterozygotes with high TAS2R38 mRNA expression in taste tissue were also likely to express more TAS2R38 mRNA in sinonasal tissue. To that end, we measured TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor mRNA by qPCR in biopsied tissue, and learned that expression amount of one is not related to the other. We confirmed the general independence of expression in other tissue expressing TAS2R38 mRNA using autopsy data from the GTEx project. Taste tissue TAS2R38 mRNA expression among heterozygotes is unlikely to predict expression in other tissues, perhaps reflecting tissue-dependent function and hence regulation of this protein.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have proposed biomarkers based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and predict the risk of evolution toward Alzheimers disease (AD). While anatomical MRI captures structural alterations, studies demonstrated the ability of diffusion MRI to capture microstructural modifications at an earlier stage. Several methods have focused on hippocampus structure to detect AD. To date, the patch-based grading framework provides the best biomarker based on the hippocampus. However, this structure is complex since the hippocampus is divided into several heterogeneous subfields not equally impacted by AD. Former in-vivo imaging studies only investigated structural alterations of these subfields using volumetric measurements and microstructural modifications with mean diffusivity measurements. The aim of our work is to study the efficiency of hippocampal subfields compared to the whole hippocampus structure with a multimodal patch-based framework that enables to capture subtler structural and microstructural alterations. To this end, we analyze the significance of the different hippocampal subfields for AD diagnosis and prognosis with volumetric, diffusivity measurements and a novel multimodal patch-based grading framework that combines structural and diffusion MRI. The experiments conducted in this work showed that the whole hippocampus provides the most discriminant biomarkers for advanced AD detection while biomarkers applied into subiculum obtain the best results for AD prediction, improving by 2% the accuracy compared to the whole hippocampus.",

Any strategies that accelerate healing would improve patient care. Distraction osteogenesis research in the past decade has shown that direct stem cell implantation enhances new bone formation. Systemic implantation would be more clinically desirable. Systemically delivered stem cells have been shown to home to a mandibular distraction site; however, effects on bone formation have not been studied. Ten-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgery to implant an external fixator-distractor and an osteotomy was performed. Twenty-four hours postoperatively, each rat received tail vein injections of either saline or 10^6 fluorescently labeled primary mesenchymal stem cells. Animals in the validation groups were euthanized two days after surgery and the femora processed for histology. Animals in the experimental groups were given five days of latency, then the femur was lengthened once daily for five days (0.75mm/day, 3.75mm total). Following four weeks of consolidation, the animals were euthanized and the femora were evaluated by microCT and histology to quantify new bone formation. Labeled stem cells were found at the distraction site in validation animals. However, there were no differences in any bone or soft tissue outcomes. Systemic stem cell administration 24 hours after surgery does not improve DO outcomes.

The criteria for accepting or rejecting donor kidneys relies heavily on pathologist determination of the percent of glomeruli (determined from a frozen section) that are normal and sclerotic. This percentage is a critical measurement that correlates with transplant outcome. Inter- and intra-observer variability in donor biopsy evaluation is, however, significant. An automated method for determination of percent global glomerulosclerosis could prove useful in decreasing evaluation variability, increasing throughput, and easing the burden on pathologists. Here, we describe the development of a deep learning model that identifies and classifies non-sclerosed and sclerosed glomeruli in whole-slide images of donor kidney frozen section biopsies. This model extends a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large database of digital images. The extended model, when trained on just 48 whole slide images, exhibits slide-level evaluation performance on par with expert renal pathologists. The model substantially outperforms a model trained on image patches of isolated glomeruli. Encouragingly, the models performance is robust to slide preparation artifacts associated with frozen section preparation. As the first model reported that identifies and classifies normal and sclerotic glomeruli in frozen kidney sections, and thus the first model reported in the literature relevant to kidney transplantation, it may become an essential part of donor kidney biopsy evaluation in the clinical setting.",

However, unavoidable calibration errors of AFM probes make it cumbersome to quantify modulation of mechanics. Here, we show that concurrent AFM force measurements enable relative mechanical characterization with an accuracy that is independent of calibration uncertainty, even when averaging data from multiple, independent experiments. Compared to traditional AFM, we estimate that concurrent strategies can measure differences in protein mechanical unfolding forces with a 6-fold improvement in accuracy and a 30-fold increase in throughput.

The evolutionary history of these genes is still under debate due to ambiguous definitions of homologous relationships among vertebrates. Thus, the goal of this study was to unravel the evolution of the GDF1 and GDF3 genes of vertebrates, emphasizing the understanding of homologous relationships and their evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, our results revealed that the GDF1 and GDF3 genes found in amphibians and mammals are the products of independent duplication events of an ancestral gene in the ancestor of each of these lineages. The main implication of this result is that the GDF1 and GDF3 genes of amphibians and mammals are not 1:1 orthologs. In other words, genes that participate in fundamental processes during early development have been reinvented two independent times during the evolutionary history of tetrapods.",

    "abstract": "Analysing models of biological networks typically relies on workflows in which different software tools with sensitive parameters are chained together, many times with additional manual steps. The accessibility and reproducibility of such workflows is challenging, as publications often overlook analysis details, and because some of these tools may be difficult to install, and/or have a steep learning curve. The CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a unified environment to edit, execute, share, and reproduce analyses of qualitative models of biological networks. This framework combines the power of different technologies to ensure repeatability and to reduce users learning curve of these technologies. The framework is distributed as a Docker image with the tools ready to be run without any installation step besides Docker, and is available on Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. The embedded computational workflows are edited with a Jupyter web interface, enabling the inclusion of textual annotations, along with the explicit code to execute, as well as the visualisation of the results. The resulting notebook files can then be shared and re-executed in the same environment. To date, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides access to software tools including GINsim, BioLQM, Pint, MaBoSS, and Cell Collective for the modelling and analysis of Boolean and multi-valued networks. More tools will be included in the future. We developed a Python interface for each of these tools to offer a seamless integration in the Jupyter web interface and ease the chaining of complementary analyses.",

Here we explore whether long-range electrical signaling can convey information on tissue geometry to influence electrical dynamics of individual cells. First, we studied an engineered electrically excitable cell line where all voltage-gated channels were well characterized. Cells grown in patterned islands of different shapes showed remarkably diverse firing patterns under otherwise identical conditions, including regular spiking, period-doubling alternans, and arrhythmic firing. A Hodgkin-Huxley numerical model quantitatively reproduced these effects, showing how the macroscopic geometry affected the single-cell electrophysiology via the influence of gap junction-mediated electrical coupling. Qualitatively similar geometry dependent dynamics were experimentally observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. The cardiac results urge caution in translating observations of arrhythmia in vitro to predictions in vivo where the tissue geometry is very different. We present simulation results and scaling arguments which explore how to extrapolate electrophysiological measurements between tissues with different geometries and different gap junction couplings.",

    "abstract": "Precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is associated with recurrent mutations that occur in cancer-initiating cells. There is a need to understand how spontaneous driver mutations influence clonal evolution in leukemia. The ETS-transcription factors PU.1 and Spi-B (encoded by Spi1 and Spib) execute a critical role in B cell development and serve as complementary tumour suppressors by opposing the proliferative events mediated by IL-7R signaling. Here, we used a mouse model to conditionally delete Spi1 and Spib genes in developing B cells. These mice developed B-ALL with a median time to euthanasia of 18 weeks. We performed RNA and whole-exome sequencing (WES) on leukemias isolated from Mb1-Cre{Delta}PB mice and identified single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in Jak1, Jak3 and Ikzf3 genes, resulting in amino acid changes and in the gain of early stop-codons. JAK3 mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions located in the pseudo-kinase (R653H, V670A) and in the kinase (T844M) domains. Introduction of these mutations into wild-type pro-B cells conferred survival and proliferation advantages. We conclude that mutations in Janus kinases represent secondary drivers of leukemogenesis in the absence of Spi-B and PU.1 transcription factors. This mouse model represents an useful tool to study clonal evolution and tumour heterogeneity in B-ALL.",

    "abstract": "Specific mate recognition strongly relies on the chemical senses in many animals, and especially in nocturnal insects. Two signal types lend to premating olfactory communication in terrestrial habitats: sex signals blend into an atmosphere of habitat odorants, where plant volatiles prevail. We show for the first time that males of the African cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis perceive female sex pheromone and volatiles of its plant host cotton as a unit, rather than as independent messages. In clean air, S. littoralis males are attracted to flawed pheromone signals, such as single synthetic pheromone components or even the pheromone of a sibling species, Oriental leafworm S. litura. Presence of host plant volatiles, however, strongly reduces the male response to deficient or heterospecific pheromone signals. That plant cues enhance discrimination of sex pheromone quality confirms the idea that specific mate recognition in noctuid moths has evolved in concert with host plant adaptation. A participation of host plant odour in sexual communication suggests that mate recognition is under natural and sexual selection. Moreover, shifts in either female host preference or sex pheromone biosynthesis give rise to new communication channels that have the potential to initiate or contribute to reproductive isolation.",

We focus on producing results detailed enough for the generation of computational models and enabling comparison with future studies. Here we report our examination of intralaminar connectivity within each of several classes of excitatory neurons. We find that connections are sparse but present among all excitatory cell types and layers we sampled, with the most sparse connections in layers 5 and 6. Almost all mouse synapses exhibited short-term depression with similar dynamics. Synaptic signaling between a subset of layer 2/3 neurons; however, exhibited facilitation.

    "abstract": "Motor behavior is often driven by visual stimuli, relying on efficient feedforward communication from lower to higher visual areas. The Communication-through-Coherence hypothesis proposes that interareal communication depends on coherence at an optimal phase relation. While previous studies have linked effective communication to enhanced interareal coherence, it remains unclear, whether this interareal coherence occurs at an optimal phase relation that actually improves the stimulus transmission to behavioral report. We recorded local field potentials simultaneously from areas V1 and V4 of macaque monkeys performing a selective visual attention task, during which they reported changes of the attended stimulus. Gamma synchronization between V1 and V4, immediately preceding the stimulus change, predicted subsequent reaction times (RTs). Crucially, RTs were systematically slowed as trial-by-trial interareal gamma phase relations deviated from the phase relation at which V1 and V4 synchronized on average. These effects were specific to the attended stimulus and not due to local power or phase inside V1 or V4. We conclude that interareal gamma synchronization occurs at the optimal phase relation and thereby improves interareal communication and the effective transformation of sensory inputs into motor responses.",

How the brain performs these inferences remains unknown: Theoretical proposals based on inverting generative models (or \"analysis-by-synthesis\") have a long history but their mechanistic implementations have typically been too slow to support online perception, and their mapping to neural circuits is unclear. Here we present a neurally plausible model for efficiently inverting generative models of images and test it as an account of one high-level visual capacity, the perception of faces. The model is based on a deep neural network that learns to invert a three-dimensional (3D) face graphics program in a single fast feedforward pass. It explains both human behavioral data and multiple levels of neural processing in non-human primates, as well as a classic illusion, the \"hollow face\" effect. The model fits qualitatively better than state-of-the-art computer vision models, and suggests an interpretable reverse-engineering account of how images are transformed into percepts in the ventral stream.",

Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0-3000 m, and performance remained high when forecasting events 24-72 h into the future (68-72% variation explained).

Feature-based reinforcement learning fails when the values of individual features depend on the other features present. One solution is to assign value to multifeatural conjunctive representations. We tested if the hippocampus formed separable conjunctive representations that enabled learning of response contingencies for stimuli of the form: AB+, B-, AC-, C+. Pattern analyses on functional MRI data showed the hippocampus formed conjunctive representations that were dissociable from feature components and that these representations influenced striatal PEs.

    "abstract": "Background and aimsChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can be a severely disabling side-effect of commonly used cancer chemotherapeutics, requiring cessation or dose reduction, impacting on survival and quality of life. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of research using animal models of CIPN to inform robust experimental design.\\n\\nMethodsWe systematically searched 5 online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Citation Index, Biosis Previews and Embase (September 2012) to identify publications reporting in vivo CIPN modelling. Due to the number of publications and high accrual rate of new studies, we ran an updated search November 2015, using machine-learning and text mining to identify relevant studies.\\n\\nAll data were abstracted by two independent reviewers. For each comparison we calculated a standardised mean difference effect size then combined effects in a random effects meta- analysis. The impact of study design factors and reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias was assessed. We ran power analysis for the most commonly reported behavioural tests.\\n\\nResults341 publications were included. The majority (84%) of studies reported using male animals to model CIPN; the most commonly reported strain was Sprague Dawley rat. In modelling experiments, Vincristine was associated with the greatest increase in pain-related behaviour (-3.22 SD [-3.88; -2.56], n=152, p=0). The most commonly reported outcome measure was evoked limb withdrawal to mechanical monofilaments. Pain-related complex behaviours were rarely reported. The number of animals required to obtain 80% power with a significance level of 0.05 varied substantially across behavioural tests. Overall, studies were at moderate risk of bias, with modest reporting of measures to reduce the risk of bias.\\n\\nConclusionsHere we provide a comprehensive summary of the field of animal models of CIPN and inform robust experimental design by highlighting measures to increase the internal and external validity of studies using animal models of CIPN. Power calculations and other factors, such as clinical relevance, should inform the choice of outcome measure in study design.",

    "abstract": "Space exploration has long been a source of inspiration, challenging scientists and engineers to find innovative solutions to various problems. One of the current focuses in space exploration is to send humans to Mars. However, the challenge of transporting materials to Mars and the need for waste management processes are two major obstacles for these long-duration missions.\\n\\nTo address these two challenges a process called Astroplastic was developed that produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from solid human waste, which can be used to 3D print useful items for astronauts. PHB granules are naturally produced by bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for carbon and energy storage. The phaJ, phaC, and phaCBA genes were cloned from these native PHB-producing bacteria into Escherichia coli. These genes code for enzymes that aid in PHB production by converting products of glycolysis and {beta}-oxidation pathways, such as acetyl-CoA and enoyl-CoA, into PHB. To ensure a continuous PHB production system and to eliminate the need for cell lysis to extract PHB, recombinant E. coli was engineered to use the genes in its natural type I secretion system to secrete PHB. The C-terminal of the HlyA secretion tag was fused to phasin (PhaP), a protein originally from R. eutropha. Phasin-HlyA electrostatically binds PHB granules and transports them outside of the cell.\\n\\nIn addition to genetically engineering bacteria, a concept for start-to-finish PHB production process was designed. Integrating expert feedback and experimental results, conditions for each step of the process including the collection and storage of waste, volatile fatty acid (VFA) fermentation, VFA extraction, PHB fermentation, and PHB extraction were optimized. The optimized system will provide a sustainable and continuous PHB production system, which will address the problems of transportation costs and waste management for future space missions.\\n\\nFinancial DisclosureMindfuel Science Alberta Foundation Genome Alberta GenScript Polyferm Canada GeekStarter Alberta Integrated DNA Technologies University of Calgary University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine University of Calgary Bachelor of Sciences University of Calgary Schulich School of Engineering University of Calgary OBrien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences City of Calgary Alberta Innovates The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\\n\\nCompeting InterestsThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\n\\nEthics StatementN/A\\n\\nData AvailabilityAll data are freely available without restriction.",

    "abstract": "Creatine (Cr) is required for proper neuronal function, as evidenced by the intellectual disability and epileptic phenotype seen in patients with cerebral Cr deficiency syndromes (CCDS). In addition, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a frequent co-morbidity of Cr transporter (Crt) deficiency, the leading cause of CCDS. While the effects of the loss of Cr in the whole brain is clear, it is unknown if Cr is required for the proper function of all neurons. Of particular interest are dopaminergic neurons, as many CCDS patients have ADHD and Cr has been implicated in dopamine-associated neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a loss of the Slc6a8 (Cr transporter; Crt) gene in cells expressing the dopamine transporter (Slc6a3; DAT) on activity levels and motor function as the animals age. DAT-specific Crt-knockout (DAT-Crt) mice were tested along with control (Crt-FLOX) mice monthly from 3 to 12 months of age in locomotor activity, the challenging beam test, and spontaneous activity. DAT-Crt mice were hyperactive compared with controls and this finding persisted throughout the lifetime of the mice. No changes were observed in errors to cross a narrow bridge in the challenging beam test. In a measurement of spontaneous activity, DAT-Crt mice showed increased rearing and hind limb steps, suggesting the hyperactivity carried over to this task. Taken together, these data suggest that the lack of Cr in dopaminergic neurons causes hyperactivity while sparing motor function.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, most genes are encoded on the leading strand, co-orienting the movement of the replication machinery with RNA polymerases. This co-orientation bias reduces the frequency of highly detrimental head-on collisions between the two machineries. This and other work set up the expectation that over evolutionary time, head-on alleles are selected against, maximizing genome co-orientation. Our findings challenge this model. Using the well-established GC skew method, we reveal the evolutionary inversion record of all chromosomally encoded genes in multiple divergent bacterial pathogens. We find that a surprisingly large number of co-oriented genes have inverted to, and are retained in the head-on orientation. Furthermore, we find that these head-on genes, (including key antibiotic resistance and virulence genes) have higher rates of nonsynonymous mutations and are more frequently under positive selection (dN/dS>1). Based on these results, we propose that bacteria increase their evolvability through gene inversion and promotion of head-on replication-transcription collisions.",

    "abstract": "A fitness landscape is a map between the genotype and its reproductive success in a given environment. The topography of fitness landscapes largely governs adaptive dynamics, constraining evolutionary trajectories and the predictability of evolution. Theory suggests that this topography can be \\\"deformed\\\" by mutations that produce substantial changes to the environment. In spite of its importance, the deformability of fitness landscapes has not been systematically studied beyond abstract models, and little is known about its reach and consequences in empirical systems. Here we have systematically characterized the deformability of the genome-wide metabolic fitness landscape of the bacterium E. coli. Deformability is quantified by the non-commutativity of epistatic interactions, which we experimentally demonstrate in mutant strains on the path to an evolutionary innovation. Our analysis shows that the deformation of fitness landscapes by metabolic mutations rarely affects evolutionary trajectories in the short-range. However, mutations with large environmental effects leave these as a \\\"legacy\\\", producing long-range landscape deformations in distant regions of the genotype space that affect the fitness of later descendants. Our methods and results provide the basis for an integration between adaptive and eco-evolutionary dynamics with complex genetics and genomics.",

    "abstract": "CD95 (Fas, APO-1, TNFRSF6) is a widely expressed single-pass transmembrane protein that is implicated in cell death, inflammatory response, proliferation and cell migration. CD95 ligand (CD95L, FasL, TNFSF6), is a potent apoptotic inducer in the membrane form but not when cleaved into soluble CD95L (sCD95L). Here, we aimed at understanding the relation between ligand-receptor multimerization and receptor activation by correlating the kinetics of ligand binding, receptor oligomerization, FADD (FAS-Associated via Death Domain) recruitment and caspase-8 activation inside living cells. Using single molecule localization microscopy and Forster resonance energy transfer imaging we show that the majority of CD95 receptors on the plasma membrane are monomeric at rest. This was confirmed functionally as the wild-type receptor is not blocked by a receptor mutant that cannot bind ligand. Moreover, using time-resolved fluorescence imaging approaches we demonstrated that receptor multimerization follows instantaneously ligand binding, whereas FADD recruitment is delayed. This process can explain the typical delay time seen with caspase-8 activity reporters. Finally, the low activity of sCD95L, which was caused by inefficient FADD recruitment, was not explained by the low avidity for the receptor but by a receptor clustering mechanism that was different from the one induced by the strong apoptosis inducer IZ-sCD95L. Our results reveal that receptor activation is modulated by the capacity of its ligand to trimerize it.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAt a density of less than 10 receptors per {micro}m2 CD95 exists as monomer (58%) and dimer (42%)\\nC_LIO_LIPre-formed dimers do not contribute to ligand-induced CD95 apoptotic signaling\\nC_LIO_LIThe PLAD of CD95 attenuates overexpression-induced, ligand-independent cell death\\nC_LIO_LIsoluble CD95L can rapidly multimerize CD95 after binding but it is still a poor inducer of apoptosis through inefficient FADD recruitment\\nC_LIO_LIFADD recruitment kinetics but not ligand binding kinetics correlates with caspase-8 onset of activity\\nC_LI",

A common method to estimate this multiplet frequency is to mix two different types of cells (e.g., human and mouse), and then determine how often the transcriptomes contain transcripts from both cell types. When the two cell types are mixed in equal proportion, the calculation of the multiplet frequency from the frequency of mixed transcriptomes is straightforward. But surprisingly, there are no published descriptions of how to calculate the multiplet frequency in the general case when the cell types are mixed unequally. Here I derive equations to analytically calculate the multiplet frequency from the numbers of observed pure and mixed transcriptomes when two cell types are mixed in arbitrary proportions, under the assumption that the loading of cells into droplets or wells is Poisson.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ in their vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence that are determined by innate and environmental factors. The corticostriatal circuit is heavily involved in the development of alcohol dependence and may contain neural information regarding vulnerability to drink excessively. In the current experiment, we hypothesized that we could characterize high and low alcohol-drinking rats (HD and LD, respectively) based on corticostriatal oscillations, and that these subgroups would differentially respond to corticostriatal brain stimulation. Rats were trained to drink 10% alcohol in a limited access paradigm. In separate sessions, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=13). Based on training alcohol consumption levels, we classified rats using a median split as HD or LD. Then, using machine-learning, we built predictive models to classify rats as HD or LD by corticostriatal LFPs and compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built on data permutations. Additionally, we explored the impact of NAcSh or mPFC stimulation on alcohol consumption in HD vs. LD. Corticostriatal LFPs were able predict HD vs. LD group classification with greater accuracy than expected by chance (>80% accuracy). Additionally, NAcSh stimulation significantly reduced alcohol consumption in HD, but not LD (p<0.05), while mPFC stimulation did not alter drinking behavior in either HD or LD (p>0.05). These data collectively show that the corticostriatal circuit is differentially involved in regulating alcohol intake in HD vs. LD rats, and suggests that corticostriatal activity may have the potential to predict a vulnerability to develop alcohol dependence in a clinical population.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study found more than 500 transcripts significantly increased in abundance in the zebrafish and mouse several hours to days postmortem relative to live controls. The current literature suggests that most mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated in stressful conditions, we rationalized that the postmortem transcripts must contain sequence features (3 to 9 mers) that are unique from those in the rest of the transcriptome - specifically, binding sites for proteins and/or non-coding RNAs involved in regulation. Our new study identified 5117 and 2245 over-represented sequence features in the mouse and zebrafish, respectively. Some of these features were disproportionately distributed along the transcripts with high densities in the 3-UTR region of the zebrafish (0.3 mers/nt) and the ORFs of the mouse (0.6 mers/nt). Yet, the highest density (2.3 mers/nt) occurred in the ORFs of 11 mouse transcripts that lacked UTRs. Our results suggest that these transcripts might serve as  molecular sponges that sequester RNA binding proteins and/or microRNAs, increasing the stability and gene expression of other transcripts. In addition, some features were identified as binding sites for Rbfox and Hud proteins that are also involved in increasing transcript stability and gene expression. Hence, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome, which presumably has implications for post-transcriptional regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "Competition and mutualism are inevitable processes in microbial ecology, and a central question is which and how many taxa will persist in the face of these interactions. Ecological theory has demonstrated that when direct, pairwise interactions among a group of species are too numerous, or too strong, then the coexistence of these species will be unstable to any slight perturbation. This instability worsens when mutualistic interactions complement competition. Here, we refine and to some extent overturn that understanding, by considering explicitly the resources that microbes consume and produce. In contrast to more complex organisms, microbial cells consume primarily abiotic resources, and mutualistic interactions are often mediated by these same abiotic resources through the mechanism of cross-feeding. Our model therefore considers the consumption and production of a set of abiotic resources by a group of microbial species. We show that if microbes consume, but do not produce resources, then any positive equilibrium will always be stable to small perturbations. We go on to show that in the presence of crossfeeding, stability is no longer guaranteed. However, stability still holds when mutualistic interations are either symmetric, or sufficiently weak.",
