    "abstract": "Correlated evolution among traits, which can happen due to genetic constraints, ontogeny, and selection, can have an important impact on the trajectory of phenotypic evolution. For example, shifts in the pattern of evolutionary integration may allow the exploration of novel regions of the morphospace by lineages. Here we use phylogenetic trees to study the pace of evolution of several traits and their pattern of evolutionary correlation across clades and over time. We use regimes mapped to the branches of the phylogeny to test for shifts in evolutionary integration. Our approach incorporates the uncertainty related to phylogeny, ancestral state estimates and parameter estimates to produce posterior distributions using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We implemented the use of summary statistics to test for regime shifts based on a series of attributes of the model that can be directly relevant to biological hypotheses. In addition, we extend Felsensteins pruning algorithm to the case of multivariate Brownian motion models with multiple rate regimes. We performed extensive simulations to explore the performance of the method under a series of scenarios. Finally, we provide two test cases; the evolution of a novel buccal morphology in fishes of the family Centrarchidae and a shift in the trajectory of evolution of traits during the radiation of anole lizards to and from the Caribbean islands.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVariation in chromatin organization across single cells can help shed important light on the mechanisms controlling gene expression, but scale, noise, and sparsity pose significant challenges for interpretation of single cell chromatin data. Here, we develop BROCKMAN (Brockman Representation Of Chromatin by K-mers in Mark-Associated Nucleotides), an approach to infer variation in transcription factor (TF) activity across samples through unsupervised analysis of the variation in DNA sequences associated with an epigenomic mark.\\n\\nResultsBROCKMAN represents each sample as a vector of epigenomic-mark-associated DNA word frequencies, and decomposes the resulting matrix to find hidden structure in the data, followed by unsupervised grouping of samples and identification of the TFs that distinguish groups. Applied to single cell ATAC-seq, BROCKMAN readily distinguished cell types, treatments, batch effects, experimental artifacts, and cycling cells. We show that each variable component in the k-mer landscape reflects a set of co-varying TFs, which are often known to physically interact. For example, in K562 cells, AP-1 TFs were central determinant of variability in chromatin accessibility through their variable expression levels and diverse interactions with other TFs. We provide a theoretical basis for why cooperative TF binding - and any associated epigenomic mark - is inherently more variable than non-cooperative binding.\\n\\nConclusionsBROCKMAN and related approaches will help gain a mechanistic understanding of the trans determinants of chromatin variability between cells, treatments, and individuals.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe dynamics of vector-borne parasites are driven by interactions between factors intrinsic to the parasite, its host, as well as environmental fluctuations. Understanding these interactions requires a long-term view, especially to predict the consequences of climate change on parasite dynamics.\\nC_LIO_LIThe goal of this study is to evaluate temporal fluctuations in individual probability of infection, its environmental drivers and consequences for host body condition, of three malaria parasites (Plasmodium azurophilum, P. leucocytica, and P. floridense) infecting the lizard, Anolis gundlachi, in the rainforest of Puerto Rico.\\nC_LIO_LIWe conducted 13 surveys totaling N > 8000 lizards over 26 years. During the early years of the study, the lizards probability of infection by all three Plasmodium species appeared stable despite disturbances from short droughts and small to moderate hurricanes.\\nC_LIO_LIOver a longer timescale, we found that the individual lizard probability of infection and overall prevalence varied significantly over the years, and this fluctuation was driven in non-linear ways by variations in temperature and rainfall. The probability of infection was maximized at intermediate levels of temperature and precipitation. This temporal variability in Plasmodium prevalence driven by environmental factors had two important consequences. First, temperature-mediated a decrease in body condition in infected female lizards relative to non-infected ones. Second, Plasmodium parasite species composition varied through time.\\nC_LIO_LIOverall, the results show how environmental conditions, such a severe drought, can drive disease dynamics outside of their apparent stable equilibrium and mediate the potential negative effects of parasite infection on the host. Our results also emphasize the need for long-term studies to reveal host-parasite dynamics, their drivers and consequences.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A personalized approach based on a patients or pathogens unique genomic sequence is the foundation of precision medicine. Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://osf.io/zm97b/) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The BioCompute paradigm and the resulting BioCompute Objects (BCO) offer that standard, and are freely accessible as a GitHub organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the \\\"Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development\\\". By communication of high-throughput sequencing studies using a BCO, regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA), diagnostic test developers, researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine, potentially decreasing the time and cost associated with next generation sequencing workflow exchange, reporting, and regulatory reviews.",

Survival analysis and extended Cox regression models were used to generate hazards ratios for selected predictor variables. A total of 9184 restorations were followed in 1551 unique patients. During the follow-up period, 28.7% of these restorations incurred an event; and overall the restorations had a median lifespan of 6.25 years. In multivariable regression models, after controlling for gender and age, composite restorations and greater number of restoration surfaces were associated with higher risks of failure; and the initial restoration recorded in the database for each subject tended to have lower risk of failure than restorations placed later that included any of those same surfaces.

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100049).\\n\\nNew parasites commonly arise through host-shifts, where parasites from one host species jump to and become established in a new host species. There is much evidence that the probability of host-shifts decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient hosts, but the consequences of such preferential host switching remain little explored. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of parasite host-shifts in the presence of this phylogenetic distance effect. Host trees evolve under a stochastic birth-death process and parasites co-evolve concurrently on those trees, undergoing host-shifts, co-speciation and extinction. Our model indicates that host trees have a major influence on these dynamics. This applies both to individual trees that evolved under the same stochastic process and to sets of trees that evolved with different macroevolutionary parameters. We predict that trees consisting of a few large clades of host species and those with fast species turnover should harbour more parasites than trees with many small clades and those that diversify more slowly. Within trees, large clades should exhibit a higher infection frequency than small clades. We discuss our results in the light of recent cophylogenetic studies in a wide range of host-parasite systems, including the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia.",

    "abstract": "The development of high throughput single-cell technologies now allows the investigation of the genome-wide diversity of transcription. This diversity has shown two faces: the expression dynamics (gene to gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly-expressed genes. Second, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same gene at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent and to provide a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is one of the most powerful frameworks to provide a suitable representation of high dimensional datasets, by searching for new axes catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distances and projections that work poorly in presence of over-dispersed counts showing zero-inflation. We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis, that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model. This hierarchical model is inferred using a variational EM algorithm. We show how this probabilistic framework induces a geometry that is suitable for single-cell data, and produces a compression of the data that is very powerful for clustering purposes. Our method is competed to other standard representation methods like ZIFA and t-SNE, and we illustrate its performance on simulated and publicly available data.",

As cancer tissues are now frequently screened for specific sets of mutations, a large amount of samples has become available for analysis. Classification of patients with similar mutation profiles may help identifying subgroups of patients who might benefit from specific types of treatment. However, classification based on somatic mutations is challenging due to the sparseness and heterogeneity of the data.\\n\\nMETHODSHere, we describe a new method to de-sparsify somatic mutation data using biological pathways. We applied this method to 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, including samples from 5, 805 primary tumors.\\n\\nRESULTSWe show that, for most cancer types, de-sparsified mutation data associates with phenotypic data. We identify poor prognostic subtypes in three cancer types, which are associated with mutations in signal transduction pathways for which targeted treatment options are available. We identify subtype-drug associations for 14 additional subtypes. Finally, we perform a pan-cancer subtyping analysis and identify nine pan-cancer subtypes, which associate with mutations in four overarching sets of biological pathways.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThis study is an important step towards understanding mutational patterns in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of response time (RT) have long been used to infer neural processes underlying various cognitive functions such as working memory, attention, and decision making. However, it is currently unknown if RT is also informative about various stages of value-based choice, particularly how reward values are constructed. To investigate these questions, we analyzed the pattern of RT during a set of multi-dimensional learning and decision-making tasks that can prompt subjects to adopt different learning strategies. In our experiments, subjects could use reward feedback to directly learn reward values associated with possible choice options (object-based learning). Alternatively, they could learn reward values of options features (e.g. color, shape) and combine these values to estimate reward values for individual options (feature-based learning). We found that RT was slower when the difference between subjects estimates of reward probabilities for the two alternative objects on a given trial was smaller. Moreover, RT was overall faster when the preceding trial was rewarded or when the previously selected object was present. These effects, however, were mediated by an interaction between these factors such that subjects were faster when the previously selected object was present rather than absent but only after unrewarded trials. Finally, RT reflected the learning strategy (i.e. object-based or feature-based approach) adopted by the subject on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating an overall faster construction of reward value and/or value comparison during object-based learning. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the pattern of RT can be informative about how reward values are learned and constructed during complex value-based learning and decision making.",

Here we present a model of Hsp70-mediated protein folding, which predicts that Hsp70, as a result of differential stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by its Hsp40 cochaperone, dissociates faster from a substrate in fold-competent conformations than from one in misfolding-prone conformations, thus elevating the native concentration above and suppressing the misfolded concentration below their respective equilibrium values. Previous models would not make or imply these predictions, which are experimentally testable. Our model quantitatively reproduces experimental refolding kinetics, predicts how modulations of the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone system affect protein folding, and suggests new approaches to regulating cellular protein quality.",

    "abstract": "Bystander selection -- the selective pressures exerted by antibiotics on microbial flora that are not the target pathogen of treatment -- is critical to understanding the total impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic use; however, to our knowledge, this effect has never been quantified. Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS), the Human Microbiome Project, and additional carriage and etiological data from existing literature, we estimate the magnitude of bystander selection for a range of clinically relevant antibiotic-species pairs as the proportion of all exposures of an antibiotic experienced by a species for conditions in which that species was not the causative pathogen (\\\"proportion of bystander exposures\\\"). For outpatient prescribing in the United States, we find that this proportion over all included antibiotics is over 80% for 8 out of 9 organisms of interest. Low proportions of bystander exposure are often associated with infrequent bacterial carriage or a high proportion of antibiotic prescribing focused on conditions caused by the species of interest. Using the proportion of bystander exposures, we roughly estimate that S. aureus and E. coli may benefit from 90.7% and 99.7%, respectively, of the estimated reduction in antibiotic use due to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, despite not being the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. These results underscore the importance of considering antibiotic exposures to bystanders, in addition to the targeted pathogen, in measuring the impact of antibiotic resistance interventions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe forces that contribute to changing population prevalence of antibiotic resistance are not well understood. Bystander selection -- the inadvertent pressures imposed by antibiotics on the microbial flora other than the pathogen targeted by treatment -- is hypothesized to be a major factor in the propagation of antibiotic resistance, but its extent has not been characterized. We estimate the proportion of bystander exposures across a range of antibiotics and organisms and describe factors driving variability of these proportions. Impact estimates for antibiotic resistance interventions, including vaccination, are often limited to effects on a target pathogen. However, the reduction of antibiotic treatment for illnesses caused by the target pathogen may have the broader potential to decrease bystander selection pressures for resistance on many other organisms.",

Indeed, de novo reconstruction of signaling interactions from large-scale molecular profiling is still lagging, compared to similar efforts in transcriptional and protein-protein interaction networks. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm for the systematic inference of protein kinase pathways, and applied it to published mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine profile data from 250 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. The resulting network includes 43 TKs and 415 inferred, LUAD-specific substrates, which were validated at >60% accuracy by SILAC assays, including \\\"novel substrates of the EGFR and c-MET TKs, which play a critical oncogenic role in lung cancer. This systematic, data-driven model supported drug response prediction on an individual sample basis, including accurate prediction and validation of synergistic EGFR and c-MET inhibitor activity in cells lacking mutations in either gene, thus contributing to current precision oncology efforts.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, most genes are encoded on the leading strand, co-orienting the movement of the replication machinery with RNA polymerases. This co-orientation bias reduces the frequency of highly detrimental head-on collisions between the two machineries. This and other work set up the expectation that over evolutionary time, head-on alleles are selected against, maximizing genome co-orientation. Our findings challenge this model. Using the well-established GC skew method, we reveal the evolutionary inversion record of all chromosomally encoded genes in multiple divergent bacterial pathogens. We find that a surprisingly large number of co-oriented genes have inverted to, and are retained in the head-on orientation. Furthermore, we find that these head-on genes, (including key antibiotic resistance and virulence genes) have higher rates of nonsynonymous mutations and are more frequently under positive selection (dN/dS>1). Based on these results, we propose that bacteria increase their evolvability through gene inversion and promotion of head-on replication-transcription collisions.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on sequential detection and localization of individual molecular blinking events. Due to the stochasticity of single-molecule blinking and the desire to improve SMLMs temporal resolution, algorithms capable of analyzing frames with a high density (HD) of active molecules, or molecules whose images overlap, are a prerequisite for accurate location measurements. Thus far, HD algorithms are evaluated using scalar metrics, such as root-mean-square error, that fail to quantify the structure of errors caused by the structure of the sample. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of localization errors within super-resolved images of biological structures are vectorial in nature, leading to systematic structural biases that severely degrade image resolution. We further demonstrate that the shape of the microscopes point-spread function (PSF) fundamentally affects the characteristics of imaging artifacts. We built a Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE) to minimize these biases for arbitrary structures and PSFs. RoSE accomplishes this minimization by estimating the likelihood of blinking events to localize molecules more accurately and eliminate false localizations. Using RoSE, we measure the distance between crossing microtubules, quantify the morphology of and separation between vesicles, and obtain robust recovery using diverse 3D PSFs with unmatched accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Limiting CcrM to a specific time period during the cell cycle relies on temporal control of ccrM transcription and CcrM proteolysis. We investigated how Lon, a protease from AAA+ superfamily conserved from bacteria to humans, temporally degrades CcrM to maintain differential chromosomal methylation state, thereby regulating transcription factor synthesis and enabling cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that CcrM degradation by Lon requires DNA as an adaptor for robust proteolysis. Lon, a DNA-bound protein, is constitutively active throughout the cell cycle, but allows CcrM mediated DNA methylation only when CcrM is transcribed and translated upon completion of DNA replication. An additional mechanism to limit CcrM activity to a narrow window of the cell cycle is its sequestration to the pole of the progeny stalked cell, which prevents physical contact with DNA-bound Lon. Thus, we have provided evidence for a novel mechanism for substrate selection by the Lon protease, providing robust cell cycle control mediated by DNA methylation.",

Structural analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies inform on substrate binding, specificity, and modulation of the AgcS family and reveal key structural features that allow this transporter to accommodate glycine and alanine while excluding all other amino acids. Mutation of key residues in the substrate binding site expand the selectivity to include valine and leucine. Moreover, as a transporter that binds both enantiomers of alanine, the present structures provide an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the mechanism of stereo-selectivity in APC transporters.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic selection (GS) can increase genetic gain by reducing the length of breeding cycle in forest trees. Here we genotyped 1370 control-pollinated progeny trees from 128 full-sib families in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), using exome capture as a genotyping platform. We used 116,765 high quality SNPs to develop genomic prediction models for tree height and wood quality traits. We assessed the impact of different genomic prediction methods, genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE), genetic composition, size of the training and validation set, relatedness, and the number of SNPs on the accuracy and predictive ability (PA) of GS.\\n\\nResultsUsing G matrix slightly altered heritability estimates relative to pedigree-based method. GS accuracies were about 11-14% lower than those based on pedigree-based selection. The efficiency of GS per year varied from 1.71 to 1.78, compared to that of the pedigree-based model if breeding cycle length was halved using GS. Height GS accuracy decreased more than 30% using one site as training for GS prediction to the second site, indicating that GxE for tree height should be accommodated in model fitting. Using half-sib family structure instead of full-sib led a significant reduction in GS accuracy and PA. The full-sib family structure only needed 750 makers to reach similar accuracy and PA as 100,000 markers required for half-sib family, indicating that maintaining the high relatedness in the model improves accuracy and PA. Using 4000-8000 markers in full-sib family structure was sufficient to obtain GS model accuracy and PA for tree height and wood quality traits, almost equivalent to that obtained with all makers.\\n\\nConclusionsThe study indicates GS would be efficient in reducing generation time of a breeding cycle in conifer tree breeding program that requires a long-term progeny testing. Sufficient number of trees within-family (16 for growth and 12 for wood quality traits) and number of SNPs (8000) are required for GS with full-sib family relationship. GS methods had little impact on GS efficiency for growth and wood quality traits. GS model should incorporate G x E effect when a strong GxE is detected.",

The presence of this general class of behavior is extremely widespread, even though the olfactory sensory apparatus and strategies used may vary between animals. The strategies and cues used by mammals to localize and track odor sources have recently become of interest to neuroscientists, but are still poorly understand. In order to study how mice localize odors, we trained mice to perform a trail following task using a novel behavioral paradigm and behavioral monitoring setup. We find that mice, in order to follow an odor trail, use both sniff by sniff odor concentration comparisons and internares comparisons to guide their behavior. Furthermore, they employ olfactory information to guide adaptive behaviors with remarkably short latencies of approximately 80ms. This study and its findings establish a rich, quantifiable olfactory localization behavior in mice that is amenable to physiological investigations and motivates investigation into the neural substrates of the identified olfactory cues.\\n\\nSignificanceMany animals, like rodents, rely heavily on their sense smell to guide them as they navigate their environment, to find food and mates and to avoid predators. Yet, in mammals, this function of the olfactory system is much less well studied than odor identification. We created a behavioral task where mice had to follow odor trails in order to efficiently find food and then tracked their movements around those trails. We found that they respond to sniff-by-sniff changes in odor intensity, using those changes to guide movements in less than one tenth of a second and also confirm that they use stereo cues to guide behavior.

While there is a long history of research into thought control, the inherent subjectivity of thoughts has made objective investigation, and thus mechanistic understanding difficult. Here, we report a novel method to empirically investigate thought control success and failure by objectively measuring the sensory strength of visual thoughts. We use the perceptual illusion binocular rivalry to assess emergent images in mind during two common thought control strategies: thought suppression and thought substitution. Thought suppression was ineffective, suppressed thoughts primed subsequent rivalry dominance at the same level as intentionally imagined thoughts. This priming effect was disrupted by concurrent uniform luminance and changes in retinotopic location, suggesting early visual representations/traces. While individuals showed some metacognition of thought suppression, strikingly, the perceptual effects remained even when thoughts were reported as successfully suppressed, indicating these thoughts may exist outside of reportable awareness. In contrast, thought substitution was more effective in controlling the perceptual effects and showed good metacognition. A thought control index predicted greater levels of trait mindfulness, while high levels of anxiety and schizotypy were related to poor thought control. Overall, our findings offer a novel method to track thoughts before and after they emerge into awareness and suggest that non-reportable and involuntary thoughts form visual representations pivotal to thought control failure.",

    "abstract": "The solvent-excluded surface (SES1) of a molecule is an important geometrical property relevant to its solvation in aqueous solution and its interactions with other molecules. In this paper we present an accurate and robust analytic algorithm suitable for a large-scale SES analysis. The accuracy and robustness of our algorithm are made possible by an iterative strategy for the treatments of probe-probe intersections, probe-probe overlaps and limited numerical precision. The accuracy and robustness of our algorithm in turn make it possible to analyze on a large-scale the SESs for different types of proteins and various sets of ligand-protein interaction interfaces. The results illustrate the usefulness of SES and SES-defined physical and geometrical properties for the characterization of protein-solvent interaction and ligand-protein interaction where ligand could be either small molecule compound, or membrane lipid, or DNA or protein.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCurrent genotyping approaches for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) rely on short, relatively accurate reads from second generation sequencing devices. Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which makes them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped. Further, we are able to use both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data to independently validate millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.",

Although actin filament elongation has been extensively studied under the past decades, the mechanism of filament nucleation remains unclear. Here, we immobilized gelsolin, a pointed-end nucleator, at the bottom of zero-mode waveguides to directly monitor the early steps of filament assembly. Our data revealed extensive dynamics and that only one, of two populations, elongates. Annalysis of the kinetics revealed a more stable trimer but a less stable tetramer in the elongating population compared to the non-elongating one. Furthermore, blocking flattening, the conformational change associated with filament formation, prevented the formation of both types of assemblies.

However, the cellular contributors and ways in which cells interact inside tissues to enable coordinated isotropic tissue scaling are not yet understood. Here, we follow cell and tissue shape changes in the zebrafish retinal neuroepithelium, which forms a cup with a smooth surface early in development and maintains this architecture as it grows. By combining 3D analysis and theory, we show that a global increase in cell height is necessary to maintain this tissue shape during growth. Timely cell height increase is governed by non-cell autonomous actin redistribution. Blocking actin redistribution and cell height increase perturbs isotropic scaling and leads to disturbed, folded tissue shape. Taken together, our data show how global changes in cell shape enable isotropic growth of the developing retinal neuroepithelium, a concept that could also apply to other systems.",

    "abstract": "Groups of proximate continental islands may conceal more tangled phylogeographic patterns than oceanic archipelagos as a consequence of repeated sea level changes, which allow populations to experience gene flow during periods of low sea level stands and isolation by vicariant mechanisms during periods of high sea level stands. Here, we describe for the first time an ancient and diverging lineage of the Italian wall lizard Podarcis siculus from the western Pontine Islands. We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of 156 individuals with the aim of unraveling their phylogenetic position, while microsatellite loci were used to compare several a priori insular biogeographic models of migration with empirical data. Our results suggest that the western Pontine populations colonized the islands early during their Pliocene volcanic formation, while populations from the eastern Pontine Islands seem to have been introduced recently. The inter-island genetic makeup indicates an important role of historical migration, probably due to glacial land bridges connecting islands followed by a recent vicariant mechanism of isolation. Moreover, the most supported migration model predicted higher gene flow among islands sharing a longitudinal arrangement. Considering the threatened status of small insular endemic populations, we suggest this new evolutionarily independent unit be given priority in conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "The way that humans and animals perceive the lightness of an object depends on its physical luminance as well as its surrounding context. While neuronal responses throughout the visual pathway are modulated by context, the relationship between neuronal responses and lightness perception is poorly understood. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness by recording responses of neuronal populations in monkey primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 to stimuli that produce a lightness illusion in humans, in which the lightness of a disk depends on the context in which it is embedded. We found that the way individual units encode the luminance (or equivalently for our stimuli, contrast) of the disk and its context is extremely heterogeneous. This motivated us to ask whether the population representation in either V1 or V4 satisfies three criteria: 1) disk luminance is represented with high fidelity, 2) the context surrounding the disk is also represented, and 3) the representations of disk luminance and context interact to create a representation of lightness that depends on these factors in a manner consistent with human psychophysical judgments of disk lightness. We found that populations of units in both V1 and V4 fulfill the first two criteria, but that we cannot conclude that the two types of information in either area interact in a manner that clearly predicts human psychophysical measurements: the interpretation of our population measurements depends on how subsequent areas read out lightness from the population responses.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyA core question in visual neuroscience is how the brain extracts stable representations of object properties from the retinal image. We searched for a neuronal mechanism of lightness perception by determining whether the responses of neuronal populations in primary visual cortex and area V4 could account for a lightness illusion measured using human psychophysics. Our results suggest that comparing psychophysics with population recordings will yield insight into neuronal mechanisms underlying a variety of perceptual phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Two-generations pedigree involving 524 plus trees and their open-pollinated (OP) progenies were jointly studied to estimate parent-progeny correlation and heritability. Three wood traits (wood density, MFA, and MOE) were determined by SilviS-can in one ramet per plus tree and 12 OP progenies. Three ramets per plus tree and 12 OP were also measured with two indirect methods, Pilodyn and Hitman. The overall correlation between OP-based breeding values and plus tree-based phenotypes was low to moderate for all traits. The correlations between the phenotypic values of the mother trees and the breeding values estimated on their half-sib pro-genies are low to moderate. Reasons for this may be experimental errors in progeny trials and lack of experimental design in archives, contributing to the parent and progeny correlation. The management practices in the archive may contribute more to such low correlation. Offspring progeny heritability estimates based on SilviScan measurements were higher than parent-offspring regression using one single ramet from the archive. Moreover, when three ramets were measured the parent-offspring regression heritability estimates were higher than those based solely on progeny data for the Pilodyn and Hitman on the standing trees. The standard error of the heritability estimates decreased with increasing progeny size.",

This bias is like that seen in experimentally determined highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumanii, but quite different from that seen in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26:74 AAA:AAG). Here we show that, paradoxically, shifting the AAA:AAG lysine codon bias to 8:92 in blaIMP-1 expressed from a natural promoter results in significantly more IMP-1 production in all three species. Sequential site directed mutagenesis revealed that increased IMP-1 production occurs following removal of an AAA,AAA double lysine codon and that otherwise, lysine codon usage had no observable impact on IMP-1 production. We conclude that ribosomal slippage at this poly-adenosine region reduces efficient translation of IMP-1 and that punctuating the region with guanine reduces ribosomal slippage and increases IMP-1 production.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal transmitters are released from nerve terminals via the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Vesicles become attached to the membrane via the SNARE complex. The SNARE complex comprises the vesicle associate protein Synaptobrevin (Syb), the membrane associated protein syntaxin (Syx), and the cytosolic protein SNAP25, which together form a four-helical bundle. The full assembly of Syb onto the core SNARE bundle promotes vesicle fusion. We investigated SNARE assembly using a coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex. The model retains chemical specificity, and was calibrated using single molecule experiments and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Steered force-control simulations of SNARE unzippering by peeling off Syb were used to set up initial disassembled states of the SNARE complex. From these states, the assembly process was simulated. We found that if Syb is in helical form, then the SNARE complex assembles rapidly, on a sub-microsecond time-scale. We found that assembly times grow exponentially with separation distance between Syb and Syx C-termni. The formation of helical turns is likely to substantially decelerate the assembly, consistent with single molecule force experiments that show SNARE assembly duration on the time-scale of hundreds of ms. Since synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at a sub-millisecond time-scale, our results indicate that for biologically relevant rapid assembly the SNARE complex needs to be partially zippered and its constituent helices brought into proximity, possibly by means of molecular chaperones.",

Such predictors may be more accurate than the self-reported phenotypes, and could have clinical applications.

Using an independent test cohort comprising 906 individuals, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained in each trait was examined for DNAm-based and genetic predictors. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated to investigate the predictive performance of DNAm-based predictors, using dichotomised phenotypes. The relationship between DNAm scores and all-cause mortality (n = 214 events) was assessed via Cox proportional-hazards models.\\n\\nResultsThe DNAm-based predictors explained different proportions of the phenotypic variance for BMI (12%), smoking (60%), alcohol consumption (12%) and education (3%). The combined genetic and DNAm predictors explained 20% of the variance in BMI, 61% in smoking, 13% in alcohol consumption, and 6% in education. DNAm predictors for smoking, alcohol, and education but not BMI predicted mortality in univariate models. The predictors showed moderate discrimination of obesity (AUC=0.67) and alcohol consumption (AUC=0.75), and excellent discrimination of current smoking status (AUC=0.98). There was poorer discrimination of college-educated individuals (AUC=0.59).\\n\\nConclusionsDNAm predictors correlate with lifestyle factors that are associated with health and mortality.

    "abstract": "MotivationIn biology, we are often faced with multiple datasets recorded on the same set of objects, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data of the same tumors. These datasets are typically not independent from each other. For example, methylation may influence gene expression, which may, in turn, influence drug response. Such relationships can strongly affect analyses performed on the data, as we have previously shown for the identification of biomarkers of drug response. Therefore, it is important to be able to chart the relationships between datasets.\\n\\nResultsWe present iTOP, a methodology to infera topology of relationships between datasets. We base this methodology on the RV coefficient, a measure of matrix correlation, which can be used to determine how much information is shared between two datasets. We extended the RV coefficient for partial matrix correlations, which allows the use of graph reconstruction algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, to infer the topologies. In addition, since multi-omics data often contain binary data (e.g. mutations), we also extended the RV coefficient for binary data. Applying iTOP to pharmacogenomics data, we found that gene expression acts as a mediator between most other datasets and drug response: only proteomics clearly shares information with drug response that is not present in gene expression. Based on this result, we used TANDEM, a method for drug response prediction, to identify which variables predictive of drug response were distinct to either gene expression or proteomics.\\n\\nAvailabilityAn implementation of our methodology is available in the R package iTOP on CRAN.

    "abstract": "To maintain genome integrity, segmented double-stranded RNA viruses of the Reoviridae family must accurately select and package a complete set of up to a dozen distinct genomic RNAs. It is thought that the high fidelity segmented genome assembly involves multiple sequence-specific RNA-RNA interactions between single-stranded RNA segment precursors. These are mediated by virus-encoded non-structural proteins with RNA chaperone-like activities, such as rotavirus NSP2 and avian reovirus {sigma}NS. Here, we compared the abilities of NSP2 and {sigma}NS to mediate sequence-specific interactions between rotavirus genomic segment precursors. Despite their similar activities, NSP2 successfully promotes inter-segment association, while {sigma}NS fails to do so. To understand the mechanisms underlying such selectivity in promoting inter-molecular duplex formation, we compared RNA-binding and helix-unwinding activities of both proteins. We demonstrate that octameric NSP2 binds structured RNAs with high affinity, resulting in efficient intramolecular RNA helix disruption. Hexameric {sigma}NS oligomerises into an octamer that binds two RNAs, yet it exhibits only limited RNA-unwinding activity compared to NSP2. Thus, the formation of intersegment RNA-RNA interactions is governed by both helix-unwinding capacity of the chaperones and stability of RNA structure. We propose that this protein-mediated RNA selection mechanism may underpin the high fidelity assembly of multi-segmented RNA genomes in Reoviridae.",

    "abstract": "Recently many cellular functions have been associated with membraneless organelles, or protein droplets, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Proteins in these droplets often contain RNA-binding domains, but the effects of RNA on LLPS have been controversial. To gain better understanding on the roles of RNA, here we used Gibbs-ensemble simulations to determine phase diagrams of two-component patchy particles, as models for mixtures of proteins with RNA or other regulatory components. Protein-like particles have four patches, with attraction strength{varepsilon} PP; regulatory particles experience mutual steric repulsion but have two attractive patches toward proteins, with the strength{varepsilon} PR tunable. At low{varepsilon} PR, the regulator, due to steric repulsion, preferentially partitions in the dispersed phase, thereby displacing the protein into the droplet phase and promoting LLPS. At moderate{varepsilon} PR, the regulator starts to partition and displace the protein in the droplet phase, but only to weaken bonding networks and thereby suppress LLPS. At{varepsilon} PR >{varepsilon} PP, the enhanced bonding ability of the regulator initially promotes LLPS, but at higher amounts, the resulting displacement of the protein suppresses LLPS. These results illustrate how RNA can have disparate effects on LLPS, thus able to perform diverse functions in different organelles.",

The moving particles are interpreted as clusters of cancer cells while stationary particles correspond to micro-tumors and metastases. The analysis of expected particle location, their locational variance, the furthest particle distribution, and the extinction probability leads to a common type of differential equation, namely, a non-local integro-differential equation with distributed delay. We prove global existence and uniqueness results for this type of equation. The solutions asymptotic behavior for long time is characterized by an explicit index, a metastatic reproduction number R0: metastases spread for R0 > 1 and become extinct for R0 < 1.

    "abstract": "BRCA proteins are essential for Homologous Recombination DNA repair, and their germline or somatic inactivation is frequently observed in human tumors. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to chemotherapy of BRCA-deficient tumors is paramount for developing improved personalized cancer therapies. While PARP inhibitors have been recently approved for treatment of BRCA-mutant breast and ovarian cancers, resistance to these novel drugs remains a major clinical problem. Several mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient cells have been identified. Rather than restoring normal recombination, these mechanisms result in stabilization of stalled replication forks, which normally are subjected to degradation in BRCA2-mutated cells. Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor E2F7 controls chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient cells. We found that E2F7 depletion restores PARP inhibitor and cisplatin resistance in BRCA2-depleted cells. Moreover, we show that the mechanism underlying this activity involves increased expression of RAD51, a target for E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression, which enhances both Homologous Recombination DNA repair, and replication fork stability in BRCA2-deficient cells. Our work describes a new mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in BRCA2-deficient cells, and identifies E2F7 as a novel biomarker for tumor response to PARP inhibitor therapy.",

We demonstrated that CD9 is specifically trapped within the nascent viral particles, especially at buds tips, and that Gag mediate CD9 and CD81 depletion from cellular surfaces, even in the absence of Vpu and Nef, resulting from tetraspanins escaping from the plasma membrane during HIV-1 release. In addition, we showed that CD9 is organized as small membrane assemblies of few tens of nanometers that can coalesce upon Gag expression.

Our results indicate that this robust tracking in older adults does not arise merely from having the same responses as younger adults but with larger amplitudes; instead they recruit additional regions, inferior to core auditory cortex, as part of an early response peak at ~ 30 ms relative to the acoustic signal.",

The participants also completed self-report measures of pleasure experience. Using a voxel-wise heritability mapping method, activation of the bilateral NAcc during the anticipation of monetary gains was found to have significant heritability (h2 = 0.20-0.49). Moreover, significant shared genetic covariance was observed between pleasure experience and NAcc activation when anticipating monetary gain.

These compounds have important roles in plant defense and potential commercial applications. However, several acylsugar metabolic genes remain unidentified, and little is known about regulation of this pathway. We used comparative transcriptomic analysis between low- and high-acylsugar-producing accessions of Solanum pennellii and found that expression levels of most acylsugar metabolic genes, including known acylsucrose biosynthetic genes and novel candidate genes (putatively encoding a ketoacyl-ACP synthase IV/II-like enzyme, peroxisomal acyl-activating enzymes, ABC transporters, and central carbon metabolic enzymes), were positively correlated with acylsugar accumulation, except two acylglucose biosynthetic genes. Genes putatively encoding oxylipin metabolic proteins, subtilisin-like proteases, and other antimicrobial defense proteins were upregulated in low-acylsugar-producing accessions, possibly to compensate for diminished defense activities of acylsugars. Gene co-expression network analysis clustered most differentially expressed genes into two separate modules and identified genetic networks associated with acylsugar production and plant defense. Transcriptome analysis after inhibition of biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (precursors to branched-chain fatty acids) further supported the coordinated regulation of most acylsugar candidate genes and identified three putative AP2-family transcription factor genes that form a strong co-expression network with many acylsugar metabolic genes.",

During last forty years PPI interfaces have been investigated extensively both in vitro and in silico in order to understand both the strength and specificity of PPI. At least three different models, the buried surface model, the O-ring model and the rim- and-core model, have been proposed for PPI interface. However none of them provide much detail about PPI and a single model that reconciles them remains elusive. To identify common physical and geometrical features shared by various PPI interfaces we have analyzed several solvent-excluded surface (SES)-defined properties for a set of well-studied protein-protein complexes with crystal structures. Our analysis shows that the SES-defined properties for the interface atoms of a PPI partner are in general different from those for the surface atoms of a water-soluble protein. Most significantly we find that the partially-buried atoms of a PPI partner have unique SES-defined properties that set them well apart from either the buried atoms or the accessible atoms. Based on distinct SES-defined properties for the accessible, buried and partially-buried atoms shared by various PPI interfaces we propose a new model specified by a list of SES-defined properties shared by various PPI interfaces. Our model is quantitative in nature and should be useful for PPI site identification, protein-protein docking and structure-based design of chemicals targeting PPI.",

Here, we show that the membrane-associated sensory input domain of PA1396 has five trans-membrane helices, two of which are required for DSF sensing. DSF binding is associated with enhanced auto-phosphorylation of PA1396 incorporated into liposomes. Further, we examined the ability of synthetic DSF analogues to modulate or inhibit PA1396 activity. Several of these analogues block the ability of DSF to trigger auto-phosphorylation and gene expression, whereas others act as inverse agonists reducing biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance, both in vitro and in murine infection models. These analogues may thus represent lead compounds for novel adjuvants to improve the efficacy of existing antibiotics.",

Importantly, there is a correlation between the composition of the gut microbiome and weight gain in the honey bee, suggesting that bacterial production of organic acids might contribute to the observed phenomenon. Here we identify potential metabolic contributions of symbionts within the honey bee gut. We show significant variation in the metabolic capabilities of these microbes, highlighting the fact that although the microbiota appears simple and consistent based on 16S rRNA gene profiling, strains are highly variable in their ability to use specific carbohydrates and produce organic acids. Finally, we confirm that the honey bee core microbes, especially a clade of {gamma}-proteobacteria (i.e. Gilliamella), are highly active in vivo, expressing key enzymatic genes critical for utilizing plant-derived molecules and producing organic acids. These results suggest that Gilliamella, and other core taxa, may contribute significantly to weight gain in the honey bee, specifically through the production of organic acids.",

    "abstract": "The tuning properties of neurons in a given brain region have been traditionally viewed as the under-pinnings of computation in neural circuits. However, at the higher levels of processing, specialization is often elusive, instead a mix of sensory, cognitive and behavioural quantities drive neural activity. In such networks, ensembles of neurons, rather than single units with easily interpretable tuning properties, encode behaviourally relevant variables. Here we show that this is the case also in the dentate gyrus and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we decoded the instantaneous position, direction of motion and speed from the activity of hundreds of cells in the hippocampus of mice freely exploring an arena. For the vast majority of neurons in both regions, their response properties were not predictive of their importance for encoding position. Furthermore, we could decode position from populations of cells that were important for decoding direction of motion and vice versa, showing that these quantities are encoded by largely overlapping ensembles as in distributed neural code. Finally, we found that correlated activities had an impact on decoding performance in CA1 but not in dentate gyrus, suggesting different enconding strategies for these areas. Our analysis indicates that classical methods of analysis based on single cell response properties might be insufficient to accurately characterize the neural computation in a given area. In contrast, population analysis may help highlight previously overlooked properties of hippocampal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Manual and saccadic reaction times (SRTs) have been used to determine the minimum time required for different types of visual categorizations. Such studies have demonstrated that faces can be detected within natural scenes within as little as 100ms (Crouzet, Kirchner & Thorpe, 2010), while increasingly complex decisions require longer processing times (Besson, Barragan-Jason, Thorpe, Fabre-Thorpe, Puma et al., 2017). Following the notion that facial representations stored in memory facilitate perceptual processing (Ramon & Gobbini, 2018), a recent study reported 180ms as the fastest speed at which \\\"familiar face detection\\\" based on expressed choice saccades (Visconti di Ollegio Castello & Gobbini, 2015). At first glance, these findings seem incompatible with the earliest neural markers of familiarity reported in electrophysiological studies (Barragan-Jason, Cauchoix & Barbeau, 2015; Caharel, Ramon & Rossion, 2014; Huang, Wu, Hu, Wang, Ding & Qu et al., 2017), which should temporally precede any overtly observed behavioral (oculomotor or manual) categorization. Here, we reason that this apparent discrepancy could be accounted for in terms of decisional space constraints, which modulate both manual RTs observed for different levels of visual processing (Besson et al., 2017), as well as saccadic RTs (SRTs) in both healthy observers and neurological patients (Ramon, in press; Ramon, Sokhn, Lao & Caldara, in press). In the present study, over 70 observers completed three different SRT experiments in which decisional space was manipulated through task demands and stimulus probability. Subjects performed a gender categorization task, or one of two familiar face \\\"recognition\\\" tasks, which differed with respect to the number of personally familiar identities presented (3 vs. 7). We observe an inverse relationship between visual categorization proficiency and decisional space. Observers were most accurate for categorization of gender, which could be achieved in as little as 140ms. Categorization of highly predictable targets was more error-prone and required an additional ~100ms processing time. Our findings add to increasing evidence that pre-activation of identity-information can modulate early visual processing in a top-down manner. They also emphasize the importance of considering procedural aspects as well as terminology when aiming to characterize cognitive processes.",

These same factors, though, must be overcome by all retroviruses, including HIV-1 and other primate immunodeficiency viruses, in order to activate provirus transcription and produce new virus. Here we show that Vpx and Vpr, proteins from a wide range of primate immunodeficiency viruses, activate provirus transcription in human CD4+ T cells. Provirus activation required the DCAF1 adaptor that links Vpx and Vpr to the CUL4A/B ubiquitin ligase complex, but did not require degradation of SAMHD1, a well-characterized target of Vpx and Vpr. A loss-of-function screen for transcription silencing factors that mimic the effect of Vpx on provirus silencing identified all components of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, FAM208A (TASOR/RAP140), MPHOSPH8 (MPP8), PPHLN1 (PERIPHILIN), and MORC2. Vpx associated with the HUSH complex components and decreased steady-state levels of these proteins in a DCAF-dependent manner. Finally, vpx and FAM208A knockdown accelerated HIV-1 and SIVMAC replication kinetics in CD4+ T cells to a similar extent, and HIV-2 replication required either vpx or FAM208A disruption. These results demonstrate that the HUSH complex restricts transcription of primate immunodeficiency viruses and thereby contributes to provirus latency. To counteract this restriction and activate provirus expression, primate immunodeficiency viruses encode Vpx and Vpr proteins that degrade HUSH complex components.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases among children in Western countries. Earlier metabolomics studies suggest that T1D is preceded by dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Here we used a lipidomics approach to analyze molecular lipids in a prospective series of 428 plasma samples from 40 children who progressed to T1D (PT1D), 40 children who developed at least a single islet autoantibody but did not progress to T1D during the follow-up (P1Ab) and 40 matched controls (CTR). Sphingomyelins were found to be persistently downregulated in PT1D when compared to the P1Ab and CTR groups. Triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines were mainly downregulated in PT1D as compared to P1Ab at the age of 3 months. Our study suggests that children who progressed to islet autoimmunity or overt T1D are characterized by distinct lipidomic signatures, which may be helpful in the identification of at-risk children before the initiation of autoimmunity.",

PinMol takes into account the accessibility of the targeted regions, as well as the inter- and intramolecular interactions of each selected probe. To demonstrate its applicability, we synthesized an oskar mRNA-specific molecular beacon (osk1236), which is selected by PinMol to target a more accessible region than a manually designed oskar-specific molecular beacon (osk2216).

While much is known about how Piezo1 responds to external forces, its response to internal, cell-generated forces remains poorly understood. Here, using measurements of endogenous Piezo1 activity and traction forces in native cellular conditions, we show that actomyosin-based cellular traction forces generate spatially-restricted Ca2+ flickers in the absence of externally-applied mechanical forces. Although Piezo1 channels diffuse readily in the plasma membrane and are widely distributed across the cell, their flicker activity is enriched in regions proximal to force-producing adhesions. The mechanical force that activates Piezo1 arises from Myosin II phosphorylation by Myosin Light Chain Kinase. We propose that Piezo1 Ca2+ flickers allow spatial segregation of mechanotransduction events, and that diffusion allows channel molecules to efficiently respond to transient, local mechanical stimuli.",

Here, we quantify the fitness effects of altering expression noise for the TDH3 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that increases in expression noise can be deleterious or beneficial depending on the difference between the average expression level of a genotype and the expression level maximizing fitness. We also show that a simple model relating single-cell expression levels to population growth produces patterns that are consistent with our empirical data. We use this model to explore a broad range of average expression levels and expression noise, providing additional insight into the fitness effects of variation in expression noise.",

The cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol-hand association and a novel symbol-hand association although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the hand making the movement, the monkeys reaction times or the novelty of the visual symbols.

    "abstract": "Microbial mats formed by Cyanobacteria of the genus Phormidium produce the neurotoxin anatoxin-a that has been linked to animal deaths. Blooms of planktonic Cyanobacteria have long been of concern in lakes, but recognition of potential harmful impacts of riverine benthic cyanobacterial mats is more recent. Consequently little is known about the diversity of the biosynthetic capacities of cyanobacterial species and associated microbes in mats throughout river networks. Here we performed metagenomic sequencing for 22 Phormidium-dominated microbial mats collected across the Eel River network in Northern California to investigate cyanobacterial and co-occurring microbial assemblage diversity, probe their metabolic potential and evaluate their capacities for toxin production. We genomically defined four Cyanobacterial species clusters that occur throughout the river network, three of which have not been described previously. From the genomes of seven strains from one species group we describe the first anatoxin-a operon from the genus Phormidium. Community composition within the mat appears to be associated with the presence of Cyanobacteria capable of producing anatoxin-a. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and novel Verrucomicrobia dominated the microbial assemblages. Interestingly, some mats also contained organisms from candidate phyla such as Canditatus Kapabacteria, as well as Absconditabacteria (SR1), Parcubacteria (OD1) and Peregrinibacteria (PER) within the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon respiration were the most common metabolisms detected in mats but other metabolic capacities include aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, sulfur compound oxidation and breakdown of urea. The results reveal the diversity of metabolisms fueling the growth of mats, and a relationship between microbial assemblage composition and the distribution of anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria within freshwater Phormidium mats in river networks.",

Here we introduce BARseq, a multiplexed method based on RNA barcoding for mapping projections of thousands of spatially resolved neurons in a single brain, and relating those projections to other properties such as gene or Cre expression. Mapping the projections to 11 areas of 3579 neurons in mouse auditory cortex using BARseq confirmed the laminar organization of the three top classes (IT, PT-like and CT) of projection neurons. In depth analysis uncovered a novel projection type restricted almost exclusively to transcriptionally-defined subtypes of IT neurons. By bridging anatomical and transcriptomic approaches at cellular resolution with high throughput, BARseq can potentially uncover the organizing principles underlying the structure and formation of neural circuits.",

While its essentiality is undisputed in metazoa, its role in model simpler eukaryotes seems less clear. Here we dissect the role of AP-1 in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans and show that it is absolutely essential for growth due to its role in clathrin-dependent maintenance of polar traffic of specific membrane cargoes towards the apex of growing hyphae. We provide evidence that AP-1 is involved in both anterograde sorting of RabERab11-labeled secretory vesicles and RabA/BRab5- dependent endosome recycling. Additionally, AP-1 is shown to be critical for microtubule and septin organization, further rationalizing its essentiality in cells that face the challenge of cytoskeleton-dependent polarized cargo traffic. This work also opens a novel issue on how non-polar cargoes, such as transporters, are sorted to the eukaryotic plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence, the irreversible ceasing of cell division, has been associated with organismal aging, prevention of cancerogenesis, and developmental processes. As such, the evolutionary basis and biological features of cellular senescence remain a fascinating area of research. In this study, we conducted comparative RNAseq experiments to detect genes associated with replicative senescence in two different human cell lines and at different time points. We identified 841 and 900 genes (core senescence-associated genes) that are significantly up- and downregulated in senescent cells, respectively, in both cell lines. Our functional enrichment analysis showed that downregulated core genes are primarily involved in cell cycle processes while upregulated core gene enrichment indicated various lipid-related processes. We further demonstrated that downregulated genes are significantly more conserved than upregulated genes. Using both transcriptomics and genetic variation data, we identified one of the upregulated, lipid metabolism gene, CD36 as an outlier. We found that overexpression of CD36 induces a senescence-like phenotype and, further, the media of CD36-overexpressing cells alone can induce a senescence-like phenotype in proliferating young cells. Moreover, we used a targeted lipidomics approach and showed that phosphatidylcholines accumulate during senescence in these cells, suggesting that upregulation of CD36 could contribute to membrane remodeling during senescence. Overall, these results contribute to the understanding of evolution and biology of cellular senescence and identify several targets and questions for future studies.",

We show that ACCuRET measures absolute distances and distance changes with high precision and accuracy using maltose binding protein as a benchmark. Using cell unroofing, we show that ACCuRET can accurately measure rearrangements of proteins in native membranes. Finally, we implement a computational method for correcting the measured distances for the distance distributions observed in proteins.

We applied anti-chicken TIM4 monoclonal antibodies, in combination with CSF1R reporter transgenes to dissect the function of TIM4 in chick (Gallus gallus). During development in ovo, TIM4 was present on the large majority of macrophages but expression became more heterogeneous post-hatch. Blood monocytes expressed KUL01, class II MHC and CSF1R-mApple uniformly. Around 50% of monocytes were positive for surface TIM4. They also expressed many other monocyte-specific transcripts at a higher level than TIM4- monocytes. In liver, highly-phagocytic TIM4hi cells shared many transcripts with mammalian Kupffer cells and were associated with uptake of apoptotic cells. Although they expressed CSF1R mRNA, Kupffer cells did not express the CSF1R-mApple transgene, suggesting that additional CSF1R transcriptional regulatory elements are required by these cells. By contrast, CSF1R-mApple was detected in liver TIM4lo and TIM4- cells which were not phagocytic and were more abundant than Kupffer cells. These cells expressed CSF1R, alongside high levels of FLT3, MHCII, XCR1 and other markers associated with conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in mice. In bursa, TIM4 was present on the cell surface of two populations. Like Kupffer cells, bursal TIM4hi phagocytes co-expressed many receptors involved in apoptotic cell recognition. TIM4lo cells appear to be a sub-population of bursal B cells. In overview, TIM4 is associated with phagocytes that eliminate apoptotic cells in the chick. In the liver, TIM4 and CSF1R reporters distinguished Kupffer cells from an abundant population of DC-like cells.",

However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are poorly defined. Using a murine breast tumor line, we tested how MHCII expression affected anti-tumor immunity.

Additionally, MHCII-expressing tumors contained more TCR clonotypes expanded to a larger degree than control tumors. Functional CD8+ T cells in tumors depended on CD4+ T cells. However, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells eventually became exhausted, even in MHCII-expressing tumors. PD1 blockade had no impact on tumor growth, potentially because tumor cells poorly expressed PD-L1. These results suggest tumor cell expression of MHCII facilitates the local activation of CD4+ T cells and indirectly helps the activation and expansion of CD8+ T cells, but by itself, cannot prevent T cell exhaustion.\\n\\nPrecisThe expression of MHCII on tumor cells augments CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, expands the TCR repertoire and delays exhaustion.

UNC-5 and another UNC-6/Netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC also regulate the extent of protrusion, with UNC-40/DCC driving protrusion and UNC-5 inhibiting protrusion. In this work we analyze the roles of UNC-6/Netrin, UNC-40/DCC, and UNC-5 in coordinating growth cone F-actin localization, microtubule organization, and protrusion that results in directed outgrowth away from UNC-6/Netrin. We find that a previously-described pathway involving the UNC-73/Trio Rac GEF and UNC-33/CRMP that acts downstream of UNC-5, regulates growth cone dorsal asymmetric F-actin accumulation and protrusion. unc-5 and unc-33 mutants also display excess EBP-2::GFP puncta, suggesting that MT + end accumulation is important in growth cone polarity and/or protrusion. unc-73 Rac GEF mutants did not display excess EBP-2::GFP puncta despite larger and more protrusive growth cones, indicating a MT-independent mechanism to polarize the growth cone and to inhibit protrusion, possibly via actin. Finally, we show that UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-40/DCC are required for excess protrusion in unc-5 mutants, but not for loss of F-actin asymmetry or MT + end accumulation, indicating that UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-40/DCC are required for protrusion downstream of F-actin asymmetry and MT + end entry. Our data suggest a model in which UNC-6/Netrin polarizes the growth cone via UNC-5, and then regulates a balance of pro- and anti-protrusive forces driven by UNC-40 and UNC-5, respectively, that result in directed protrusion and outgrowth.",
