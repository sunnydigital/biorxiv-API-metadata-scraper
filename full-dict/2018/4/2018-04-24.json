    "abstract": "Changes in environmental conditions can lead to rapid shifts in the state of an ecosystem (\\\"regime shifts\\\"), which, even after the environment has returned to previous conditions, subsequently recovers slowly to the previous state (\\\"hysteresis\\\"). Large spatial and temporal scales of dynamics, and the lack of frameworks linking observations to models, are challenges to understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to perturbations. The naturally-occurring microecosystem inside leaves of the northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) exhibits oligotrophic and eutrophic states that can be induced by adding insect prey. Here, we further develop a model for simulating these dynamics, parameterize it using data from a prey addition experiment and conduct a sensitivity analysis to identify critical zones within the parameter space. Simulations illustrate that the microecosystem model displays regime shifts and hysteresis. Parallel results were observed in the plant itself after experimental enrichment with prey. Decomposition rate of prey was the main driver of system dynamics, including the time the system remains in an anoxic state and the rate of return to an oxygenated state. Biological oxygen demand in fluenced the shape of the systems return trajectory. The combination of simulated results, sensitivity analysis and use of empirical results to parameterize the model more precisely demonstrates that the Sarracenia microecosystem model displays behaviors qualitatively similar to models of larger ecological systems.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) precisely characterize gene expression levels and dissect variation in expression associated with the state (technical or biological) and the type of the cell, which is averaged out in bulk measurements. Multiple and correlated sources contribute to gene expression variation in single cells, which makes their estimation difficult with the existing methods developed for bulk measurements (e.g., surrogate variable analysis (SVA)) that estimate orthogonal transformations of these sources. We developed iteratively adjusted surrogate variable analysis (IA-SVA) that can estimate hidden and correlated sources of variation by identifying a set of genes affected with each hidden factor in an iterative manner. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from human cells showed that IA-SVA could accurately capture hidden variation arising from technical (e.g., stacked doublet cells) or biological sources (e.g., cell type or cell-cycle stage). Furthermore, IA-SVA delivers a set of genes associated with the detected hidden source to be used in downstream data analyses. As a proof of concept, IA-SVA recapitulated known marker genes for islet cell subsets (e.g., alpha, beta), which improved the grouping of subsets into distinct clusters. Taken together, IA-SVA is an effective and novel method to dissect multiple and correlated sources of variation in scRNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic tests of adaptive evolution, which infer positive selection from an excess of nonsynonymous changes, assume that nucleotide substitutions occur singly and independently. But recent research has shown that multiple errors at adjacent sites often occur in single events during DNA replication. These multinucleotide mutations (MNMs) are overwhelmingly likely to be nonsynonymous. We therefore evaluated whether phylogenetic tests of adaptive evolution, such as the widely used branch-site test, might misinterpret sequence patterns produced by MNMs as false support for positive selection. We explored two genome-wide datasets comprising thousands of coding alignments - one from mammals and one from flies - and found that codons with multiple differences (CMDs) account for virtually all the support for lineage-specific positive selection inferred by the branch-site test. Simulations under genome-wide, empirically derived conditions without positive selection show that realistic rates of MNMs cause a strong and systematic bias in the branch-site and related tests; the bias is sufficient to produce false positive inferences approximately as often as the branch-site test infers positive selection from the empirical data. Our analysis indicates that genes may often be inferred to be under positive selection simply because they stochastically accumulated one or a few MNMs. Because these tests do not reliably distinguish sequence patterns produced by authentic positive selection from those caused by neutral fixation of MNMs, many published inferences of adaptive evolution using these techniques may therefore be artifacts of model violation caused by unincorporated neutral mutational processes. We develop an alternative model that incorporates MNMs and may be helpful in reducing this bias.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnalysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation. Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.fr/site/downloads/ Contact: florian.plaza-onate@inra.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf",

    "abstract": "Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and unbiasedness of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time in Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but models were increasingly inaccurate at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making requiring predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomization has developed into an established method for strengthening causal inference and estimating causal effects, largely due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies. However, genetic instruments remain controversial as pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene-environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in Mendelian randomization analyses.\\n\\nMethodsWe introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias, drawing upon developments in econometrics and epidemiology. If an instrument-covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of MRGxE is similar to conventional summary Mendelian randomization approaches, with a particular advantage of MRGxE being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument.\\n\\nResultsWe investigate the effect of BMI upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank and the GIANT consortium using a single instrument (a weighted allelic score). We find MRGxE produces findings in agreement with MR Egger regression in a two-sample summary MR setting, however, association estimates obtained across all methods differ considerably when excluding related participants or individuals of non-European ancestry. This could be a consequence of selection bias, though there is also potential for introducing bias by using a mixed ancestry population. Further, we assess the performance of MRGxE with respect to identifying and correcting for horizontal pleiotropy in a simulation setting, highlighting the utility of the approach even when the MRGxE assumptions are violated.\\n\\nConclusionsBy utilising instrument-covariate interactions within a linear regression framework, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic bias, provided the average magnitude of pleiotropy is constant across interaction covariate subgroups.\\n\\nO_TEXTBOXKey MessagesO_LIInstrument-covariate interactions can be used to identify pleiotropic bias in Mendelian randomization analyses, provided they induce sufficient variation in the association between the genetic instrument and exposure.\\nC_LIO_LIBy regressing the gene-outcome association upon the gene-exposure association across interaction covariate subgroups, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the average pleiotropic effect and a causal effect estimate.\\nC_LIO_LIThe interpretation of MRGxE is analogous to that of MR-Egger regression.\\nC_LIO_LIThe approach serves as a valuable test for directional pleiotropy and can be used to inform instrument selection.\\nC_LI\\n\\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly - producing large type I error rates - in the analysis of phenotypes with unbalanced case-control ratios. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the distribution of score test statistics. This method, SAIGE, provides accurate p-values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. It utilizes state-of-art optimization strategies to reduce computational time and memory cost of generalized mixed model. The computation cost linearly depends on sample size, and hence can be applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank data of 408,961 white British European-ancestry samples for >1400 binary phenotypes, we show that SAIGE can efficiently analyze large sample data, controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios and sample relatedness.",

Participants listen to a narrative during functional MRI describing an ambiguous social scenario, written such that some individuals would find it highly suspicious, while others less so. Using inter-subject correlation analysis, we identify several brain areas that are differentially synchronized during listening between participants with high- and low trait-level paranoia, including theory-of-mind regions. Follow-up analyses indicate that these regions are more active to mentalizing events in high-paranoia individuals. Analyzing participants speech as they freely recall the narrative reveals semantic and syntactic features that also scale with paranoia.

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 (Na-1) and 2 (Na-2) are characterized by an inability to sustain wakefulness and are likely caused by degeneration of orexin neurons. Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood, but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To evaluate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin-A positive cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, six weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin-A positive cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss. Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wake-promotion develops in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 is poorly understood but has been hypothesized to be due, at least in part, to degeneration of a smaller proportion of the orexin neuronal field than occurs in narcolepsy type 1. To evaluate a transgenic mouse model of narcolepsy type 2, we correlated the sleep/wake phenotypes of individual, male and female adult mice that received diet-induced conditional ablations of orexin neurons with their orexin cell counts. Using a translatable measure of narcolepsy sleepiness severity, we demonstrated that compensatory wake-promoting responses developed in mice concurrent with progressive orexin neurodegeneration. These results provide important details necessary for preclinical drug discovery for therapeutic areas characterized by orexin insufficiency, such as narcolepsy, Parkinsons disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the brain controls behavior requires observing and manipulating neural activity in awake behaving animals. Neuronal firing is timed at millisecond precision. Therefore, to decipher temporal coding, it is necessary to monitor and control animal behavior at the same level of temporal accuracy. However, it is technically challenging to deliver sensory stimuli and reinforcers as well as to read the behavioral responses they elicit with millisecond precision. Presently available commercial systems often excel in specific aspects of behavior control, but they do not provide a customizable environment allowing flexible experimental design while maintaining high standards for temporal control necessary for interpreting neuronal activity. Moreover, delay measurements of stimulus and reinforcement delivery are largely unavailable. We combined microcontroller-based behavior control with a sound delivery system for playing complex acoustic stimuli, fast solenoid valves for precisely timed reinforcement delivery and a custom-built sound attenuated chamber using high-end industrial insulation materials. Together this setup provides a physical environment to train head-fixed animals, enables calibrated sound stimuli and precisely timed fluid and air puff presentation as reinforcers. We provide latency measurements for stimulus and reinforcement delivery and an algorithm to perform such measurements on other behavior control systems. Combined with electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulations, the millisecond timing accuracy will help interpret temporally precise neural signals and behavioral changes. Additionally, since software and hardware provided here can be readily customized to achieve a large variety of paradigms, these solutions enable an unusually flexible design of rodent behavioral experiments.",

    "abstract": "Observations of bacteria at the single-cell level have revealed many instances of phenotypic heterogeneity within otherwise clonal populations, but the selective causes, molecular bases and broader ecological relevance remain poorly understood. In an earlier experiment in which the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was propagated under a selective regime that mimicked the host immune response, a genotype evolved that stochastically switched between capsulation states. The genetic cause was a mutation in carB that decreased the pyrimidine pool (and growth rate), lowering the activation threshold of a pre-existing but hitherto unrecognised phenotypic switch. Genetic components surrounding bifurcation of UTP flux towards DNA/RNA or UDP-glucose (a precursor of colanic acid forming the capsules) were implicated as key components. Extending these molecular analyses - and based on a combination of genetics, transcriptomics, biochemistry and mathematical modelling - we show that pyrimidine limitation triggers an increase in ribosome biosynthesis and that switching is caused by competition between ribosomes and CsrA/RsmA proteins for the mRNA transcript of a feed-forward regulator of colanic acid biosynthesis. We additionally show that in the ancestral bacterium the switch is part of a programme that determines stochastic entry into the semi-quiescent capsulated state, ensures that such cells are provisioned with excess ribosomes, and enables provisioned cells to exit rapidly from stationary phase under permissive conditions.",

    "abstract": "While the natural history of flatfish has been debated for decades, the mode of diversification of this biologically and economically important group has never been elucidated. To address this question, we assembled the largest molecular data set to date, covering > 300 species (out of ca. 800 extant), from 13 of the 14 known families over nine genes, and employed relaxed molecular clocks to uncover their patterns of diversification. As the fossil record of flatfish is contentious, we used sister species distributed on both sides of the American continent to calibrate clock models based on the closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS), and on their current species range. We show that flatfish diversified in two bouts, as species that are today distributed around the Equator diverged during the closure of CAS, while those with a northern range diverged after this, hereby suggesting the existence of a post-CAS closure dispersal for these northern species, most likely along a trans-Arctic northern route, a hypothesis fully compatible with paleogeographic reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "Color vision requires the activity of cone photoreceptors to be compared in post-receptoral circuitry. Decades of psychophysical measurements have quantified the nature of these comparative interactions on a coarse scale. How such findings generalize to a cellular scale remains unclear. To answer that question, we quantified the influence of surrounding light on the appearance of spots targeted to individual cones. The eyes aberrations were corrected with adaptive optics and retinal position was precisely tracked in real-time to compensate for natural movement. Subjects reported the color appearance of each spot. A majority of L-and M-cones consistently gave rise to the sensation of white, while a smaller group repeatedly elicited hue sensations. When blue sensations were reported they were more likely mediated by M- than L-cones. Blue sensations were elicited from M-cones against a short-wavelength light that preferentially elevated the quantal catch in surrounding S-cones, while stimulation of the same cones against a white background elicited green sensations. In one of two subjects, proximity to S-cones increased the probability of blue reports when M-cones were probed. We propose that M-cone increments excited both green and blue opponent pathways, but the relative activity of neighboring cones favored one pathway over the other.",

    "abstract": "Spatial or temporal aspects of neural organisation are known to be important indices of how cognition is organised. However, measurements and estimations are often noisy and many of the algorithms used are probabilistic, which in combination have been argued to limit studies exploring the neural basis of specific aspects of cognition. Focusing on static and dynamic functional connectivity estimations, we propose to leverage this variability to improve statistical efficiency in relating these estimations to behaviour. To achieve this goal, we use a procedure based on permutation testing that provides a way of combining the results from many individual tests that refer to the same hypothesis. This is needed when testing a measure whose value is obtained from a noisy process, which can be repeated multiple times, referred to as replications. Focusing on functional connectivity, this noisy process can be: (i) computational, e.g. when using an approximate inference algorithm for which different runs can produce different results or (ii) observational, if we have the capacity to acquire data multiple times, and the different acquired data sets can be considered noisy examples of some underlying truth. In both cases, we are not interested in the individual replications but on the unobserved process generating each replication. In this note, we show how results can be combined instead of choosing just one of the estimated models. Using both simulations and real data, we show the benefits of this approach in practice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacillus strains producing highly resistant spores have been isolated from cleanrooms and space craft assembly facilities. Organisms that can survive such conditions merit planetary protection concern and if that resistance can be transferred to other organisms, a health concern too. To further efforts to understand these resistances, the complete genome of Bacillus safensis strain FO-36b, which produces spore resistant to peroxide and radiation was determined. The genome was compared to the complete genome of B. pumilus SAFR-032, as well as draft genomes of B. safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2 and the type strain B. pumilus ATCC7061T. In addition, comparisons were made to 61 draft genomes that have been mostly identified as strains of B. pumilus or B. safensis.\\n\\nResultsThe FO-36b gene order is essentially the same as that in SAFR-032 and other B. pumilus strains [1]. The annotated genome has 3850 open reading frames and 40 noncoding RNAs and riboswitches. Of these, 307 are not shared by SAFR-032, and 65 are also not shared by either MERTA or ATCC7061T. The FO-36b genome was found to have ten unique reading frames and two phage-like regions, which have homology with the Bacillus bacteriophage SPP1 (NC_004166) and Brevibacillus phage Jimmer1 (NC_029104). Differing remnants of the Jimmer1 phage are found in essentially all safensis/pumilus strains. Seven unique genes are part of these phage elements. Comparison of gyrA sequences from FO-36b, SAFR-032, ATCC7061T, and 61 other draft genomes separate the various strains into three distinct clusters. Two of these are subgroups of B. pumilus while the other houses all the B. safensis strains.\\n\\nConclusionsIt is not immediately obvious that the presence or absence of any specific gene or combination of genes is responsible for the variations in resistance seen. It is quite possible that distinctions in gene regulation can change the level of expression of key proteins thereby changing the organisms resistance properties without gain or loss of a particular gene. What is clear is that phage elements contribute significantly to genome variability. The larger comparison of multiple strains indicates that many strains named as B. pumilus actually belong to the B. safensis group.",

    "abstract": "Temperature impacts the physiology of ectotherms, including vectors that transmit disease. While thermal biology predicts nonlinear effects of temperature on vector and pathogen traits that drive disease transmission, the empirical relationship between temperature and transmission remains unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model to estimate the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important mosquito-borne pathogen of humans in Australia, the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4{degrees}C) and declines to zero at low (17.0{degrees}C) and high (31.5{degrees}C) temperatures. The model predicted broad patterns of disease across Australia. First, transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics and sub-tropics but seasonal in temperate zones. Second, nationwide human cases peak seasonally as predicted from population-weighted seasonal temperatures. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear, mechanistic models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Given the abundance, broad distribution, and diversity of roles that ants play in many ecosystems, they are an ideal group to serve as ecosystem indicators of climatic change. At present, only a few whole-genome sequences of ants are available (19 of > 16,000 species), mostly from tropical and sub-tropical species. To address this limited sampling, we sequenced genomes of temperate-latitude species from the genus Aphaenogaster, a genus with important seed dispersers. In total, we sampled seven colonies of six species: A. ashmeadi, A. floridana, A. fulva, A. miamiana, A. picea, and A. rudis. The geographic ranges of these species collectively span eastern North America from southern Florida to southern Canada, which encompasses a latitudinal gradient in which many climatic variables are changing rapidly. For the six genomes, we assembled an average of 271,039 contigs into 47,337 scaffolds. The mean genome size was 370.5 Mb, ranging from 310.3 to 429.7, which is comparable to that of other sequenced ant genomes (212.8 to 396.0 Mb) and flow cytometry estimates (210.7 to 690.4 Mb). In an analysis of currently sequenced ant genomes and the new Aphaenogaster sequences, we found that after controlling for both spatial autocorrelation and phylogenetics ant genome size was marginally correlated with sample site climate similarity. Of all examined climate variables, minimum temperature showed the strongest correlation with genome size, with ants from locations with colder minimum temperatures having larger genomes. These results suggest that temperature extremes could be a selective force acting on ant genomes and point to the need for more extensive sequencing of ant genomes.",

The de novo formation of autophagosomes requires several vesicle transport and membrane fusion events which are not completely understood. We studied the involvement of Exocyst- an octameric tethering complex, which has a primary function in tethering post-Golgi secretory vesicles to plasma membrane, in autophagy. Our findings indicate not all subunits of exocyst are involved in selective and general autophagy. We show that in the absence of autophagy specific subunits, autophagy arrest is accompanied by accumulation of incomplete autophagosome-like structures. In these mutants, impaired Atg9 trafficking leads to decreased delivery of membrane to the site of autophagosome biogenesis thereby impeding the elongation and completion of the autophagosomes. The subunits of exocyst which are dispensable for autophagic function do not associate with the autophagy specific subcomplex of exocyst.",

To investigate cell-type-specific opioid responses, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the nucleus accumbens of mice following acute morphine treatment. Differential expression analysis uncovered robust morphine-dependent changes in gene expression in oligodendrocytes. We examined the expression of selected genes, including Cdkn1a and Sgk1, by FISH, confirming their induction by morphine in oligodendrocytes. Further analysis using RNAseq of FACS-purified oligodendrocytes revealed a large cohort of morphine-regulated genes. Importantly, the affected genes are enriched for roles in cellular pathways intimately linked to oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, including the unfolded protein response. Altogether, our data shed light on a novel, morphine-dependent transcriptional response by oligodendrocytes that may contribute to the myelination defects observed in human opioid addicts.",

Specialized protein assemblies initiate inward or outward membrane deformations that turn into, for example, filopodia or endocytic intermediates. Actin dynamics and actin-binding proteins are involved in this process, although their detailed role remains controversial. We show here that a dynamic, branched actin network is sufficient, in absence of any membrane-associated proteins, to initiate both inward and outward membrane deformation. With actin polymerization triggered at the membrane of liposomes, we produce inward filopodia-like structures at low tension, while outward endocytosis-like structures are robustly generated regardless of tension. Our results are reminiscent of endocytosis in mammalian cells, where actin polymerization forces are required when membrane tension is increased, and in yeast, where they are always required to overcome the opposing turgor pressure. By combining experimental observations with physical modeling, we propose a mechanism for actin-driven endocytosis under high tension or high pressure conditions.",

    "abstract": "White rot fungi (WRF) produce lignolytic enzymes comprised by laccases and peroxidases responsible for mineralization of recalcitrant lignin. Because of the so-called lignin modifying enzymes(LMEs), these fungi have potential applications in biodegradation and bioremediation processes. Increased demand for lignolytic enzymes to exploit their various applications has sparked interest in identifying and characterizing new novel strains of WRF. Despite this undisputed biotechnological significance, molecular identification of WRF, remains a daunting task for researchers as genomic DNA isolation is a tedious process, unsuccessful many a times because of their rigid and resistant cell walls. A rapid, effective and efficient method to identify the innumerable fungal strains within no time is the need of the hour. The fungal mycelia of various unknown as well as know isolates of WRF, after alternative washing with TE buffer and sterile water were suspended in TE buffer. Fungi in solution were then exposed to microwave. The crude extract contained genomic DNA which was extracted and amplified using ITS primers for further identification. Based on sequencing results the identity of known cultures was confirmed, while the unknown cultures were identified as Clitopilus scyphoides (AGUM004, BankIt2098576 MH172163); Ganoderma rasinaceum (AGUM007, BankIt2098576 MH172163); Schizophyllum sp (KONA001 BankIt2098576 MH172164; AGUM011 BankIt2098576 MH172165and AGUM021 BankIt2098576 MH172166respectively), Coprinellus disseminatus (BANG001, BankIt2098576 MH172167) and Lentinus squarrosulus (TAMI004, BankIt2098576 MH172167). The microwave method described for isolating quality DNA of WRF without further purification steps proved a novel method requiring less than ten minutes and minimized the chances of the presence of PCR inhibitors.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWhite rot fungi which decay wood, possess selective lignin degrading enzymes responsible for degrading a wide variety of environmental pollutants, xenobiotic compounds in addition to mineralizing chemicals that are insoluble and recalcitrant. Lignolytic enzymes hold potential towards replacing conventional chemical processes and their increased demand in the market has ignited interest in identifying and characterizing new strains of WRF. A rapid, efficient method capable of quickly identifying fungal isolates is a constraint. The microwave method is a novel quick method for isolating superior quality DNA. Its adoption circumvents the initial purification steps and /or interference of PCR inhibitors, which are encompassed in the use of conventional methods. The microwave method thus permits the thorough amplification of the ITS region thereby aiding in the easy identification of unknown species. Use of the microwave method will permit researchers to obtain DNA from fungi very quickly for further application in molecular studies.",

    "abstract": "Symmetry is a pervasive feature of organismal shape and the focus of a large body of research in Biology. Here, we consider complex patterns of symmetry where a phenotype exhibits a hierarchically structured combination of symmetries. We extend the Procrustes ANOVA for the analysis of nested symmetries and the decomposition of the overall morphological variation into components of symmetry (among-individual variation) and asymmetry (directional and fluctuating asymmetry). We illustrate its use with the Aristotles lantern, the masticatory apparatus of  regular sea urchins, a complex organ displaying bilateral symmetry nested within five-fold rotational symmetry. Our results highlight the importance of characterising the full symmetry of a structure with nested symmetries. Higher order rotational symmetry appears strongly constrained and developmentally stable compared to lower level bilateral symmetry. This contrast between higher and lower levels of asymmetry is discussed in relation to the spatial pattern of the lantern morphogenesis. This extended framework is applicable to any biological object exhibiting nested symmetries, regardless of their type (e.g., bilateral, rotational, translational).

    "abstract": "Artificial gut models provide unique opportunities to study human-associated microbiota. Outstanding questions for these models fundamental biology include the timescales on which microbiota vary and the factors that drive such change. Answering these questions though requires overcoming analytical obstacles like estimating the effects of technical variation on observed microbiota dynamics, as well as the lack of appropriate benchmark datasets. To address these obstacles, we created a modeling framework based on multinomial logistic-normal dynamic linear models (MALLARDs) and performed dense longitudinal sampling of replicate artificial human guts over the course of 1 month. The resulting analyses revealed that when observed on an hourly basis, 76% of community variation could be ascribed to technical noise from sample processing, which could also skew the observed covariation between taxa. Our analyses also supported hypotheses that human gut microbiota fluctuate on sub-daily timescales in the absence of a host and that microbiota can follow replicable trajectories in the presence of environmental driving forces. Finally, multiple aspects of our approach are generalizable and could ultimately be used to facilitate the design and analysis of longitudinal microbiota studies in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infection of humans, animals and plants relies heavily on secreted proteases that degrade host defences or activate bacterial toxins. The largest family of proteins secreted by Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, the Autotransporters (ATs), includes key proteolytic virulence factors. There remains uncertainty about the mechanistic steps of the pathway ATs share to exit bacteria, and how it is energetically driven. This study set out to shed light on the AT secretion pathway with the ultimate aim of uncovering novel antimicrobial targets that would be unlikely to trigger the development of resistance mechanisms in bacteria. To do this, two AT virulence factors with distinct proteolytic functions, EspC (secreted from Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli) and AaaA (tethered to the extracellular surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were chosen. EspC and AaaA were fluorescently labelled using two separate methods to establish the localization patterns of ATs as they are secreted from a bacterial cell. Super resolution microscopy revealed that localization of ATs occurs via a helical route along the bacterial cytoskeleton. In addition to requiring the conserved C-terminal {beta}-barrel translocator domain of the AT, we present the first evidence that secretion is dependent on a dynamic interaction with a structure reliant upon the actin homologue MreB and the Sec translocon. These findings provide a step forward in the mechanistic understanding of the secretion of this widely distributed family of proteins that have pivotal roles in bacterial pathogenesis and conserved structural properties that could serve as novel broad-range antimicrobial targets.\\n\\nSignificanceSecreted bacterial proteases facilitate the infection of human, animal and plant hosts by degrading host defences or activating bacterial toxins. The autotransporter family is the largest family of proteins secreted from Gram-negative bacteria, and includes proteolytic virulence factors crucial to bacterial infection. Precisely how autotransporters migrate from the inside to the outside of the cell, and how this movement is energetically driven is a mystery. We demonstrate a spiral pathway of autotransporter secretion, presenting evidence that it involves a dynamic interaction with the actin homologue MreB that comprises the bacterial cytoskeleton. Our findings open the way to unravelling the mechanism of autotransporter secretion and offer the possibility to identify novel antimicrobial targets unlikely to trigger the development of antimicrobial resistance.",

Integrated analyses of these data to assess differential dependency across genes and cell lines are challenging due to confounding factors such as batch effects and variable screen quality, as well as difficulty assessing gene dependency on an absolute scale. To address these issues, we incorporated estimation of cell line screen quality parameters and hierarchical Bayesian inference into an analytical framework for analyzing RNAi screens (DEMETER2; https://depmap.org/R2-D2). We applied this model to individual large-scale datasets and show that it substantially improves estimates of gene dependency across a range of performance measures, including identification of gold-standard essential genes as well as agreement with CRISPR-Cas9-based viability screens. This model also allows us to effectively integrate information across three large RNAi screening datasets, providing a unified resource representing the most extensive compilation of cancer cell line genetic dependencies to date.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory signaling during natural killer (NK) cell education translates into increased responsiveness to activation; however the intracellular mechanism for functional tuning by inhibitory receptors remains unclear. We found that educated NK cells expressing self-MHC specific inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) show accumulation of granzyme B, localized in dense-core secretory lysosomes, converged close to the centrosome. This discrete morphological phenotype persists in self-KIR+ NK cells independently of transcriptional programs that regulate effector function, metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis. The granzymeB dense, large secretory lysosomes in self-KIR+ NK cells were efficiently released upon target cell recognition, contributing to their enhanced cytotoxic capacity. Secretory lysosomes are part of the acidic lysosomal compartment, which has been shown to channel calcium and mediate intracellular signalling in several cell types. Interference of signaling from acidic Ca2+ stores in primary NK cells reduced both target-specific Ca2+-flux, degranulation and cytokine production. Furthermore, inhibition of PI(3,5)P2 synthesis or genetic silencing of the PI(3,5)P2-regulated lysosomal Ca2+-channel TRPML1 led to increased levels of granzyme B and enhanced functional potential. These results indicate an intrinsic role for lysosomal homeostasis in NK cell education.",

Two rhesus monkeys conducted instructed walk-and-reach movements towards targets flexibly positioned in the cage. We tracked 3D multi-joint arm and head movements using markerless motion capture. Movements show small trial-to-trial variability despite being unrestrained. We wirelessly recorded 192 broad-band neural signals from three cortical sensorimotor areas simultaneously. Single unit activity is selective for different reach and walk-and-reach movements. Walk-and-reach targets could be decoded from premotor and parietal but not motor cortical activity during movement planning. The Reach Cage allows systems-level sensorimotor neuroscience studies with full-body movements in a configurable 3D spatial setting with unrestrained monkeys. We conclude that the primate frontoparietal network encodes reach goals beyond immediate reach during movement planning.",

    "abstract": "Evidence that social and individual learning are at least partially dissociable sustains the belief that humans possess adaptive specialisations for social learning. However, in most extant paradigms, social information comprises an indirect source that can be used to supplement ones own, direct, experience. Thus, social and individual learning differ both in terms of social nature (social versus non-social) and directness (indirect versus direct). To test whether the dissociation between social and individual learning is best explained in terms of social nature or directness, we used a catecholaminergic challenge known to modulate learning. Two groups completed a decision-making task which required direct learning, from own experience, and indirect learning from an additional source. The groups differed in terms of whether the indirect source was social or non-social. The catecholamine transporter blocker, methylphenidate, affected direct learning by improving adaptation to changes in the volatility of the environment but there was no effect of methylphenidate on learning from the social or non-social indirect source. Thus, we report positive evidence for a dissociable effect of methylphenidate on direct and indirect learning, but no evidence for a distinction between social and non-social. These data fail to support the adaptive specialisation view, instead providing evidence for distinct mechanisms for direct versus indirect learning.",

We show that repeated induction of the C. elegans flight response inhibits conserved cytoprotective mechanisms. This acute-stress response activates neurons that release tyramine, the invertebrate analog of adrenaline/noradrenaline. Tyramine stimulates the DAF-2/Insulin/IGF-1 pathway and precludes the nuclear translocation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor through the activation of an adrenergic-like receptor TYRA-3 in the intestine. In contrast, environmental long-term stressors, such as heat or oxidative stress, reduce tyramine release allowing the induction of FOXO-dependent cytoprotective genes. These findings demonstrate how a neural stress-hormone signaling provides a state-dependent neural switch between acute and long-term stress responses, and provide mechanistic insights how acute stress impairs cellular defensive systems.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: The \\\"fight-or-flight\\\" response reduces resistance to environmental challenges.",

Here, we use this approach to study the interactions underpinning anaerobic digestion communities and involving the key microbial populations of a sulfate reducer (Desulfovibrio vulgaris), and aceto-(Methanosarcina barkeri) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanococcus maripaludis) methanogens. We create all possible mixed culture combinations of these species and analyse the stability and productivity of each system over multiple sub-culturings and under different sulfate levels, mimicking ecological perturbation in the form of strong electron acceptor availability. We find that all three species can co-exist in the absence of sulfate, and that system productivity (in form of methane production from lactate) increases by almost two-fold compared to co-cultures. With increasing sulfate availability, co-existence is perturbed and both methanogenic populations display a diminishing trend. Interestingly, we find that, despite the continued presence of acetate in the system, the acetotrophic methanogens are more readily disrupted by sulfate perturbation. We show that this is due to a shift in M. barkeri metabolism towards increased co-utilisation of hydrogen with acetate, which we verified through experiments on mono cultures and mass balance calculations in co-cultures. We conclude that hydrogen is a key factor for both hydrogeno- and aceto-trophic methanogenesis and can influence these populations differentially under the common ecological perturbation of strong electron acceptor availability.

    "abstract": "Apical-basal polarity is essential for the formation and function of epithelial tissues, whereas loss of polarity is a hallmark of tumours. Studies in Drosophila have identified conserved polarity factors that define the apical (Crumbs, Stardust, Par-6, aPKC), junctional (Baz/Par-3) and basolateral (Scribbled, Discs large, Lgl) domains of epithelial cells (1, 2). Because these conserved factors mark equivalent domains in diverse vertebrate and invertebrate epithelial types, it is generally assumed that this system organises polarity in all epithelia. Here we show that this is not the case, as none of these canonical factors are required for the polarisation of the endodermal epithelium of the Drosophila adult midgut. Furthermore, unlike other Drosophila epithelia, the midgut forms occluding junctions above adherens junctions, as in vertebrates, and requires the integrin adhesion complex for polarity (3, 4). Thus, Drosophila contains two types of epithelia that polarise by different mechanisms. Since knock-outs of canonical polarity factors often have little effect on the polarity of vertebrate epithelia, this diversity of polarity mechanisms is likely to be conserved in other animals (5-8).",

Activation of the Fe deficiency response was confirmed by increased ferric chelate reductase activity in the mutant. At early stages, genes important for chloroplast redox control (FSD1, SAPX), Fe homeostasis (FER1, SUFB) and chlorophyll metabolism (HEMA1, NYC1) were downregulated, indicating limited Fe availability in plastids.

Work in cultured neurons has shown that ankyrin-G plays a key role in the regulation of GABAergic synapses on the axon initial segment and somatodendritic domain of pyramidal neurons where it interacts directly with the GABAO_SCPCAPAC_SCPCAP receptor associated protein (GABARAP) to stabilize cell surface GABAO_SCPCAPAC_SCPCAP receptors. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing a mutation that abolishes the ankyrin-G/GABARAP interaction (Ank3 W1989R) to understand how ankyrin-G and GABARAP regulate GABAergic circuitry in vivo. We found that Ank3 W1989R mice exhibit a striking reduction in forebrain GABAergic synapses resulting in pyramidal cell hyperexcitability and disruptions in network synchronization. In addition, we identified changes in pyramidal cell dendritic spines and axon initial segments consistent with compensation for hyperexcitability. Finally, we identified the ANK3 W1989R variant in a family with bipolar disorder, suggesting a potential role of this variant in disease. Our results highlight the importance of ankyrin-G in regulating forebrain circuitry and provide novel insights into how ANK3 loss-of-function variants may contribute to human disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOpenPrescribing is a freely accessible service that enables any user to view and analyse NHS primary care prescribing data at the level of individual practices. This tool is intended to improve the quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness of prescribing.\\n\\nObjectivesWe set out to measure the impact of OpenPrescribing being viewed on subsequent prescribing.\\n\\nMethodsHaving pre-registered our protocol and code, we measured three different metrics of prescribing quality (mean percentile across 34 existing OpenPrescribing quality measures, available \\\"price-per-unit\\\" savings, and total \\\"low-priority prescribing\\\" spend) to see if they changed after CCG and practice pages were viewed. We also measured whether practices whose data were viewed on OpenPrescribing differed in prescribing, prior to viewing, to those who were not. We used fixed effects and between effects linear panel regression, to isolate change over time and differences between practices respectively. We adjusted for month of prescribing in the fixed effects model, to remove underlying trends in outcome measures.\\n\\nResultsWe found a reduction in available price-per-unit savings for both practices and CCGs after their pages were viewed. The saving was greater at the practice level (-{pound}40.42 per thousand patients per month, 95% confidence interval -54.04 to -26.01) than at CCG level (-{pound}14.70 per thousand patients per month, 95% confidence interval -25.56 to -3.84). We estimate a total saving since launch of {pound}243k at practice level and {pound}1.47m at CCG level between the feature launch and end of follow-up (August to November 2017) among practices viewed. If the observed savings from practices viewed were extrapolated to all practices, this would generate {pound}26.8m in annual savings for the NHS, approximately 20% of the total possible savings from this method. The other two measures were not different after CCGs/practices were viewed. Practices which were viewed had worse prescribing quality scores overall, prior to viewing.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found a clinically significant positive impact from use of OpenPrescribing, specifically for the class of savings opportunities that can only be identified by using this tool. We also show that it is possible to conduct a robust analysis of the impact of such an online service on clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is one of the major public health threats of the 21st century. There is a pressing need to adopt more efficient treatment strategies in order to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant strains. The common approach is to treat patients with high drug doses, both to clear the infection quickly and to reduce the risk of de novo resistance. Recently, several studies have argued that, at least in some cases, low-dose treatments could be more suitable to reduce the within-host emergence of antimicrobial resistance. However, the choice of a drug dose may have consequences at the population level, which has received little attention so far.\\n\\nHere, we study the influence of the drug dose on resistance and disease management at the host and population levels. We develop a nested two-strain model and unravel trade-offs in treatment benefits between an individual and the community. We use several measures to evaluate the benefits of any dose choice. Two measures focus on the emergence of resistance, at the host level and at the population level. The other two focus on the overall treatment success: the outbreak probability and the disease burden. We find that different measures can suggest different dosing strategies. In particular, we identify situations where low doses minimize the risk of emergence of resistance at the individual level, while high or intermediate doses prove most beneficial to improve the treatment efficiency or even to reduce the risk of resistance in the population.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe obvious goals of antimicrobial drug therapy are rapid patient recovery and low disease prevalence in the population. However, achieving these goals is complicated by the rapid evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance. A sustainable treatment strategy needs to account for the risk of resistance and keep it in check. One parameter of treatment is the drug dosage, which can vary within certain limits. It has been proposed that lower doses may, in some cases, be more suitable than higher doses to reduce the risk of resistance evolution in any one patient. However, if lower doses prolong the period of infectiousness, such a strategy has consequences for the pathogen dynamics of both strains at the population level. Here, we set up a nested model of within-host and between-host dynamics for an acute self-limiting infection. We explore the consequences of drug dosing on several measures of treatment success: the risk of resistance at the individual and population levels and the outbreak probability and the disease burden of an epidemic. Our analysis shows that trade-offs may exist between optimal treatments under these various criteria. The criterion given most weight in the decision process ultimately depends on the disease and population under consideration.",

    "abstract": "Most transcriptional activity of exponentially growing cells is carried out by the RNA Polymerase I (Pol I), which produces a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor. In budding yeast, Pol I is a multimeric enzyme with 14 subunits. Among them, Rpa49 forms with Rpa34 a Pol I-specific heterodimer (homologous to PAF53/CAST heterodimer in human Pol I), which might be responsible for the specific functions of the Pol I. Previous studies provided insight in the involvement of Rpa49 in initiation, elongation, docking and releasing of Rrn3, an essential Pol I transcription factor. Here, we took advantage of the spontaneous occurrence of extragenic suppressors of the growth defect of the rpa49 null mutant to better understand the activity of Pol I. Combining genetic approaches, biochemical analysis of rRNA synthesis and investigation of the transcription rate at the individual gene scale, we characterized mutated residues of the Pol I as novel extragenic suppressors of the growth defect caused by the absence of Rpa49. When mapped on the Pol I structure, most of these mutations cluster within the jaw-lobe module, at an interface formed by the lobe in Rpa135 and the jaw made up of regions of Rpa190 and Rpa12. In vivo, the suppressor allele RPA135-F301S restores normal rRNA synthesis and increases Pol I density on rDNA genes when Rpa49 is absent. Growth of the Rpa135-F301S mutant is impaired when combined with exosome mutation rrp6{Delta} and it massively accumulates pre-rRNA. Moreover, Pol I bearing Rpa135-F301S is a hyper-active RNA polymerase in an in vitro tailed-template assay. We conclude that wild-type RNA polymerase I can be engineered to produce more rRNA in vivo and in vitro. We propose that the mutated area undergoes a conformational change that supports the DNA insertion into the cleft of the enzyme resulting in a super-active form of Pol I.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe nuclear genome of eukaryotic cells is transcribed by three RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a multimeric enzyme specialized in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA. Deregulation of the Pol I function is linked to the etiology of a broad range of human diseases. Understanding the Pol I activity and regulation represents therefore a major challenge. We chose the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, because Pol I transcription apparatus is genetically amenable in this organism. Analyses of phenotypic consequences of deletion/truncation of Pol I subunits-coding genes in yeast indeed provided insights into the activity and regulation of the enzyme. Here, we characterized mutations in Pol I that can alleviate the growth defect caused by the absence of Rpa49, one of the subunits composing this multi-protein enzyme. We mapped these mutations on the Pol I structure and found that they all cluster in a well-described structural element, the jaw-lobe module. Combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we showed that Pol I bearing one of these mutations in the Rpa135 subunit is able to produce more ribosomal RNA in vivo and in vitro. We propose that this super-activity is explained by structural rearrangement of the Pol I jaw/lobe interface.",

    "abstract": "Disproportionate distal limb shortening is the hallmark of acromelic dysplasias. Among them, geleophysic dysplasia is a rare, frequently lethal condition characterized by severe short stature, musculoskeletal, cardiac, pulmonary, and skin anomalies. Geleophysic dysplasia results from dominant fibrillin-1 (FBN1) or recessive ADAMTSL2 mutations, suggesting a functional link between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1. Mice lacking ADAMTSL2 die at birth, precluding analysis of postnatal skeletal growth and mechanisms underlying the skeletal anomalies of geleophysic dysplasia. We show that Adamtsl2 is expressed in limb soft tissues, predominantly in tendon. Expression in developing bones is limited to their terminal cell layers that are destined to become articular cartilage and is absent in growth plate cartilage. Adamtsl2 conditional deletion in limb mesenchyme using Prxl-Cre led to an acromelic dysplasia, providing a suitable model for investigation of geleophysic dysplasia. Unexpectedly, conditional Adamtsl2 deletion using Scx-Cre, a tendon-specific deleter, also impaired skeletal growth. Specific morphogenetic anomalies were seen in Achilles tendon, along with FBN1 accumulation. Thus, ADAMTSL2, shown here to bind fibrillin microfibrils in vitro, limits fibrillin microfibril formation in tendons and promotes tendon growth. The findings suggest that reduced bone growth in geleophysic dysplasia results from external tethering by short tendons rather than intrinsic growth plate anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Filamin-A (FlnA), an actin-binding protein that organizes the actin cytoskeleton and mechanically links transmembrane glycoproteins to the cytoskeleton, associates with platelet receptors integrin IIb{beta}3, glycoprotein-Ib (GPIb), and integrin 2{beta}1. Fibrinogen, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and collagen, binding to these receptors mechanically connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Here we identified that under standardized conditions, platelet activation and ligand binding to IIb{beta}3, GPIb, or 2{beta}1, generates reproducible patterns of FlnA cleavage after platelet lysis. We exploited this novel assay to study the impact of ligand binding and receptor activation on the platelet cytoskeleton. We identified that: i) the FlnA modification that renders it cleavable by calpain after platelet lysis, requires both ligand binding and either internal force (e.g; clot retraction) or external forces (e.g; stirring and aggregating), ii) FlnA modification depends on actin polymerization downstream of integrin IIb{beta}3 and integrin 2{beta}1, but not downstream of GPIb signaling, iii) FlnA modification is reversible in time when platelets are activated with convulxin (Cvx), collagen, von Willebrand factor (vWF) or thrombin receptor activating peptide (T6), and this reversibility correlates with platelet dissagregation, iv) in contrast to the reversible nature of platelet aggregation and FlnA modification by activation with Cvx, collagen, ristocetin or T6, when platelets are activated by thrombin the platelet do not disaggregate and FlnA remains cleavable. Our data demonstrate that IIb{beta}3, 2{beta}1 and GPIb can each exert tension on the cytoskeleton by virtue of binding ligand under conditions of shear. We further identified a unique role for IIb{beta}3-fibrin interactions in creating sustained cytoskeletal tension, with implications for thrombus stability and clot retraction.",

To address this we developed Tri-C, a new Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) approach to identify concurrent chromatin interactions at individual alleles within single cells. The heterogeneity of interactions observed between such cells shows that CTCF-mediated formation of chromatin domains and interactions within them are dynamic processes. Importantly, our analyses reveal higher-order structures involving simultaneous interactions between multiple enhancers and promoters within individual cells.

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes patients to accumulate thick, dehydrated mucus in the lung and develop chronic, polymicrobial infections due to reduced mucociliary clearance. These chronic polymicrobial infections and subsequent decline in lung function are significant factors in the morbidity and mortality of CF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp. are among the most prevalent organisms in the CF lung; the presence of P. aeruginosa correlates with lung function decline and the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG), a subgroup of the viridans streptococci, is associated with exacerbations in patients with CF. Here we characterize the interspecies interactions that occur between these two genera. We demonstrated that multiple P. aeruginosa laboratory strains and clinical CF isolates promote the growth of multiple SMG strains and oral streptococci in an in vitro coculture system. We investigated the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa enhances growth of streptococci by screening for mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14 unable to enhance Streptococcus growth, and we identified the P. aeruginosa pqsL::TnM mutant, which failed to promote growth of S. constellatus and S. sanguinis. Characterization of the P. aeruginosa {Delta}pqsL mutant revealed that this strain cannot promote Streptococcus growth. Our genetic data and growth studies support a model whereby the P. aeruginosa {Delta}pqsL mutant overproduces siderophores, and thus likely outcompetes Streptococcus sanguinis for limited iron. We propose a model whereby competition for iron represents one important means of interaction between P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp.\\n\\nImportanceCystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections are increasingly recognized for their polymicrobial nature. These polymicrobial infections may alter the biology of the organisms involved in CF-related infections, leading to changes in growth, virulence and/or antibiotic tolerance, and could thereby affect patient health and response to treatment. In this study, we demonstrate interactions between P. aeruginosa and streptococci using a coculture model, and show that one interaction between these microbes is likely competition for iron. Thus, these data indicate that one CF pathogen may influence the growth of another and add to our limited knowledge of polymicrobial interactions in the CF airway.",

Here we develop a high-throughput assay to measure olfactory behavior in response to well-controlled sensory stimuli. We show that odor evokes two behaviors: an upwind run during odor (ON response), and a local search at odor offset (OFF response). Wind orientation requires antennal mechanoreceptors, but search is driven solely by odor. Using dynamic odor stimuli, we measure the dependence of these two behaviors on odor intensity and history. Based on these data, we develop a navigation model that recapitulates the behavior of flies in our apparatus, and generates realistic trajectories when run in a turbulent boundary layer plume. The ability to parse olfactory navigation into quantifiable elementary sensori-motor transformations provides a foundation for dissecting neural circuits that govern olfactory behavior.",

There is a critical need to advance understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive CD heterogeneity.

We generated patient crypt-derived epithelial colonoids and showed that miR-31 expression differences preserved in this ex-vivo system. In adult patients, low colonic miR-31 expression levels at the time of surgery are associated with post-operative recurrence of ileal disease. In pediatric patients, lower miR-31 expression at the time of diagnosis is associated with the future development of fibrostenotic ileal CD requiring surgery. These findings represent an important step forward in designing more effective clinical trials and developing personalized therapies for CD.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing methods for liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a non-trivial task. Here we present rawDiag, a software tool supporting rational method optimization by providing MS operator-tailored diagnostic plots of scan level metadata. rawDiag is implemented as R package and can be executed on the command line, or through a graphical user interface (GUI) for less experienced users. The code runs platform independent and can process a hundred raw files in less than three minutes on current consumer hardware as we show by our benchmark. In order to demonstrate the functionality of our package, we included a real-world example taken from our daily core facility business.",

    "abstract": "Trait loss is a pervasive phenomenon in evolution, yet the underlying molecular causes have been identified in only a handful of cases. Most of these involve loss-of-function mutations in one or more trait-specific genes. Parasitoid insects are fatty acid auxotrophs: they lost the ability to convert dietary sugars into fatty acids, a trait that is ubiquitous among non-parasitoid animals and is enabled by a highly conserved set of genes. Earlier research suggests that lack of lipogenesis is caused by changes in gene regulation, rather than gene decay. We compared transcriptome-wide responses to sugar-feeding in the non-lipogenic parasitoid species Nasonia vitripennis and the lipogenic Drosophila melanogaster. Both species adjusted their metabolism within four hours after feeding, but there was little overlap at the gene level between the responses of the two species. Even at the pathway-level, there were sharp differences between the expression profiles of the two species, especially in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic pathways. Several genes coding for key enzymes in acetyl-CoA metabolism, such as malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) and HMG-CoA synthase differed in expression between the two species. Their combined action likely blocks lipogenesis in the parasitoid species. Network analysis indicates most genes involved in these pathways to be highly connected, which suggest they have pleiotropic effects and could explain the absence of gene degradation. Our results indicate that modification of expression levels of only a few non-connected genes, such as MCD, is sufficient to enable complete loss of lipogenesis in N. vitripennis.",

    "abstract": "Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting envelope (Env) is a major goal of HIV vaccine development, but cross-clade breadth from immunization has only sporadically been observed. Recently, Xu et al (2018) elicited cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses in a variety of animal models using immunogens based on the epitope of bnAb VRC34.01. The VRC34.01 antibody, which was elicited by natural human infection, targets the N terminus of the Env fusion peptide, a critical component of the virus entry machinery. Here we precisely characterize the functional epitopes of VRC34.01 and two vaccine-elicited murine antibodies by mapping all single amino-acid mutations to the BG505 Env that affect viral neutralization. While escape from VRC34.01 occurred via mutations in both fusion peptide and distal interacting sites of the Env trimer, escape from the vaccine-elicited antibodies was mediated predominantly by mutations in the fusion peptide. Cryo-electron microscopy of four vaccine-elicited antibodies in complex with Env trimer revealed focused recognition of the fusion peptide and provided a structural basis for development of neutralization breadth. Together, these functional and structural data suggest that the breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies targeting the fusion peptide can be enhanced by specific interactions with additional portions of Env. Thus, our complete maps of viral escape provide a template to improve the breadth or potency of future vaccine-induced antibodies against Envs fusion peptide.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA major goal of HIV-1 vaccine design is to elicit antibodies that neutralize diverse strains of HIV-1. Recently, some of us elicited such antibodies in animal models using immunogens based on the epitope of a broad antibody (VRC34.01) isolated from an infected individual. Further improving these vaccine-elicited antibody responses will require a detailed understanding of how the resulting antibodies target HIVs envelope protein (Env). Here, we used mutational antigenic profiling to precisely map the epitope of two vaccine-elicited antibodies and the template VRC34.01 antibody. We did this by quantifying the effect of all possible amino acid mutations to Env on antibody neutralization. Although all antibodies target a similar region of Env, we found clear differences in the functional interaction of Env with the vaccine- and infection-elicited antibodies. We combined these functional data with structural analyses to identify antibody-Env interactions that could improve the breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies, and thereby help to refine vaccination schemes to achieve broader responses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLongitudinal tracking of individual Plasmodium falciparum strains in multi-clonal infections is essential for investigating infection dynamics of malaria. The traditional genotyping techniques did not permit tracking changes in individual clone density during persistent natural infections. Amplicon deep sequencing (Amp-Seq) offers a tool to address this knowledge gap.\\n\\nMethodsThe sensitivity of Amp-Seq for relative quantification of clones was investigated using three molecular markers, ama1-D2, ama1-D3, and cpmp. Amp-Seq and length-polymorphism based genotyping were compared for their performance in following minority clones in longitudinal samples from Papua New Guinea.\\n\\nResultsAmp-Seq markers were superior to length-polymorphic marker msp2 in detecting minority clones (sensitivity Amp-Seq: 95%, msp2: 85%). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) by Amp-Seq was 2.32 versus 1.73 for msp2. The higher sensitivity had no effect on estimates of force of infection because missed minority clones were detected in preceding or succeeding bleeds. Individual clone densities were tracked longitudinally by Amp-Seq despite MOI>1, thus providing an additional parameter for investigating malaria infection dynamics.\\n\\nConclusionAmp-Seq based genotyping of longitudinal samples improves detection of minority clones and estimates of MOI. Amp-Seq permits tracking of clone density over time to study clone competition or the dynamics of specific, i.e. resistance-associated genotypes.",

    "abstract": "EnTAP (Eukaryotic Non-Model Transcriptome Annotation Pipeline) was designed to improve the accuracy, speed, and flexibility of functional gene annotation for de novo assembled transcriptomes in non-model eukaryotes. This software package addresses the fragmentation and related assembly issues that result in inflated transcript estimates and poor annotation rates, while focusing primarily on protein-coding transcripts. Following filters applied through assessment of true expression and frame selection, open-source tools are leveraged to functionally annotate the translated proteins. Downstream features include fast similarity search across three repositories, protein domain assignment, orthologous gene family assessment, and Gene Ontology term assignment. The final annotation integrates across multiple databases and selects an optimal assignment from a combination of weighted metrics describing similarity search score, taxonomic relationship, and informativeness. Researchers have the option to include additional filters to identify and remove contaminants, identify associated pathways, and prepare the transcripts for enrichment analysis. This fully featured pipeline is easy to install, configure, and runs significantly faster than comparable annotation packages. EnTAP is optimized to generate extensive functional information for the gene space of organisms with limited or poorly characterized genomic resources.",

    "abstract": "Captive populations are considered a key component of ex situ conservation programs. Research on multiple taxa have shown the differential success of maintaining demographic versus genetic stability and viability in captive populations. In typical captive populations, usually founded by few or related individuals, genetic diversity can be lost and inbreeding can accumulate rapidly, calling into question their ultimate utility for release into the wild. Furthermore, domestication selection for survival in captive conditions is another concern. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of population sizes, particularly the effective population size, and genetic diversity at non-neutral, at adaptive loci in captive populations.\\n\\nIn this study, we assessed effective population sizes and genetic variation at both neutral microsatellite markers, as well as SNP variants from the MHC-B locus of a captive Red Junglefowl population. This population is a rare instance of a well-documented history in captivity, and also following a realistic chain-of-custody, unlike captive lab populations. Our analysis of 27 individuals that comprise the entirety of one captive population. Our results show very low neutral and adaptive genetic variation, as well as low effective sizes, which are surprising in spite of the known demographic history. Finally, our study also shows the divergent impacts of small effective size and inbreeding in captive populations on microsatellite versus adaptive genetic variation in the MHC-B locus. Our study provides insights into the difficulties of maintaining adaptive genetic variation in small captive populations.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in the peptide-binding groove of the highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules has repeatedly been associated with HIV-1 control and progression to AIDS, accounting for up to 12% of the variation in HIV-1 set point viral load (spVL). This suggests a key role in disease control for HLA presentation of HIV-1 epitopes to cytotoxic T cells. However, a comprehensive understanding of the relevant HLA-bound HIV epitopes is still elusive. Here we developed a peptidome-wide association study (PepWAS) approach that integrates HLA genotypes and spVL data from 6,311 HIV-infected patients to interrogate the entire HIV-1 proteome (3,252 unique peptides) for disease-relevant peptides. This PepWAS approach revealed a core set of epitopes associated with spVL, including previously characterized epitopes but also several novel disease-relevant peptides. More importantly, each patient presents only 16 ({+/-}7) and 6 ({+/-}6) of these core epitopes through their individual HLA-B and HLA-A variants, respectively. Differences in these patient-specific epitope repertoires account for almost all the variation in spVL previously associated with HLA genetic variation. PepWAS thus enables a comprehensive functional interpretation of the robust but little understood association between HLA and HIV-1 control, prioritizing a short and targetable list of disease-associated epitopes for personalized immunotherapy.",
