    "abstract": "The replacement of forest areas with human-dominated landscapes usually leads to fragmentation, altering the structure and function of the forest. Here we studied the dynamics of forest patch sizes at a global level, examining signals of a critical transition from an unfragmented to a fragmented state, using the MODIS vegetation continuous field. We defined wide regions of connected forest across continents and big islands, and combined five criteria, including the distribution of patch sizes and the fluctuations of the largest patch over the last sixteen years, to evaluate the closeness of each region to a fragmentation threshold. Regions with the highest deforestation rates--South America, Southeast Asia, Africa--all met these criteria and may thus be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This implies that if current forest loss rates are maintained, wide continental areas could suddenly fragment, triggering extensive species loss and degradation of ecosystems services.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific barcodes (BCs) and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. zUMIs is such a pipeline, it can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapses UMIs, either just for Exon mapping reads or for both Exon and Intron mapping reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function, that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes, but also allows to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. zUMIs flexibility allows to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analysed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to Introns. We furthermore show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution.

    "abstract": "In everyday visual environments, objects are non-uniformly distributed across visual space. Many objects preferentially occupy particular retinotopic locations: for example, lamps more often fall into the upper visual field, whereas carpets more often fall into the lower visual field. The long-term experience with natural environments prompts the hypothesis that the visual system is tuned to such retinotopic object locations. A key prediction is that typically positioned objects should be coded more efficiently. To test this prediction, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed briefly presented objects appearing in their typical locations (e.g., an airplane in the upper visual field) or in atypical locations (e.g., an airplane in the lower visual field). Multivariate pattern analysis applied to the EEG data revealed that object classification depended on positional regularities: Objects were classified more accurately when positioned typically, rather than atypically, already at 140 ms, suggesting that relatively early stages of object processing are tuned to typical retinotopic locations. Our results confirm the prediction that long-term experience with objects occurring at specific locations leads to enhanced perceptual processing when these objects appear in their typical locations. This may indicate a neural mechanism for efficient natural scene processing, where a large number of typically positioned objects needs to be processed.",

    "abstract": "The primary target of Influenza A virus (IAV) is epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. In contrast to epithelial cells, productive infection of most IAV strains is either blocked or highly inefficient in macrophages. The exact nature of the defect in IAV replication in human macrophages remains unknown. In this study, we showed that primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are inefficient in IAV release even when compared to a monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells, despite comparable levels of expression of viral glycoproteins at the plasma membrane. Correlative fluorescence scanning electron microscopy revealed that formation of budding structures at the cell surface is inefficient in MDM even though clustering of a viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is observed, suggesting that IAV particle assembly is blocked in human MDM. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we further determined that association between HA and the viral ion channel protein M2 is defective at the plasma membrane of MDM. In contrast, HA and another glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) associate with each other on the MDM surface efficiently. Notably, the defect in association between HA and M2 in MDM was reversed upon inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D. Altogether, these results suggest that HA-M2 association on the plasma membrane is a discrete step in the IAV assembly process, which is separable from the association between HA and NA and susceptible to suppression by actin cytoskeleton. Overall, our study revealed the presence of a cell-type-specific mechanism negatively regulating IAV assembly at the plasma membrane.\\n\\nImportanceIdentification of host cell determinants promoting or suppressing replication of many viruses has been aided by analyses of host cells that impose inherent blocks on viral replication. In this study, we show that primary human MDM are not permissive to IAV replication due to a defect at the virus particle formation step. This defect is specific to primary human macrophages, since a human monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells supports IAV particle formation. We further identified association between two viral transmembrane proteins, HA and M2, on the cell surface as a discrete assembly step, which is defective in MDM. Defective HA-M2 association in MDM is rescued by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, revealing a previously unknown, negative role for actin polymerization, which is generally thought to play positive roles in IAV assembly. Overall, our study uncovered a host-mediated restriction of association between viral transmembrane components during IAV assembly.",

Mortality hazard rates describe individuals instantaneous ability to survive at different times, whereas survival probabilities are defined for time-intervals of a given length. In this commentary, we argue that it is often more meaningful to model and interpret interval-specific time-averaged mortality hazard rates than survival probabilities, also when using discrete-time models.\\nC_LIO_LIWe discuss three topics where the concept of hazard rates is essential for sound biological inference, but nevertheless often not used: (i) modelling of covariate effects on survival probabilities or mortality hazard rates, (ii) modelling of multiple sources of mortality and competing risks, and (iii) elasticity analyses of population growth rate to demographic parameters. To facilitate estimation of cause-specific mortality hazard rates, we provide amendments to R package  marked.\\nC_LIO_LIBy focusing on modelling mortality hazard rates, one avoids several inherent problems of comparing survival or mortality probabilities. In particular, interpretations about relative differences between mortality hazard rates (measurements on a ratio scale), or effects of relative changes in mortality hazard rates on population growth (elasticities), are more meaningful than similar interpretations involving survival (or mortality) probabilities or odds (measurements on an absolute scale).\\nC_LIO_LIThe concept of hazard rates is essential for understanding ecological and evolutionary processes and we give an intuitive explanation for this, using several examples.

    "abstract": "Understanding selection on ecological interactions that take place in dispersal-limited communities is an important challenge for ecology and evolutionary biology. The problem is that local demographic stochasticity generates eco-evolutionary dynamics that are too complicated to make tractable analytical investigations. Here, we circumvent this problem by approximating the selection gradient on a quantitative trait that influences local community dynamics, assuming that such dynamics are deterministic with a stable fixed point, but incorporating the kin selection effects arising from demographic stochasticity. Our approximation reveals that selection depends on how an individual expressing a trait-change influences: (1) its own fitness and the fitness of its current relatives; and (2) the fitness of its downstream relatives through modifications of local ecological conditions (i.e., through ecological inheritance). Mathematically, the effects of ecological inheritance on selection are captured by dispersal-limited versions of press-perturbations of community ecology. We use our approximation to investigate the evolution of helping within- and harming between-species when these behaviours influence demography. We find helping evolves more readily when competition is for material resources rather than space because then, the costs of kin competition are paid by downstream relatives. Similarly, harming between species evolves when it alleviates downstream relatives from inter-specific competition. Beyond these examples, our approximation can help better understand the influence of ecological inheritance on a variety of eco-evolutionary dynamics, from plant-pollinator to predator-prey coevolution.",

    "abstract": "Flying animals need constant sensory feedback about their body position and orientation for flight control. The visual system provides essential but slow feedback. In contrast, mechanosensory channels can provide feedback at much shorter timescales. How the contributions from these two senses are integrated remains an open question in most insect groups. In Diptera, fast mechanosensory feedback is provided by organs called halteres, and is crucial for the control of rapid flight manoeuvres, while vision controls manoeuvres in lower temporal frequency bands. Here we have investigated the visual-mechanosensory integration in an insect which lacks halteres: the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. They represent a large group of insects that use Johnstons organs in their antennae to provide mechanosensory feedback on perturbations in body position. High-speed videos of freely-flying hawkmoths hovering at stationary or oscillating artificial flowers showed that positional fidelity during flight was reduced in flagella ablated animals, but was recovered after flagella re-attachment. Our experiments show that antennal mechanosensory feedback specifically mediates fast flight manoeuvres, but not slow ones. Differences in the latency of visual feedback (in different light intensities) affected all antennal conditions equally, suggesting there was no compensatory interaction between antennal and visual feedback under the tested conditions. These results establish the importance of antennal mechanosensors in providing rapid mechanosensory feedback for finer control of flight manoeuvres, acting in parallel to visual feedback.",

    "abstract": "Most patients with advanced cancer eventually acquire resistance to targeted therapies, spurring extensive efforts to identify molecular events mediating therapy resistance. Many of these events involve synthetic rescue (SR) interactions, where the reduction in cancer cell viability caused by targeted gene inactivation is rescued by an adaptive alteration of another gene (the rescuer). Here we perform a genome-wide prediction of SR rescuer genes by analyzing tumor transcriptomics and survival data of 10,000 TCGA cancer patients. Predicted SR interactions are validated in new experimental screens. We show that SR interactions can successfully predict cancer patients response and emerging resistance. Inhibiting predicted rescuer genes sensitizes resistant cancer cells to therapies synergistically, providing initial leads for developing combinatorial approaches to overcome resistance proactively. Finally, we show that the SR analysis of melanoma patients successfully identifies known mediators of resistance to immunotherapy and predicts novel rescuers.",

    "abstract": "Extreme statistics describe the distribution of rare events that can define the timescales of transduction within cellular microdomains. We combine biophysical modeling and analysis of live-cell calcium imaging to explain the fast calcium transient in spines. We show that in the presence of a spine apparatus (SA), which is an extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), calcium transients during synaptic inputs rely on rare and extreme calcium ion trajectories. Using numerical simulations, we predicted the asymmetrical distributions of Ryanodine receptors and SERCA pumps that we confirmed experimentally. When calcium ions are released in the spine head, the fastest ions arriving at the base determine the transient timescale through a calcium-induced calcium release mechanism. In general, the fastest particles arriving at a small target are likely to be a generic mechanism that determines the timescale of molecular transduction in cellular neuroscience.\\n\\nSignificance statementIntrigued by fast calcium transients of few milliseconds in dendritic spines, we investigated its underlying biophysical mechanism. We show here that it is generated by the diffusion of the fastest calcium ions when the spine contains a Spine Apparatus, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum. This timescale is modulated by the initial number of released calcium ions and the asymmetric distribution of its associated calcium release associated Ryanodyne receptors, present only at the base of a spine. This novel mechanism of calcium signaling that we have unraveled here is driven by the fastest particles. To conclude, the rate of arrival of the fastest particles (ions) to a small target receptor defines the timescale of activation instead of the classical forward rate of chemical reactions introduced by von Smoluchowski in 1916. Applying this new rate theory to transduction should refine our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying molecular signaling.",

In contrast to the genome reduction seen in many obligate intracellular bacteria, early genetic studies of Orientia have revealed one of the most repetitive bacterial genomes sequenced to date. The dramatic expansion of mobile elements has hampered efforts to generate complete genome sequences using short read sequencing methodologies, and consequently there have been few studies of the comparative genomics of this neglected species.\\n\\nResultsWe report new high-quality genomes of Orientia tsutsugamushi, generated using PacBio single molecule long read sequencing, for six strains: Karp, Kato, Gilliam, TA686, UT76 and UT176. In comparative genomics analyses of these strains together with existing reference genomes from Ikeda and Boryong strains, we identify a relatively small core genome of 657 genes, grouped into core gene  islands and separated by repeat regions, and use the core genes to infer the first whole-genome phylogeny of Orientia.\\n\\nConclusionsComplete assemblies of multiple Orientia genomes verify initial suggestions that these are remarkable organisms. They have large genomes with widespread amplification of repeat elements and massive chromosomal rearrangements between strains. At the gene level, Orientia has a relatively small set of universally conserved genes, similar to other obligate intracellular bacteria, and the relative expansion in genome size can be accounted for by gene duplication and repeat amplification.

Processing the unattended spoken (written) information was confined to auditory (visual) cortices. In contrast, attending to the spoken (written) story enhanced the stimulus-selective responses in early sensory regions and allowed it to spread into higher-order areas.

    "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling the transcription of gene sets in specific regions of a plant embryo shortly after fertilization remain unknown. Previously, we showed that G564 mRNA, encoding a protein of unknown function, accumulates to high levels in the giant suspensor of both Scarlet Runner Bean (SRB) and Common Bean embryos, and a cis-regulatory module containing three unique DNA sequences, designated as the 10-bp, Region 2, and Fifth motifs, is required for G564 suspensor-specific transcription [Henry, K. F. et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 88(3):207-217 (2015); Kawashima, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 106(9):3627-3632 (2009)]. We tested the hypothesis that these motifs are also required for transcription of the SRB GA 20-oxidase gene, which encodes a gibberellic acid hormone biosynthesis enzyme and is co-expressed with G564 at a high level in giant bean suspensors. We used deletion and gain-of-function experiments in transgenic tobacco embryos to show that two GA 20-oxidase DNA regions are required for suspensor-specific transcription - one in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) (+119 to +205) and another in the 5 upstream region (-341 to -316). Mutagenesis of sequences in these two regions determined that the cis-regulatory motifs required for G564 suspensor transcription are also required for GA 20-oxidase transcription within the suspensor, although the motif arrangement differs. Our results demonstrate the flexibility of motif positioning within a cis-regulatory module that activates gene transcription within giant bean suspensors, and suggest that G564 and GA 20-oxidase comprise part of a suspensor gene regulatory network.\\n\\nSignificanceLittle is known about how genes are expressed in different plant embryo regions. We tested the hypothesis that shared cis-regulatory motifs control the transcription of genes specifically in the suspensor. We carried out functional studies with the Scarlet Runner Bean (SRB) GA 20-oxidase gene that encodes a gibberellic acid (GA) hormone biosynthesis enzyme, and is expressed specifically within the suspensor. We show that cis-regulatory motifs required for GA 20-oxidase transcription within the suspensor are the same as those required for suspensor-specific transcription of the SRB G564 gene, although motif number, spacing and order differ. These cis-elements constitute a control module that is required to activate genes in the SRB suspensor and may form part of a suspensor regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genomic probes (e.g., DNA methylation marks) is becoming a new approach to detect novel genomic risk factors for complex human diseases. The F test is the standard equal-variance test in Statistics. For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases vs. controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA is another mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified differentially variable (DV) microRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV microRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of microRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variance in cases and variance in controls and about the independence among cases and controls. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first clustering algorithm that aims to detect DV genomic probes. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperformed the probe-wise F test and had certain robustness to the violation of the normality assumption. Based on two real datasets about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 7 DV-only microRNAs (hsa-miR-1826, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-194-star, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-502-3p, hsa-miR-93, and hsa-miR-99b) using the proposed method, one (hsa-miR-1826) of which has not yet been reported to relate to HCC in the literature.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing concern about the decline of pollinators worldwide. However, despite reports that pollinator declines are widespread, data are scarce and often geographically and taxonomically biased. These biases limit robust inference about any potential pollinator crisis. Non-structured and opportunistic historical specimen collection data provide the only source of historical information which can serve as a baseline for identifying pollinator declines. Specimens historically collected and preserved in museums not only provide information on where and when species were collected, but also contain other ecological information such as species interactions and morphological traits. Here, we provide a synthesis of how researchers have used historical data to identify long-term changes in biodiversity, species abundances, morphology and pollination services. Despite recent advances, we show that information on the status and trends of most pollinators is absent, but we highlight opportunities and limitations to progress the assessment of pollinator declines globally. Finally, we demonstrate different approaches to analysing museum collection data using two contrasting case studies from distinct geographical regions (New Zealand and Spain) for which long-term pollinator declines have never been assessed. There is immense potential for museum specimens to play a central role in assessing the extent of the global pollination crisis.",

Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular genetic basis underpinning plant-pathogen interactions using commonly measured traits including lesion size and/or pathogen biomass. Yet with the advent of digital imaging and phenomics, there are a large number of additional resistance traits available to study quantitative resistance. In this study, we used high-throughput digital imaging analysis to investigate previously uncharacterized visual traits of plant-pathogen interactions related disease resistance using the Arabidopsis thaliana/Botrytis cinerea pathosystem. Using a large collection of 75 visual traits collected from every lesion, we focused on lesion color, lesion shape, and lesion size, to test how these aspects of the interaction are genetically related. Using genome wide association (GWA) mapping in A. thaliana, we show that lesion color and shape are genetically separable traits associated with plant-disease resistance. Using defined mutants in 23 candidate genes from the GWA mapping, we could identify and show that novel loci associated with each different plant-pathogen interaction trait, which expands our understanding of the functional mechanisms driving plant disease resistance.\\n\\nSummaryDigital imaging allows the identification of genes controlling novel lesion traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn social insects, identical genotypes can show extreme lifespan variation providing a unique perspective on age-associated microbial succession. In honey bees, short and long-lived host phenotypes are polarized by a suite of age-associated factors including hormones, nutrition, immune senescence and oxidative stress. Similar to other model organisms, the aging gut microbiota of short-lived (worker) honey bees accrue Proteobacteria and are depleted of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, consistent with a suite of host senescence markers. In contrast, long-lived (queen) honey bees maintain youthful cellular function without expressing oxidative stress genes, suggesting a very different host environment for age-associated microbial succession.\\n\\nResultsWe sequenced the microbiota of 63 honey bee queens exploring two chronological ages and four alimentary tract niches. To control for individual variation we quantified carbonyl accumulation in queen fat body tissue as a proxy for biological aging. We compared our results to the age-specific microbial succession of worker guts. Accounting for queen source variation, two or more bacterial species per niche differed significantly by queen age. Biological aging in queens was correlated with microbiota composition highlighting the relationship of microbiota with oxidative stress. Queens and workers shared many major gut bacterial species, but differ markedly in community structure and age succession. In stark contrast to aging workers, carbonyl accumulation in queens was significantly associated with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and depletion of various Proteobacteria.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a model system linking changes in gut microbiota to diet and longevity, two of the most confounding variables in human microbiota research. As described for other model systems, metabolic changes associated with diet and host longevity correspond to the changing microbiota. The pattern of age-associated succession in the queen microbiota is largely the reverse of that demonstrated for workers. The guts of short-lived worker phenotypes are progressively dominated by three major Proteobacteria, but these same species were sparse or significantly depleted in long-lived queen phenotypes. More broadly, our results suggest that lifespan evolution formed the context for host-microbial interactions and age-related succession of honey bee microbiota.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA-124 is expressed in neurons, where it represses genes inhibitory for neuronal differentiation, including the RNA binding protein PTBP1. PTBP1 maintains non-neuronal splicing patterns of mRNAs that switch to neuronal isoforms upon neuronal differentiation. We find that pri-miR-124-1 is expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) where mature miR-124 is absent. PTBP1 binds to this precursor RNA upstream of the miRNA stem-loop to inhibit mature miR-124 expression in vivo, and DROSHA cleavage of pri-miR-124-1 in vitro. This new function for PTBP1 in repressing miR-124 biogenesis adds an additional regulatory loop to the already intricate interplay between these two molecules. Applying mathematical modeling to examine the dynamics of this regulation, we find that the pool of pri-miR-124 whose maturation is blocked by PTBP1 creates a robust and self-reinforcing transition in gene expression as PTBP1 is depleted during early neuronal differentiation. While interlocking regulatory loops are often modeled between miRNAs and transcriptional regulators, our results indicate that miRNA targeting of posttranscriptional regulators also reinforces developmental decisions. Notably, induction of neuronal differentiation observed upon PTBP1 knockdown likely results from direct de-repression of miR-124, in addition to indirect effects previously described.",

    "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have garnered much attention as possible links between DNA sequence and the protein factors that mediate DNA methylation. However, the mechanisms by which DNA methylation is directed to specific genomic locations remain poorly understood. We previously identified a lncRNA in mouse, the pitRNA, that was implicated in the control of DNA methylation at the imprinted Rasgrf1 locus. The pitRNA is transcribed in the developing male germline antisense to the differentially methylated region (DMR) that harbors paternal allele methylation, and is driven by a series of tandem repeats that are necessary for imprinted methylation.\\n\\nMitoPLD, a factor necessary for piRNA biogenesis, both processes piRNAs from the pitRNA, and is necessary for complete methylation at the locus, along with piRNA binding proteins. Using two independent mouse systems where pitRNA transcription is driven by the doxycycline-inducible Tet Operator, we demonstrate that pitRNA transcription across the DMR is insufficient for imprinted methylation, and that the Rasgrf1 repeats have additional, critical cis-acting roles for imparting DNA methylation to Rasgrf1, independently of their control of pitRNA transcription. Furthermore, pitRNA overexpression and oocyte loading of pitRNA is insufficient to induce transallelic and transgenerational effects previously reported for Rasgrf1. Notably, manipulation of the pitRNA with the TetOFF system led to transcriptional perturbations over a broad chromosomal region surrounding the inserted Tet Operator, revealing that the effects of this regulatory tool are not localized to a single target gene.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDNA methylation is a heritable genetic modification known to impact vital biological processes. While the proteins that establish, maintain, and remove DNA methylation are well characterized, the mechanisms by which these proteins are directed to specific genetic sequences are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that DNA methylation at the imprinted Rasgrf1 locus requires a DNA element with a series of tandem repeats. These repeats act as a promoter for a long noncoding RNA, the pitRNA, which is targeted by a small noncoding RNA pathway known to silence viral elements in the male germline via DNA methylation. We queried the sufficiency of the pitRNA to mediate DNA methylation at Rasgrf1. We show that, in the absence of the repeats, the pitRNA expression is insufficient to establish imprinted methylation. This work supports a pitRNA-independent mechanism for methylation at Rasgrf1, and a critical cis-acting role for the tandem repeats separate from their control of pitRNA transcription.",

    "abstract": "Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer Collateral synapses. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca2+) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca2+-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin, and CaMKII. Here, we investigate whether RGS14 regulates Ca2+ signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We find the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses due to genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca2+-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca2+ transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca2+ transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca2+ levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca2+ elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent studies of hippocampal area CA2 have provided strong evidence in support of a clear role for this apparently plasticity-resistant subregion of the hippocampus in social, spatial, and temporal aspects of memory. Regulator of G Protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a critical factor that inhibits synaptic plasticity in CA2, but the molecular mechanisms by which RGS14 limits LTP remained unknown. Here we provide new evidence that RGS14 restricts spine calcium (Ca2+) in CA2 neurons and that key downstream Ca2+-activated signaling pathways are required for CA2 plasticity in mice lacking RGS14. These results define a previously unrecognized role for RGS14 as a natural inhibitor of postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling in hippocampal area CA2.",

    "abstract": "Hybridisation and introgression can dramatically alter the relationships among groups of species, leading to phylogenetic discordance across the genome and between populations. Introgression can also erode species differences over time, but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain post-mating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate, which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene, H. cydno and H. timareta, using whole genomes of 92 individuals, and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions, we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic, with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition, long chromosomes, which have lower recombination rates, produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes. Finally, we find a consistent difference between two species pairs on either side of the Andes, which suggests differences in the architecture of the species barriers. Our findings illustrate how the combined effects of hybridisation, recombination and natural selection, acting at multitudes of loci over long periods, can dramatically sculpt the phylogenetic relationships among species.",

    "abstract": "The mycobacterial type VII secretion system ESX-1 is responsible for the secretion of a number of proteins that play important roles during host infection. The regulation of the expression of secreted proteins is often essential to establish successful infection. Using transcriptome sequencing, we found that the abrogation of ESX-1 function in Mycobacterium marinum leads to a pronounced increase in gene expression levels of the espA operon during the infection of macrophages, suggesting an important role in ESX-1-mediated virulence during the early phase of infection. In addition, the disruption of ESX-1-mediated protein secretion also leads to a specific down-regulation of the ESX-1 substrates, but not of the structural components of this system, during growth in culture medium. This effect is observed in both M. marinum and M. tuberculosis. We established that down-regulation of ESX-1 substrates is the result of a regulatory process that is influenced by the putative transcriptional regulator whib6, which is located adjacent to the esx-1 locus. In addition, the overexpression of the ESX-1-associated PE35/PPE68 protein pair resulted in a significantly increased secretion of the ESX-1 substrate EsxA, demonstrating a functional link between these proteins. Taken together, these data show that WhiB6 is required for the secretion-dependent regulation of ESX-1 substrates and that ESX-1 substrates are regulated independently from the structural components, both during infection and as a result of active secretion.",

    "abstract": "In real-world vision, humans are constantly confronted with complex environments that contain a multitude of objects. These environments are spatially structured, so that objects have different likelihoods of appearing in specific parts of the visual space. Our massive experience with such positional regularities prompts the hypothesis that the processing of individual objects varies in efficiency across the visual field: when objects are encountered in their typical locations (e.g., we are used to seeing lamps in the upper visual field and carpets in the lower visual field), they should be more efficiently perceived than when they are encountered in atypical locations (e.g., a lamp in the lower visual field and a carpet in the upper visual field). Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by showing that typical positioning facilitates an objects access to awareness. In two continuous flash suppression experiments, objects more efficiently overcame inter-ocular suppression when they were presented in visual-field locations that matched their typical locations in the environment, as compared to non-typical locations. This finding suggests that through extensive experience the visual system has adapted to the statistics of the environment. This adaptation may be particularly useful for rapid object individuation in natural scenes.",

However, it is heavily debated whether and what feature information is predictively remapped during the pre-saccadic interval. Using an orientation adaptation paradigm, we investigated whether predictive remapping occurs for stimulus features and whether adaptation itself is remapped. We found strong evidence for predictive remapping of a stimulus presented shortly before saccade onset, but no remapping of adaptation. Furthermore, we establish that predictive remapping also occurs for stimuli that are not saccade targets, pointing toward a  forward remapping process operating across the whole visual field. Together, our findings suggest that predictive feature remapping of object information plays an important role in mediating visual stability.",
