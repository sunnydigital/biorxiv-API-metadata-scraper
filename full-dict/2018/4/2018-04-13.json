    "abstract": "Acquisition of foreign DNA by natural transformation is an important mechanism of adaptation and evolution in diverse microbial species. Here, we characterize the mechanism of ComM, a broadly conserved AAA+ protein previously implicated in homologous recombination of transforming DNA (tDNA) in naturally competent Gram-negative bacterial species. In vivo, we found that ComM was required for efficient comigration of linked genetic markers in Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi, which is consistent with a role in branch migration. Also, ComM was particularly important for integration of tDNA with increased sequence heterology, suggesting that its activity promotes the acquisition of novel DNA sequences. In vitro, we showed that purified ComM binds ssDNA, oligomerizes into a hexameric ring, and has bidirectional helicase and branch migration activity. Based on these data, we propose a model for tDNA integration during natural transformation. This study provides mechanistic insight into the enigmatic steps involved in tDNA integration and uncovers the function of a protein required for this conserved mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "We employ a reporter assay and Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-seq) to study translational regulation by RNA-binding proteins, in bacteria. We designed 82 constructs, each with a single hairpin based on the binding sites of the RNA-binding coat proteins of phages MS2, PP7, GA, and Q{beta}, at various positions within the N-terminus of a reporter gene. In the absence of RNA-binding proteins, the translation level depends on hairpin location, and exhibits a three-nucleotide periodicity. For hairpin positions within the initiation region, we observe strong translational repression in the presence of its cognate RNA-binding protein. In vivo SHAPE-seq results for a representative construct indicate that the repression phenomenon correlates with a wide-swath of protection, including the hairpin and extending past the ribosome binding site. Consequently, our data suggest that the protection provided by the RBP-hairpin complex inhibits ribosomal initiation. Finally, utilizing the repression phenomenon for quantifying protein-RNA binding affinity in vivo, we both observe partially contrasting results to previous in vitro and in situ studies, and additionally, show that this method can be used in a high-throughput assay for a quantitative study of protein-RNA binding in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We study translational regulation by a 5 UTR sequence encoding the binding site of an RNA-binding protein (RBP) in bacteria, using a reporter assay and Selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq). We tested constructs containing a single hairpin, based on the binding sites of the coat RBPs of bacteriophages GA, MS2, PP7, and Q{beta}, positioned in the 5 UTR of a reporter gene. With specifically-bound RBP present, either weak repression or up-regulation is observed, depending on the binding site and its flanking sequence. SHAPE-Seq data for a representative construct exhibiting up-regulation, indicates a partially-folded hairpin and non-reactive upstream and downstream flanking region, which we attribute to intermediate structures that apparently blocks translation. RBP binding stabilizes the fully-folded hairpin state and thus facilitates translation, suggesting that the up-regulating constructs are RBP-sensing riboswitches. This finding is further supported by lengthening the binding-site stem, which in turn destabilizes the translationally-inactive state, and abolishes the up-regulating behavior. Finally, we found that the combination of two binding sites, positioned in the 5 UTR and gene-header of the same transcript, can yield a cooperative regulatory response. Together, we show that the interaction of an RBP with its RNA target facilitates structural changes in the RNA, which is reflected by a controllable range of binding affinities and dose response behaviors. Thus, demonstrating that RNA-RBP interactions can provide a platform for constructing gene regulatory networks that are based on translational, rather than transcriptional, regulation.",

The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.",

    "abstract": "Antigenic targets of influenza vaccination are currently seen to be polarised between (i) highly immunogenic (and protective) epitopes of high variability, and (ii) conserved epitopes of low immunogenicity. This requires vaccines directed against the variable sites to be continuously updated, with the only other alternative being seen as the artificial boosting of immunity to invariant epitopes of low natural efficacy. However, theoretical models suggest that the antigenic evolution of influenza is best explained by postulating the existence of highly immunogenic epitopes of limited variability. Here we report the identification of such an epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein. We show that the epitope mediates immunity to historical influenza strains not previously seen by a cohort of young children. Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce immunity to all the human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918. The identification of epitopes of limited variability offers a mechanism by which a universal influenza vaccine can be created; these vaccines would also have the potential to protect against newly emerging influenza strains.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix stiffness has a profound effect on the behaviour of many cell types. Adherent cells apply contractile forces to the material on which they adhere, and sense the resistance of the material to deformation - its stiffness. This is dependent on both the elastic modulus and the thickness of the material, with the corollary that single cells are able to sense underlying stiff materials through soft hydrogel materials at low (<10 {micro}m) thicknesses. Here, we hypothesised that cohesive colonies of cells exert more force and create more hydrogel deformation than single cells, therefore enabling them to mechanosense more deeply into underlying materials than single cells. To test this, we modulated the thickness of soft (1 kPa) elastic ECM-functionalised polyacrylamide hydrogels adhered to glass substrates and allowed colonies of MG63 cells to form on their surfaces. Cell morphology and deformations of fluorescent fiducial-marker labelled hydrogels were quantified by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy imaging. Single cell spreading increased with respect to decreasing hydrogel thickness, with data fitting to an exponential model with half-maximal response at a thickness of 3.2 m. By quantifying cell area within colonies of defined area, we similarly found that colony-cell spreading increased with decreasing hydrogel thickness but with a greater halfmaximal response at 54 m. Depth-sensing was dependent on ROCK-mediated cellular  contractility. Surface hydrogel deformations were significantly greater on thick hydrogels compared to thin hydrogels. In addition, deformations extended greater distances from the periphery of colonies on thick hydrogels compared to thin hydrogels. Our data suggest that by acting collectively, cells mechanosense rigid materials beneath elastic hydrogels at greater depths than individual cells. This raises the possibility that the collective action of cells in colonies or sheets may allow cells to sense structures of differing material properties at comparatively large distances.",

    "abstract": "Tumour recurrence post chemotherapy is an established clinical problem and many cancer types are often observed to be increasingly drug resistant subsequent to chemotherapy treatments. Drug resistance in cancer is a multipart phenomenon which can be derived from several origins and in many cases it has been observed that cancer cells have the ability to possess, acquire and communicate drug resistant traits.\\n\\nHere, an in silico framework is developed in order to study drug resistance and drug response in cancer cell populations exhibiting various drug resistant features. The framework is based on an on-lattice hybrid multiscale mathematical model and is equipped to simulate multiple mechanisms on different scales that contribute towards chemotherapeutic drug resistance in cancer. This study demonstrates how drug resistant tumour features may depend on the interplay amongst intracellular, extracelluar and intercellular factors. On a cellular level, drug resistant cell phenotypes are here derived from inheritance or mutations that are spontaneous, drug-induced or communicated via exosomes. Furthermore intratumoural heterogeneity and spatio-temporal drug dynamics heavily influences drug delivery and the development of drug resistant cancer cell subpopulations. Chemotherapy treatment strategies are here optimised for various in silico tumour scenarios and treatment objectives. We demonstrate that optimal chemotherapy treatment strategies drastically depend on which drug resistant mechanisms are activated, and that furthermore suboptimal chemotherapy administration may promote drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Observation techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution, such as single-particle tracking (SPT) based on interferometric Scattering (iSCAT) microscopy, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy applied on a super-resolution STED microscope (STED-FCS), have revealed new insights of the molecular organization of membranes. While delivering complementary information, there are still distinct differences between these techniques, most prominently the use of fluorescent dye-tagged probes for STED-FCS and a need for larger scattering gold nanoparticle tags for iSCAT. In this work we have used lipid analogues tagged with a hybrid fluorescent tag - gold nanoparticle construct, to directly compare the results from STED-FCS and iSCAT measurements of phospholipid diffusion on a homogeneous Supported Lipid Bilayer (SLB). These comparative measurements showed that while the mode of diffusion remained free, at least at the spatial (>40 nm) and temporal (50 [&le;] t [&le;] 100 ms) scales probed, the diffussion coefficient was reduced by 20- to 60-fold when tagging with 20 and 40 nm large gold particles as compared to when using dye-tagged lipid analogues. These FCS measurements of hybrid fluorescent tag - gold nanoparticle labeled lipids also revealed that commercially supplied streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles contain large quantities of free streptavidin. Finally, the values of apparent diffusion coefficients obtained by STED-FCS and iSCAT differed by a factor of 2-3 across the techniques, while relative differences in mobility between different species of lipid analogues considered were identical in both approaches. In conclusion, our experiments reveal that large and potentially crosslinking scattering tags introduce a significant slow-down in diffusion on SLBs but no additional bias, and our labeling approach creates a new way of exploiting complementary information from STED-FCS and iSCAT measurements.",

We present DRUID--Deep Relatedness Utilizing Identity by Descent--a method that works by inferring the identical by descent (IBD) sharing profile of an ungenotyped ancestor of a set of close relatives. Using this IBD profile, DRUID infers relatedness between unobserved ancestors and more distant relatives, thereby combining information from multiple samples to remove one or more generations between the deep relationships to be identified. DRUID constructs sets of close relatives by detecting full siblings and also uses a novel approach to identify the aunts/uncles of two or more siblings, recovering 92.2% of real aunts/uncles with zero false positives. In real and simulated data, DRUID correctly infers up to 10.5% more relatives than PADRE when using data from two sets of distantly related siblings, and 10.7-31.3% more relatives given two sets of siblings and their aunts/uncles. DRUID frequently infers relationships either correctly or within one degree of the truth, with PADRE classifying 43.3-58.3% of tenth degree relatives in this way compared to 79.6-96.7% using DRUID.",

Retrospective and prospective designs were used mostly (45% and 41% of the surveys, respectively) with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The de[fi]nition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g. a non-physical contact may require conversation, close proximity or both. Age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend) and household size were identi[fi]ed as relevant determinants for contact pattern across a large number of studies. The surveys present a wide range of study designs. Throughout, we found that the overall contact patterns were remarkably robust for the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, de[fi]nition of contact), we could identify a common practice approach that can be used to facilitate comparison between studies and for benchmarking future studies.",

    "abstract": "Alternatively spliced genes produce multiple spliced isoforms, called transcript variants. In differential alternative splicing, the relative abundance of transcript variants differs across sample types. Differential alternative splicing is common in animal systems and influences cellular development in many processes, but its extent and significance is not as well known in plants. To investigate alternative splicing in plants, we examined rice seedling RNA-Seq data that included approximately 40 million sequence alignments per library, three libraries per sample type, and four sample types: roots and shoots, each treated with exogenous cytokinin delivered hydroponically, plus mock-treated controls. Cytokinin treatment triggered expression changes in thousands of genes, but had minimal effect on alternative splicing. However, there were many splicing differences between roots and shoots. Analysis of a similar (but less deeply sequenced) mRNA-Seq data set from Arabidopsis showed the same pattern. Quantitative fragment analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products made from newly prepared rice samples confirmed nine of ten differential splicing events between rice roots and shoots. In both the Arabidopsis and rice mRNA-Seq data sets, most genes annotated as alternatively spliced had small minor variant frequencies, i.e., the less frequently observed forms were supported by fewer than 20% of informative mRNA-Seq sequences. Of splicing choices where there was more abundant support for minor forms, most alternative splicing events were located within the protein-coding sequence and also maintained the annotated reading frame. A tool for visualizing protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence (ProtAnnot) together with a genome browser (Integrated Genome Browser) were used to visualize and assess effects of differential splicing on gene function. In general, differentially spliced regions coincided with conserved regions in the encoded proteins, indicating that differential alternative splicing is likely to affect protein function between root and shoot tissue in rice.",

    "abstract": "Over the past twenty years, neuroscience research on reward-based learning has converged on a canonical model, under which the neurotransmitter dopamine  stamps in associations between situations, actions and rewards by modulating the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. However, a growing number of recent findings have placed this standard model under strain. In the present work, we draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence to introduce a new theory of reward-based learning. Here, the dopamine system trains another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, to operate as its own free-standing learning system. This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian brain is composed of diverse, specialized cell populations, few of which we fully understand. To more systematically ascertain and learn from cellular specializations in the brain, we used Drop-seq to perform single-cell RNA sequencing of 690,000 cells sampled from nine regions of the adult mouse brain: frontal and posterior cortex (156,000 and 99,000 cells, respectively), hippocampus (113,000), thalamus (89,000), cerebellum (26,000), and all of the basal ganglia - the striatum (77,000), globus pallidus externus/nucleus basalis (66,000), entopeduncular/subthalamic nuclei (19,000), and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (44,000). We developed computational approaches to distinguish biological from technical signals in single-cell data, then identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells, which we annotate and present through interactive online software we developed for visualizing and re-analyzing these data (DropViz). Comparison of cell classes and types across regions revealed features of brain organization. These included a neuronal gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components; widely shared patterns in the combinatorial co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels by diverse neuronal populations; functional distinctions among cells of the brain vasculature; and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions to a degree not observed in other neuronal or non-neuronal populations. We describe systematic neuronal classifications for two complex, understudied regions of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externus and substantia nigra reticulata. In the striatum, where neuron types have been intensely researched, our data reveal a previously undescribed population of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) comprising 4% of SPNs. The adult mouse brain cell atlas can serve as a reference for analyses of development, disease, and evolution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith aging, the incidence of neuropathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases increases in the brains of cognitively healthy individuals. It is currently unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort agreed to post-mortem brain donation. Centenarians self-reported to be cognitive healthy at baseline, which was confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health, objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that most neuropathological hallmarks related to age and neurodegenerative diseases such as A{beta} and Tau pathology, as well as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by A{beta}-associated pathologies. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in the centenarians. In conclusion, we find that while the centenarians in this cohort escaped or delayed cognitive impairment until extreme ages, their brains reveal varying levels of disease-associated neuropathological hallmarks, some of which associate with cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia 28 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by missense mutations affecting the proteolytic domain of AFG3L2, a major component of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease. However, little is known of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms or how to treat patients with SCA28. Currently available Afg3l2 mutant mice harbour deletions that lead to severe, early-onset neurological phenotypes that do not faithfully reproduce the late-onset and slowly progressing SCA28 phenotype. Here we describe production and detailed analysis of a new knock-in murine model harbouring an Afg3l2 allele carrying the p.Met665Arg patient-derived mutation. Heterozygous mutant mice developed normally but signs of ataxia were detectable by beam test at 18 months. Cerebellar pathology was negative; electrophysiological analysis showed increased spontaneous firing in Purkinje cells from heterozygous mutants with respect to wild-type controls, although not statistically significant. As homozygous mutants died perinatally with evidence of cardiac atrophy, for each genotype we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to investigate mitochondrial function. MEFs from mutant mice showed altered mitochondrial bioenergetics, with decreased basal oxygen consumption rate, ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial network formation and morphology was also altered, in line with greatly reduced expression of Opa1 fusogenic protein L-isoforms. The mitochondrial alterations observed in MEFs were also detected in cerebella of 18-month-old heterozygous mutants, suggesting they may be a hallmark of disease. Pharmacological inhibition of de novo mitochondrial protein translation with chloramphenicol caused reversal of mitochondrial morphology in homozygous mutant MEFs, supporting the relevance of mitochondrial proteotoxicity for SCA28 pathogenesis and therapy development.",

    "abstract": "The endosomal FYVE- and WD40-domain-containing protein WDFY2 has been assigned a function as tumour suppressor, but its functional mechanism has remained elusive. Here we have used confocal, widefield and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to show that WDFY2 localizes to the base of retromer-containing endosomal tubules by a mechanism that involves recognition of a specific pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) by the WDFY2 FYVE domain. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry identified the v-SNARE VAMP3 as an interaction partner of WDFY2, and cellular knockout of WDFY2 caused a strong redistribution of VAMP3 into small vesicles near the plasma membrane. This was accompanied by increased secretion of the matrix metalloprotease MT1-MMP, enhanced degradation of extracellular matrix, and increased cell invasion. WDFY2 is frequently lost in metastatic cancers, most predominantly in ovarian and prostate cancer. We propose that WDFY2 acts as a tumor suppressor by serving as a gatekeeper for VAMP3 recycling.",

    "abstract": "Plants defend themselves against pathogens by activating an array of immune responses. Unfortunately, immunity programs may also cause unintended collateral damage to the plant itself. The quantitative disease resistance gene ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) serves as a nexus for the trade-off between growth and pathogen resistance in wild populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. An autoimmune allele, ACD6-Est, first identified in the natural accession Est-1, is found in over 10% of wild strains, even though it causes a clear fitness penalty under optimal growth conditions. There is, however, extensive variation in the strength of the autoimmune phenotype expressed by strains with an ACD6-Est allele, indicative of genetic modifiers. Quantitative genetic analysis suggests that the population genetic basis of ACD6 modulation is complex, with different strains often carrying different large-effect modifiers. One modifier is SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1), located in a highly polymorphic cluster of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes, which are prototypes for qualitative disease resistance genes. Allelic variation at SNC1 correlates with ACD6-Est activity in multiple accessions, and a common structural variant affecting the NL linker sequence can explain differences in SNC1 activity. Taken together, we find that an NLR gene can mask the activity of an ACD6 autoimmune allele in natural A. thaliana populations, thereby linking different arms of the plant immune system.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPlants defend themselves against pathogens by activating immune responses. Unfortunately, these can cause unintended collateral damage to the plant itself. Nevertheless, some wild plants have genetic variants that confer a low threshold for the activation of immunity. While these enable a plant to respond particularly quickly to pathogen attack, such variants might be potentially dangerous. We are investigating one such variant of the immune gene ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6) in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We discovered that there are variants at other genetic loci that can mask the effects of an overly active ACD6 gene. One of these genes, SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1), codes for a known immune receptor. The SNC1 variant that attenuates ACD6 activity is rather common in A. thaliana populations, suggesting that new combinations of the hyperactive ACD6 variant and this antagonistic SNC1 variant will often arise by natural crosses. Similarly, because the two genes are unlinked, outcrossing will often lead to the hyperactive ACD6 variants being unmasked again. We propose that allelic diversity at SNC1 contributes to the maintenance of the hyperactive ACD6 variant in natural A. thaliana populations.",

    "abstract": "AimsFamilial recurrence studies provide strong evidence for a genetic component to the predisposition to sporadic, non-syndromic Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) phenotype. Rare genetic variants have been identified as important contributors to the risk of CHD, but relatively small numbers of TOF cases have been studied to date. Here, we use whole exome sequencing to assess the prevalence of rare, potentially deleterious variants in candidate genes previously associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic TOF, in the largest cohort of non-syndromic TOF patients reported to date.\\n\\nMethods & Results829 non-syndromic TOF patients underwent whole exome sequencing. A systematic review of the literature was conducted which revealed 77 genes in which mutations had been reported in patients with TOF. The presence of rare, deleterious variants in the 77 candidate genes was determined, defined by a minor allele frequency of [&le;] 0.001 and scaled combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score of [&ge;] 20. We found a clustering of heterozygous rare, deleterious variants in NOTCH1 (P=1.89E-15), DOCK6 (P=2.93E-07), MYOM2 (P= 7.35E-05), TTC37 (P=0.016), MESP1 (P=0.024) and TBX1 (P=0.039), after correcting for multiple testing. NOTCH1 was most frequently found to harbour deleterious variants. Changes were observed in 49 patients (6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.5% - 7.8%) and included six truncating/frameshift variants and forty missense variants. Sanger sequencing of the unaffected parents of thirteen cases identified five de novo variants. Variants were not confined to a single functional domain of the NOTCH1 protein but significant clustering of variants was evident in the EGF-like repeats (P=0.018). Three NOTCH1 missense variants (p.G200R, p.C607Y and de novo p.N1875S) were subjected to functional evaluation and showed a reduction in Jagged1 ligand-induced NOTCH signalling. p.C607Y, which exhibited the most significant reduction in signalling, also perturbed S1 cleavage of the NOTCH1 receptor in the Golgi.\\n\\nConclusionThe NOTCH1 locus is a frequent site of genetic variants predisposing to non-syndromic TOF with 6% of patients exhibiting rare, deleterious variants.

Whether these associations reflect shared predisposing risk factors and/or causal consequences of alcohol use remains poorly understood.\\n\\nMethodsData came from 3 neuroimaging samples (total n=2,423), spanning childhood/adolescence to middle age, with prospective or family-based data. First, we identified replicable GMV correlates of alcohol use. Next, we used family-based and longitudinal data to test whether these associations may plausibly reflect a predispositional liability for alcohol use, and/or a causal consequence of alcohol use. Finally, we evaluated whether GWAS-defined genomic risk for alcohol consumption is enriched for genes preferentially expressed in regions identified in our neuroimaging analyses, using heritability and gene-set enrichment, and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) approaches.\\n\\nResultsSmaller right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; i.e., middle and superior frontal gyri) and insula GMVs were associated with increased alcohol use across samples. Family-based and prospective longitudinal data suggest these associations are genetically conferred and that DLPFC GMV prospectively predicts future use and initiation. Genomic risk for alcohol use was enriched in gene-sets preferentially expressed in the DLPFC and associated with differential expression of C16orf93, CWF19L1, and C18orf8 in the DLPFC.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest that smaller DLPFC and insula GMV plausibly represent predispositional risk factors for, as opposed to consequences of, alcohol use.

Cas9 can be dislodged by translocating RNA polymerases, but only if the polymerase approaches one direction towards the Cas9-DSB complex. By exploiting these RNA polymerase-Cas9 interactions, Cas9 can be conditionally converted into a multi-turnover nuclease, mediating increased mutagenesis frequencies in mammalian cells and enhancing bacterial immunity to bacteriophages. These consequences of a stable Cas9-DSB complex provide insights into the evolution of PAM sequences and a simple method of improving selection of highly active sgRNA for genome editing.",

For matched focality and energy, the depth of a figure-8 coil can be increased by 22%.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/300616_fig8.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 8\\\">\\nView larger version (14K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af0b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4118d8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c61f80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e23fa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 8.C_FLOATNO Energy, W, vs. spread, S1/2, curves for hand knob stimulation for a conventional figure-8 coil and optimized fdTMS coil on a 32 x 32 cm square plane.\\n\\nC_FIG ConclusionComputational design of TMS coils could enable more selective targeting of the induced E-field.

    "abstract": "Species range limits offer powerful opportunities to study environmental factors regulating distributions and probe the limits of adaptation. However, we rarely know what aspects of the environment are actually constraining range expansion, much less which traits are mediating the organisms response to these environmental gradients. Though most studies focus on climatic limits to species distributions, biotic interactions may be just as important. We used field experiments and simulations to estimate contributions of mammal herbivory to a range boundary in the annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. A steep gradient of increasing probability of herbivory occurs across the boundary, and herbivory drives several-fold declines in lifetime fitness at and beyond the boundary. By including in our analyses data from a sister taxon with more rapid phenology, we show that delayed phenology drives C. xantiana ssp. xantianas susceptibility to herbivory and low fitness beyond its border.",

    "abstract": "Finding approximate occurrences of a pattern in a text using a full-text index is a central problem in bioinformatics and has been extensively researched. Bidirectional indices have opened new possibilities in this regard allowing the search to start from anywhere within the pattern and extend in both directions. In particular, use of search schemes (partitioning the pattern and searching the pieces in certain orders with given bounds on errors) can yield significant speed-ups. However, finding optimal search schemes is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem.\\n\\nHere for the first time, we propose a mixed integer program (MIP) capable to solve this optimization problem for Hamming distance with given number of pieces. Our experiments show that the optimal search schemes found by our MIP significantly improve the performance of search in bidirectional FM-index upon previous ad-hoc solutions. For example, approximate matching of 101-bp Illumina reads (with two errors) becomes 35 times faster than standard backtracking. Moreover, despite being performed purely in the index, the running time of search using our optimal schemes (for up to two errors) is comparable to the best state-of-the-art aligners, which benefit from combining search in index with in-text verification using dynamic programming. As a result, we anticipate a full-fledged aligner that employs an intelligent combination of search in the bidirectional FM-index using our optimal search schemes and in-text verification using dynamic programming that will outperform todays best aligners. The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.",

    "abstract": "There is an increased need for integrative analyses of multi-omic data. Although several algorithms for analysing multi-omic data exist, no study has yet performed a detailed comparison of these methods in biologically relevant contexts. Here we benchmark a novel tensorial independent component analysis (tICA) algorithm against current state-of-the-art methods. Using simulated and real multi-omic data, we find that tICA outperforms established methods in identifying biological sources of data variation at a significantly reduced computational cost. Using two independent multi cell-type EWAS, we further demonstrate how tICA can identify, in the absence of genotype information, mQTLs at a higher sensitivity than competing multi-way algorithms. We validate mQTLs found with tICA in an independent set, and demonstrate that approximately 75% of mQTLs are independent of blood cell subtype. In an application to multi-omic cancer data, tICA identifies many gene modules whose expression variation across tumors is driven by copy number or DNA methylation changes, but whose deregulation relative to the normal state is independent such alterations, an important finding that we confirm by direct analysis of individual data types. In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.",

    "abstract": "While sustainable development goals are by their nature global, their achievement requires local action and thus targeting and monitoring sustainable solutions tailored to different social and ecological contexts. Ostrom stressed that there are no panaceas or universal solutions to environmental problems, and developed a social-ecological systems (SES) framework -a nested multi-tier set of variables- to help diagnose problems, identify complex interactions, and solutions tailored to each SES arena. The framework has been applied to over a hundred cases, typically reflecting in-depth analysis of local case studies, but with relatively small coverage in space and time. While case studies are context rich and necessary, it can be difficult to upscale their lessons to policy making realms. Here we develop a data driven method for upscaling Ostroms SES framework and apply it to a context where data is scarce, incomplete, but also where sustainable solutions are needed. The purpose of upscaling the framework is to create a tool that facilitates decision-making on data scarce contexts such as developing countries. We mapped SES by applying the SES framework to poverty alleviation and food security issues in the Volta River basin in Ghana and Burkina Faso. We found archetypical configurations of SES in space. Given data availability, we study their change over time, and discuss where agricultural innovations such as water reservoirs might have a stronger impact at increasing food security and therefore alleviating poverty and hunger. We conclude by outlining how the method can be used in other SES comparative studies.",

    "abstract": "Different human populations facing similar environmental challenges have sometimes evolved convergent biological adaptations, for example hypoxia resistance at high altitudes and depigmented skin in northern latitudes on separate continents. The pygmy phenotype (small adult body size), a characteristic of hunter-gatherer populations inhabiting both African and Asian tropical rainforests, is often highlighted as another case of convergent adaptation in humans. However, the degree to which phenotypic convergence in this polygenic trait is due to convergent vs. population-specific genetic changes is unknown. To address this question, we analyzed high-coverage sequence data from the protein-coding portion of the genomes (exomes) of two pairs of populations, Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and neighboring Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda, and Andamanese rainforest hunter-gatherers (Jarawa and Onge) and Brahmin agriculturalists from India. We observed signatures of convergent positive selection between the Batwa and Andamanese rainforest hunter-gatherers across the set of genes with annotated  growth factor binding functions (p < 0.001). Unexpectedly, for the rainforest groups we also observed convergent and population-specific signatures of positive selection in pathways related to cardiac development (e.g.  cardiac muscle tissue development; p = 0.001). We hypothesize that the growth hormone sub-responsiveness likely underlying the pygmy phenotype may have led to compensatory changes in cardiac pathways, in which this hormone also plays an essential role. Importantly, in the agriculturalist populations we did not observe similar patterns of positive selection on sets of genes associated with either growth or cardiac development, indicating that our results most likely reflect a history of convergent adaptation to the similar ecology of rainforest hunter-gatherers rather than a more common or general evolutionary pattern for human populations.",

    "abstract": "Immunological assays performed in different laboratories participating in multi-centre clinical trials must be standardized in order to generate comparable and reliable data. This entails standardized procedures for sample collection, processing, freezing and storage. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) partnered with local institutions to establish Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP)-accredited laboratories to support clinical trials in Africa, Europe and Asia. Here we report on the performance of seven laboratories based in Africa and Europe in the interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-{gamma} ELISpot) assay and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) processing over four years. Characterized frozen PBMC samples from 48 volunteer blood packs processed at a central laboratory were sent to participating laboratories. For each stimulus, there were 1751 assays performed over four years. 98% of these ELISpot data were within acceptable ranges with low responses to mock stimuli. There were no significant differences in ELISpot responses at five laboratories actively conducting immunological analyses in support of IAVI sponsored clinical trials or HIV research. In a separate study, 1,297 PBMC samples isolated from healthy HIV-1 negative participants in clinical trials of two prophylactic HIV vaccine candidates were analysed for PBMC yield from fresh blood and cell recovery and viability following freezing and thawing. 94 % and 96 % of samples had fresh PBMC viabilities and cell yields within the pre-defined acceptance criteria while for frozen PBMC, 99 % and 96 % of samples had acceptable viabilities and cell recoveries respectively, along with acceptable ELISpot responses in 95%. These findings demonstrate the competency of laboratories across different continents to generate comparable and reliable data in support of clinical trials.\\n\\nImportanceThere is a need for the establishment of an African network of laboratories to support large clinical trials across the continent to support and further the development of vaccine candidates against emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika and dengue viruses and the continued HIV-1 pandemic. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa where the HIV-1 pandemic is most severe. In this report we have demonstrated by using standardized SOPs, training, equipment and reagents that GCLP-accredited clinical trial laboratories based in Africa and Europe can process clinical trial samples and maintain cell integrity and functionality demonstrated by IFN-{gamma} ELISpot testing, producing comparable and reliable data.",

    "abstract": "Interferon- (IFN-) induces the transfer of resistance to hepatitis B virus (HBV) from liver nonparenchymal cells (LNPCs) to hepatocytes via exosomes. However, little is known about the entry machinery and pathway involved in the transmission of IFN--induced antiviral activity. Here, we found that macrophage exosomes depend on T cell immunoglobulin and mucin receptor 1 (TIM-1), a hepatitis A virus (HAV) receptor, to enter hepatocytes for delivering IFN--induced anti-HBV activity. Moreover, two primary endocytic routes for virus infection, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and macropinocytosis, collaborate to permit exosome entry and anti-HBV activity transfer. Subsequently, lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), an anionic lipid closely related to endosome penetration of virus, facilitates membrane fusion of exosomes in late endosomes/ multivesicular bodies (LEs/MVBs) and the accompanying exosomal cargo uncoating. Together, this study provides comprehensive insights into the transmission route of macrophage exosomes to efficiently deliver IFN--induced anti-HBV activity and highlights the similarities between the entry mechanisms of exosomes and virus.\\n\\nImportanceOur previous study showed that LNPC-derived exosomes could transmit IFN--induced antiviral activity to HBV replicating hepatocytes, but the concrete transmission mechanisms which include exosome entry and exosomal cargo release remain unclear. In this study, we found that virus entry machinery and pathway were also applied to exosome-mediated cell-to-cell antiviral activity transfer. Macrophage-derived exosomes exploit hepatitis A virus receptor for access to hepatocytes. Later, CME and macropinocytosis are utilized by exosomes which is followed by exosome-endosome fusion for efficient transfer of IFN--induced anti-HBV activity. Dissecting the similarities between exosome and virus entry will be beneficial to designing exosomes as efficient vehicles for antiviral therapy.",

To overcome this drawback, serum beta-D-glucan (BG) and P. insidiosum specific antibody (Pi-Ab) were examined as potential monitoring markers in vascular pythiosis.\\n\\nMethodsA prospective cohort study of vascular pythiosis patients was carried on during January 2010-July 2016. Clinical information and blood samples were collected and evaluated by the BG and Pi-Ab assays. Linear mixed effect models were used to compare BG and Pi-Ab levels. The in vitro susceptibility test was performed in all P. insidiosum isolates from culture positive cases.\\n\\nResultsA total of 50 patients were enrolled; 45 survived and 5 died during follow-up. The survivors had a significantly shorter time to medical care (p<0.0001) and a significantly shorter waiting time to the first surgery (p<0.0001). There were no differences in BG levels among the groups at diagnosis (p=0.17); however, BG levels among survivors were significantly lower than the deceased group at 0.5 months (p<0.0001) and became undetectable after 3 months. Survivors were able to maintain ELISA value (EV) of Pi-Ab above 8, whereas EV among deceased patients was less than 4. In vitro susceptibility results revealed no synergistic effects between itraconazole and terbinafine.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study showed that BG and Pi-Ab were potentially valuable markers to monitor the disease after treatment initiation. An unchanged BG level at 2 weeks after surgery should prompt an evaluation for residual disease.",

    "abstract": "Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are increasingly recognized to be associated with intralumenal microbial biofilms, and effective measures for the prevention and treatment of BSI remain lacking. This report evaluates a new commercially developed antimicrobial catheter lock solution (ACL) containing trimethoprim (5 mg/ml) and ethanol (25%) and CA-EDTA 3% for activity against bacterial and fungal biofilms using in vitro and in vivo (rabbit) catheter biofilm models. Biofilms were formed with bacterial (seven different species including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, VRE) or fungal (C. albicans) species on catheter materials. Biofilm formation was evaluated by quantitative culture (colony forming units, CFUs) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Treatment with ACL inhibited growth of adhesion phase biofilms in vitro after 60 min (VRE) or 15 min (all others), while mature biofilms were eradicated after exposure for 2 or 4 h, compared to control. Similar results were observed for drug-resistant bacteria. In the catheterized rabbit model, when compared against heparinized saline control, ACL lock therapy significantly reduced the catheter bacterial (3.49 {+/-} 0.75 vs. 0.03 {+/-} 0.06 log CFU/catheter, respectively; P = 0.001) and fungal burden (2.48 {+/-} 1.60 vs. 0.55 {+/-} 1.19 log CFU/catheter segment, respectively; P = 0.012). SEM also demonstrated eradication of bacterial and fungal biofilms in vivo on catheters exposed to ACL, while vigorous biofilms were observed on untreated control catheters. Our results demonstrate that ACL was efficacious against both adhesion phase and mature biofilms formed by bacteria and fungi in vitro as well as in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria prioritize sugar metabolism via carbohydrate catabolite repression, which regulates global gene expression to optimize the catabolism of preferred substrates. Here, we report an unusual long-term memory effect in certain Streptococcus mutans strains that alters adaptation to growth on lactose after prior exposure to glucose or fructose. In strain GS-5, cells that were first cultured on fructose then transferred to lactose displayed an exceptionally long lag (>11 h) and slower growth, compared to cells first cultured on glucose or cellobiose, which displayed a reduction in lag phase by as much as 10 h. Mutants lacking the cellobiose-PTS or phospho-{beta}-glucosidase lost the accelerated growth on lactose associated with prior culturing on glucose. The memory effects of glucose or fructose on lactose catabolism were not as profound in strain UA159, but the lag phase was considerably shorter in mutants lacking the glucose-PTS EIIMan. Interestingly, when S. mutans was cultivated on lactose, significant quantities of free glucose accumulated in the medium, with higher levels found in the cultures of strains lacking EIIMan, glucokinase, or both. Free glucose was also detected in cultures that were utilizing cellobiose or trehalose, albeit at lower levels. Such release of hexoses by S. mutans is likely of biological significance as it was found that cells required small amounts of glucose or other preferred carbohydrates to initiate efficient growth on lactose. These findings suggest that S. mutans modulates the induction of lactose utilization based on its prior exposure to glucose or fructose, which can be liberated from common disaccharides.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms employed by oral bacteria to control sugar metabolism is key to developing novel therapies for management of dental caries and other oral diseases. Lactose is a naturally occurring disaccharide that is abundant in dairy products and commonly ingested by humans. However, for the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of genes required for lactose uptake and catabolism. Two peculiarities of lactose utilization by S. mutans are explored here: a) S. mutans excretes glucose that it cleaves from lactose and b) prior exposure to certain carbohydrates can result in a long-term inability to use lactose. The study begins to shed light on how S. mutans may bet-hedge to optimize its persistence and virulence in the human oral cavity.",

    "abstract": "The categorization of food via sensing nutrients or toxins is crucial to the survival of any organism. On ingestion, rapid responses within the gustatory system are required to identify the oral stimulus to guide immediate behaviour (swallowing or expulsion). The way in which the human brain accomplishes this task has so far remained unclear. Using multivariate analysis of 64-channel scalp EEG recordings obtained from 16 volunteers during tasting salty, sweet, sour, or bitter solutions, we found that activity in the delta-frequency range (1-4 Hz; delta power and phase) has information about taste identity in the human brain, with discriminable response patterns at the single-trial level within 130 ms of tasting. Importantly, the latencies of these response patterns predicted the point in time at which participants indicated detection of a taste by pressing a button. Furthermore, taste pattern discrimination was independent of motor-related activation and other taste features such as intensity and valence. On comparison with our previous findings from a passive (delayed) taste-discrimination task (Crouzet et al., 2015), taste-specific neural representations emerged earlier during this active (speeded) taste-detection task, suggesting a goal-dependent flexibility in gustatory response coding. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of a role of delta activity in taste-information coding in humans. Crucially, these neuronal response patterns can be linked to the speed of simple gustatory perceptual decisions - a vital performance index of nutrient sensing.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic exchange can mediate beneficial interactions among microbes, helping explain diversity in microbial communities. These interactions are often assumed to involve a fitness cost, prompting questions on how cooperative phenotypes can be stable and withstand the emergence of cheaters. Here we use genome-scale models of metabolism to investigate whether a radically different scenario, the pervasive release of \\\"costless\\\" metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producing organism), can serve as a prominent mechanism for inter-microbial interactions. By carrying out over 1 million pairwise growth simulations for 14 microbial species in a combinatorial assortment of environmental conditions, we find that there is indeed a large space of metabolites that can be secreted at no cost, which can generate ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative costless interdependencies, our modeling also demonstrates that oxygen availability significantly enhances mutualistic interactions by providing more opportunities for metabolic exchange through costless metabolites, resulting in an over-representation of specific ecological network motifs. In addition to helping explain natural diversity, we show how the exchange of costless metabolites can facilitate the engineering of stable synthetic microbial consortia.",

    "abstract": "Purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs) play an important role in the blood fluke parasite Schistosoma mansoni as a key enzyme of the purine salvage pathway. Here we present the structural and kinetic characterization of a new PNP isoform from S. mansoni, named as SmPNP2. Screening of different ligands using a thermofluorescence approach indicated cytidine and cytosine as potential ligands. The binding of cytosine was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry, with a KD of 27 M, and kinetic parameters for cytidine catalysis were obtained by ITC resulting in a KM of 76.3 M. SmPNP2 also displays catalytic activity against inosine and adenosine, making it the first described PNP with robust catalytic activity towards both pyrimidines and purines. Crystallographic structures of SmPNP2 with different ligands were obtained and comparison of these structures with the previously described S. mansoni PNP (SmPNP1) provided clues for the unique capability of SmPNP2 to bind pyrimidines. When compared with the structure of SmPNP1, substitutions in the vicinity of SmPNP2 active site alter the architecture of the nucleoside base binding site allowing an alternative binding mode for nucleosides, with a 180{degrees} rotation from the canonical binding mode. The remarkable plasticity of this binding site deepens the understanding of the correlation between structure and nucleotide selectivity, offering new ways to analyses PNP activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySchistosoma mansoni is a human parasite dependent on purine salvage for purine bases supply. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is a key enzyme in this pathway. It carries two PNP isoforms, one previously characterized (SmPNP1) and one unknown (SmPNP2). Here we present the crystallographic structure of SmPNP2 and its complex with cytosine, cytidine, ribose-l-phosphate, adenine, hypoxanthine, and tubercidin. Cytidine and cytosine were identified as ligands of SmPNP2 using a thermofluorescence approach. Binding of cytosine was proven by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and cytidine, inosine, and adenosine kinetic parameters were also obtained. Purine bases showed different binding in the active site, rotated 180{degrees} from the canonical binding mode. Its the first report showing a Low Molecular Mass PNP capable of catalyzing both types of nucleotide bases. The SmPNP2 odd behavior sheds a new light on the Schistosoma mansonis life cycle metabolic adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Tropomyosin (Tpm) is a continuous -helical coiled-coil homodimer that regulates actinomyosin interactions in muscle. We examined extended molecular simulations of four Tpms, two from the vertebrate phylum Chordata (rat and pig), and two from the invertebrate Arthropoda (shrimp and lobster), and found that despite extensive sequence and structural homologyacross metazoans, dynamic behavior - particularly long range structural fluctuations - were clearly distinct between phyla. Vertebrate Tpms were flexible and sampled complex, multi-state conformational landscapes. Invertebrate Tpms were rigid, sampling highly constrained harmonic landscapes. Filtering of trajectories by PCA into essential subspaces showed significant overlap within but not between phyla. In vertebrate Tpms, hinge-regions decoupled long-range inter-helical motions and suggested distinct domains. In contrast, crustacean Tpms lacked significant long range dynamic correlations - behaving more like a single rigid rod. Although Tpm sequence and structure has highly conserved over the last 0.6-billion years since the split of ancestral bilateria into protostomes and deuterostomes, divergence seems to have occurred at the level of long-range correlated dynamics, reflecting adaptations to phyla-specific requirements of actin binding and muscle contraction.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of animal population density is a fundamental goal in wildlife ecology and management, commonly met using mark recapture or spatial mark recapture (SCR) study designs and statistical methods. Mark-recapture methods require the identification of individuals; however, for many species and sampling methods, particularly noninvasive methods, no individuals or only a subset of individuals are individually identifiable. The unmarked SCR model, theoretically, can estimate the density of unmarked populations; however, it produces biased and imprecise density estimates in many sampling scenarios typically encountered. Spatial mark-resight (SMR) models extend the unmarked SCR model in three ways: 1) by introducing a subset of individuals that are marked and individually identifiable, 2) introducing the possibility of individual-linked telemetry data, and 3) introducing the possibility that the capture-recapture data from the survey used to deploy the marks can be used in a joint model, all improving the reliability of density estimates. The categorical spatial partial identity model (SPIM) improves the reliability of density estimates over unmarked SCR along another dimension, by adding categorical identity covariates that improve the probabilistic association of the latent identity samples. Here, we combine these two models into a \\\"categorical SMR\\\" model to exploit the benefits of both models simultaneously. We demonstrate using simulations that SMR alone can produce biased and imprecise density estimates with sparse data and/or when few individuals are marked. Then, using a fisher (Pekania pennanti) genetic capture-recapture data set, we show how categorical identity covariates, marked individuals, telemetry data, and jointly modeling the capture survey used to deploy marks with the resighting survey all combine to improve inference over the unmarked SCR model. As previously seen in an application of the categorical SPIM to a real-world data set, the fisher data set demonstrates that individual heterogeneity in detection function parameters, especially the spatial scale parameter{sigma} , introduces positive bias into latent identity SCR models (e.g., unmarked SCR, SMR), but the categorical SMR model provides more tools to reduce this positive bias than SMR or the categorical SPIM alone. We introduce the possibility of detection functions that vary by identity category level, which will remove individual heterogeneity in detection function parameters than is explained by categorical covariates, such as individual sex. Finally, we provide efficient SMR algorithms that accommodate all SMR sample types, interspersed marking and sighting periods, and any number of identity covariates using the 2-dimensional individual by trap data in conjunction with precomputed constraint matrices, rather than the 3-dimensional individual by trap by occasion data used in SMR algorithms to date.",

In bacteria, sensing, transport and storage molecules act in coordination to fulfill these roles. However, there is not yet a kinetic schema explaining the system integration. Here, we report a model emerging from experimental and computational approaches that describes the dynamics of copper distribution in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on copper uptake experiments, a minimal kinetic model describes well the copper distribution in the wild type bacteria but is unable to explain the behavior of the mutant strain lacking CopA1, a key Cu+ efflux ATPase. The model was expanded through an iterative hypothesis-driven approach, arriving to a mechanism that considers the induction of compartmental pools and the parallel function of CopA and Cus efflux systems. Model simulations support the presence of a periplasmic copper storage with a crucial role under dyshomeostasis conditions in P. aeruginosa. Importantly, the model predicts not only the interplay of periplasmic and cytoplasmic pools but also the existence of a threshold in the concentration of external copper beyond which cells lose their ability to control copper levels.",

We designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc during performance. We found that coding of cue identity and location occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this coding persisted both during a delay period, after the rat made a decision and was waiting for an outcome, and after the outcome was revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations to inform future behavior.",

However, it is still a challenging task to aggregate heterogeneous biological information such as gene expression and gene interactions to achieve more accurate inference for prediction and discovery of new gene interactions. In particular, how to generate a unified vector representation to integrate diverse input data is a key challenge addressed here. We propose a scalable and robust deep learning framework to learn embedded representations to unify known gene interactions and gene expression for gene interaction predictions. These low-dimensional embeddings derive deeper insights into the structure of rapidly accumulating and diverse gene interaction networks and greatly simplify downstream modeling. We compare the predictive power of our deep embeddings to the strong baselines. The results suggest that our deep embeddings achieve significantly more accurate predictions.

For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse gut microbiomes we observed high functional congruence to the real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers, MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets generated with CAMISIM.

In most eukaryotes, the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery drives flagellum biogenesis, and anterograde IFT requires kinesin-2 motor proteins. In this study, we investigated the function of the two T. brucei kinesin-2 proteins, TbKin2a and TbKin2b, in bloodstream form trypanosomes. We found that compared to other kinesin-2 proteins, TbKin2a and TbKin2b show greater variation in neck, stalk, and tail domain sequences. Both kinesins contributed additively to flagellar lengthening. Surprisingly, silencing TbKin2a inhibited cell proliferation, cytokinesis and motility, whereas silencing TbKin2b did not. TbKin2a was localized on the flagellum and colocalized with IFT components near the basal body, consistent with it performing a role in IFT. TbKin2a was also detected on the flagellar attachment zone, a specialized structure in trypanosome cells that connects the flagellum to the cell body. Our results indicate that kinesin-2 proteins in trypanosomes play conserved roles in IFT and exhibit a specialized localization, emphasizing the evolutionary flexibility of motor protein function in an organism with a large complement of kinesins.",

In order to extend such a study to beech stands of different age classes, it was necessary to build biomass and biomass increment equations that could be used for any age; we call them generalized biomass equations.\\n\\nTo build such generalized equations, trees were sampled in different forest plots covering the whole age range. Moreover, in each plot, several trees were chosen to represent the different crown classes (from dominant to suppressed). Sampled trees were felled down and the root system excavated for a sub-sample of trees, for biomass analysis by separating the main compartments of the above and belowground tree parts. When it was not possible to measure the total biomass of a given tree compartment (large trees), wood samples were taken in the concerned compartment. Moreover, equations were built to estimate the biomass of the missing parts of the root system and branch compartments that were likely to have suffered losses during root excavation and tree felling, respectively. Multivariate linear and non-linear models including possible random effects were tested to represent the biomass and biomass increment variations of each tree compartment and of their aggregation in the above and belowground parts of the tree.\\n\\nCompatible biomass and biomass increment equations for the different tree compartments and their combination in above and belowground tree parts were developed and fitted, allowing the analysis of the variations of the biomass distribution and allocation with tree age. Stem growth efficiency was also calculated and appeared dependent on tree age and tree social status.\\n\\nThe biomass and biomass increment equations established for beech in this study allow the estimation of the biomass and carbon stocks and fluxes (NPP) for the even-aged beech stands of the Hesse forest, whatever the age of the stand; they could also be used to analyze the effects of different silvicultural treatments on the biomass and carbon stocks and fluxes of beech stands, using the available stand growth and yield models developed for beech in France.",

Understanding the causes of mate choice is important, because assortative mating (AM) if based upon heritable traits, has genetic and evolutionary consequences. AM is predicted under Fishers classical theory1 to induce a signature in the genome at trait-associated loci that can be detected and quantified. Here, we develop and apply a method to quantify AM on a specific trait by estimating the correlation ({theta}) between genetic predictors of the trait from SNPs on odd versus even chromosomes. We show by theory and simulation that the effect of AM can be distinguished from population stratification. We applied this approach to 32 complex traits and diseases using SNP data from [~]400,000 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We found significant evidence of AM for height ({theta}=3.2%) and educational attainment ({theta}=2.7%), both consistent with theoretical predictions. Overall, our results imply that AM involves multiple traits, affects the genomic architecture of loci that are associated with these traits and that the consequence of mate choice can be detected from a random sample of genomes.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella is a leading cause of food borne illness and poses a major public health problem worldwide. Two type III secretion systems (TTSSs) are responsible for the delivery of a series of bacterial effectors into the infected cells to reprogram host cell functions to promote bacterial invasion and intracellular survival/replication. Nearly half of Salmonella genes encode proteins that are annotated as \\\"hypothetical\\\". We hypothesize that some of these hypothetical proteins might be TTSS effectors and participate in Salmonella virulence. In this study, we employed an in silico screen to identify putative TTSS effector proteins and performed a large scale screening of Salmonella effectors using a {beta}-lactamase protein translocation reporter assay. We identified 22 novel effectors that have not been previously reported. One of the effector - YggG, is found to be cytotoxic to mammalian cells when overexpressed suggesting interference with mammalian cell functions and survival. Importantly, Salmonella strains lacking YggG has reduced virulence in the mouse infection model. Our study demonstrated that YggG and its protease activity are required for Salmonella virulence in the mouse infection model. Surprisingly, no detectable roles in invasion into epithelial cells and no effect on the survival and replication inside cultured macrophages. We speculate that YggG may be involved in altering some aspects of the host immune system to promote infection. Our finding significantly expands the number of known Salmonella effectors, and laid a solid foundation in further understanding Salmonella pathogenesis.\\n\\nAbstract ImportanceSalmonellosis continues to be public health concern in the USA and the world. Salmonella delivers a set of bacterial proteins (effectors) into the host cells to invade non-phagocytic cells and to replicate inside the infected cells. Identification and characterization of these effectors are pivotal to the understanding of how Salmonella causes diseases. In addition, Nearly half of Salmonella genes encode proteins that are annotated as \\\"hypothetical\\\". We have identified 22 novel effectors that have not been previously reported.

    "abstract": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) strongly modulate the cholinergic drive to a hierarchy of inhibitory neurons in the superficial layers of the PFC, critical to cognitive processes. Genetic deletion of various types of nAChRs, located on specific interneurons, impacts the properties of ultra-slow transitions between high and low activity states (H-states and L-states, respectively), recorded in mice during quiet wakefulness. In addition, recent data indicate that a genetic mutation of the 5 nAChR subunit located on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons, the rs16969968 single nucleotide polymorphism (5 SNP), appears to be responsible for \\\"hypofrontality\\\" observed in schizophrenia. Chronic nicotine application to 5 SNP mice restores neural activity to control levels. Using firing rate models of hierarchically organized neural populations, we showed that the change of activity patterns recorded in the genetically modified mice can be explained by a change of activity state stability, differentially modulated by cholinergic inputs to parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) or VIP inhibitory populations. A change in amplitude, but not duration of H-states fully account for the lowered pyramidal (PYR) firing rates recorded in 5 SNP mice. We demonstrate that desensitization and upregulation of {beta}2 nAChRs located on SOM interneurons, but not activation of 5 nAChRs located on VIP interneurons, by chronic nicotine application could account for activity normalization recorded in 5 SNP mice. The model implies that subsequent nicotine withdrawal should lead to PYR activity depression more severe than the original hypofrontality caused by SNP mutation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNetwork connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression. One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner network problems: given a reference \\\"database\\\" graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu.\\n\\nResults and DiscussionWe introduce the condition Steiner network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C -{epsilon} , for every C [&ge;] 2 and{epsilon} > 0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network.\\n\\nConclusionOur results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur solver for the general condition Steiner network problem is available at https://github.com/YosefLab/condition_connectivity_problems",

    "abstract": "Snowfall is a global phenomenon highly integrated with hydrology and ecology. Forays into studying bioaerosols and their dependence on aeolian movement are largely constrained to either precipitation-independent analyses or in-silico models. Though snowpack and glacial microbiological studies have been conducted, little is known about the biological component of meteoric snow. Through culture-independent phylogenetic and geochemical analyses, we show that the geographical location at which snow precipitates determines snowfalls geochemical and microbiological composition. Storm-tracking, furthermore, can be used as a valuable environmental indicator to trace down what factors are influencing bioaerosols. We estimate annual deposits of up to ~10 kg of bacterial / archaeal biomass per hectare along our study area of the eastern Front Range in Colorado. The dominant kinds of microbiota captured in an analysis of seven snow events at two different locations, one urban, one rural, across the winter of 2016/2017 included phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria, though a multitude of different kinds of organisms were found in both. Taxonomically, Bacteroidetes were more abundant in Golden (urban plain) snow while Proteobacteria were more common in Sunshine (rural mountain) samples. Chemically, Golden snowfall was positively correlated with some metals and anions. The work also hints at better informing the  everything is everywhere hypotheses of the microbial world and that atmospheric transport of microbiota is not only common, but is capable of disseminating vast amounts of microbiota of different physiologies and genetics that then affect ecosystems globally. Snowfall, we conclude, is a significant repository of microbiological material with strong implications for both ecosystem genetic flux and general bio-aerosol theory.\\n\\nImportanceSnowfall is commonplace to the temperate and polar regions of the world. As an interface between the atmosphere, hydrosphere and earth, snow is responsible for high annual deposits of moisture globally, and, can serve as a  water bank in the form of both permanent snow fields and glaciers. Essential to general ecosystem function, snow can also be considered a transporter of aerosolized material. Given the magnitude of microbiota deposited by snowfall, which we report, it is likely that biological material within snowfall, with its geochemical underpinning-- and the associated genetic banks--have significant downstream ecological effects.\\n\\nUnderstanding what is contained in snowfall becomes especially urgent in a warming climate where high-impact meteorological and ecological changes are imminent and likely. With climate-induced changes to snowfall patterns, surface ecosystems are likely to be impacted by ensuing changes in microbiota deposition. Thus, the ecosystem function of soils, rock and surface waters are also likely to be impacted; these changes, in turn, greatly influence agriculture, weathering and infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is critical for genome stability because of its roles in double-strand break repair. Ku and ligase D (LigD) are the crucial proteins in this process, and strains expressing Ku and LigD can cyclize linear DNA in vivo. Herein, we established a proof-of-concept mono-homologous linear DNA recombination for gene inactivation or genome editing by which cyclization of linear DNA in vivo by NHEJ could be used to generate non-replicable circular DNA and could allow allelic exchanges between the circular DNA and the chromosome. We achieved this approach in Dietzia sp. DQ12-45-1b, which expresses Ku and LigD homologs and presents NHEJ activity. By transforming the strain with a linear DNA mono homolog to the sequence in chromosome, we mutated the genome. This method did not require the screening of suitable plasmids and was easy and time-effective. Bioinformatic analysis showed that more than 20% prokaryotic organisms contain Ku and LigD, suggesting the wide distribution of NHEJ activities. Moreover, the Escherichia coli strain also showed NHEJ activity when the Ku and LigD of Dietzia sp. DQ12-45-1b were introduced and expressed in it. Therefore, this method may be a widely applicable genome editing tool for diverse prokaryotic organisms, especially for non-model microorganisms.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe non-model gram-positive bacteria lack efficient genetic manipulation systems, but they express genes encoding Ku and LigD. The NHEJ pathway in Dietzia sp. DQ12-45-1b was evaluated and was used to successfully knockout eleven genes in the genome. Since bioinformatic studies revealed that the putative genes encoding Ku and LigD ubiquitously exist in phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea, the mono-homologous linear DNA recombination by the NHEJ pathway could be a potentially applicable genetic manipulation method for diverse non-model prokaryotic organisms.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the source of all blood components, and genetic defects in these cells are causative of disorders ranging from severe combined immunodeficiency to sickle cell disease. However, genome editing of long-term repopulating HSCs to correct mutated alleles has been challenging. HSCs have the ability to either be quiescent or cycle, with the former linked to stemness and the latter involved in differentiation. Here we investigate the link between cell cycle status and genome editing outcomes at the causative codon for sickle cell disease in adult human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We show that quiescent HSPCs that are immunophenotypically enriched for engrafting stem cells predominantly repair Cas9-induced double strand breaks (DSBs) through an error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway and exhibit almost no homology directed repair (HDR). By contrast, non-quiescent cycling stem-enriched cells repair Cas9 DSBs through both error-prone NHEJ and fidelitous HDR. Pre-treating bulk CD34+ HSPCs with a combination of mTOR and GSK-3 inhibitors to induce quiescence results in complete loss of HDR in all cell subtypes. We used these compounds, which were initially developed to maintain HSCs in culture, to create a new strategy for editing adult human HSCs. CD34+ HSPCs are edited, allowed to briefly cycle to accumulate HDR alleles, and then placed back in quiescence to maintain stemness, resulting in 6-fold increase in HDR/NHEJ ratio in quiescent, stem-enriched cells. Our results reveal the fundamental tension between quiescence and editing in human HSPCs and suggests strategies to manipulate HSCs during therapeutic genome editing.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical in tumor growth and invasive potential of cancer cells. In glioblastoma tumors, some components of the native brain ECM such as hyaluronic acid (HA) have been suggested as key regulators of processes associated with poor patient outlook such as invasion and therapeutic resistance. Given the importance of cell-mediated remodeling during invasion, it is likely that the molecular weight of available HA polymer may strongly influence GBM progression. Biomaterial platforms therefore provide a unique opportunity to systematically examine the influence of the molecular weight distribution of HA on GBM cell activity. Here we report the relationship between the molecular weight of matrix-bound HA within a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel, the invasive phenotype of a patient-derived xenograft GBM population that exhibits significant in vivo invasivity, and the local production of soluble HA during GBM cell invasion. Hyaluronic acid of different molecular weights spanning a range associated with cell-mediated remodeling (10, 60, and 500 kDa) was photopolymerized into GelMA hydrogels, with cell activity compared to GelMA only conditions (-HA). Polymerization conditions were tuned to create a homologous series of GelMA hydrogels with conserved poroelastic properties (i.e. shear modulus, Poissons ratio, and diffusivity). GBM migration was strongly influenced by HA molecular weight. While markers associated with active remodeling of the HA content, hyaluronan synthase and hyaluronidase, were found to be insensitive to matrix immobilized HA content. These results provide new information regarding the importance of local hyaluronic acid content on the invasive phenotype of GBM.",

    "abstract": "Populations generally differ in environmental and genetic factors, which can create differences in allele substitution effects between populations. Therefore, a single genotype may have different additive genetic values in different populations. The correlation between the two additive genetic values of a single genotype in both populations is known as the additive genetic correlation between populations and can differ from one. Our objective was to investigate whether differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequencies of markers and causal loci between populations affect bias of the estimated genetic correlation. We simulated two populations that were separated for 50 generations. Markers and causal loci were selected to either have similar or different allele frequencies in the two populations. Differences in consistency of LD between populations were obtained by using different marker density panels. Results showed that when the difference in allele frequencies of causal loci between populations was reflected by the markers, genetic correlations were only slightly underestimated using markers. This was even the case when LD patterns, measured by LD statistic r, were different between populations. When the difference in allele frequencies of causal loci between populations was not reflected by the markers, genetic correlations were severely underestimated. We conclude that for an unbiased estimate of the genetic correlation between populations, marker allele frequencies should reflect allele frequencies of causal loci so that marker-based relationships can accurately predict the relationships at causal loci, i.e. E(Gcausal loci|Gmarkers) = Gmarkers. Differences in LD between populations have little effect on the estimated genetic correlation.",

    "abstract": "In metazoans, apoptotic cells are swiftly engulfed by phagocytes and degraded inside phagosomes. Multiple small GTPases in the Rab family are known to function in phagosome maturation by regulating vesicle trafficking. We discovered rab-35 as a new gene important for apoptotic cell clearance using an RNAi screen targeting putative Rab GTPases in Caenorhabditis elegans. We further identified TBC-10 as a putative GTPase-activating protein (GAP), and FLCN-1 and RME-4 as two putative Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), for RAB-35. RAB-35 function was found to be required for the incorporation of early endosomes to phagosomes and for the timely degradation of apoptotic cell corpses. More specifically, RAB-35 facilitates the switch of phagosomal membrane phosphatidylinositol species from PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(3)P and promotes the recruitment of the small GTPase RAB-5 to phagosomal surfaces, processes that are essential for phagosome maturation. Interestingly, we observed that CED-1 performs these same functions, and to a much larger extent than RAB-35. Remarkably, in addition to cell corpse degradation, RAB-35 also facilitates the recognition of cell corpses independently of the CED-1 and CED-5 pathways. RAB-35 localizes to extending pseudopods and is further enriched on nascent phagosomes, consistent with its dual roles in regulating cell corpse-recognition and phagosome maturation. Epistasis analyses indicate that rab-35 represents a novel third genetic pathway that acts in parallel to both of the canonical ced-1/6/7 and ced-2/5/10/12 engulfment pathways. We propose that RAB-35 acts as a robustness factor, leading a pathway that aids the canonical pathways for the engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells.",

    "abstract": "Urban streams are susceptible to stormwater and sewage inputs that can impact their ecological health and water quality. Microbial communities in streams play important functional roles and their composition and metabolic potential can help assess ecological state and water quality. Although these environments are highly heterogenous, little is known about the influence of isolated perturbations, such as those resulting from rain events on urban stream microbiota. Here, we examined the microbial community composition and diversity in an urban stream during dry and wet weather conditions with both 16S rRNA gene sequencing across multiple years and shotgun metagenomics to more deeply analyze a single stormflow event. Metagenomics was used to assess population-level dynamics as well as shifts in the microbial community taxonomic profile and functional potential before and after a substantial rainfall. Results demonstrated general trends present in the stream under stormflow vs. baseflow conditions across years and seasons and also highlighted the significant influence of increased effluent flow following rain in shifting the stream microbial community from abundant freshwater taxa to those more associated with urban/anthropogenic settings. Shifts in the taxonomic composition were also linked to changes in functional gene content, particularly for transmembrane transport and organic substance biosynthesis. We also observed an increase in relative abundance of genes encoding degradation of organic pollutants and antibiotic resistance after rain. Overall, this study provided evidence of stormflow impacts on an urban stream microbiome from an environmental and public health perspective.\\n\\nImportanceUrban streams in various parts of the world are facing increased anthropogenic pressure on their water quality, and stormflow events represent one such source of complex physical, chemical and biological perturbations. Microorganisms are important components of these streams from both ecological and public-health perspectives, and analyzing the effect of such perturbations on the stream microbial community can help improve current knowledge on the impact such chronic disturbances can have on these water resources. This study examines microbial community dynamics during rain-induced stormflow conditions in an urban stream of the Chicago Area Waterway System. Additionally, using shotgun metagenomics we identified significant shifts in the microbial community composition and functional gene content following a high rainfall event, with potential environment and public health implications. Previous work in this area has been limited to specific genes/organisms or has not assessed immediate stormflow impact.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental developmental process that is abnormally activated in cancer metastasis. Dynamic changes in alternative splicing occur during EMT. ESRP1 and hnRNPM are splicing regulators that promote an epithelial splicing program and a mesenchymal splicing program, respectively. The functional relationships between these splicing factors in the genome-scale remain elusive. Comparing alternative splicing targets of hnRNPM and ESRP1 revealed that they co-regulate a set of cassette exon events, with the majority showing discordant splicing regulation. hnRNPM discordantly regulated splicing events show a positive correlation with splicing during EMT while concordant splicing events do not, highlighting the antagonistic role of hnRNPM and ESRP1 during EMT. Motif enrichment analysis near co-regulated exons identifies guanine-uridine rich motifs downstream of hnRNPM-repressed and ESRP1-enhanced exons, supporting a model of competitive binding to these cis-elements to antagonize alternative splicing. The set of co-regulated exons are enriched in genes associated with cell-migration and cytoskeletal reorganization, which are pathways associated with EMT. Splicing levels of co-regulated exons are associated with breast cancer patient survival and correlate with gene sets involved in EMT and breast cancer subtypes. These data identify complex modes of interaction between hnRNPM and ESRP1 in regulation of splicing in disease-relevant contexts.",

Although it is clear that memory performance is affected by circadian cycling, it is unknown whether age-related disruption of the circadian clock causes impaired hippocampal memory. Here, we show that the repressive histone deacetylase HDAC3 restricts long-term memory, synaptic plasticity, and learning-induced expression of the circadian gene Per1 in the aging hippocampus without affecting rhythmic circadian activity patterns. We also demonstrate that hippocampal Per1 is critical for long-term memory formation. Together, our data challenge the traditional idea that alterations in the core circadian clock drive circadian-related changes in memory formation and instead argue for a more autonomous role for circadian clock gene function in hippocampal cells to gate the likelihood of long-term memory formation.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we optimized the pressure-cycling technology (PCT) and SWATH mass spectrometry workflow to analyze biopsy-level tissue samples (2 mg wet weight) from 19 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Using OpenSWATH and pan-human spectral library, we quantified 11,787 proteotypic peptides from 2,579 SwissProt proteins in 76 HCC tissue samples within about 9 working days (from receiving tissue to SWATH data). The coefficient of variation (CV) of peptide yield using PCT was 32.9%, and the R2 of peptide quantification was 0.9729. We identified protein changes in malignant tissues compared to matched control samples in HCC patients, and further stratified patient samples into groups with high -fetoprotein (AFP) expression or HBV infection. In aggregate, the data identified 23 upregulated pathways and 13 ones. We observed enhanced biomolecule synthesis and suppressed small molecular metabolism in liver tumor tissues. 16 proteins of high documented relevance to HCC are highlighted in our data. We also identified changes of virus-infection-related proteins including PKM, CTPS1 and ALDOB in the HBV+ HCC subcohort. In conclusion, we demonstrate the practicality of performing proteomic analysis of biopsy-level tissue samples with PCT-SWATH methodology with moderate effort and within a relatively short timeframe.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled researchers to study gene expression at a cellular resolution. However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNAseq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a zero-inflated negative binomial noise model, and nonlinear gene-gene or gene-dispersion interactions are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can therefore be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.",

    "abstract": "Best practices to handling duplicated mapped reads in RNA-seq analyses has long been discussed but a gold standard method has yet to be established, as such duplicates could originate from valid biological transcripts or they could be PCR-related artifacts. Here we used the NEXTflex qRNA-SeqTM (aka Molecular Indexing) technology to identify PCR duplicates via the random attachment of unique molecular labels to each cDNA molecule prior to PCR amplification. We found that up to 64.3% of the single end and 19.3% of the mouse paired end duplicates originated from valid biological transcripts rather than PCR artifacts. For single end reads, either removing or retaining all duplicates resulted in a substantial number of false positives (up to 47.0%) and false negatives (up to 12.1%) in the sets of significantly differentially expressed genes. For paired end reads, only the alignment retaining all duplicates resulted in a substantial number of false positives. This is the first effort to evaluate the performance of qRNA-seq using  real-world biomedical samples, and we found that PCR duplicate identification provided minor benefits for paired end reads but greatly improved the sensitivity and specificity in the determination of the significantly differentially expressed genes for single end reads.",

    "abstract": "Mead is a traditional alcoholic beverage that is produced by fermentation of diluted honey. The mead quality is primarily influenced by the honey variety, although the yeast microflora as the main catalyst of alcoholic fermentation also plays a significant role in the organoleptic and chemical quality of the final product. The impact of the indigenous honey associated-yeasts on the mead properties has scarcely been investigated. To fill this gap the main objective of this work was to assess the metabolic properties of the yeasts isolated from honey and pollen from beehives of northeast Austria.\\n\\nThe biodiversity was low and only two yeast species were identified, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Candida apicola. The fermentation potentials of these yeasts were estimated in two media, grape juice (since yeasts isolated from honey may be useful for sweet wine production) and diluted honey of similar sugar concentration, and compared with those of the reference strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae; S. uvarum and S. eubayanus. Depending on the fermentation substrate, yeasts differed with respect to their metabolic power, fermentation rate, sugar utilization and production of glycerol and organic acids. During mead fermentation Saccharomyces species showed the highest metabolic turnover, while the fermentation rate did not differ significantly. Addition of assimilable nitrogen to the diluted honey enhanced fermentation rate of S. cerevisiae, but not of the other species. Fermentation of grape juice occurred much faster than that of diluted honey and differences between yeasts were more pronounced. The S. cerevisiae commercial wine strain, adapted to high alcohol concentrations, and S. eubayanus outperformed the others, S. uvarum was comparable with Z. rouxii, while C. apicola had the lowest fermentation rate. Fructophily of Z. rouxii and to a lesser degree of C. apicola was observed in both media. An increased production of glycerol was achieved by S. eubayanus in both media and by C. apicola during the fermentation of honey must. A commercial S. cerevisiae strain, S. eubayanus and Z. rouxii were able to metabolize malic acid in wine. In mead, the S. eubayanus and S. uvarum yeasts showed the tendency of increasing the level of malic acid. Aroma profile depended profoundly on yeast species. This study demonstrates that the composition and complexity of the fermentation substrate determines the activity and the final metabolic outcomes of the studied yeasts.",
