    "abstract": "Stretches of relaxed cat and rat muscle elicit similar history-dependent muscle spindle Ia firing rates that resemble history-dependent forces seen in single activated muscle fibers (Nichols and Cope, 2004). During stretch of relaxed cat muscle, whole musculotendon forces exhibit history-dependence that mirror history-dependent muscle spindle firing rates, where both muscle force and muscle spindle firing rates are elevated in the first stretch in a series of stretch-shorten cycles (Blum et al., 2017). By contrast, rat musculotendon are only mildly history-dependent and do not mirror history-dependent muscle spindle firing rates in the same way (Haftel et al., 2004). We hypothesized that history-dependent muscle spindle firing rates elicited in stretch of relaxed rat muscle would mirror history-dependent muscle fiber forces, which are masked by noncontractile tissue at the level of whole musculotendon force. We removed noncontractile tissue force contributions from the recorded musculotendon force using an exponentially-elastic tissue model. We then show that the remaining estimated muscle fiber force resembles history-dependent muscle spindle firing rates recorded simultaneously. These forces also resemble history-dependent forces recorded in stretch of single activated fibers and attributed to muscle cross-bridge mechanisms (Campbell and Moss, 2000). Our results suggest that history-dependent muscle spindle firing in both rats and cats arise from stretch of cross-bridges in muscle fibers.",

    "abstract": "Genetically-identical organisms age at different rates, but the reason for this is unclear. The rate of aging is due to the accumulation of damage, such as senescent cells (SnC) which are a major driver of aging in mammals, but the accumulation dynamics of SnC are unknown. Here, we combine theory and experiments in mice and find that SnC are rapidly produced and removed with a half-life of days in young mice. In old mice SnC half-life grows to weeks, because SnC saturate their own removal process. This saturation leads to persistent fluctuations known as critical-slowing-down: fluctuations are amplified to long-lasting differences in SnC between individuals at old ages. Rapid turnover with saturating removal is a general framework that may apply to any aging-related form of damage, and can quantitatively explain the demographic laws of mortality in worms, flies, mice and humans.",

Here, we investigated these associations through analyzing data collected for UK Biobank subjects with an age range of 45 to 79 years old. We first trained a statistical model for obtaining relative brain age (RBA), a metric describing a subjects brain age relative to peers, based on a randomly selected training set subjects (n=2,679). We then applied this model to the evaluation set subjects (n=6,252) and further tested the association of RBA with tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and 529,098 genetic variants. We found that daily or almost daily consumption of smoking or alcohol was significantly associated with increased RBA (P<0.05). Interestingly, there was no significant difference of RBA among subjects who smoked occasionally, only tried once or twice, or abstained from smoking. Further, there was no significant difference of RBA among subjects who consumed alcohol 1 to 3 times a month, at special occasions only, or abstained from alcohol consumption. Among the subjects who smoked on most or all days and did not abstain from alcohol drinking, RBA increased by 0.021 years for each addition pack-year of smoking (P<0.05) and by 0.014 years for each additional gram of alcohol consumed (P<0.05). We did not identify individual genetic variation significantly associate with RBA. Further exploration of genetic variation-brain aging association is warranted, where our current genetic association statistics may serve as prior knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The Regulator of G-protein Signaling 12 (Rgs12) is important for osteoclast (OC) differentiation, and its deletion in vivo protected mice against pathological bone loss. To characterize its mechanism in osteoclastogenesis, we selectively deleted Rgs12 in OC precursors using the LysM-Cre transgenic line or overexpressed the gene in RAW264.7 cells. Rgs12 deletion led to increased bone mass with decreased OC numbers, whereas its overexpression increased OC number and size. Proteomics analysis of Rgs12-deficient OCs identified an upregulation of antioxidant enzymes under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress. We confirmed an increase of Nrf2 activity and impaired production in Rgs12-deficient cells. Conversely, Rgs12 overexpression suppressed Nrf2 through a mechanism dependent on the 26S proteasome, and promoted RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NF{kappa}B, which was abrogated by antioxidant treatment. We therefore identified a novel role of Rgs12 in regulating Nrf2, thereby controlling cellular redox state and OC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Though it has been known for over half a century that interference with the normal activity of septohippocampal neurons can abolish hippocampal theta rhythmicity, a definitive answer to the question of its function has remained elusive. To clarify the role of septal circuits and theta in location specific activity of place cells and spatial behavior, three drugs were delivered to the medial septum of rats: tetracaine, a local anesthetic; muscimol, a GABA-A agonist; and gabazine, a GABA-A antagonist. All three drugs disrupted normal oscillatory activity in the hippocampus. However, tetracaine and muscimol both reduced spatial firing and interfered with the rats ability to navigate to a hidden goal. After gabazine, location specific firing was preserved in the absence of theta, but rats were unable to accurately locate the hidden goal. These results indicate that theta is unnecessary for location specific firing of hippocampal cells, and that place cell activity cannot support accurate navigation when septal circuits are disrupted.",

This family of proteins is enriched in the brain and recent data indicate potential pleiotropic functions in several different contexts. An inherent ability of this family of proteins is to induce membrane protrusions, and we have previously reported that members of this family may act in concert. However, the function of PLPPR1 is not yet understood. Here, we report that exogenous expression of PLPPR1 increases cell adhesion to the ECM substrate by altering cytoskeletal dynamics and modulating RhoA and Rac1 activity through association with RhoGDI, enabling PLPPR1 to overcome the inhibitory activity of CSPGs and LPA. Together, these results establish a novel signaling pathway for PLPPR1 protein.",

To gain more insight in the relevance of Ser129-p and CTT aSyn under physiological and pathological conditions, we investigated their subcellular distribution patterns in normal aged and PD brains using highly-selective antibodies in combination with 3D multicolor STED microscopy. We show that CTT aSyn localizes in mitochondria in PD patients and controls, whereas the organization of Ser129-p in a cytoplasmic network is strongly associated with pathology. Nigral Lewy bodies show an onion skin-like architecture, with a structured framework of Ser129-p aSyn and neurofilaments encapsulating CTT aSyn in their core, which displayed high content of proteins and lipids by label-free CARS microscopy. The subcellular phenotypes of antibody-labeled pathology identified in this study provide evidence for a crucial role of Ser129-p aSyn in Lewy body formation.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin organization plays an important role in regulating gene expression. Previously, we showed that chromatin is organized in the form of nucleosome groups or clutches. The size and nucleosome packing density of clutches decreased in hyperacetylated cells having more open chromatin. While hyperacetylation is thought to disrupt histone-DNA and inter-nucleosome interactions, its impact on higher order DNA compaction by groups of nucleosomes in vivo is not clear. To elucidate this question, we carried out two-color super-resolution imaging of histones and DNA in cells treated with the Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). We showed that a lower percentage of DNA was associated to clutches in hyperacetylated cells, suggesting a decrease in nucleosome occupancy. We further identified the presence of \\\"clutch\\\" DNA within a nanoscale distance around the clutches. Upon histone hyperacetylation, the radius of the clutch DNA decreased leading to DNA release from the clutches, consistent with disruption of DNA-histone interactions. Finally, the most dramatic decompaction was observed for groups of clutches in close spatial proximity, suggesting that neighboring clutches influence each others DNA compaction.\\n\\nSummarySuper-resolution imaging of histones and DNA reveals that DNA is compacted by groups of nucleosomes - clutches - at the nanoscale level and clutch compaction of DNA is affected by histone tail acetylation especially in highly folded regions containing several nearby clutches.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models are increasingly designed to guide experiments in biology, biotechnology, as well as to assist in medical decision making. They are in particular important to understand emergent collective cell behavior. For this purpose, the models, despite still abstractions of reality, need to be quantitative in all aspects relevant for the question of interest. The focus in this paper is to study the regeneration of liver after drug-induced depletion of hepatocytes, in which surviving dividing and migrating hepatocytes must squeeze through a blood vessel network to fill the emerged lesions. Here, the cells response to mechanical stress might significantly impact on the regeneration process. We present a 3D high-resolution cell-based model integrating information from measurements in order to obtain a refined quantitative understanding of the cell-biomechanical impact on the closure of drug-induced lesions in liver. Our model represents each cell individually, constructed as a physically scalable network of viscoelastic elements, capable of mimicking realistic cell deformation and supplying information at subcellular scales. The cells have the capability to migrate, grow and divide, and infer the nature of their mechanical elements and their parameters from comparisons with optical stretcher experiments. Due to triangulation of the cell surface, interactions of cells with arbitrarily shaped (triangulated) structures such as blood vessels can be captured naturally. Comparing our simulations with those of so-called center-based models, in which cells have a rigid shape and forces are exerted between cell centers, we find that the migration forces a cell needs to exert on its environment to close a tissue lesion, is much smaller than predicted by center-based models. This effect is expected to be even more present in chronic liver disease, where tissue stiffens and excess collagen narrows pores for cells to squeeze through.",

    "abstract": "The calcium pump SERCA is a transmembrane protein that is critical for calcium transport in cells. SERCA resides in an environment made up largely by the lipid bilayer, so lipids play a central role on its stability and function. Studies have provided insights into the effects of annular and bulk lipids on SERCA activation, but the role of a nonannular lipid site in the E2 intermediate state remains elusive. Here, we have performed microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the effects of nonannular lipid binding on the stability and structural dynamics of the E2 state of SERCA. We found that the structural integrity and stability of the E2 state is independent of nonannular lipid binding, and that occupancy of a lipid molecule at this site does not modulate destabilization of the E2 state, a step required to initiate the transition toward the competent E1 state. We also found that binding of the nonannular lipid does not induce direct allosteric control of the intrinsic functional dynamics the E2 state. We conclude that nonannular lipid binding is not necessary for the stability of the E2 state, but we speculate that it becomes functionally significant during the E2-to-E1 transition of the pump.",

    "abstract": "Mycolactone, a cytotoxic and immunosuppressive macrolide produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is the central virulent factor in the skin disease Buruli ulcer. This multifunctional cytotoxin affects fundamental cellular processes such as cell adhesion, immune response and cell death by targeting various cellular structures. Developing effective diagnostics that target mycolactone has been challenging, potentially due to suspected interactions with lipophilic architectures, including membranes. To better understand the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer disease, aid in the development of diagnostics, and learn how amphiphiles in general use lipid trafficking to navigate the host environment, we seek to understand the nature of mycolactone-membrane interactions. Herein we characterize how the two dominant isomers of mycolactone (A and B) interact with and permeate DPPC membranes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations employing transition tempered metadynamics, and compare these results with those obtained by MARTINI coarse-grained simulations. Our all-atom simulations reveal that both isomers have a strong preference to associate with the membrane, although their mechanisms and energetics of membrane permeation differ slightly. Water molecules are found to play an important role in the permeation process. Although the MARTINI coarse-grained simulations give the correct free energy of membrane association, they fail to capture the mechanism of permeation and role of water during permeation as seen in all-atom simulations.",

In this work, we investigate an individual-based model accounting for various intraspecies and interspecies interactions in a community consisting of two distinct species. In this framework we consider one species to be chasers and the other species to be escapees, and we focus on chase-escape dynamics where the chasers are biased to move towards the escapees, and the escapees are biased to move away from the chasers. This framework allows us to explore how individual-level directional interactions scale up to influence spatial structure at the macroscale. To focus exclusively on the role of motility and directional bias in determining spatial structure, we consider conservative communities where the number of individuals in each species remains constant. To provide additional information about the individual-based model, we also present a mathematically tractable deterministic approximation based on describing the evolution of the spatial moments. We explore how different features of interactions including interaction strength, spatial extent of interaction, and relative density of species influence the formation of the macroscale spatial patterns.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes play a critical role in mitotic spindle assembly through their role in microtubule nucleation and bipolar spindle assembly. Loss of centrosomes can impair the ability of some cells to properly conduct mitotic division, leading to chromosomal instability, cell stress, and aneuploidy. Multiple aspects of the cellular response to mitotic error associated with centrosome loss appears to involve activation of JNK signaling. To further characterize the transcriptional effects of centrosome loss, we compared gene expression profiles of wildtype and acentrosomal cells from Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We found elevation of expression of JNK target genes, which we verified at the protein level. Consistent with this, the upregulated gene set showed significant enrichment for the AP1 consensus DNA binding sequence. We also found significant elevation in expression of genes regulating redox balance. Based on those findings, we examined oxidative stress after centrosome loss, revealing that acentrosomal wing cells have significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). We then performed a candidate genetic screen and found that one of the genes upregulated in acentrosomal cells, G6PD, plays an important role in buffering acentrosomal cells against increased ROS and helps protect those cells from cell death. Our data and other recent studies have revealed a complex network of signaling pathways, transcriptional programs, and cellular processes that epithelial cells use to respond to stressors like mitotic errors to help limit cell damage and maintain normal tissue development.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for human morbidity and mortality. Thus, the identification of compounds that defer aging, also known as  geroprotectors, could greatly improve our health and promote a longer life. Here we screened for geroprotectors, employing the power of human transcriptomics to predict biological age. We used age-stratified human tissue transcriptomes to generate machine-learning-based classifiers capable of distinguishing transcriptomes from young versus old individuals. Then we applied these classifiers to transcriptomes induced by 1300 different compounds in human cell lines and ranked these compounds by their ability to induce a  youthful transcriptional state. Besides known geroprotectors, several new candidate compounds emerged from this ranking. Testing these in the model organism C. elegans, we identified two Hsp90 inhibitors, Monorden and Tanespimycin, which substantially extended the animals lifespan and improved their health. Hsp90 inhibition specifically induces the expression of heat shock proteins, known to improve protein homeostasis. Consistently, Monorden treatment improved the survival of C. elegans under proteotoxic stress, and its lifespan benefits were fully dependent on the master regulator of the cytosolic unfolded protein response, the transcription factor HSF-1. Taken together, we present an innovative transcriptomics-based screening approach to discover aging-preventive compounds and highlight Hsp90 inhibitors as powerful geroprotectors that could be of great value, to target the aging process in humans.",

    "abstract": "Baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells is a powerful approach for protein production. However, many existing methods are time consuming, offer limited options for protein tagging, and are unsuitable for secreted proteins requiring proteolytic maturation, such as TGF-{beta} family growth factors. To overcome these limitations, we engineered \\\"FlexiBAC\\\", a system that simplifies baculovirus production and permits furin-driven proteolytic maturation of targets. This system allows recombinant baculovirus formation inside insect cells and reduces the time between initial cloning and protein production to 13 days. FlexiBAC includes 146 shuttle vectors that append combinations of purification tags, fluorescent markers, proteolytic cleavage sites, trafficking signals, and chemical conjugation tags to the termini of the target protein. We demonstrate that this system can be used to produce high levels of mature, active forms of TGF-{beta} family growth factors, such as Activin A, as well as other proteins that are typically difficult to reconstitute, such as proteins rich in coiled-coil, low complexity, and disordered domains.",

    "abstract": "Shotgun lipidomics enables an extensive analysis of lipids from tissues and fluids. Each specimen requires appropriate extraction and processing procedures to ensure good coverage and reproducible quantification of the lipidome. Adipose tissue (AT) has become a research focus with regard to its involvement in obesity-related pathologies. However, the quantification of the AT lipidome is particularly challenging due to the predominance of triacylglycerides, which elicit high ion suppression of the remaining lipid classes. We present a new and validated method for shotgun lipidomics of AT, which tailors the lipid extraction procedure to the target specimen and features high reproducibility with a linear dynamic range of at least 4 orders of magnitude for all lipid classes. Utilizing this method, we observed tissue-specific and diet-related differences in three AT types (brown, gonadal, inguinal subcutaneous) from lean and obese mice. Brown AT exhibited a distinct lipidomic profile with the greatest lipid class diversity and responded to high-fat diet by altering its lipid composition, which shifted towards that of white AT. Moreover, diet-induced obesity promoted an overall remodelling of the lipidome, where all three AT types featured a significant increase in longer and more unsaturated triacylglyceride and phospholipid species.\\n\\nThe here presented method facilitates reproducible systematic lipidomic profiling of AT and could be integrated with further -omics approaches used in (pre-)clinical research, in order to advance the understanding of the molecular metabolic dynamics involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated disorders.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational force is one of environmental factors that influence growth and development of plants. Changes in this force, including microgravity, can be one of the stress factor which plants have to adapt to cope with. That kind of stress can lead to several abnormalities such as chromosomal breakage, morphological abnormalities or changes in gene expression. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of simulated microgravity on gene expression of Arabidopsis thaliana embryos by use Random Positioning Machine (RPM). RPM is laboratory facility that can generate conditions comparable to the true microgravity. This paper studies effect of simulated microgravity on expression of genes which are involved in plant embryogenesis (LEAFY COTYLEDON, LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT), antioxidative system (CATALASE), mechanical stimuli (TOUCH) and gravitropism (SCARECROW, SHOOT GRAVITROPISM2). Changes in gene expression were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Several of tested genes had increased transcript levels after the influence of simulated microgravity. Specifically, catalase (CAT3), LECs (LEC1), touch (TCH2/CML24), and gravitropism (SGR2) genes achieved significantly increased relative expression (level [&ge;] 2). The changes in the levels of expression on embryos of Arabidopsis depend on the type of genes and principally on the timing of the influence of the simulated microgravity.",

    "abstract": "Infectious disease outbreaks are a common constraint of group living organisms. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) live in large, dense colonies and are host to a diverse range of parasites and pathogens, facilitating the possibility of epidemic-induced collapse. However, the majority of parasites infecting ants require a period of development outside of the nest before they can transmit to their next ant host ( ex-nido transmission) and the impact of these parasites on colony dynamics is unknown. Here we develop a mathematical model to assess ant colony dynamics in the presence of such parasites. We find that under field-realistic model conditions, such parasites are unlikely to cause the epidemic collapse of mature ant colonies, unless colony birth rate drops below 0.2328 ants/day. The preponderance of ex-nido transmitting parasites infecting ants and their limited epidemiological impact on colony dynamics may partly explain why collapsed ant colonies are rarely, if ever, observed in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "The common human epilepsies are associated with distinct patterns of reduced cortical thickness, detectable on neuroimaging, with important clinical consequences. To explore underlying mechanisms, we layered MRI-based cortical structural maps from a large-scale epilepsy neuroimaging study onto highly spatially-resolved human brain gene expression data, identifying >2,500 genes overexpressed in regions of reduced cortical thickness, compared to relatively-protected regions. The resulting set of differentially-expressed genes shows enrichment for microglial markers, and in particular, activated microglial states. Parallel analyses of cell-specific eQTLs show enrichment in human genetic signatures of epilepsy severity, but not epilepsy causation. Post mortem brain tissue from humans with epilepsy shows excess activated microglia. In an experimental model, depletion of activated microglia prevents cortical thinning, but not the development of chronic seizures. These convergent data strongly implicate activated microglia in cortical thinning, representing a new dimension for concern and disease modification in the epilepsies, potentially distinct from seizure control.",

    "abstract": "RUNX2 is a transcription factor critical for chondrocyte maturation and normal endochondral bone formation. It promotes the expression of factors catabolic to the cartilage extracellular matrix and is shown to be upregulated in human osteoarthritic cartilage and in murine articular cartilage following joint injury. To date, in vivo studies of RUNX2 overexpression in cartilage have been limited to forced expression in osteochondroprogenitor cells preventing investigation into the effects of chondrocyte-specific RUNX2 overexpression during development or in postnatal articular cartilage. Here, we used the Rosa26Runx2 allele in combination with the inducible Col2a1CreERT2 transgene or the inducible AcanCreERT2 knock-in allele to achieve chondrocyte-specific RUNX2 overexpression (OE) during embryonic development or in the postnatal articular cartilage of adult mice, respectively. RUNX2 OE was induced at E13.5 for all developmental studies and resulted in a phenotype resembling chondrodysplasia at E18.5. Histology and in situ hybridization analyses suggest an early onset of chondrocyte hypertrophy and accelerated terminal maturation in the limbs of the RUNX2 OE embryos compared to control embryos. Additionally, RUNX2 OE resulted in enhanced TUNEL staining indicative of increased chondrocyte apoptosis throughout all regions of the growth plate. For all postnatal studies, RUNX2 OE was induced at 2 months of age. Surprisingly, no histopathological signs of OA or cartilage catabolism were observed even six months following induction of RUNX2 OE in postnatal animals. Using the meniscal/ligamentous injury (MLI), a surgical model of knee joint destabilization and meniscal injury, however, we found that chondrocyte-specific RUNX2 OE accelerates the progression of OA pathogenesis following joint trauma. Histomorphometry and OARSI scoring confirmed decreased cartilage area two months following injury in the RUNX2 OE joints compared to control joints. Further, the numbers of MMP13-positive and TUNEL-positive chondrocytes were significantly greater in the articular cartilage of the RUNX2 OE joints compared to control joints one month following injury. Collectively, our data support that RUNX2 OE in growth plate chondrocytes is sufficient to promote their hypertrophy and terminal maturation during development. While RUNX2 overexpression alone is surprisingly insufficient to induce catabolic changes to the postnatal articular cartilage, it can accelerate the progression of post-traumatic OA. These results suggest that although increased RUNX2 expression may predetermine the rate of OA onset and/or progression following traumatic joint injury, alone this change is not sufficient to initiate the OA degenerative process.",

    "abstract": "Tissue morphogenesis critically depends on the coordination of cellular growth patterns. In plants, many organs consist of clonally distinct cell layers, such as the epidermis, whose cells undergo divisions that are oriented along the plane of the layer. The developmental control of such planar growth is poorly understood. We have previously identified the Arabidopsis AGCVIII-class protein kinase UNICORN (UCN) as a central regulator of this process. Plants lacking UCN activity show spontaneous formation of ectopic multicellular protrusions in integuments and malformed petals indicating that UCN suppresses uncontrolled growth in those tissues. In the current model UCN regulates planar growth of integuments in part by directly repressing the putative transcription factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS). Here we report on the identification of 3-PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1 (PDK1) as a novel factor involved in UCN-mediated growth control. PDK1 constitutes a basic component of signaling mediated by AGC protein kinases throughout eukaryotes. Arabidopsis PDK1 is implied in stress responses and growth promotion. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in PDK1 suppress aberrant growth in integuments and petals of ucn mutants. Additional genetic, in vitro, and cell biological data support the view that UCN functions by repressing PDK1. Furthermore, our data indicate that PDK1 is indirectly required for deregulated growth caused by ATS overexpression. Our findings support a model proposing that UCN suppresses ectopic growth in integuments through two independent processes: the attenuation of the protein kinase PDK1 in the cytoplasm and the repression of the transcription factor ATS in the nucleus.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPlant organs, such as petals or roots, are composites of distinct cell layers. As a rule, cells making up a layer, for example the epidermis, the outermost layer of a tissue, divide \\\"within the plane\\\" of the layer. This cellular behavior results in the two-dimensional sheet-like or planar growth of the cell layer. The mechanism orchestrating such a growth pattern is poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how uncontrolled and \\\"out-of-plane\\\" growth is avoided. Here we provide insight into this process. Our data indicate that higher than normal activity of a central regulator of growth and stress responses results in wavy and malformed petals and in protrusion-like aberrant outgrowths in the tissue that will develop into the seed coat. It is therefore important to keep this factor in check to allow proper formation of those tissues. We further show that a protein called UNICORN attenuates the activity of this regulator thereby ensuring the sheet-like growth of young petals or the developing seed coat.",

    "abstract": "The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) encodes a proteasome that carries out regulated degradation of bacterial proteins. It has been proposed that the proteasome contributes to nitrogen metabolism in M. tuberculosis, although this hypothesis had not been tested. Upon assessing M. tuberculosis growth in several nitrogen sources, we found that a mutant strain lacking the Mycobacterium proteasomal activator Mpa was unable to use nitrate as a sole nitrogen source due to a specific failure in the pathway of nitrate reduction to ammonium. We found that the robust activity by the nitrite reductase complex NirBD depended on expression of the groEL/groES chaperonin genes, which are regulated by the repressor HrcA. We identified HrcA as a likely proteasome substrate, and propose that the degradation of HrcA is required for the full expression of chaperonin genes. Furthermore, our data suggest that degradation of HrcA, along with numerous other proteasome substrates, is enhanced during growth in nitrate to facilitate the de-repression of the chaperonin genes. Importantly, growth in nitrate is the first example of a specific condition that reduces the steady-state levels of numerous proteasome substrates in M. tuberculosis.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe proteasome is required for the full virulence of M. tuberculosis. However, the extent of its role as a regulator of bacterial physiology remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate a novel function of the proteasome system in maintaining the expression of essential chaperonin genes. This activity by the proteasome is required for M. tuberculosis to use nitrate as a nitrogen source. Furthermore, we identified a specific growth condition that robustly decreases the abundance of pupylated proteins. This observation strongly suggests the presence of a yet-to-be-determined mechanism of control over the Pup-proteasome system in M. tuberculosis that is induced in nitrate.",

    "abstract": "The human brain constantly anticipates the future based on memories of the past. Encountering a familiar situation reactivates memory of previous encounters which can trigger a prediction of what comes next to facilitate responsiveness. However, a prediction error can lead to pruning of the offending memory, a process that weakens its representation in the brain and leads to forgetting. Our goal in this study was to evaluate whether memories are spared from pruning in situations that allow for more abstract yet reliable predictions. We hypothesized that when the category, but not the identity, of a new stimulus can be anticipated, this will reduce pruning of existing memories and also reduce encoding of the specifics of new memories. Participants viewed a sequence of objects, some of which reappeared multiple times (\"cues\"), followed always by novel items. Half of the cues were followed by new items from different (unpredictable) categories, while others were followed by new items from a single (predictable) category. Pattern classification of fMRI data was used to identify category-specific predictions after each cue. Pruning was observed only in unpredictable contexts, while encoding of new items suffered more in predictable contexts. These findings demonstrate that how episodic memories are updated is influenced by the reliability of abstract-level predictions in familiar contexts.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral neural signals have the potential to provide the necessary motor, sensory or autonomic information for robust control in many neuroprosthetic and neuromodulation applications. However, developing methods to recover information encoded in these signals is a significant challenge. We introduce the idea of using spatiotemporal signatures extracted from multi-contact nerve cuff electrode recordings to classify naturally evoked compound action potentials (CAP). 9 Long-Evan rats were implanted with a 56-channel nerve cuff on the sciatic nerve. Afferent activity was selectively evoked in the different fascicles of the sciatic nerve (tibial, peroneal, sural) using mechano-sensory stimuli. Spatiotemporal signatures of recorded CAPs were used to train three different classifiers. Performance was measured based on the classification accuracy, F1-score, and the ability to reconstruct original firing rates of neural pathways. The mean classification accuracies, for a 3-class problem, for the best performing classifier was 0.686 {+/-} 0.126 and corresponding mean F1-score was 0.605 {+/-} 0.212. The mean Pearson correlation coefficients between the original firing rates and estimated firing rates found for the best classifier was 0.728 {+/-} 0.276. The proposed method demonstrates the possibility of classifying individual naturally evoked CAPs in peripheral neural signals recorded from extraneural electrodes, allowing for more precise control signals in neuroprosthetic applications.",

    "abstract": "The floral repressor APETALA2 (AP2) in Arabidopsis regulates flowering through the age pathway. The AP2 orthologue in the alpine perennial Arabis alpina, PERPETUAL FLOWERING 2 (PEP2), was previously reported to regulate flowering through the vernalization pathway by enhancing the expression of another floral repressor PERPETUAL FLOWERING 1 (PEP1), the orthologue of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). However, PEP2 also regulates flowering independently of PEP1. To characterize the function of PEP2 we analyzed the transcriptomes of pep2 and pep1 mutants. The majority of differentially expressed genes were detected between pep2 and the wild type or between pep2 and pep1, highlighting the importance of the PEP2 role that is independent of PEP1. Here we demonstrate that PEP2 prevents the upregulation of the A. alpina floral meristem identity genes FRUITFUL (AaFUL), LEAFY (AaLFY) and APETALA1 (AaAP1) which ensure floral commitment during vernalization. Young pep2 seedlings respond to vernalization, suggesting that PEP2 regulates the age-dependent response to vernalization independently of PEP1. The major role of PEP2 through the PEP1-dependent pathway takes place after vernalization, when it facilitates PEP1 activation both in the main shoot apex and in the axillary branches. These multiple roles of PEP2 in vernalization response contribute to the A. alpina life-cycle.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTThe Arabis alpina APETALA2 orthologue, PERPETUAL FLOWERING2, regulates the age-dependent response to vernalization and it is required to facilitate the activation of the A. alpina FLOWERING LOCUS C after vernalization.",

We show that this product is suitable for Nanopore sequencing as single reads, as well as for generating short-read Illumina sequences. Nanopore reads can be used to implement a straightforward method for error correction that reduces the per-read error rate, by comparing multiple genome copies combined into a single concatemer and by comparing reads generated from plus and minus strands. Thus we can achieve improved consensus sequencing accuracy of 99.7% and resolve intra-sample sequence variants to form whole-genome haplotypes. The combination of isothermal amplification and Nanopore sequencing offers the longer-term potential to develop point-of-care tests for HBV, which could also be adapted for other viruses.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic DNA methylation and three-dimensional chromatin architecture compose a major portion of a cells epigenome and play an essential role in tissue specific gene expression programs. Currently, DNA methylation and chromatin organization are generally profiled in separate assays. Here, we report Methyl-HiC, a method combining in situ Hi-C and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to simultaneously capture chromosome conformation and DNA methylome in a single assay. Methyl-HiC analysis of mouse embryonic stem cells reveals coordinated DNA methylation between distant yet spatially proximal genomic regions. Extension of Methyl-HiC to single cells further enables delineation of the heterogeneity of both chromosomal conformation and DNA methylation in a mixed cell population, and uncovers increased dynamics of chromatin contacts and decreased stochasticity in DNA methylation in genomic regions that replicate early during cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a major cause of pulmonary and systemic disease in at-risk populations. Gaps in knowledge about transmission patterns, evolution, and pathogenicity during infection have prompted a recent surge in genomic NTM research. Increased availability and affordability of whole genome sequencing (WGS) techniques, including the advent of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, provide new opportunities to sequence complete NTM genomes at a fraction of the previous cost. However, extracting large quantities of pure genomic DNA is particularly challenging with NTM due to their slow growth and recalcitrant cell wall. Here we report a DNA extraction protocol that is optimized for long-read WGS of NTM, yielding large quantities of highly pure DNA. Our refined method was compared to 6 other methods with variations in timing of mechanical and enzymatic digestion, quantity of matrix material, and reagents used in extraction and precipitation. We also demonstrate the ability of our optimized protocol to produce sufficient DNA to yield near-complete NTM genome assemblies using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Timing of seed germination is crucial for seed plants and coordinated by internal and external cues, reflecting adaptations to different habitats. Physiological and molecular studies with lettuce and Arabidopsis thaliana have documented a strict requirement for light to initiate germination and identified many receptors, signalling cascades, and hormonal control elements. In contrast, seed germination of several other plants is inhibited by light, but the molecular basis of this converse response is unknown. We describe Aethionema arabicum (Brassicaceae) as a suitable model plant to investigate the mechanism of germination inhibition by light, as it comprises accessions with natural variation between light-sensitive and light-neutral responses. Inhibition is independent of light wavelength and increases with light intensity and duration. Gibberellins and abscisic acid are involved in the control of germination as in Arabidopsis, but transcriptome comparisons of light- and dark-exposed Aethionema arabicum seeds revealed that expression of genes for key regulators upon light exposure undergo converse changes, resulting in antipodal hormone regulation. This illustrates that similar modular components of a pathway in light-inhibited, light-neutral and light requiring germination among the Brassicaceae have been assembled by evolution to produce divergent pathways, likely as adaptive traits.\\n\\nHighlightIn contrast to light requirement for Arabidopsis seed germination, germination of several Aethionema arabicum accessions is inhibited by light, due to antipodal transcriptional regulation of hormone balance.",

    "abstract": "Cardiorenal syndrome is defined by primary heart failure conditions influencing or leading to renal injury or dysfunction. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major co-existing form of heart failure (HF) with renal diseases. Myocardin (MYOCD), a cardiac-specific co-activator of serum response factor (SRF), is increased in DCM mice and patient cardiac tissues and plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DCM. Inhibiting the increased MYOCD has shown to be partially rescuing the DCM mice phenotype. However, expression levels of MYOCD in the cardiac tissues of the cardiorenal syndromic patients and the beneficial effect of inhibiting MYOCD in a cardiorenal syndrome model remains to be explored.\n\nHere, we analyzed the expression levels of MYOCD in the DCM patients with and without renal diseases. We also explored, whether cardiac specific silencing of MYOCD expression could ameliorate the cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac function in a renal artery ligated rat model (RAL). We observed an increase in MYOCD levels in the endomyocardial biopsies of DCM patients associated with renal failure compared to DCM alone. Silencing of MYOCD in RAL rats by a cardiac homing peptide conjugated MYOCD siRNA resulted in attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and restoration of the left ventricular functions.\n\nOur data suggest hyper-activation of MYOCD in the pathogenesis of the cardiorenal failure cases. Also, MYOCD silencing showed beneficial effects by rescuing cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, size and function in a cardiorenal rat model.",
