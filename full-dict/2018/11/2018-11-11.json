    "abstract": "BackgroundMetazoan lineages exhibit a wide range of regenerative capabilities that vary among developmental stage and tissue type. The most robust regenerative abilities are apparent in the phyla Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, and Echinodermata, whose members are capable of whole-body regeneration (WBR). This phenomenon has been well-characterized in planarian and hydra models, but the molecular details of WBR are less established within echinoderms, or any other deuterostome system. Thus, it is not clear to what degree aspects of this regenerative ability are due to deeply conserved mechanisms.\\n\\nResultsWe characterize regeneration in the larval stage of the Bat Star (Patiria miniata). Following bisection along the anterior-posterior axis, larvae progress through phases of wound healing and re-proportioning of larval tissues. The overall number of proliferating cells is reduced following bisection and we find evidence for a re-deployment of genes with known roles in embryonic axial patterning. Following axial re-specification, we observe a significant localization of proliferating cells to the wound region. Analyses of transcriptome data highlight the molecular signatures of functions that are common to regeneration, including specific signaling pathways and cell cycle controls. Notably, we find evidence for temporal conservation among orthologous genes involved in regeneration from published Platyhelminth and Cnidarian regeneration datasets.\\n\\nConclusionsThese analyses show that sea star larval regeneration includes phases of wound response, axis respecification, and wound proximal proliferation. Commonalities of the overall process of regeneration, as well as gene usage between this deuterostome and other species with divergent evolutionary origins suggest a deep conservation of whole-body regeneration among the metazoa.",

    "abstract": "For most experimental biologists, handling the avalanche of data generated is similar to learning how to drive on your own. Although that might be doable, it is preferable and safer to learn programming and good practices together and preferably from experienced scientists. One way to achieve this is to build local communities of practice in scientific programming by bringing together life scientists that perform code-intensive research to spread know-how and good practices. The community will make sure that, for a given researcher working for an academic institution, their capacity to conduct data-intensive research will not be arbitrarily reliant on the presence of well-trained bioinformaticians in their vicinity.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a three-step field guide for building a local community of practice in scientific programming for life scientists. The first step is organizing a Carpentries programming workshop designed for researchers new to computational biology. However, while such workshops provide an immediate solution for learning, more regular long-term assistance is also needed. Researchers need persisting, local support to continue learning and solving programming issues that may hamper their research progress. The solution we describe here is to implement a Mozilla Study Group where researchers can meet-up and help each other in a \\\"safe-learning atmosphere\\\". We describe two real-life examples of building local communities of practice: one in the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Science Park and one in the United States at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In order to help future researchers to build their own community of practice in scientific programming we discuss challenges and implemented solutions.\\n\\nWe believe that our local communities of practice will prove useful for other life scien-tists who want to set up similar support groups for researchers involved in scientific programming and data science.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn this paper, we describe why and how to build a community of practice for life scientists that start to make more use of computers and programming in their research. A community of practice is a small group of scientists that meet regularly to help each other and promote good practices in scientific computing. While most life scientists are well-trained in the laboratory to conduct experiments, good practices with (big) datasets and their analysis are often missing. This paper proposes a field-guide on how to build such a community of practice at a local academic institution. Based on two real-life examples, challenges and related recommendations are provided. We believe that the current data deluge that life scientists will increasingly face can benefit from the implementation of these small communities. Good practices spread among experimental scientists will foster open, transparent, sound scientific results beneficial to society.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphIdentification of protective and/or pathogenic genetic modifiers provides important insight into the heterogeneity of disease presentations in individuals affected by neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), despite having well-defined pathogenic variants. Targeting modifier genes to improve disease phenotypes could be especially beneficial in cases where the causative genes are large, structurally complex and the mutations are heterogeneous. Here, we report a mutation-independent strategy to upregulate expression of a compensatory disease-modifying gene in Congenital Muscular Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) using a CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system. MDC1A is caused by nonfunctional Laminin 2, which compromises muscle fibers stability and axon myelination in peripheral nerves 1. Transgenic overexpression of Lama1, encoding a structurally similar protein Laminin 1, ameliorates muscle wasting and paralysis in the MDC1A mouse models, demonstrating its role as a protective disease modifier 2. Yet, upregulation of Lama1 as a postnatal gene therapy is hampered by its large size, which exceeds the current genome packaging capacity of clinically relevant delivery vehicles such as adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs). In this study, we sought to upregulate Lama1 using CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system, comprised of catalytically inactive S. aureus Cas9 (dCas9) fused to VP64 transactivation domains and sgRNAs targeting the Lama1 promoter. We first demonstrated robust upregulation of Lama1 in myoblasts, and following AAV9-mediated intramuscular delivery, in skeletal muscles of dy2j/dy2j mouse model of MDC1A.\\n\\nWe therefore assessed whether systemic upregulation of Lama1 would yield therapeutic benefits in dy2j/dy2j mice. When the intervention was started early in pre-symptomatic dy2j/dy2j mice, Lama1 upregulation prevented muscle fibrosis and hindlimb paralysis. An important question for future therapeutic approaches for a variety of disorders concerns the therapeutic window and phenotypic reversibility. This is particularly true for muscular dystrophies as it has long been hypothesized that fibrotic changes in skeletal muscle represent an irreversible disease state that would impair any therapeutic intervention at advanced stages of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that dystrophic features and disease progression were significantly improved and partially reversed when the treatment was initiated in symptomatic 3-week old dy2j/dy2j mice with already-apparent hind limb paralysis and significant muscle fibrosis.\\n\\nCollectively, our data demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated modulation of a disease modifier gene, which opens up an entirely new and mutation-independent treatment approach for all MDC1A patients. Moreover, this treatment strategy provides evidence that muscle fibrosis can be reversible, thus extending the therapeutic window for this disorder. Our data provide a proof-of-concept strategy that can be applied to a variety of disease modifier genes and a powerful therapeutic approach for various inherited and acquired diseases.",

    "abstract": "During early mammalian development, the two X-chromosomes in female cells are active. Dosage compensation between XX female and XY male cells is then achieved by X-chromosome inactivation in female cells. Reprogramming female mouse somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) leads to X-chromosome reactivation. The extent to which increased X-chromosome dosage (X-dosage) in female iPSCs leads to differences in the molecular and cellular properties of XX and XY iPSCs is still unclear. We show that chromatin accessibility in mouse iPSCs is modulated by X-dosage. Specific sets of transcriptional regulator motifs are enriched in chromatin with increased accessibility in XX or XY iPSCs. We show that the transcriptome, growth and pluripotency exit are also modulated by X-dosage in iPSCs. To understand the mechanisms by which increased X-dosage modulates the molecular and cellular properties of mouse pluripotent stem cells, we used heterozygous deletions of the X-linked gene Dusp9 in XX embryonic stem cells. We show that X-dosage regulates the transcriptome, open chromatin landscape, growth and pluripotency exit largely independently of global DNA methylation. Our results uncover new insights into X-dosage in pluripotent stem cells, providing principles of how gene dosage modulates the epigenetic and genetic mechanisms regulating cell identity.",

The NTD infants had been referred to a center for the treatment of autism by pediatric neurologists and expert clinicians. Using computational analysis we document in TD infants a phylogenetic ancient behavior: origin-related exploration. Strikingly, while the TD infants exhibited excursions in reference to mother and deep engagement with mother when visiting her, the NTD infants tended to avoid mothers place, performing few if any excursions, and exhibiting shallow engagement with mother. Given the pervasiveness of origin-related exploration in invertebrates, vertebrates, and primates, we now face a challenge to find an animal model that will exhibit active exploration while ignoring or suppressing the return to the origin, be it a mother or any other safe haven.",

ICD and EPD have mainly been reported in copepods, and whether they occur in other arthropods is not known. If they did, then rearing studies could be simplified because the durations of later developmental stages could be predicted based on those of earlier ones. The goal of this study was to test whether different taxa have ICD, EPD, or an alternative development type in which stage-specific proportions depend on temperature, termed  variable proportional development (VPD), and also how well each development type allowed later-stage durations to be predicted from earlier ones. Data for 71 arthropods (arachnids, copepod and decapod crustaceans, and insects) were tested, and most (85.9 %) species were concluded to have VPD, meaning that ICD and EPD do not occur generally. However, EPD predicted later-stage durations comparably well to VPD (within 19-23 %), and thus may still be useful. Interestingly, some species showed a  mixed form of development, where some stages developmental proportions varied with temperature while those of others did not, which should be further investigated.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWhether arthropod development is generally isochronal or equiproportional was tested\\nC_LIO_LIDevelopmental proportions of most species stages varied with temperature\\nC_LIO_LIMany species had  mixed development between variable and equiproportional types\\nC_LIO_LIThe general occurrence of isochronal and equiproportional development was rejected\\nC_LIO_LIEquiproportional development did make reasonable predictions of stage durations\\nC_LI",

A recent study reported over 30 distinct types in the mouse retina, indicating that the processing of visual information is highly parallelised in the brain. The advent of high density multi-electrode arrays now enables recording from many hundreds to thousands of neurons from a single retina. Here we describe a method for the automatic classification of large-scale retinal recordings using a simple stimulus paradigm and a spike train distance measure as a clustering metric. We evaluate our approach using synthetic spike trains, and demonstrate that major known cell types are identified in high-density recording sessions from the mouse retina with around 1000 retinal ganglion cells. A comparison across different retinas reveals substantial variability between preparations, suggesting pooling data across retinas should be approached with caution. As a parameter-free method, our approach is broadly applicable for cellular physiological classification in all sensory modalities.",

    "abstract": "Ocean-floor sediment samples collected up to 150 years ago represent an important historical archive to benchmark global changes in the seafloor environment, such as species range shifts and invasions and pollution trends. Such benchmarking requires that the historical sediment samples represent the state of the environment at or shortly before the time of collection. However, early oceanographic expeditions sampled the ocean floor using devices like the sounding tube or a dredge, which potentially disturb the sediment surface and recover a mix of Holocene (surface) and deeper, Pleistocene sediments. Here we use climate-sensitive microfossils as a fast biometric method to assess if historical seafloor samples contain a mixture of modern and glacial sediments. Our assessment is based on comparing the composition of planktonic foraminifera (PF) assemblages in historical samples with Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) global reference datasets. We show that eight out of the nine historical samples contain PF assemblages more similar to the Holocene than to the LGM PF assemblages, but the comparisons are only significant when there is a high local species temporal turnover (from the LGM to the Holocene). When analysing temporal turnover globally, we show that upwelling and temperate regions had greatest species turnover, which are areas where our methodology would be most diagnostic. Our results suggest that sediment samples from historical collections can provide a baseline of the state of marine ecosystems in the late 19th century, and thus be used to assess ocean global change trends.",

In Xenopus, depletion of Ccdc11 causes defects in LR patterning, recapitulating the patient phenotype. Upon Ccdc11 depletion, normally monociliated cells of the Left-Right Organizer (LRO) exhibit multiple cilia per cell. Unexpectedly, we found that Ccdc11 is necessary for successful cytokinesis, and the multiciliation observed in Ccdc11-depleted cells was due to failed cytokinesis. Furthermore, CCDC11 depletion alters cell-cell adhesion with reduction in junctional localization of adhesion molecules. The small GTPase RhoA is critical for cytokinesis and cell-cell adhesion. Because the CCDC11 depletion phenotypes are reminiscent of RhoA loss of function, we investigated a possible connection to regulation of RhoA signaling. We demonstrate that CCDC11 is localized to the cytokinetic contractile ring overlapping with RhoA during cytokinesis and regulates total RhoA protein levels. Our results suggest that CCDC11 connects cytokinesis and LR patterning via RhoA regulation, providing a potential mechanism for heterotaxy disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Direct coupling analysis (DCA) for protein folding has made very good progress, but it is not effective for proteins that lack many sequence homologs, even coupled with time-consuming folding simulation. We show that we can accurately predict the distance matrix of a protein by deep learning, even for proteins with [~]60 sequence homologs. Using only the geometric constraints given by the resulting distance matrix we may construct 3D models without involving any folding simulation. Our method successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 hours on a Linux computer of 20 CPUs. In contrast, DCA cannot fold any of these hard targets in the absence of folding simulation, and the best CASP12 group folded only 11 of them by integrating DCA-predicted contacts into complex, fragment-based folding simulation. Rigorous experimental validation in CASP13 shows that our distance-based folding server successfully folded 17 of 32 hard targets (with a median family size of 36 sequence homologs) and obtained 70% precision on top L/5 long-range predicted contacts. Latest experimental validation in CAMEO shows that our server predicted correct fold for two membrane proteins of new fold while all the other servers failed. These results imply that it is now feasible to predict correct fold for proteins lack of similar structures in PDB on a personal computer without folding simulation.\\n\\nSignificanceAccurate description of protein structure and function is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics. Although greatly improved, experimental protein structure determination is still low-throughput and costly, especially for membrane proteins. As such, computational structure prediction is often resorted. Predicting the structure of a protein with a new fold (i.e., without similar structures in PDB) is very challenging and usually needs a large amount of computing power. This paper shows that by using a powerful deep learning technique, even with only a personal computer we can predict new folds much more accurately than ever before. This method also works well on membrane protein folding.",

A total of 55 specimens were CT scanned to generate a three-dimensional model of each cranium, and 57 landmarks were digitized to analyze the craniofacial shape variation in the Japanese macaque. The results showed that four intra-specific groups, consisting of two subspecies and the two sexes, differed in both size and shape space. In size, the cranium of the Macaca fuscata yakui (MFY) was smaller than that of Macaca fuscata fuscata (MFF) in both sexes, and female crania were smaller than male crania in both subspecies. Shape sexual dimorphisms in both subspecies were detected in the first axis of principal component analysis and were related to a relatively broad orbit, smaller neurocranium, enlarged snout, and broader temporal fossa in males. The shape differences between subspecies showed different features than those between sexes. Male subspecies shape differences were detected in the first and third axes, while those for females were in the first and second axes. Subspecies shape differences common to both sexes were a narrower orbit, relatively small neurocranium, longer snout, and postorbital constriction in MFY. Male MFY was specifically characterized by a more anterior and superior direction of snout protrusion. In contrast, female MFY showed an inferior direction of snout protrusion. Female MFY also had a taller orbit. With regard to the relationship between size and shape differences, shape sexual dimorphism for each subspecies was positively associated with size difference, but there was no such association between subspecies in either sex. Size does not seem to play an important role in subspeciation of Macaca fuscata.",

Our robust phylogenetic hypothesis reveals trends in growth form including an overall increase in height in the B. armata clade, and independent evolution of dwarf forms from taller ancestors in the B. pimo and B. dulcis clades. Ancestral range estimation reveals roles of dispersal (e.g. B. edulis on Guadalupe Island) and sympatric speciation in some cases (e.g. in the B. armata clade), but is equivocal in others (e.g. in the B. pimo clade). We find evidence of niche non-equivalency among species within the B. armata clade in northwestern Mexico, and some evidence of niche non-equivalency between B. berlandieri and B. dulcis, the former of which is synonymized under B. dulcis.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings have implications for the complex biogeographic history in Central America and Mexico, suggesting that sympatric speciation and dispersal are the predominant processes of species diversification. Future studies should include population-level sampling across the genus, along with morphological and ecological information, to assess distinctness among species and, particularly, levels of gene flow, in an integrative fashion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDown syndrome remains the main genetic cause of intellectual disability, with an incidence rate of about 1 in 700 live births. The Ts65Dn mouse strain, with an extra murine chromosome that includes genes from chromosomes 10, 16 and 17 of the mouse and the Tc1 strain with an extra human chromosome 21, are currently accepted as informative and well-studied models for Down Syndrome. Using whole cell patch clamp we recently showed changes in several types of transmembrane currents in hippocampal neuronal cultures of Ts65Dn and Tc1 embryos. The associated genetic changes responsible for these changes in physiology were yet to be studied.\\n\\nMethodsWe used qPCR to measure RNA expression level of a few of the channel genes that we suspect are implicated in the previously reported changes of measured currents, and performed statistical analysis using Matlab procedures for the standard t-test and ANOVA and for calculating correlations between the RNA expression levels of several channel genes.\\n\\nResultsWe present differential gene expression levels measured using qPCR of the potassium channel regulators KCNE1 and KCNE2 in both Ts65Dn and Tc1 embryos and pups compared to controls. In Tc1, the human genes KCNJ6 and KCNJ15 are expressed in addition to a statistically insignificant increase of expression in the mouse genes KCNJ6 and KCNJ15. All channel genes that we have measured with large replication, have the same up-regulation or down-regulation in both mouse models, indicating that the transcription mechanism acts similarly in these two mouse models. The large dataset furthermore allows us to observe correlations between different channel genes. We find that, despite the significant changes in expression levels, channels that are known to interact have a high and significant correlation in expression both in controls and in the Down syndrome mouse model.\\n\\nConclusionsWe suggest the differential expression of KCNE1 and KCNE2 as a possible cause for our previously reported changes in potassium currents. We report a KCNJ6 and KCNJ15 overexpression, which plays a role in the increased input conductance and the reduced cell excitability that we previously reported in the Tc1 mouse model. The large and significant positive (KCNQ2-KCNQ3, KCNE1-KCNE2, KCNQ3-KCNE1, KCNQ2-KCNE1, KCNQ2-KCNE2, KCNQ3-KCNE2) and negative correlations (KCNE1-KCNJ15, KCNE2-KCNJ15) that we find between channel genes indicate that these genes probably work in a cooperative or in a mutually exclusive manner.",

As a depolarizing channel, its function is studied in the central nervous system and kidney. TRPC5 forms heteromultimers with TRPC1, but also forms homomultimers. It can be activated by reducing agents through reduction of the extracellular disulfide bond. Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of TRPC5. The structure of TRPC5 in its apo state is partially open, which may be related to the weak activation of TRPC5 in response to extracellular pH. We also report the conserved negatively charged residues of the cation binding site located in the hydrophilic pocket between S2 and S3. Comparison of the TRPC5 structure to previously determined structures of other TRPC and TRP channels reveals differences in the extracellular pore domain and in the length of the S3 helix. Together, these results shed light on the structural features that contribute to the specific activation mechanism of the receptor-activated TRPC5.",

    "abstract": "The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a mouse genetic reference population whose range of applications includes quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The design of a CC QTL mapping study involves multiple decisions, including which and how many strains to use, and how many replicates per strain to phenotype, all viewed within the context of hypothesized QTL architecture. Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses based on extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4) the distribution of functionally distinct alleles among the founder strains at the QTL. We also provide general power estimates to aide in the design of future experiments. All analyses were conducted with our R package, SPARCC (Simulated Power Analysis in the Realized Collaborative Cross), developed for performing either large scale power analyses or those tailored to particular CC experiments.",

    "abstract": "Advances in supervised learning have enabled accurate prediction in biological systems governed by complex interactions among biomolecules. However, state-of-the-art predictive algorithms are typically \\\"black-boxes,\\\" learning statistical interactions that are difficult to translate into testable hypotheses. The iterative Random Forest (iRF) algorithm took a step towards bridging this gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the stable, high-order feature interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of Random Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions identified by iRF to explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method, signed iRF (s-iRF), describes \\\"subsets\\\" of rules that frequently occur on RF decision paths. We refer to these \\\"rule subsets\\\" as signed interactions. Signed interactions share not only the same set of interacting features but also exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent functional relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe stable and predictive importance metrics (SPIMs) to rank signed interactions in terms of their stability, predictive accuracy, and strength of interaction. For each SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior under known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and spatial gene expression patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF recovers one of the few experimentally validated high-order interactions and suggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active. In the case of spatial gene expression patterns, s-iRF recovers all 11 reported links in the gap gene network. By refining the process of interaction recovery, our approach has the potential to guide mechanistic inquiry into systems whose scale and complexity is beyond human comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis pathology is driven by the type 3 cytokines IL-17 and Il-22, but little is understood about the dynamics that initiate alterations in tissue homeostasis. Here, we use mouse models, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), computational inference and cell lineage mapping to show that psoriasis induction reconfigures the functionality of skin-resident ILCs to initiate disease. Tissue-resident ILCs amplified an initial IL-23 trigger and were sufficient, without circulatory ILCs, to drive pathology, indicating that ILC tissue remodeling initiates psoriasis. Skin ILCs expressed type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 in steady state, but were epigenetically poised to become ILC3-like cells. ScRNA-seq profiles of ILCs from psoriatic and naive skin of wild type (WT) and Rag1-/- mice form a dense continuum, consistent with this model of fluid ILC states. We inferred biological \\\"topics\\\" underlying these states and their relative importance in each cell with a generative model of latent Dirichlet allocation, showing that ILCs from untreated skin span a spectrum of states, including a naive/quiescent-like state and one expressing the Cd74 and Il13 but little Il5. Upon disease induction, this spectrum shifts, giving rise to a greater proportion of classical Il5- and Il13- expressing \\\"ILC2s\\\" and a new, mixed ILC2/ILC3-like subset, expressing Il13, Il17, and Il22. Using these key topics, we related the cells through transitions, revealing a quiescence-ILC2-ILC3s state trajectory. We demonstrated this plasticity in vivo, combining an IL-5 fate mouse with IL-17A and IL-22 reporters, validating the transition of IL-5-producing ILC2s to IL-22- and IL-17A-producing cells during disease initiation. Thus, steady-state skin ILCs are actively repressed and cued for a plastic, type 2 response, which, upon induction, morphs into a type 3 response that drives psoriasis. This suggests a general model where specific immune activities are primed in healthy tissue, dynamically adapt to provocations, and left unchecked, drive pathological remodeling.",

We have targeted this redox environment with the cyclic nitroxide derivative 4-methoxy-TEMPO (MetT) in the zebrafish-M. marinum infection model. MetT inhibited the production of mitochondrial ROS and decreased infection-induced cell death to aid containment of infection. We identify a second mechanism of action whereby stress conditions, including hypoxia, found in the infection microenvironment appear to sensitise M. marinum to killing by MetT both in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "Cortical connectivity conforms to a series of organizing principles that are common across species. Spatial proximity, similar cortical type, and similar connectional profile all constitute factors for determining the connectivity between cortical regions. We previously demonstrated another principle of connectivity that is closely related to the spatial layout of the cerebral cortex. Using functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI in the human cortex, we found that the further a region is located from primary cortex, the more distant are its functional connections with other areas of the cortex. However, it remains unknown whether this relationship between cortical layout and connectivity extends to other primate species. Here, we investigated this relationship using both resting-state functional connectivity as well as gold-standard tract-tracing connectivity in the macaque monkey cortex. For both measures of connectivity, we found a gradient of connectivity distance extending between primary and frontoparietal regions. As in the human cortex, the further a region is located from primary areas, the stronger its connections to distant portions of the cortex, with connectivity distance highest in frontal and parietal regions. The similarity between the human and macaque findings provide evidence for a phylogenetically conserved relationship between the spatial layout of cortical areas and connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Perception of sensory stimulation is influenced by numerous psychological variables. One example is placebo analgesia, where expecting low pain causes a painful stimulus to feel less painful. Yet, because pain evolved to signal threats to survival, it should be maladaptive for highly-erroneous expectations to yield unrealistic pain experiences. Therefore, we hypothesised that a cue followed by a highly discrepant stimulus intensity, which generates a large prediction error, will have a weaker influence on the perception of that stimulus. To test this hypothesis we collected two independent pain-cueing datasets. The second dataset and the analysis plan were preregistered (osf.io/5r6z7). Regression modelling revealed that reported pain intensities were best explained by a quartic polynomial model of the prediction error. The results indicated that the influence of cues on perceived pain decreased when stimulus intensity was very different from expectations, suggesting that prediction error size has an immediate functional role in pain perception.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent-flow respirometry is widely used to measure oxygen uptake rates and subsequently estimate aerobic metabolic rates of aquatic animals. However, the lack of a standard quality-control software to detect technical problems represents a potential impediment to comparisons across studies. Here, we introduce  FishResp, a versatile R package and its graphical implementation for quality-control and filtering of raw respirometry data. Our goal is to provide a straightforward, cross-platform and free software to help improve the quality and comparability of metabolic rate estimates for reducing methodological fragmentation in the field of aquatic respirometry. FishResp accepts data from various respirometry systems, allows users to detect potential mechanical problems which can occur during oxygen uptake measurements (e.g. chamber leaking, poor water circulation), and offers six options to correct raw data for microbial oxygen consumption. The software performs filtering of raw data based on user criteria, and produces accurate and unbiased estimates of absolute and mass-specific metabolic rates. Using data from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we demonstrate the virtues of FishResp, highlighting the importance of detecting mechanical problems and correcting measurements for background respiration.\\n\\nLay summaryFishResp is a user-friendly tool for calculating oxygen uptake of aquatic organisms. The aim of the software is to improve the quality of metabolic rate estimates based on a straightforward pipeline: background respiration correction, detection of mechanical problems, conduction of QC tests, and filtration based on user-defined criteria.",

Besides FLC, other FRI targets also exist in Arabidopsis. Although leaves sense environmental cues to modulate flowering time, it is not known if roots also regulate the floral transition. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal effect of FRI on flowering time. Local expression of FRI in the phloem and leaves activated FLC to delay flowering. Furthermore, we found that local expression of FRI in the roots also delayed flowering by activating other targets MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) and MAF5 in the roots. Graft and genetic experiments revealed that the spatial expression of FRI in the root might generate a mobile signal, which is transmitted from roots to shoot and antagonizes the FT signal to delay flowering. Specifically expressing FRI in the embryo efficiently delayed flowering, even expressing FRI as early as pro-embryo stage is enough to upregulate FLC expression to delay flowering. Together, our findings confirm the spatiotemporal effect of FRI on delaying flowering, and propose that root tissue also perceives the flowering signal to fine-tune the flowering time through MAF4/5 as novel targets of FRI.\\n\\nHighlightRoot FRIDIGA activated the novel targets MAF4/5 to delay flowering; Temporal expressing FRIGIDA at as early as pro-embryo stage is efficient to delay flowering.",

With the rapid development of Multi-Omics analyses, it is desirable to minimize sample variations by using DNA, RNA, and proteins co-purified from the same samples. Currently, most of the co-purification protocols rely on Tri Reagent (Trizol as a common representative) and require protein precipitation and dissolving steps, which render difficulties in experimental handling and high-throughput analyses. Here, we established a simple and robust method to minimize the precipitation steps and yield ready-to-use RNA and protein in solutions. This method can be applied to samples in small quantity, such as protoplasts. We demonstrated that the protoplast system equipped with this method may facilitate studies on viroid biogenesis. Given the ease and the robustness of this new method, it will have broad applications for plant research and other disciplines in molecular biology.",

Here, we use expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace single cell transcriptomes dynamically during differentiation and apply this approach to the study of hematopoiesis. Our analysis identifies functional boundaries of cell potential early in the hematopoietic hierarchy and locates them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We reconstruct a developmental hierarchy showing separate ontogenies for granulocytic subtypes and two routes to monocyte differentiation that leave a persistent imprint on mature cells.

    "abstract": "Genomic regions associated with complex traits and diseases are primarily located in non-coding regions of the genome and have unknown mechanism of action. A critical step to understanding the genetics of complex traits is to fine-map each associated locus; that is, to find the causal variant(s) that underlie genetic associations with a trait. Fine-mapping approaches are currently focused on identifying genomic annotations, such as transcription factor binding sites, which are enriched in direct overlap with candidate causal variants. We introduce CONVERGE, the first computational tool to search for co-localization of GWAS causal variants with transcription factor binding sites in the same regulatory regions, without requiring direct overlap. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that CONVERGE is able to identify five novel regulators of type 2 diabetes which subsequently validated in knockdown experiments in pancreatic beta cells, while existing fine-mapping methods were unable to find any statistically significant regulators. CONVERGE also recovers more established regulators for total cholesterol compared to other fine-mapping methods. CONVERGE is therefore unique and complementary to existing fine-mapping methods and is useful for exploring the regulatory architecture of complex traits.",

However, its occurrence in other contexts, environment-dependence, and mechanistic basis are unclear. Here we address these questions using 1005 sequenced segregants generated from a yeast cross. Under each of 47 examined environments, 66-92% of tested polymorphisms exhibit diminishing returns epistasis. Surprisingly, improving environment quality also reduces the benefits of advantageous mutations even when fitness is controlled for, indicating the necessity to revise the global epistasis hypothesis. We propose that diminishing returns originates from the modular organization of life where the contribution of each functional module to fitness is determined jointly by the genotype and environment and has an upper limit, and demonstrate that our model predictions match empirical observations. These findings broaden the concept of diminishing returns epistasis, reveal its generality and potential cause, and have important evolutionary implications.",

    "abstract": "The Ashkenazi Jews (AJ) are a population isolate that have resided in Central Europe since at least the 10th century and share ancestry with both European and Middle Eastern populations. Between the 11th and 16th centuries, AJ expanded eastward leading to two culturally distinct communities, one in central Europe and one in eastern Europe. Our aim was to determine if there are genetically distinct AJ subpopulations that reflect the cultural groups, and if so, what demographic events contributed to the population differentiation. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to choose among models of AJ history and infer demographic parameter values, including divergence times, effective population size, and gene flow. For the ABC analysis we used allele frequency spectrum and identical by descent based statistics to capture information on a wide timescale. We also mitigated the effects of ascertainment bias when performing ABC on SNP array data by jointly modeling and inferring the SNP discovery. We found that the most likely model was population differentiation between the Eastern and Western AJ ~400 years ago. The differentiation between the Eastern and Western AJ could be attributed to more extreme population growth in the Eastern AJ (0.25 per generation) than the Western AJ (0.069 per generation).",

Leveraging the chromatin accessiblity of regulatory elements, we developed ARC-C (accessible region chromosome conformation capture), which profiles chromatin regulatory interactions genome-wide at high resolution. Applying ARC-C to C. elegans, we identify ~15,000 significant interactions at 500bp resolution. Regions bound by transcription factors and chromatin regulators such as cohesin and condensin II are enriched for interactions, and we use ARC-C to show that the BLMP-1 transcription factor mediates interactions between its targets. Investigating domain level architecture, we find that C. elegans chromatin domains defined by either active or repressive modifications form topologically associating domains (TADs) and that these domains interact to form A/B (active/inactive) compartment structure.

    "abstract": "Cells are defined by their unique ability to selfreplicate through cell division. This periodic process is known as the cell-cycle and it happens with a defined period in each cell. The budding yeast divides asymmetrically with a mother cell generating multiple daughter cells. Within the cell population each cell divides with the same period but asynchronously. Here, we investigate the problem of synchronising the cell-cycle across a population of yeast cells through a microfluidics-based feedback control platform. We propose a theoretical and experimental approach for cell-cycle control by considering a yeast strain that can be forced to start the cell-cycle by changing growth medium. The duration of the cell-cycle is strictly linked to the cell volume growth, hence a hard constraint in the controller design is to prevent excessive volume growth. We experimentally characterised the yeast strain and derived a simplified phase-oscillator model of the cell-cycle. We then designed and implemented three impulsive control strategies to achieve maximal synchronisation across the population and assessed their control performance by numerical simulations. The first two controllers are based on event-triggered strategies, while the third uses a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to select the sequence of control impulses while satisfying built-in constraints on volume growth. We compared the three strategies by computing two cost functions: one quantifying the level of synchronisation across the cell population and the other volume growth during the process. We demonstrated that the proposed control approaches can effectively achieve an acceptable trade-off between two conflicting control objectives: (i) obtaining maximal synchronisation of the cell cycle across the population while (ii) minimizing volume growth. The results can be used to implement effective strategies to unfold the biological mechanisms controlling cell cycle and volume growth in yeast cells.",

However, target gene might be integrated into heterochromatin region or unstable region of chromatin by using this method, and thus required multiple rounds of selection to obtain desirable expression cell lines with stable expression level of target proteins. Rational cell line construction method can overcome this shortcoming by integrating transgenes into stable hot spot within genome specifically. Thus, to discover novel effective hot spot would be critical for this new cell line construction method. Here we reported one practical method to discover new stable hot spot by using lentivirus infection and random integration. One such hot spot located at NW_006880285.1 was thoroughly investigated in this article. The expression stability of this hot spot was verified by detecting Zsgreen1 reporter gene expression for over 50 passages. When cells were adapted to suspension culture, they successfully kept expressing Zsgreen1 reporter gene. In addition, this suspension cell line could keep expressing reporter gene stably for another 50 passages. In summary, this research offered an easy new method for researchers to identify their own stable hot spots within CHO genome, and would contribute to the development of site-specific integration study in the future.",

To address this, we have gathered 262 plant sesquiterpene synthase sequences with experimentally characterized products. The annotated enzyme sequences allowed for an analysis of terpene synthase motifs, leading to the extension of one motif and recognition of a variant of another. In addition, putative terpene synthase sequences were obtained from various resources and compared with the annotated sesquiterpene synthases. This analysis indicated regions of terpene synthase sequence space which so far are unexplored experimentally. Finally, we present a case describing mutational studies on residues altering product specificity, for which we analyzed conservation in our database. This demonstrates an application of our database in choosing likely-functional residues for mutagenesis studies aimed at understanding or changing sesquiterpene synthase product specificity.",

The purpose of the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project is to build maps of molecular signatures of all human cell types and states to serve as references for future discoveries. Constructing such a complex reference atlas must involve the assembly and aggregation of data from multiple labs, probably generated with different technologies. It has much higher requirements on reproducibility than individual research projects. To add another layer of complexity, the bioinformatics procedures involved for single-cell data have high flexibility and diversity. There are many factors in the processing and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data that can shape the final results in different ways. To study what levels of reproducibility can be reached in current practices, we conducted a detailed reproduction study for a well-documented recent publication on the atlas of human blood dendritic cells as an example to break down the bioinformatics steps and factors that are crucial for the reproducibility at different levels. We found that the major scientific discovery can be well reproduced after some efforts, but there are also some differences in some details that may cause uncertainty in the future reference. This study provides a detailed case observation on the on-going discussions of the type of standards the HCA community should take when releasing data and publications to guarantee the reproducibility and reliability of the future atlas.",

    "abstract": "It is now well established that Southern European peninsulas have been major glacial refugia for temperate species during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. However, substantial environmental changes occurred also within these peninsulas throughout the Pleistocene, rising questions about the role and interplay of various of micro-evolutionary processes in shaping patterns of intraspecific diversity within these areas. Here, we investigate the patterns of genetic variation in the bank vole Myodes glareolus within the Italian peninsula. By using a panel of 13 microsatellite loci, we found more intra-specific variation than expected based on previous assessments. Indeed, both Bayesian and ordination-based clustering analyses of variation recovered five main geographic/genetic clusters along the peninsula, with three clusters geographically restricted to the southern portion of the study area. This pattern supports the occurrence of multiple sub-refugia for the bank vole in peninsular Italy, likely promoted by the major paleo-environmental changes which affected forested habitats within this area during the Pleistocene. Thus, our results support a scenario whereby the high levels of intraspecific diversity observed within major glacial refugia are better explained by dynamic micro-evolutionary processes occurred within these areas, rather than by long-term demographic stability of refugial population. Finally, the narrow and isolated distribution of some of the identified lineages, suggest the need for future assessments of their conservation and taxonomic status.",

Simultaneous inhibition of KDM7A and UTX significantly reduced leukocyte adhesion in mice, establishing the biological and potential translational relevance of this mechanism.

    "abstract": "European bison (Bison bonasus) are the largest endemic vertebrates in Europe, and one of the few megafaunal species to have survived the mass megafaunal extinction during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (12-9 thousand years ago). Untangling their evolutionary history would provide valuable information about the response of European megafauna to periods of rapid environmental change. However, a severe and recent population bottleneck obscures much of the population history that could be inferred from the genomes of modern individuals. While several studies have attempted to analyse ancient European bison populations directly using ancient DNA, their datasets were limited in temporal and geographic range. In this study we present the most comprehensive dataset of ancient European bison mitochondrial genomes to date, with 131 ancient bison samples from across the Eurasian continent covering over 50 thousand years. We reveal patterns of bison distribution and concurrent environmental changes across a broad geographical and temporal range. In particular, population expansions following periods of extensive forest reduction combined with a decrease in anthropogenic pressures suggest that European bison remain preferentially adapted to an open steppe environment through to the present day.",

    "abstract": "Penaeidins are members of a family of key effectors with broad anti-bacterial activities in penaeid shrimp. However, the function of penaeidins in antiviral immunity is rarely reported and remains largely unknown. Herein, we uncovered that penaeidins are a novel family of antiviral effectors against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Firstly, RNAi in vivo mediated knockdown of each penaeidin from four identified penaeidins from Litopenaeus vannamei resulted in elevated viral loads and rendered shrimp more susceptible to WSSV, whilst the phenotype of survival rate in penaeidin-silenced shrimp can be rescued via the injection of recombinant penaeidin proteins. Moreover, pull-down assays demonstrated the conserved PEN domain of penaeidin was able to interact with WSSV structural proteins. Furthermore, we observed that colloidal gold-labeled penaeidins were located on the outer surface of the WSSV virion. By infection-blocking assay, we observed that hemocytes had lower viral infection rates in the group of WSSV preincubated with penaeidins than those of control group. Phagocytic activity analysis further showed that penaeidins were able to inhibit phagocytic activity of hemocytes against WSSV Taken together, these results suggest that penaeidins specifically binds to WSSV virion by interacting with its structural proteins, thus preventing viral infection that confers host against WSSV. In addition, dual-luciferase assay and EMSA assay demonstrated that penaeidins were regulated by Dorsal and Relish, two transcription factors of the canonical Toll and IMD pathway, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on uncovering the antiviral function of penaeidins in the innate immune system of shrimp.\\n\\nImportancesWhite spot syndrome, caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), is the most serious disease in shrimp aquaculture, which has long been a scourge of cultured shrimp industry. Herein, we provided some substantial evidences to indicate that penaeidins are a novel family of effectors with antiviral activity against WSSV in shrimp. Penaeidins such as BigPEN, PEN2 and PEN3 were able to interact with the outer surface of WSSV virion via binding to viral structural proteins, and thus preventing viral entry host cells. In addition, we demonstrated that the Toll and IMD signaling pathways can regulate the transcriptional expression of penaeidins, which may suggest an important role of the conserved innate signaling pathways in antiviral immunity. This is the first report of the antiviral mechanism of penaeidins in shrimp, which may provide some new insights into strategies to control WSSV infection in shrimp farms.",

Many computational algorithms developed for single-cell RNA-seq adopted gene selection and dimension reduction strategies to address the dropouts. Here, an opposite view is explored. Instead of treating dropouts as a problem to be fixed, we embrace it as a useful signal for defining cell types. We present an iterative co-occurrence clustering algorithm that works with binarized single-cell RNA-seq count data. Surprisingly, although all the quantitative information is removed after the data is binarized, co-occurrence clustering of the binarized data is able to effectively identify cell populations, as well as cell-type specific pathways. We demonstrate that the binary dropout patterns of the data provides not only overlapping but also complementary information compared to the quantitative gene expression counts in single-cell RNA-seq data.",

We describe, statistically, the interactions between amino acids using resolved protein structures. Based on the frequency of amino acid interactions, we have devised an amino acid substitution model that implements the following idea: amino acids that have similar neighbors in the protein tertiary structure can replace each other, while substitution is more difficult between amino acids that prefer different spatial neighbors. Using known tertiary structures for -helical membrane (HM) proteins, we build evolutionary substitution matrices. We constructed maximum likelihood phylogenies using our amino acid substitution matrices and compared them to widely-used methods.

We performed pain phenotyping, functional neuroimaging, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments, inflammation biomarkers, and gene expression profiling in healthy subjects who underwent surgical extraction of bony impacted third molars, in order to characterize factors associated with heterogeneity in response to ibuprofen.\\n\\nSubjects were treated with rapid-acting ibuprofen (400 mg; N=19) or placebo (N=10) in a randomized, double-blind design. Compared to placebo, ibuprofen-treated subjects exhibited greater reduction in pain scores, alterations in regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions associated with pain processing, and inhibition of ex vivo cyclooxygenase activity and urinary prostaglandin metabolite excretion as indices of biochemical drug action (p<0.05). As expected, ibuprofen-treated subjects could be stratified into partial responders (N=9, required rescue medication within the dosing interval) and complete responders (N=10, no rescue medication). This was also reflected by differences in pain scores (p<0.01) as early as 30 minutes following drug administration (p<0.05). Variability in analgesic efficacy was not associated with demographic or clinical characteristics, ibuprofen pharmacokinetics, metabolizing enzyme genotype, or the degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition by ibuprofen. However, complete responders had higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers in urine and serum, than partial responders. Specifically, a stable urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite, serum TNF and IL-8 were higher in patients who did not require rescue medication compared those who did (p < 0.05). RNAseq gene expression analysis in PBMCs collected after surgery and ibuprofen administration showed enrichment of inflammation related pathways among genes differentially expressed (q < 0.2) between complete and partial responders\\n\\nThese findings suggest that patients who receive substantial pain relief from ibuprofen have a more pronounced activation of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathway and regulation of the inflammatory pain phenotype differs from those patients who are insufficiently treated with ibuprofen alone and may require an opioid or other therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Mastication behavior is a notable source of interindividual variation in texture perception and could be linked to oral sensitivity. As oral sensitivity declines so does the amount of tactile feedback relayed to the brain, resulting in less effective manipulation or food and a reduced ability to discriminate differences. To address these hypotheses, we measured masticatory behavior and related this to texture discrimination and oral sensitivity. The study was performed on 41 participants in two groups, with high (n = 20) or low (n=21) sensitivity. Oral sensitivity was measured using a battery of tests that included: oral stereognosis, lingual tactile acuity, and bite force sensitivity. Sensitivity to texture changes was measured using a series of triangle tests with confectionaries of different hardness, with masticatory patterns and behaviors being video recorded and analyzed using jaw tracking software. Overall, there was no significant difference between high and low sensitivity participants and their ability to distinguish texture changes. But, there were significantly different trends found between the groups based on their masticatory behaviors including chewing pattern and overall number of chews. But, it was found that multiple masticatory behaviors were being modulated by oral sensitivity, including overall chewing cycles used (p < 0.0001). More, specifically those in the high sensitivity group used more stochastic chewing movements, while those in the low sensitivity group were found to use crescent-shaped chewing cycles. It was also noted that in the high sensitivity group the jaw moved further distances (p < 0.0001) in all phases and moved at a higher velocity when opening (p < 0.0001) but not when closing, when compared to the low sensitivity group. These results help bolster evidence that mastication and oral sensitivity are related.",

There are 158 metabolites measured by NMR spectroscopy measured in the 31-year follow-up of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC66). These metabolites, as with many multivariate phenotypes produced by high-throughput biomarker technology, exhibit strong correlation structures. Existing approaches for combining such data with genetic variants for multivariate QTL analysis generally ignore phenotypic correlations or make restrictive assumptions about the associations between phenotypes and genetic loci.\n\nResultsWe present a computationally efficient Bayesian Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) model for high-dimensional data, with cell-sparse variable selection and sparse graphical structure for covariance selection. Cell-sparsity allows different phenotype responses to be associated with different genetic predictors and the graphical structure is used to represent the conditional dependencies between phenotype variables. To achieve feasible computation of the large model space, we exploit a factorisation of the covariance matrix. Applying the model to the NFBC66 data with 9,000 directly-genotyped Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, we are able to simultaneously estimate genotype-phenotype associations and the residual dependence structure amongst the metabolites at the same time.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe R package BayesSUR with full documentation is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesSUR/\n\nContactalex.lewin@lshtm.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Gene expression profiling is an effective way to provide insights into cell function. However, for heterogeneous tissues, bulk RNA-Seq can only provide the average gene expression profile for all cells from the tissue, making the interpretation of the sequencing result challenging. Single-cell RNA-seq, on the other hand, generates transcriptomic profiles of individual cell and cell types, making it a powerful method to decode the heterogeneity in complex tissues.\n\nThe retina is a heterogeneous tissue composed of multiple cell types with distinct functions. Here we report the first single-nuclei RNA-seq transcriptomic study on human neural retinal tissue to identify transcriptome profile for individual cell types. Six retina samples from three healthy donors were profiled and RNA-seq data with high quality was obtained for 4730 single nuclei. All seven major cell types were observed from the dataset and signature genes for each cell type were identified by differential gene express analysis. The gene expression of the macular and peripheral retina was compared at the cell type level, showing significant improvement from previous bulk RNA-seq studies. Furthermore, our dataset showed improved power in prioritizing genes associated with human retinal diseases compared to both mouse single-cell RNA-seq and human bulk RNA-seq results. In conclusion, we demonstrated that feasibility of obtaining single cell transcriptome from human frozen tissues to provide additional insights that is missed by either the human bulk RNA-seq or the animal models.",

    "abstract": "We develop a flexible and computationally efficient approach for analysing high throughput chemical genetic screens. In such screens, a library of genetic mutants is phenotyped in a large number of stresses. The goal is to detect interactions between genes and stresses. Typically, this is achieved by grouping the mutants and stresses into categories, and performing modified t-tests for each combination. This approach does not have a natural extension if mutants or stresses have quantitative or non-overlapping annotations (eg. if conditions have doses, or a mutant falls into more than one category simultaneously). We develop a matrix linear model framework that allows us to model relationships between mutants and conditions in a simple, yet flexible multivariate framework. It encodes both categorical and continuous relationships to enhance detection of associations. To handle large datasets, we develop a fast estimation approach that takes advantage of the structure of matrix linear models. We evaluate our methods performance in simulations and in an E. coli chemical genetic screen, comparing it with an existing univariate approach based on modified t-tests. We show that matrix linear models perform slightly better than the univariate approach when mutants and conditions are classified in non-overlapping categories, and substantially better when conditions can be ordered in dosage categories. Our approach is much faster computationally and is scalable to larger datasets. It is an attractive alternative to current methods, and provides a natural framework extensible to larger, and more complex chemical genetic screens. A Julia implementation of matrix linear models and the code used for the analysis in this paper can be found at https://bitbucket.org/jwliang/mlm_packages and https://bitbucket.org/jwliang/mlm_gs_supplement, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutations in the human survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN protein has a well-characterized role in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), core components of the spliceosome. SMN is part of an oligomeric complex with core binding partners, collectively called Gemins. Biochemical and cell biological studies demonstrate that certain Gemins are required for proper snRNP assembly and transport. However, the precise functions of most Gemins are unknown. To gain a deeper understanding of the SMN complex in the context of metazoan evolution, we investigated the composition of the SMN complex in Drosophila melanogaster. Using a stable transgenic line that exclusively expresses Flag-tagged SMN from its native promoter, we previously found that Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin5, and all nine classical Sm proteins, including Lsm10 and Lsm11, co-purify with SMN. Here, we show that CG2941 is also highly enriched in the pulldown. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation reveals that epitope-tagged CG2941 interacts with endogenous SMN in Schneider2 cells. Bioinformatic comparisons show that CG2941 shares sequence and structural similarity with metazoan Gemin4. Additional analysis shows that three other genes (CG14164, CG31950 and CG2371) are not orthologous to Gemins 6-7-8, respectively, as previously suggested. In D.melanogaster, CG2941 is located within an evolutionarily recent genomic triplication with two other nearly identical paralogous genes (CG32783 and CG32786). RNAi-mediated knockdown of CG2941 and its two close paralogs reveals that Gemin4 is essential for organismal viability.",

    "abstract": "Humans can vary considerably in their healthy immune phenotypes and in their immune responses to various stimuli. We have developed an interactive web-based tool, ImmuneRegulation, to enable discovery of human regulatory elements that drive some of the phenotypic differences observed in gene expression profiles. ImmuneRegulation currently provides the largest centrally integrated resource available in the literature on transcriptome regulation in whole blood and blood cell types, including genotype data from 23,040 individuals, with associated gene expression data from 30,562 experiments, that provide genetic variant-gene expression associations on [~]200 million eQTLs. In addition, it includes 14 million transcription factor (TF) binding region hits extracted from 1945 TF ChIP-seq peaks and the latest GWAS catalog of 67,230 published SNP-trait associations. Users can interactively explore ImmuneRegulation to visualize and discover associations between their gene(s) of interest and their regulators (genetic variants or transcription factors) across multiple cohorts and studies. These regulators can explain cohort or cell type dependent gene expression variations and may be critical in selecting the ideal cohorts or cell types for follow-up studies. Overall, ImmuneRegulation aims to contribute to our understanding of the effects of eQTLs and TFs on heterogeneous transcriptional responses reported in studies on the blood; in the development of molecular signatures of immune response; and facilitate their future application in patient management.

    "abstract": "The finite state projection (FSP) approach to solving the chemical master equation has enabled successful inference of discrete stochastic models to predict single-cell gene regulation dynamics. Unfortunately, the FSP approach is highly computationally intensive for all but the simplest models, an issue that is highly problematic when parameter inference and uncertainty quantification takes enormous numbers of parameter evaluations. To address this issue, we propose two new computational methods for the Bayesian inference of stochastic gene expression parameters given single-cell experiments. We formulate and verify an Adaptive Delayed Acceptance Metropolis-Hastings (ADAMH) algorithm to utilize with reduced Krylov-basis projections of the FSP. We then introduce an extension of the ADAMH into a Hybrid scheme that consists of an initial phase to construct a reduced model and a faster second phase to sample from the approximate posterior distribution determined by the constructed model. We test and compare both algorithms to an adaptive Metropolis algorithm with full FSP-based likelihood evaluations on three example models and simulated data to show that the new ADAMH variants achieve substantial speedup in comparison to the full FSP approach. By reducing the computational costs of parameter estimation, we expect the ADAMH approach to enable efficient data-driven estimation for more complex gene regulation models.",

    "abstract": "When learning about events through visual experience, one must not only identify which events are visually similar, but also retrieve those events' associates - which may be visually dissimilar - and recognize when different events have similar predictive relations. How are these demands balanced? To address this question, we taught participants the predictive structures among four events, which appeared in four different sequences, each cued by a distinct object. In each, one event ('cause') was predictably followed by another ('effect'). Sequences in the same relational category had similar predictive structure, while across categories, the effect and cause events were reversed. Using fMRI data, we measured associative coding, indicated by correlated responses between effect and cause events; perceptual coding, indicated by correlated responses to visually similar events; and relational category coding, indicated by correlated responses to objects in the same relational category. All three models characterized responses within right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), but in different ways: perceptual and associative coding diverged along the posterior to anterior axis, while relational categories emerged anteriorly in tandem with associative coding. Thus, along the posterior-anterior axis of MTG, the representation of the visual attributes of events is transformed to a representation of both specific and generalizable relational attributes.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity propagates across spatial scales in the mammalian cortex but technical challenges have generally precluded establishing conceptual links between the function of local circuits of neurons and brain-wide network dynamics. To solve this problem, we developed a method for simultaneous cellular-resolution two-photon calcium imaging of a local microcircuit and mesoscopic widefield calcium imaging of the entire cortical mantle in awake, behaving mice. Our method employs an orthogonal axis design whereby the mesoscopic objective is oriented downward directly above the brain and the two-photon objective is oriented horizontally, with imaging performed through a glass right angle microprism implanted in the skull. In support of this method, we introduce a suite of analysis tools for relating the activity of individual cells to distal cortical areas, as well as a viral method for robust and widespread gene delivery in the juvenile mouse brain. We use these methods to characterize the diversity of associations of individual, genetically-defined neurons with cortex-wide network motifs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease (PD), is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting both cognitive and motor functions. It is characterized by decreased brain dopamine (DA) and a selective and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), whereas dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) show reduced vulnerability. The majority of animal models of PD are genetic lesion or neurotoxin exposure models that lead to death of dopaminergic neurons. Here we use a DAT:TH KO mouse model that by inactivation of the tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons, causes selective depletion of striatal dopamine without affecting DA neuron survival. We analyzed transcriptome responses to decreased DA in both pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic brain regions of DAT:TH KO animals. We detected only few differentially expressed genes in the post-synaptic regions as a function of DA deficiency. This suggests that the broad striatal transcriptional changes in neurodegeneration-based PD models are not direct effects of DA depletion, but are rather a result of DA neuronal death. However, we find a number of dopaminergic genes differentially expressed in SNc, and to a lesser extent in VTA, as a function of DA deficiency, providing evidence for a DA-dependent feedback loop. Of particular interest, expression of Nr4a2, a crucial transcription factor maintaining DA neuron identity, is significantly decreased in SNc, but not VTA, of DAT:TH KO mice, implying a potential protective role for DA in the SNc.",
