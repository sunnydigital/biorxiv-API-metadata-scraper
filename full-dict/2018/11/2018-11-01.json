    "abstract": "Brassicales is a diverse angiosperm order with about 4,700 recognized species. Here, we assembled and described the complete plastid genomes from four species of Brassicales: Capparis urophylla F.Chun (Capparaceae), Carica papaya L. (Caricaceae), Cleome rutidosperma DC. (Cleomaceae), and Moringa oleifera Lam. (Moringaceae), including two plastid genomes newly assembled for two families (Capparaceae and Moringaceae). The four plastid genomes are 159,680 base pairs on average in length and encode 78 protein-coding genes. The genomes each contains a typical structure of a Large Single-Copy (LSC) region and a Small Single-Copy (SSC) region separated by two Inverted Repeat (IR) regions. We performed the maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis using three different data sets of 66 protein-coding genes (ntAll, ntNo3rd and AA). Our phylogenetic results from different dataset are congruent, and are consistent with previous phylogenetic studies of Brassiales.",

    "abstract": "Protein translocation is a fundamental process in biology. Major gaps in our understanding of this process arises due the poor sensitivity, low time-resolution and irreproducibility of translocation assays. To address this, we applied NanoLuc split-luciferase to produce a new strategy for measuring protein transport. The system reduces the timescale of data collection from days to minutes, and allows continuous acquisition with a time-resolution in the order of seconds - yielding kinetics parameters suitable for mechanistic elucidation and mathematical fitting. To demonstrate its versatility, we implemented and validated the assay in vitro and in vivo for the bacterial Sec system, and the mitochondrial protein import apparatus. Overall, this technology represents a major step forward, providing a powerful new tool for fundamental mechanistic enquiry of protein translocation and for inhibitor (drug) screening, with an intensity and rigour unattainable through classical methods.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important intercellular mediators regulating health and disease. Conventional EVs surface marker profiling, which was based on population measurements, masked the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the quantity and phenotypes of EVs secretion. Herein, by using spatially patterned antibodies barcode, we realized multiplexed profiling of single-cell EVs secretion from more than 1000 single cells simultaneously. Applying this platform to profile human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines led to deep understanding of previously undifferentiated single cell heterogeneity underlying EVs secretion. Notably, we observed the decrement of certain EV phenotypes (e.g. CD63+EVs) were associated with the invasive feature of both OSCC cell lines and primary OSCC cells. We also realized multiplexed detection of EVs secretion and cytokines secretion simultaneously from the same single cells to investigate multidimensional spectrum of intercellular communications, from which we resolved three functional subgroups with distinct secretion profiles by visualized clustering. In particular, we found EVs secretion and cytokines secretion were generally dominated by different cell subgroups. The technology introduced here enables comprehensive evaluation of EVs secretion heterogeneity at single cell level, which may become an indispensable tool to complement current single cell analysis and EV research.\\n\\nSignificanceExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell derived nano-sized particles medicating cell-cell communication and transferring biology information molecules like nucleic acids to regulate human health and disease. Conventional methods for EV surface markers profiling cant tell the differences in the quantity and phenotypes of EVs secretion between cells. To address this need, we developed a platform for profiling an array of surface markers on EVs from large numbers of single cells, enabling more comprehensive monitoring of cellular communications. Single cell EVs secretion assay led to previously unobserved cell heterogeneity underlying EVs secretion, which might open up new avenues for studying cell communication and cell microenvironment in both basic and clinical research.",

    "abstract": "Understanding human bone marrow (BM) pathophysiology in the context of myelotoxic stress induced by drugs, radiation, or genetic mutations is of critical importance in clinical medicine. However, study of these dynamic cellular responses is hampered by the inaccessibility of living BM in vivo. Here, we describe a vascularized human Bone Marrow-on-a-Chip (BM Chip) microfluidic culture device for modeling bone marrow function and disease states. The BM Chip is comprised of a fluidic channel filled with a fibrin gel in which patient-derived CD34+ cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) are co-cultured, which is separated by a porous membrane from a parallel fluidic channel lined by human vascular endothelium. When perfused with culture medium through the vascular channel, the BM Chip maintains human CD34+ cells and supports differentiation and maturation of multiple blood cell lineages over 1 month in culture. Moreover, it recapitulates human myeloerythroid injury responses to drugs and gamma radiation exposure, as well as key hematopoietic abnormalities found in patients with the genetic disorder, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS). These data establish the BM Chip as a new human in vitro model with broad potential utility for studies of BM dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "A subset of cancers rely on telomerase-independent mechanisms to maintain their chromosome ends. The predominant \\\"alternative lengthening of telomeres\\\" pathway appears dependent on homology-directed repair (HDR) to maintain telomeric DNA. However, the molecular changes needed for cells to productively engage in telomeric HDR are poorly understood. To gain new insights into this transition, we monitored the state of telomeres during serial culture of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) lacking the telomerase recruitment factor Ccq1. Rad52 is loaded onto critically short telomeres shortly after germination despite continued telomere erosion, suggesting that recruitment of recombination factors is not sufficient to maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase function. Instead, survivor formation coincides with the derepression of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). In this context, degradation of TERRA associated with the telomere in the form of R-loops drives a severe growth crisis, ultimately leading to a novel type of survivor with linear chromosomes and altered cytological telomere characteristics, including the loss of the shelterin component Rap1 (but not the TRF1/TRF2 orthologue, Taz1) from the telomere. We demonstrate that deletion of Rap1 is protective in this context, preventing the growth crisis that is otherwise triggered by degradation of telomeric R-loops in survivors with linear chromosomes. These findings suggest that up-regulation of telomere-engaged TERRA or altered recruitment of shelterin components can support telomerase-independent telomere maintenance.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePatients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy are often candidates for invasive surgical therapies. In these patients, it is necessary to accurately localize seizure-generators to ensure seizure freedom following intervention. While intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is the gold standard for mapping networks for surgery, this approach requires inducing and recording seizures, which may cause patient morbidity. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of mapping interictal (non-seizure) iEEG networks to identify targets for surgical treatment.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyze interictal iEEG recordings and neuroimaging from 27 focal epilepsy patients treated via surgical resection. We generate interictal functional networks by calculating pairwise correlation of iEEG signals across different frequency bands. We identify electrodes falling within surgically resected tissue (i.e. the resection zone), and compute node-level and edge-level synchrony in relation to the resection zone. We associate these metrics with post-surgical outcomes.\\n\\nResultsGreater overlap between resected electrodes and highly synchronous electrodes is associated with favorable post-surgical outcomes. Additionally, good outcome patients have significantly higher connectivity localized within the resection zone compared to those with poorer postoperative seizure control. This finding persists following normalization by a spatially-constrained null model.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study suggests that spatially-informed interictal network synchrony measures can distinguish between good and poor post-surgical outcomes. By capturing clinically relevant information during interictal periods, our method may ultimately reduce the need for prolonged invasive implants and provide insights into the pathophysiology of an epileptic brain. We discuss next steps for translating these findings into a prospectively useful clinical tool.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C (HIV-1C) has a natural deletion of a YPxL motif in its Gag-p6 late domain. This domain mediates the binding of Gag to host cell protein ALIX and subsequently facilitates viral budding. In a subset of HIV-1C infected individuals, the tetrapeptide insertion PYxE has been identified at the deleted YPxL motif site. Here, we report the consequences of PYxE insertion on the interaction with ALIX and the relevance regarding replication fitness and drug sensitivity. In our three HIV-1C cohorts, PYKE and PYQE were most prevalent among PYxE variants. Through in silico predictions and in vitro experiments, we showed that HIV-1C Gag has an increased binding to ALIX when PYxE motif is present. To go more into the clinical relevance of the PYxE insertion, we obtained patient-derived gag-pol sequences from HIV-1CPYxEi viruses and inserted them in a reference HIV-1. Viral growth was increased, and the sensitivity to protease inhibitor (PI) lopinavir (LPV) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) was decreased for some of the HIV-1C PYxE variants compared to wild-type variants. Our data suggest that PYxE insertion in Gag restores the ability of Gag to bind ALIX and correlates with enhanced viral fitness in the absence or presence of LPV and TAF. The high prevalence and increased replication fitness of the HIV-1C virus with PYxE insertion could indicate the clinical importance of these viral variants.\\n\\nImportanceGenomic differences within HIV-1 subtypes is associated with a varying degree of viral spread, disease progression, and clinical outcome. Viral budding is essential in the HIV-1 life cycle and mainly mediated through the interaction of Gag with host proteins. Two motifs within Gag-p6 mediate binding of host cell proteins and facilitate budding. HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) has a natural deletion of one of these two motifs resulting in an inability to bind to host cell protein ALIX. Previously, we have identified a tetrapeptide (PYxE) insertion at this deleted motif site in a subset of HIV-1C patients. Here, we report the incidence of PYxE insertions in three different HIV-1C cohorts, and the insertion restores the binding of Gag to ALIX. It also increases viral growth even in the presence of antiretroviral drugs lopinavir and tenofovir alafenamide. Hence, PYxE insertion in HIV-1C might be biologically relevant for viruses and clinically significant among patients.",

In many rod-shaped bacteria, the actin homolog MreB directs cell-wall insertion and maintains cell shape, but it remains unclear how structural changes to MreB affect its physiological function. To bridge this gap, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for Caulobacter crescentus MreB and then utilized a coarse-grained biophysical model to successfully predict MreB filament properties in vivo. We discovered that MreB double protofilaments exhibit left-handed twisting that is dependent on the bound nucleotide and membrane binding; the degree of twisting determines the limit length and orientation of MreB filaments in vivo. Membrane binding of MreB also induces a stable membrane curvature that is physiologically relevant. Together, our data empower the prediction of cytoskeletal filament size from molecular dynamics simulations, providing a paradigm for connecting protein filament structure and mechanics to cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "An aptamer reagent that can switch its binding affinity in a pH-responsive manner would be highly valuable for many biomedical applications including imaging and drug delivery. Unfortunately, the discovery of such aptamers is difficult and only a few have been reported to date. Here we report the first experimental strategy for generating pH-responsive aptamers through direct selection. As an exemplar, we report streptavidin-binding aptamers that retain nanomolar affinity at pH 7.4 but exhibit a ~100-fold decrease in affinity at pH 5.2. These aptamers were generated by incorporating a known streptavidin-binding DNA motif into an aptamer library and performing FACS-based screening at multiple pH conditions. Upon structural analysis, we found that one aptamers affinity-switching behavior is driven by a non-canonical G-A base-pair that controls its folding in a highly pH-dependent manner. We believe our strategy could be readily extended to other aptamer-target systems because it does not require a priori structural knowledge of the aptamer or the target.",

The efficacy of chromosome capture by the mitotic spindle can be influenced by how widely chromosomes are scattered in space. Here, we quantify chromosome-scattering volume (CSV) and find that it is reduced immediately after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) in human cells. The reduction of CSV occurs independently of microtubules and is therefore not an outcome of interactions between chromosomes and the spindle. We find that, prior to NEBD, an acto-myosin network is assembled in a LINC complex-dependent manner on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear envelope. This acto-myosin network remains around chromosomes soon after NEBD, and its myosin-II-mediated contraction reduces CSV and facilitates chromosome interaction with spindle microtubules.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of biomarkers for pre-kidney transplant immune risk stratification to avoid over- or under-immunosuppression, despite substantial advances in kidney transplant management. Since the circulating lipidome is integrally involved in various inflammatory process and pathophysiology of several immune response, we hypothesized that the lipidome may provide biomarkers that are helpful in the prediction of kidney rejection. Serial plasma samples collected over 1-year post-kidney transplant from a prospective, observational cohort of 45 adult Kidney Transplant [antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)=16; stable controls (SC) =29] patients, were assayed for 210 unique lipid metabolites by quantitative mass spectrometry. A stepwise regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) was used to generate models of predictors of rejection and multivariate statistics was used to identify metabolic group differences. The RLDA models include lipids as well as of calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) and presence of significant donor-specific antibody (DSA) at the time of transplant. Analysis of lipids on day of transplant (T1) samples revealed a 7-lipid classifier (lysophosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine species) which discriminated between AMR and SC with a misclassification rate of 8.9% [AUC = 0.95 (95% CI = 0.84-0.98), R2 = 0.63]. A clinical model using cPRA and DSA was inferior and produced a misclassification rate of 15.6% [AUC = 0.82 (95% CI = 0.69-0.93), R2 = 0.41]. A stepwise combined model using 4 lipid classifiers and DSA improved the AUC further to 0.98 (95% CI = 0.89-1.0, R2 = 0.83) with a misclassification of only 2.2%. Specific classes of lipids were lower in AMR compared with SC. Serial analysis of SC patients demonstrated metabolic changes between T1 and 6 months (T2) post-transplant, but not between 6 and 12 (T3) months post-transplant. There were no overtime changes in AMR patients. Analysis of SC T1 vs AMR T3 (that at time of AMR) showed sustained decreased levels of lipids in AMR at the time of rejection. These findings suggest that lack of anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated phospholipids differentiate SC from AMR pre-transplant and at the time of rejection, and a composite model using a 4-lipid classifier along with DSA could be used for prediction of antibody-mediated rejection before transplant.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDespite significant advancements in kidney transplant treatment and intensive clinical follow-up monitoring, all rejection events are unlikely to be recognized at the beginning. As a result, efforts have been made to identify new biomarkers for kidney rejection detection.\nC_LIO_LIWhile lipids are known to be potent mediators of inflammation, pro-resolving processes, and other cell signaling cascades, lipidomics can be applied to identify reliable biomarkers to monitor disease severity and may also allow prediction of kidney rejection.\nC_LIO_LIOur lipidomic study shows lipid profile changes between antibody-mediated rejection group and stable control group as a function of different time point, pre and post-kidney transplantation. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that combining lipid and clinical parameters allow prediction of rejection on the day of the transplant.\nC_LIO_LIThese findings have the potential to change the present paradigm of pre and post-transplant monitoring and management of these patients by implementing an evidence-based risk stratification technique, resulting in a substantial improvement in kidney transplant success.\nC_LI",

To address how gyrase copes with these topological challenges, we used high-speed single-molecule fluorescence imaging in live Escherichia coli cells.

Novel PPIs were predicted by applying the HiPPIP algorithm, which computes features of protein pairs such as cellular localization, molecular function, biological process membership, genomic location of the gene, gene expression in microarray experiments, protein domains and tissue membership, and classifies the pairwise features as interacting or non-interacting based on a random forest model. To our satisfaction, the interactome is significantly enriched with genes differentially expressed in MPM tumors compared with normal pleura, and with other thoracic tumors. The interactome is also significantly enriched with genes whose high expression has been correlated with unfavorable prognosis in lung cancer, and with genes differentially expressed on crocidolite exposure. 28 of the interactors of MPM proteins are targets of 147 FDA-approved drugs. By comparing differential expression profiles induced by drug to profiles induced by MPM, potentially repurposable drugs are identified from this drug list. Development of PPIs of disease-specific set of genes is a powerful approach with high translational impact - the interactome is a vehicle to piece together an integrated view on how genes associated with MPM through various high throughput studies are functionally linked, leading to clinically translatable results such as clinical trials with repurposed drugs. The PPIs are made available on a webserver, called Wiki-Pi MPM at http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/wiki-MPM with advanced search capabilities.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMesothelioma Interactome with 367 novel protein-protein interactions may shed light on the mechanisms of cancer genesis and progression",

    "abstract": "Medical uses of marijuana have been recently approved in many countries, and after a long ban on research, there is despicable scientific evidence regarding its action and side effects. We investigated the effect of inhalation of vaporized marijuana on cardiac function in Drosophila melanogaster, a suitable genetic model for assessing cardiovascular function. Chronic exposure of adult flies to vaporized marijuana reduces heart rate, increments contractility and prolongs relaxation. These changes are manifested in the cardiomyocytes with no effect in calcium handling, and in the absence of the canonical cannabinoids receptors identified in mammals. Our results are the first evidence of the in vivo impact of phytocannabinoids in D. melanogaster and open new paths for genetic screenings using vaporized compounds, providing a simple and affordable platform prior to mammalian models.",

    "abstract": "SummaryVarying pH of luminal fluid along the female reproductive tract is a physiological cue that modulates sperm motility. CatSper is a sperm-specific, pH-sensitive calcium channel essential for hyperactivated motility and male fertility. Multi-subunit CatSper channel complexes organize linear Ca2+ signaling nanodomains along the sperm tail. Here, we identify EF-hand calciumbinding domain-containing protein 9 (EFCAB9) as a dual function, cytoplasmic machine modulating the channel activity and the domain organization of CatSper. Knockout mice studies demonstrate that EFCAB9, in complex with the CatSper subunit, CAT SPER{zeta}, is essential for pH-dependent and Ca2+ sensitive activation of the CatSper channel. In the absence of EFCAB9, sperm motility and fertility is compromised and the linear arrangement of the Ca2+ signaling domains is disrupted. EFCAB9 interacts directly with CATSPER{zeta} in a Ca2+ dependent manner and dissociates at elevated pH.These observations suggest that EFCAB9 is a long-sought, intracellular, pH-dependent Ca2+ sensor that triggers changes in sperm motility.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIEfcab9 encodes an evolutionarily conserved, sperm-specific EF-hand domain protein\\nC_LIO_LIEfcab9-deficient mice have sperm motility defects and reduced male fertility\\nC_LIO_LIEFCAB9 is a pH-tuned Ca2+ sensor for flagellar CatSper Ca2+ channel\\nC_LIO_LIEFCAB9 is a dual function machine in gatekeeping and domain organization of CatSper\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Understanding how cell fate decisions are regulated is a central question in stem cell biology. Recent studies have demonstrated that intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics contribute to this process. Indeed, the pHi of cells within a tissue is not simply a consequence of chemical reactions in the cytoplasm and other cellular activity, but is actively maintained at a specific setpoint in each cell type. We found previously that the pHi of cells in the follicle stem cell (FSC) lineage in the Drosophila ovary increases progressively during differentiation from an average of 6.8 in the FSCs, to 7.0 in newly produced daughter cells, to 7.3 in more differentiated cells. Two major regulators of pHi in this lineage are Drosophila sodium-proton exchanger 2 (dNhe2) and a previously uncharacterized gene, CG8177, that is homologous to mammalian anion exchanger 2 (AE2). Based on this homology, we named the gene ae2. Here, we generated null alleles of ae2 and found that homozygous mutant flies are viable but have severe defects in ovary development and adult oogenesis. Specifically, we find that ae2 null flies have smaller ovaries, reduced fertility, and impaired follicle formation. In addition, we find that the follicle formation defect can be suppressed by a decrease in dNhe2 copy number and enhanced by the overexpression of dNhe2, suggesting that this phenotype is due to the dysregulation of pHi. These findings support the emerging idea that pHi dynamics regulate cell fate decisions and our studies provide new genetic tools to investigate the mechanisms by which this occurs.",

    "abstract": "Antigen-specific T cells can be orchestrated to kill cancer cells in immunotherapies but the utilities of the TCR information have not been fully explored. Here, we leveraged previous efforts on tumor TCR repertoire, and developed a novel algorithm to characterize antigen-specific TCR clusters. Joint analysis with gene expression revealed novel regulators for T cell activation. Investigation of single-cell sequencing data revealed a novel subset of tissue-resident memory T cell population with elevated metabolic status. Integrative analysis of TCR clusters with HLA alleles and cancer genomics data identified candidate antigens derived from missense mutations, frameshift indels, and tumor-associated gene overexpression. Predicted antigen HSFX1 was further validated using vaccinated humanized HLA-A*02:01 mice. Finally, high abundant cancer-associated TCRs were observed in the blood repertoire of early breast cancer patients, suggesting new avenues for noninvasive early detection. Thus, our analysis identified cancer-associated T cells with broad utilities in immune monitoring and cancer immunotherapies.",
