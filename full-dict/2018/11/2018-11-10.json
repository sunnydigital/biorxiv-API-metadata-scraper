    "abstract": "MotivationTo gain insights into complex biological processes, genome-scale data (e.g., RNA-Seq) are often overlaid on biochemical networks. However, many networks do not have a one-to-one relationship between genes and network edges, due to the existence of isozymes and protein complexes. Therefore, decisions must be made on how to overlay data onto networks. For example, for metabolic networks, these decisions include (1) how to integrate gene expression levels using gene-protein-reaction rules, (2) the approach used for selection of thresholds on expression data to consider the associated gene as \\\"active\\\", and (3) the order in which these steps are imposed. However, the influence of these decisions has not been systematically tested.\\n\\nResultsWe compared 20 decision combinations using a transcriptomic dataset across 32 tissues and showed that definition of which reaction may be considered as active is mainly influenced by thresholding approach used. To determine the most appropriate decisions, we evaluated how these decisions impact the acquisition of tissue-specific active reaction lists that recapitulate organ-system tissue groups. These results will provide guidelines to improve data analyses with biochemical networks and facilitate the construction of context-specific metabolic models.\\n\\nContactnlewisres@ucsd.edu",

    "abstract": "It is known that cortical networks operate on the edge of instability, in which oscillations can appear. However, the influence of this dynamic regime on performance in decision making, is not well understood. In this work, we propose a population model of decision making based on a winner-take-all mechanism. Using this model, we demonstrate that local slow inhibition within the competing neuronal populations can lead to Hopf bifurcation. At the edge of instability, the system exhibits ambiguity in the decision making, which can account for the perceptual switches observed in human experiments. We further validate this model with fMRI datasets from an experiment on semantic priming in perception of ambivalent (male versus female) faces. We demonstrate that the model can correctly predict the drop in the variance of the BOLD within the Superior Parietal Area and Inferior Parietal Area while watching ambiguous visual stimuli.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman cortex is a complex structure composed of thousands of tangled neural circuits. These circuits exhibit multiple modes of activity, depending on the local balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity. In particular, these circuits can exhibit oscillatory behavior, which is believed to be a manifestation of a so-called criticality: balancing on the edge between stable and unstable dynamics. Circuits in the cortex are responsible for higher cognitive functions such as, in example, perceptual decision making, i.e., evaluating properties of objects appearing in the visual field. However, it is not well known how aforementioned balancing on the edge of instability influences perceptual decision making.\\n\\nIn this work, we build a model to simulate dynamics of a very simple decision-making network consisting of two subpopulations. We then demonstrate that criticality in the network can account for ambiguity in decision making, and cause perceptual switches observed in human experiments. We further validate our model with datasets coming from a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment on semantic priming in perception of ambivalent (male versus female) faces. We demonstrate that the model can correctly predict the drop in the variance of the BOLD within the parietal areas of the cortex while watching ambiguous visual stimuli.",

    "abstract": "We applied simulation-based approaches to characterize how microbial community structure influences the amount of sequencing effort to reconstruct metagenomes that are assembled from short read sequences. An initial analysis evaluated the quantity, completion, and contamination of complete-metagenome-assembled genome (complete-MAG) equivalents, a bioinformatic-pipeline normalized metric for MAG quantity, as a function of sequencing effort, on four preexisting sequence read datasets taken from a maize soil, an estuarine sediment, the surface ocean, and the human gut. These datasets were subsampled to varying degrees of completeness in order to simulate the effect of sequencing effort on MAG retrieval. Modeling suggested that sequencing efforts beyond what is typical in published experiments (1 to 10 Gbp) would generate diminishing returns in terms of MAG binning. A second analysis explored the theoretical relationship between sequencing effort and the proportion of available metagenomic DNA sequenced during a sequencing experiment as a function of community richness, evenness, and genome size. Simulations from this analysis demonstrated that while community richness and evenness influenced the amount of sequencing required to sequence a community metagenome to exhaustion, the effort necessary to sequence an individual genome to a target fraction of exhaustion was only dependent on the relative abundance of the corresponding organism and its genome size. A software tool, GRASE, was created to assist investigators further explore this relationship. Re-evaluation of the relationship between sequencing effort and binning success in the context of the relative abundance of genomes, as opposed to base pairs, provides a framework to design sequencing experiments based on the relative abundance of microbes in an environment rather than arbitrary levels of sequencing effort.",

    "abstract": "Asexual reproduction has evolved repeatedly from sexual ancestors across a wide range of taxa. While the costs and benefits associated with asexuality have received considerable attention, the molecular changes underpinning the evolution of asexual reproduction remain relatively unexplored. In particular, it is completely unknown whether the repeated evolution of asexual phenotypes involves similar molecular changes, as previous studies have focused on changes occurring in single lineages. Here we investigate the extent of convergent gene expression changes across five independent transitions to asexuality in stick insects. We compared gene expression of asexual females to females of close sexual relatives in whole-bodies, reproductive tracts, and legs. We identified a striking amount of convergent gene expression change (up to 8% of genes), greatly exceeding that expected by chance. Convergent changes were also tissue-specific, and most likely driven by selection for functional changes. Genes showing convergent changes in the reproductive tract were associated with meiotic spindle formation and centrosome organization. These genes are particularly interesting as they can influence the production of unreduced eggs, a key barrier to asexual reproduction. Changes in legs and whole-bodies were likely involved in female sexual trait decay, with enrichment in terms such as sperm-storage and pigmentation. By identifying changes occurring across multiple independent transitions to asexuality, our results provide a rare insight into the molecular basis of asexual phenotypes and suggest that the evolutionary path to asexuality is highly constrained, requiring repeated changes to the same key genes.",

As the number of available genomes continues to increase, a new problem is facing researchers. Once more species become available, they have to repeat the whole process from the beginning because updating species trees is currently not possible. However, the de novo inference can be prohibitively costly in human effort or machine time. In this paper, we introduce INSTRAL, a method that extends ASTRAL to enable phylogenetic placement. INSTRAL is designed to place a new species on an existing species tree after sequences from the new species have already been added to gene trees; thus, INSTRAL is complementary to existing placement methods that update gene trees.",

In Xenopus, depletion of Ccdc11 causes defects in LR patterning, recapitulating the patient phenotype. Upon Ccdc11 depletion, normally monociliated cells of the Left-Right Organizer (LRO) exhibit multiple cilia per cell. Unexpectedly, we found that Ccdc11 is necessary for successful cytokinesis, and the multiciliation observed in Ccdc11-depleted cells was due to failed cytokinesis. Furthermore, CCDC11 depletion alters cell-cell adhesion with reduction in junctional localization of adhesion molecules. The small GTPase RhoA is critical for cytokinesis and cell-cell adhesion. Because the CCDC11 depletion phenotypes are reminiscent of RhoA loss of function, we investigated a possible connection to regulation of RhoA signaling. We demonstrate that CCDC11 is localized to the cytokinetic contractile ring overlapping with RhoA during cytokinesis and regulates total RhoA protein levels. Our results suggest that CCDC11 connects cytokinesis and LR patterning via RhoA regulation, providing a potential mechanism for heterotaxy disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Optimism regarding potential epidemiological and conservation applications of modern gene drives is tempered by concern about the potential unintended spread of engineered organisms beyond the target population. In response, several novel gene drive approaches have been proposed that can, under certain conditions, locally alter characteristics of a population. One challenge for these gene drives is the difficulty of achieving high levels of localized population suppression without very large releases in face of gene flow. We present a new gene drive system, Tethered Homing (TH), with improved capacity for localized population alteration, especially for population suppression. The TH drive is based on driving a payload gene using a homing construct that is anchored to a spatially restricted gene drive. We use a proof of principle mathematical model to show the dynamics of a TH drive that uses engineered underdominance as an anchor. This system is composed of a split homing drive and a two-locus engineered underdominance drive linked to one part of the split drive (the Cas endonuclease). In addition to improved localization, the TH system offers the ability to gradually adjust the genetic load in a population after the initial alteration, with minimal additional release effort.",

I argue that the biggest deficiency of bar plots (and other mean-and-error plots) is that they fail to directly communicate modeled effects and uncertainty, and dot and box plots do not address this deficiency. A Harrell plot combines a forest plot of modeled treatment effects and uncertainty, a dot plot of raw data, and a box plot of the distribution of the raw data into a single, two-part graph. A Harrell plot encourages best practices such as communication of the distribution of the data and a focus on effect size and uncertainty, while discouraging poor practices such as hiding distributions and focusing on p-values.",

    "abstract": "Humans have long wondered about the function of mental imagery and its relationship to vision. Although visual representations are utilized during imagery, the computations they subserve are unclear. Building on a theory that treats vision as inference about the causes of sensory stimulation in an internal generative model, we propose that mental imagery is inference about the sensory consequences of predicted or remembered causes. The relation between these complementary inferences yields a relation between the brain activity patterns associated with imagery and vision. We show that this relation has the formal structure of an echo that makes encoding of imagined stimuli in low-level visual areas resemble the encoding of seen stimuli in higher areas. To test for evidence of this echo effect we developed imagery encoding models--a new tool for revealing how imagined stimuli are encoded in brain activity. We estimated imagery encoding models from brain activity measured with fMRI while human subjects imagined complex visual stimuli, and then compared these to visual encoding models estimated from a matched viewing experiment. Consistent with an echo effect, imagery encoding models in low-level visual areas exhibited decreased spatial frequency preference and larger, more foveal receptive fields, thus resembling visual encoding models in high-level visual areas where imagery and vision appeared to be almost interchangeable. Our findings support an interpretation of mental imagery as a predictive inference that is conditioned on activity in high-level visual cortex, and is related to vision through shared dependence on an internal model of the visual world.",

We find that most loci with non-canonical histories arose through introgression, and are strongly underrepresented in regions of low recombination and high gene density. This is expected if introgressed alleles are more likely to be purged in such regions due to tighter linkage with incompatibility loci. Finally, we identify a hitherto unrecognized inversion, and show it is a convergent structural rearrangement that captures a known color pattern switch locus within the genus.

There are some common treatments for this pain such as medicine, microvascular decompression or radio frequency. In this regard, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another therapeutic method to reduce the pain, which has been recently attracting the therapists attention. The positive effect of tDCS on TN was shown in many previous studies. However, the mechanism of tDCS effect has remained unclear\\n\\nObjectiveThis study aims to model the neuronal behavior of the main known regions of the brain participating in TN pathways to study the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation\\n\\nMethodThe proposed model consists of several blocks (block diagram): 1) trigeminal nerve, 2) trigeminal ganglion, 3) PAG (Periaqueductal gray in the brainstem), 4) thalamus, 5) motor cortex (M1) and 6) somatosensory cortex (S1). Each of these components represented by a modified Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model (a mathematical model). The modification of the HH model was done based on some neurological facts of pain sodium channels. The input of the model is any stimuli to  trigeminal nerve, which cause the pain, and the output is the activity of the somatosensory cortex. An external current, which is considered as electrical current, was applied to the motor cortex block of the model\\n\\nResultThe results showed that by decreasing the conductivity of the slow sodium channels (pain channels) and applying tDCS over the M1, the activity of the somatosensory cortex would be reduced. This reduction can cause pain relief\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed model provided some possible suggestions about the relationship between the effects of tDCS and associated components in TN, and also the relationship between the pain measurement index, somatosensory cortex activity, and the strength of tDCS.",

    "abstract": "Crossover formation as a result of meiotic recombination is vital for proper segregation of homologous chromosomes at the end of meiosis I. In many organisms, crossovers are generated through two crossover pathways: Class I and Class II. To ensure accurate crossover formation, meiosis-specific protein complexes regulate the degree in which each pathway is used. One such complex is the mei-MCM complex, which contains MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) and MCM-like proteins REC (ortholog of Mcm8), MEI-217, and MEI-218, collectively called the mei-MCM complex. The mei-MCM complex genetically promotes Class I crossovers and inhibits Class II crossovers in Drosophila, but it is unclear how individual mei-MCM proteins contribute to crossover regulation. In this study, we perform genetic analyses to understand how specific regions and motifs of mei-MCM proteins contribute to Class I and II crossover formation and distribution. Our analyses show that the long, disordered N-terminus of MEI-218 is dispensable for crossover formation, and that mutations that disrupt RECs Walker A and B motifs differentially affect Class I and Class II crossover formation. In Rec Walker A mutants, Class I crossovers exhibit no change, but Class II crossovers are increased. However, in rec Walker B mutants, Class I crossovers are severely impaired, and Class II crossovers are increased. These results suggest that REC may form multiple complexes that exhibit differential REC-dependent ATP binding and hydrolyzing requirements. These results provide genetic insight into the mechanisms through which mei-MCM proteins promote Class I crossovers and inhibit Class II crossovers.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omic techniques can offer a comprehensive overview of microbial communities at the gene, transcript and protein levels. However, to what extent these levels reflect in situ process rates is less clear, especially in highly complex habitats such as soils. Here we performed microcosm incubations using soil from a site with a history of agricultural management. Microcosms, amended with isotopically labelled ammonium and urea to simulate a fertilization event, showed nitrification (up to 4.1 {+/-} 0.87 {micro}g N-NO3- g-1 dry soil d-1) and accumulation of N2O after 192 hours of incubation. Nitrification activity (NH4+[-&gt;]NH2OH[-&gt;]NO2-[-&gt;]NO3-) was accompanied by a 6-fold increase in relative expression of the 16S rRNA gene (RNA/DNA) between 10 and 192 hours of incubation for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira. In contrast, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) nitrifiers showed stable gene expression during incubations but were generally more abundant (DNA level) than their Betaproteobacteria AOB counterparts. A strong relationship between nitrification activity and (mostly) betaproteobacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA; NH4+[-&gt;]NH2OH) and nitrite oxidoreductase (nxrA; NO2-[-&gt;]NO3-) transcript abundances revealed that mRNA levels quantitatively reflected measured activity and were generally more sensitive than the DNA level in the microcosm incubations. Although peptides related to housekeeping proteins from nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms were detected, their abundance was not significantly correlated with activity, revealing that meta-proteomics provided only a qualitative assessment of activity. Altogether, these findings underscore the strengths and limitations of multi-omic approaches for assessing complex microbial communities and provide the molecular means to assess nitrification processes in soils.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEven though the use of omic approaches has expanded our knowledge of the diversity of microbial communities in natural and engineered systems, it is less clear how well the use of whole community DNA-, RNA- or protein-based approaches reflect microbial activities. To this end, we directly compared the different levels of molecular information (i.e., DNA, RNA or proteins) in order to assess which level best correlated with isotope-based measurements of nitrification activity in agricultural soils after fertilization. This work reveals the strengths as well as the associated limitations of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic approaches in serving as reliable proxies for examining microbial activities in highly diverse environments like soils.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptation prevents local extinction in deteriorating environments. Laboratory experiments with microorganisms have shown that the likelihood of evolutionary rescue is greatest in large populations that have previously experienced sublethal doses of stress. To assess this result in natural communities, we conducted a mesocosm experiment with semi-natural phytoplankton communities exposed to glyphosate, a widely used herbicide. We tested whether community biomass and pre-exposure to sublethal stress would facilitate community rescue after severe contamination. Exposure to sublethal stress, but not community biomass, facilitated rescue significantly-even though it led to biodiversity loss. Furthermore, glyphosate had modest effects on community composition, suggesting that community resistance to glyphosate was primarily driven by changes in resistance within taxa, not by community turnover. Our results expand the scope of community evolutionary rescue theory to complex ecosystems and confirm that prior stress exposure is a key predictor of rescue.",

    "abstract": "Tumor stem cells and malignant multicellular networks have been separately implicated in the therapeutic resistance of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive type of brain cancer in adults. We show that small molecule inhibition of RHO-associated serine/threonine kinase (ROCKi) significantly promoted the outgrowth of neurite-like cell projections in cultures of heterogeneous patient-derived GBM stem-like cells. These projections formed de novo-induced cellular network (iNet)  webs, which regressed after withdrawal of ROCKi. Connected cells within the iNet web exhibited long range calcium signal transmission, and significant lysosomal and mitochondrial trafficking. In contrast to their less-connected vehicle control counterparts, iNet cells remained viable and proliferative after high-dose radiation. These findings demonstrate a link between ROCKi-regulated cell projection dynamics and the formation of radiation-resistant multicellular networks. Our study identifies means to reversibly induce iNet webs ex vivo, and may thereby accelerate future studies into the biology of GBM cellular networks.",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding ribosomal proteins are expressed at rate limiting levels, rendering their biological function highly sensitive to the copy-number variation that results from genomic instability. Cells with a reduced number of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) are eliminated, when intermingled with wild type cells, via a process known as cell competition. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we report the function of a CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein (C/EBP), Xrp1, that is critically required for the elimination of cells with a hemizygous RPG genotype. In such cells, Xrp1 is transcriptionally upregulated by an autoregulatory loop and is able to trigger cell elimination. Since genomic instability is likely to cause the loss of a haploinsufficient RPG, we propose a molecular model of how RPGs, together with a C/EBP-dependent transcriptional program, could preserve the genomic integrity of tissues.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmunity to membrane proteins in the central nervous system has been increasingly recognized as a cause of neuropsychiatric disease. A key recent development was the discovery of antibodies to NMDA receptors in limbic encephalitis, characterized by cognitive changes, memory loss, seizures and sometimes long-term morbidity or mortality. Treatment approaches and experimental studies have largely focused on the pathogenic role of these autoantibodies. Passive antibody transfer to mice has provided useful insights, but does not produce the full spectrum of the human disease. Here we describe a de novo autoimmune mouse model of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Active immunization of immune competent mice with conformationally-stabilized, native-like NMDA receptors induced a fulminant encephalitis that was strikingly similar to the behavioral and pathologic characteristics of human cases. Our results provide evidence of neuroinflammation and immune cell infiltration as early and robust features of the autoimmune response. Use of transgenic mice indicated that mature T cells as well as antibody-producing cells were required for disease induction. Our results provide new insights into disease pathogenesis as well as a platform for testing mechanisms of disease initiation and therapeutic approaches.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe report an active immunization model of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in mice that recapitulates the features of the clinical disease, provides new insights into the pathophysiology, and offers a platform for investigation of new therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "MAPK6/ERK3 is an atypical member of the MAPKs. An essential role has been suggested by the perinatal lethal phenotype of ERK3 knockout mice carrying a lacZ insertion in exon 2 due to pulmonary disfunction and by defects in function, activation and positive selection of T cells. To study the role of ERK3 in vivo, we generated mice carrying a conditional Erk3 allele with exon3 flanked by LoxP sites. Loss of ERK3 protein was validated after deletion of Erk3 in the female germ line using zona pellucida 3 (Zp3)-cre and a clear reduction of the protein kinase MK5 is detected, providing first evidence for the existence of the ERK3/MK5 signaling complex in vivo. In contrast to the previously reported Erk3 knockout phenotype, these mice are viable and fertile, do not display pulmonary hypoplasia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal T cell development, reduction of thymocyte numbers or altered T cells selection. Hence, ERK3 is dispensable for pulmonary and T-cell functions. The perinatal lethality, lung and T-cell defects of the previous ERK3 knockout mice are likely due to ERK3-unrelated effects of the inserted lacZ-neomycin-resistance-cassette. The knockout mouse of the closely related atypical MAPK ERK4/MAPK4 is also normal suggesting redundant functions of both protein kinases.",
