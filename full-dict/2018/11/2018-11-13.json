    "abstract": "Little is known about the life histories, population connectivity, or dispersal mechanisms of shallow groundwater organisms. Here we used RAD-seq to analyze population structure in two aquifer species: Paraperla frontalis, a stonefly with groundwater larvae and aerial adults, and Stygobromus sp., a groundwater-obligate amphipod. We found similar levels of connectivity in each species between floodplains separated by ~70 river km in the Flathead River basin of NW Montana, USA. Given that Stygobromous lacks the aboveground life stage of P. frontalis, our findings suggest that aquifer-obligate species might have previously unrecognized dispersal capacity.",

    "abstract": "Fractal analysis represents a promising new approach to structural neuroimaging data, yet systematic evaluation of the fractal dimension (FD) as a marker of structural brain complexity is scarce. Here we present in-depth methodological assessment of FD estimation in structural brain MRI. On the computational side, we show that spatial scale optimization can significantly improve FD estimation accuracy, as suggested by simulation studies with known FD values. For empirical evaluation, we analyzed two recent open-access neuroimaging data sets (MASSIVE and Midnight Scan Club), stratified by fundamental image characteristics including registration, sequence weighting, spatial resolution, segmentation procedures, tissue type, and image complexity. Deviation analyses showed high repeated-acquisition stability of the FD estimates across both data sets, with differential deviation susceptibility according to image characteristics. While less frequently studied in the literature, FD estimation in T2-weighted images yielded robust outcomes. Importantly, we observed a significant impact of image registration on absolute FD estimates. Applying different registration schemes, we found that unbalanced registration induced i) repeated-measurement deviation clusters around the registration target, ii) strong bidirectional correlations among image analysis groups, and iii) spurious associations between the FD and an index of structural similarity, and these effects were strongly attenuated by reregistration in both data sets. Indeed, differences in FD between scans did not simply track differences in structure per se, suggesting that structural complexity and structural similarity represent distinct aspects of structural brain MRI. In conclusion, scale optimization can improve FD estimation accuracy, and empirical FD estimates are reliable yet sensitive to image characteristics.",

    "abstract": "During real-life situations, multiple factors interact dynamically to determine threat level. In the current functional MRI study involving healthy adult human volunteers, we investigated interactions between proximity, direction (approach vs. retreat), and speed during a dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm. As a measure of threat-evoked physiological arousal, skin conductance responses were recorded during fMRI scanning. Whereas some brain regions tracked individual threat-related factors, others were also sensitive to combinations of these variables. In particular, signals in the anterior insula tracked the interaction between proximity and direction where approach vs. retreat responses were stronger when threat was closer compared to farther. A parallel proximity-by-direction interaction was also observed in physiological skin conductance responses. In the right amygdala, we observed a proximity by direction interaction, but intriguingly in the opposite direction as the anterior insula; retreat vs. approach responses were stronger when threat was closer compared to farther. In the right bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, we observed an effect of threat proximity, whereas in the right periaqueductal gray/midbrain we observed an effect of threat direction and a proximity by direction by speed interaction (the latter was detected in exploratory analyses but not in a voxelwise fashion). Together, our study refines our understanding of the brain mechanisms involved during aversive anticipation in the human brain. Importantly, it emphasizes that threat processing should be understood in a manner that is both context sensitive and dynamic.",

    "abstract": "FDA approval of multiple drugs differing in chemical structures but targeting the same protein raises the question whether such drugs have sufficiently similar mechanisms of action to be considered functionally equivalent. In this paper we compare three recently approved inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4/6 - palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib - that are becoming important therapies for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast and potentially other cancers. We find that transcriptional and proteomic changes induced by the three drugs differ significantly and that abemaciclib has unique cellular activities including induction of cell death (even in pRb-deficient cells), arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and reduced drug adaptation. These activities appear to arise from inhibition of kinases other than CDK4/6 including CDK2/Cyclin A/E and CDK1/Cyclin B.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe target profiles of most drugs are established relatively early in their development and are not systematically revisited at the time of approval. Scattered reports suggest that palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib differ in pharmacokinetics, dosing, and adverse effects but the three drugs are generally regarded as similar. Our finding that the drugs differ substantially in mechanism of action - abemaciclib retains activities of the earlier-generation drug alvocidib - suggests the potential for different uses in the clinic: in particular, abemaciclib may show activity in patients progressing on palbociclib or ribociclib. More generally, our approach relying on data from five distinct phenotypic and biochemical assays strongly suggests that a multi-faceted approach is necessary to get a reliable picture the target spectrum of kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "We present a technique applicable in any dynamical framework to identify control-robust subsets of an interacting system. These robust subsystems, which we call stable modules, are characterized by constraints on the variables that make up the subsystem. They are robust in the sense that if the defining constraints are satisfied at a given time, they remain satisfied for all later times, regardless of what happens in the rest of the system, and can only be broken if the constrained variables are externally manipulated. We identify stable modules as graph structures in an expanded network, which represents causal links between variable constraints. A stable module represents a system \\\"decision point\\\", or trap subspace. Using the expanded network, small stable modules can be composed sequentially to form larger stable modules that describe dynamics on the system level. Collections of large, mutually exclusive stable modules describe the systems repertoire of long-term behaviors. We implement this technique in a broad class of dynamical systems and illustrate its practical utility via examples and algorithmic analysis of two published biological network models. In the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster, we obtain a state-space visualization that reproduces by novel means the four possible cell fates and predicts the outcome of cell transplant experiments. In the T-cell signaling network, we identify six signaling elements that determine the high-signal response and show that control of an element connected to them cannot disrupt this response.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe show how to uncover the causal relationships between qualitative statements about the values of variables in ODE systems. We then show how these relationships can be used to identify subsystem behaviors that are robust to outside interventions. This informs potential system control strategies (e.g., in identifying drug targets). Typical analytical properties of biomolecular systems render them particularly amenable to our techniques. Furthermore, due to their often high dimension and large uncertainties, our results are particularly useful in biomolecular systems. We apply our methods to two quantitative biological models: the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and the T-cell signal transduction network.",

    "abstract": "Culture-based methods to measure Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers. Since results take up to 12 hours, statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results; however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests return results within 3 hours but are 2 to 5 times more expensive than culture-based methods. This paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qPCR tested sites with inter-beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds. The model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria. Using data from Chicago collected between 2006 and 2016, the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3.4 percent to 11.2 percent-a 230 percent increase. We find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models. Thus, limited deployments of qPCR testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity.",

In a genomic screen of 331 unrelated Japanese patients, we identify a disruptive Alu insertion and a nonsense variant (p.Arg1933*) in the ciliary gene RP1, neither of which are rare alleles in Japan. p.Arg1933* is almost polymorphic (frequency = 0.6%, amongst 12,000 individuals), does not cause disease in homozygosis or heterozygosis, and yet is significantly enriched in HRD patients (frequency = 2.1%, i.e. a 3.5-fold enrichment; p-value = 9.2x10-5). Familial co-segregation and association analyses show that p.Arg1933* can act as a Mendelian mutation, in trans with the Alu insertion, but might also cause disease in association with two alleles in the EYS gene in a non-Mendelian pattern of heredity. Our results suggest that rare conditions such as HRDs can be paradoxically determined by relatively common variants, following a quasi-Mendelian model linking monogenic and complex inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Animals have access to many alternative information sources when making decisions, such as private information (e.g. memory) and social information. Social insects make extensive use of social information. However, when intentional social information (e.g. pheromone trails in ants) conflicts with private information (e.g. route memories), insects often follow their private information. Why is this? We propose that an asymmetry in the type of information provided by these two information sources drives the neglect of social information: In ants, workers with certain information about the quality of a food source (memory) ignore valuable social information (pheromone trails) because the pheromone trails encode only a very ambiguous measure of food quality. This leads to a testable hypothesis: the addition of unambiguous quality information should rescue social information following. To test this, we trained ants to a poor quality (0.25M sucrose) food source, and then provided an alternative path along with either 1) no information, 2) a pheromone trail, 3) a 0.2l 1.5M sucrose droplet, providing unambiguous quality information, or 4) both a trail and a droplet. When either no or only one information source was provided (1-3), most ants (60-75%) continued following their own memory. However, the addition of unambiguous quality information (4) rescued trail following: when both a trail and a droplet were provided, 75% of ants followed the trail. In further experiments, we show that quality information gleaned from direct contact with fed nestmates produced similar effects. Using florescence microscopy, we demonstrate that food (and information) flows from fed workers to outgoing foragers, explaining the frequent contacts on trails. We propose that the type of information an information source can convey, and its ambiguity, is a strong driver of which source of information is attended to.",

Their potential applications in cryo-preservation, biomedicine, food industry and in the modulation of climate are widespread. Nevertheless, over several decades, cell-based recombinant methods have experienced multiple difficulties expressing these large proteins in full-length and in necessary yields while retaining functionality. As a result, our understanding of the structure and ice nucleation mechanism for this class of proteins is incomplete, and, most importantly, the full extent of possible applications unrealized. Using a wheat-germ cell-free expression pipeline, we successfully expressed and purified full-length ice nucleating protein InaZ from Pseudomonas syringae, known as a model INP. High protein yield and solubility has been achieved using this system. Ice nucleation experiments inside a dynamic environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) confirmed that the produced InaZ products remain functional. Preliminary structural assessments of these proteins using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed experimental evidence for their structural organization as fibrils. We believe that the current platform will be suitable for expressing other INPs of interest and can be further employed as new engineering system either for industrial or scientific needs.",

In this light, we propose a view of the adaptive immune system as a dynamic Bayesian machinery that updates its memory repertoire by balancing evidence from new pathogen encounters against past experience of infection to predict and prepare for future threats. This framework links the observed initial rapid increase of the memory pool early in life followed by a mid-life plateau to the ease of learning salient features of sparse environments. We also derive a modulated memory pool update rule in agreement with current vaccine response experiments. Our results suggest that pathogenic environments are sparse and that memory repertoires significantly decrease infection costs even with moderate sampling.

    "abstract": "Heterosis (hybrid vigor) and inbreeding depression, commonly considered as corollary phenomena, could nevertheless be decoupled under certain assumptions according to theoretical population genetics works. In order to explore this issue on real data, we analyzed the components of genetic variation in a population derived from a half-diallel cross between strains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. uvarum, two related yeast species involved in alcoholic fermentation. A large number of phenotypic traits, either molecular (coming from quantitative proteomics) or related to fermentation and life-history, were measured during alcoholic fermentation. Because the parental strains were included in the design, we were able to distinguish between inbreeding effects, which measures phenotypic differences between inbred and hybrids, and heterosis, which measures phenotypic differences between a specific hybrid and the other hybrids sharing a common parent. The sources of phenotypic variation differed depending on the temperature, indicating the predominance of genotype by environment interactions. Decomposing the total genetic variance into variances of additive (intra- and inter-specific) effects, of inbreeding effects and of heterosis (intra- and inter-specific) effects, we showed that the distribution of variance components defined clear-cut groups of proteins and traits. Moreover, it was possible to cluster fermentation and life-history traits into most proteomic groups. Within groups, we observed positive, negative or null correlations between the variances of heterosis and inbreeding effects. To our knowledge, such a decoupling had never been experimentally demonstrated. This result suggests that, despite a common evolutionary history of individuals within a species, the different types of traits have been subject to different selective pressures.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHigh-throughput sequencing of large immune repertoires has enabled the development of methods to predict the probability of generation by V(D)J recombination of T- and B-cell receptors of any specific nucleotide sequence. These generation probabilities are very non-homogeneous, ranging over 20 orders of magnitude in real repertoires. Since the function of a receptor really depends on its protein sequence, it is important to be able to predict this probability of generation at the amino acid level. However, brute-force summation over all the nucleotide sequences with the correct amino acid translation is computationally intractable. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution to this problem.\\n\\nResultsWe use dynamic programming to construct an efficient and flexible algorithm, called OLGA (Optimized Likelihood estimate of immunoGlobulin Amino-acid sequences), for calculating the probability of generating a given CDR3 amino acid sequence or motif, with or without V/J restriction, as a result of V(D)J recombination in B or T cells. We apply it to databases of epitope-specific T-cell receptors to evaluate the probability that a typical human subject will possess T cells responsive to specific disease-associated epitopes. The model prediction shows an excellent agreement with published data. We suggest that OLGA may be a useful tool to guide vaccine design.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code is available at https://github.com/zsethna/OLGA",

    "abstract": "Temperate phages constitute a potentially beneficial genetic reservoir for bacterial innovation despite being selfish entities encoding an infection cycle inherently at odds with bacterial fitness. These phages integrate their genomes into the bacterial host during infection, donating new, but deleterious, genetic material: the phage genome encodes toxic genes, such as lysins, that kill the bacterium during the phage infection cycle. Remarkably, some bacteria have exploited the destructive properties of phage genes for their own benefit by co-opting them as toxins for functions related to bacterial warfare, virulence, and secretion. However, do toxic phage genes ever become raw material for functional innovation? Here we report on a toxic phage gene whose product has lost its toxicity and has become a domain of a core cellular factor, SpmX, throughout the bacterial order Caulobacterales. Using a combination of phylogenetics, bioinformatics, structural biology, cell biology, and biochemistry, we have investigated the origin and function of SpmX and determined that its occurrence is the result of the detoxification of a phage peptidoglycan hydrolase gene. We show that the retained, attenuated activity of the phage-derived domain plays an important role in proper cell morphology and developmental regulation in representatives of this large bacterial clade. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of phage gene domestication in which a toxic phage gene has been co-opted for a housekeeping function.",

    "abstract": "Reporting of the actual data in graphs and plots increases transparency and enables independent evaluation. On the other hand, data summaries are often used in graphs since they aid interpretation. State-of-the art data visualizations can be made with the ggplot2 package, which uses the ideas of a  grammar of graphics to generate a graphic from multiple layers of data. However, ggplot2 requires coding skills and an understanding of the tidy data structure. To democratize state-of-the-art data visualization of raw data with a selection of statistical summaries, a web app was written using R/shiny that uses the ggplot2 package for generating plots. A multilayered approach together with adjustable transparency offers a unique flexibility, enabling users can to choose how to display the data and which of the data summaries to add. Four data summaries are provided, mean, median, boxplot, violinplot, to accommodate several types of data distributions. In addition, 95% confidence intervals can be added for visual inferences. By adjusting the transparency of the layers, the visualization of the raw data together with the summary can be tuned for optimal presentation and interpretation.

We aimed to investigate the clinical association between the IL6R-Asp358Ala variant and AAA growth, and to assess the effect of blocking the IL-6 signalling pathway in mouse models of aneurysm rupture.\\n\\nMethodUsing data from 2,863 participants with AAA from nine prospective cohorts, age- and sex-adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate the association between the IL6R-Asp358Ala variant and annual change in AAA diameter (mm/year). In a series of complementary randomised trials in mice, the effect of blocking the IL-6 signalling pathways was assessed on plasma biomarkers, systolic blood pressure, aneurysm diameter and time to aortic rupture and death.\\n\\nResultsAfter adjusting for age and sex, baseline aneurysm size was 0.55mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13, 0.98mm) smaller per copy of the minor allele [C] of the Asp358Ala variant. There was no evidence of a reduction in AAA growth rate (change in growth=-0.06mm per year [-0.18, 0.06] per copy of the minor allele). In two mouse models of AAA, selective blockage of the IL-6 trans-signalling pathway, but not combined blockage of both, the classical and trans-signalling pathways, was associated with improved survival (p<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsOur proof-of-principle data are compatible with the concept that IL-6 trans-signalling is relevant to AAA growth, encouraging larger-scale evaluation of this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) enables discovery of nearly all genetic variants present in a genome. A subset of these variants, however, may have poor sequencing quality due to limitations in sequencing technology or in variant calling algorithms. In genetic studies that analyze a large number of sequenced individuals, it is critical to detect and remove those variants with poor quality as they may cause spurious findings. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for performing quality control on variants identified from NGS data by combining a traditional filtering approach and a machine learning approach. Our method uses information on sequencing quality such as sequencing depth, genotyping quality, and GC contents to predict whether a certain variant is likely to contain errors. To evaluate our method, we applied it to two whole-genome sequencing datasets where one dataset consists of related individuals from families while the other consists of unrelated individuals. Results indicate that our method outperforms widely used methods for performing quality control on variants such as VQSR of GATK by considerably improving the quality of variants to be included in the analysis. Our approach is also very efficient, and hence can be applied to large sequencing datasets. We conclude that combining a machine learning algorithm trained with sequencing quality information and the filtering approach is an effective approach to perform quality control on genetic variants from sequencing data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenetic disorders can be caused by many types of genetic mutations, including common and rare single nucleotide variants, structural variants, insertions and deletions. Nowadays, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to identify various genetic variants that are associated with diseases. However, variants detected by NGS might have poor sequencing quality due to biases and errors in sequencing technologies and analysis tools. Therefore, it is critical to remove variants with low quality, which could cause spurious findings in follow-up analyses. Previously, people applied either hard filters or machine learning models for variant quality control (QC), which failed to filter out those variants accurately. Here, we developed a statistical tool, ForestQC, for variant QC by combining a filtering approach and a machine learning approach. We applied ForestQC to one family-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset and one general case-control WGS dataset, to evaluate our method. Results show that ForestQC outperforms widely used methods for variant QC by considerably improving the quality of variants. Also, ForestQC is very efficient and scalable to large-scale sequencing datasets. Our study indicates that combining filtering approaches and machine learning approaches enables effective variant QC.",

Here we characterize caste-specific transcriptomic profiles across development and adult body segments from pharaoh ants (Monomorium pharaonis) and honey bees (Apis mellifera), representing two independent origins of eusociality. We identify a substantial shared core of genes upregulated in the abdomens of queen ants and honey bees that also tends to be upregulated in mated female flies, suggesting that these genes are part of a conserved insect reproductive groundplan. Outside of this shared groundplan, few genes are differentially expressed in common. Instead, the majority of the thousands of caste-associated genes are plastically-expressed, rapidly evolving, and relatively evolutionarily young. These results emphasize that the recruitment of both highly conserved and lineage-specific genes underlie the convergent evolution of novel traits such as eusociality.",

Within synchronized states, previous studies have noted a plethora of different types of activity, including delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) and slow oscillations (<1 Hz) in the cortex and large- and small-irregular activity in the hippocampus. However, it is not still fully characterized how neural populations contribute to the synchronized state. Here we apply independent component analysis (ICA) to parse which populations are involved in different kinds of cortical activity, and find two populations that alternate throughout synchronized states. One population broadly affects cortical deep layers, and is associated with larger amplitude slower cortical activity. The other population exhibits theta-frequency oscillations that are not easily observed in raw field potential recordings. These theta oscillations apparently come from below the cortex, suggesting hippocampal origin, and are associated with smaller amplitude faster cortical activity. Relative involvement of these two alternating populations may indicate different modes of operation within synchronized states.",

Our understanding of the basal ganglia in particular has been greatly assisted by BAC mutants with selective transgene expression in striatal neurons forming the direct or indirect pathways. However, for more sophisticated behavioral tasks and larger intracranial implants, rat models are preferred. Furthermore, BAC lines can show variable expression patterns depending upon genomic insertion site. We therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two novel knock-in rat lines specifically encoding Cre recombinase immediately after the dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1a) or adenosine 2a receptor (Adora2a) loci. Here we validate these lines using in situ hybridization and viral vector mediated transfection to demonstrate selective, functional Cre expression in the striatal direct and indirect pathways respectively. We used whole-genome sequencing to confirm the lack of off-target effects, and established that both rat lines have normal locomotor activity and learning in simple instrumental and Pavlovian tasks. We expect these new D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rat lines will be widely used to study both normal brain functions and neurological and psychiatric pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) mediates clearance of circulating lipoproteins from blood by binding to ApoE receptors. Humans express three genetic variants, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, that exhibit distinct ApoE receptor binding properties. In brain, ApoE is abundantly produced by activated astrocytes and microglia, and three variants differentially affect Alzheimers disease (AD), such that ApoE2 protects against, and ApoE4 predisposes to the disease. A role for ApoE4 in driving microglial dysregulation and impeding A{beta} clearance in AD is well documented, but the direct effects of three variants on neurons are poorly understood. Extending previous studies, we here demonstrate that ApoE variants differentially activate multiple neuronal signaling pathways and regulate synaptogenesis. Specifically, using human neurons cultured in the absence of glia to exclude indirect glial mechanisms, we show that ApoE broadly stimulates signal transduction cascades which among others enhance synapse formation with an ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2 potency rank order, paralleling the relative risk for AD conferred by these variants. Unlike the previously described induction of APP transcription, however, ApoE-induced synaptogenesis involves CREB rather than cFos activation. We thus propose that in brain, ApoE acts as a glia-secreted paracrine signal and activates neuronal signaling pathways in what may represent a protective response, with the differential potency of ApoE variants causing distinct levels of chronic signaling that may contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is the process by which male gametes are formed from a self-renewing population of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) residing in the testis. SSCs represent less than 1% of the total testicular cell population, but must achieve a stable balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Once differentiation has occurred, the newly formed and highly proliferative spermatogonia must then enter the meiotic program in which DNA content is doubled, then halved twice to create haploid gametes. While much is known about the critical cellular processes that take place during the specialized cell division that is meiosis, much less is known about how the spermatocytes in the \\\"first-wave\\\" compare to those that contribute to long-term, \\\"steady-state\\\" spermatogenesis. Given the strictly-defined developmental process of spermatogenesis, this study was aimed at exploring the transcriptional profiles of developmental cell stages over the age of the animal. Using a combination of comprehensive germ cell sampling with high-resolution, single-cell-mRNA-sequencing, we have generated a reference dataset of germ cell gene expression. We show that discrete developmental stages possess significant differences in the transcriptional profiles from neonates compared to juveniles and adults. Importantly, these gene expression dynamics are also reflected at the protein level in their respective cell types. We also show differential utilization of many biological pathways with age in both spermatogonia and spermatocytes, demonstrating significantly different underlying gene regulatory programs in these cell types over the course of testis development and spermatogenic waves. This dataset represents the first unbiased sampling of spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the developing testis over developmental age, at high-resolution, single-cell depth. Not only does this analysis reveal previously unknown transcriptional dynamics of a highly transitional cell population, it has also begun to reveal critical differences in biological pathway utilization in developing spermatogonia and spermatocytes, including response to DNA damage and double-strand breaks.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySpermatogenesis is the process by which male gametes - mature spermatozoa - are produced in the testis. This process requires exquisite control over many developmental transitions, including the self-renewal of the germline stem cell population, commitment to meiosis, and ultimately, spermiogenesis. While much is known about molecular mechanisms regulating single transitions at single time points in the mouse, much less is understood about how the spermatogenic progenitor cells, spermatogonia, or the meiotic cells, spermatocytes, of the testis change over developmental age.\\n\\nOur single-cell-mRNA-sequencing analysis is the first to profile both spermatogonia and spermatocytes from neonatal mice through adulthood, revealing novel gene expression dynamics and differential utilization of biological pathways. These discoveries help us to understand how the spermatogenic progenitors of this population modulate their activity to adapt to a changing testicular environment. Furthermore, they also begin to explain previously-observed differences - and deficiencies - in spermatocytes that are derived from the first \\\"wave\\\" of spermatogenesis. Overall, this dataset is the first of its kind to comprehensively profile gene expression dynamics in male germ cell populations over time, enriching our understanding of the complex and highly-orchestrated process of spermatogenesis.",

The Straight-billed Reedhaunter (Limnoctites rectirostris) is a little known and threatened Passeriform that is highly dependent Erygo wetlands patches. Here, we evaluated the effects of habitat fragmentation on populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter, during the construction of a water reservoir in southern Brazil. During eight months, we monitored five Eryngo wetlands patches occupied (n=3) and no occupied (n=2) by Straight-billed Reedhaunter individuals, collecting data on their temporal occupancy patterns and registering new fragmentation events in formally continuous habitat patches. We evaluated the consequences of habitat fragmentation on the probabilities of patch occupancy, colonization and extinction of populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter using an information-theoretic approach. Out of the three patches occupied by Straight-billed Reedhaunter, two were not altered by construction activities and their populations were present during the entire study period. After fragmentation events, local extinction in one of the wetland patches was observed, and individuals were sporadically observed in two other initially unoccupied sites. The model in which fragmentation affected only the extinction probability was the most plausible among the set of candidate models. Fragmentation greatly increased the chance of local population extinction within patches. Our results indicate that the conservation of populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter is highly dependent on continuous and unaltered wetland patches.",

In the apical plant stem cell system, local accumulation of the small, highly mobile phytohormone auxin triggers differentiation while at the same time, pluripotent stem cells are maintained throughout the entire life-cycle. We find that stem cells are resistant to auxin mediated differentiation, but require low levels of signaling for their maintenance. We demonstrate that the WUSCHEL transcription factor confers this behavior by rheostatically controlling the auxin signaling and response pathway. Finally, we show that WUSCHEL acts via regulation of histone acetylation at target loci, including those with functions in the auxin pathway. Our results reveal an important mechanism that allows cells to differentially translate a potent and highly dynamic developmental signal into stable cell behavior with high spatial precision and temporal robustness.",

    "abstract": "A major cause of human blindness is the death of rod photoreceptors. As rods degenerate, synaptic structures between rod and rod bipolar cells dissolve and the rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites and occasionally make aberrant contacts. Such changes are broadly observed in blinding disorders caused by photoreceptor cell death and is thought to occur in response to deafferentation. How the remodeled retinal circuit affect visual processing following rod rescue is not known. To address this question, we generated transgenic mice wherein a disrupted cGMP-gated channel (CNG) gene can be repaired at the endogenous locus and at different stages of degeneration by tamoxifen-inducible cre-mediated recombination. In normal rods, light-induced closure of CNG channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell, reducing neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Similarly, rods lacking CNG channel exhibit a resting membrane potential that was ~10mV hyperpolarized compared to WT rods, indicating diminished glutamate release. Retinas from these mice undergo stereotypic retinal remodeling as a consequence of rod malfunction and degeneration. Upon tamoxifen-induced expression of CNG channels, rods recovered their structure and exhibited normal light responses. Moreover, we show that the adult mouse retina displays a surprising degree of plasticity upon activation of rod input. Wayward bipolar cell dendrites establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity extending beyond the developmental period and support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod degeneration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCurrent strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders are focused on the repair of the primary affected cell type. However, the defective neuron functions within a complex neural circuitry, which also becomes degraded during disease. It is not known whether a rescued neuron and the remodeled circuit will establish communication to regain normal function. We show that the adult mammalian neural retina exhibits a surprising degree of plasticity following rescue of rod photoreceptors. The wayward rod bipolar cell dendrites re-establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod cell loss.",

    "abstract": "Autistic people exhibit enhanced abilities to find and extract visual or auditory figures out of a meaningful whole (disembedding). Studies have shown heightened autistic traits in professional musicians with absolute pitch (AP). This study investigates whether such musicians show an advantage in an interleaved melody recognition task (IMRT).\\n\\nA total of N=59 professional musicians (AP=27) participated in the study. In each trial a probe melody was followed by an interleaved sequence. Subjects had to indicate as to whether the probe melody was present in the interleaved sequence. Sensitivity index d and response bias c were calculated according to signal detection theory. Additionally, a pitch adjustment test measuring fine-graded differences in absolute pitch proficiency, the Autism-Spectrum-Quotient and a visual embedded figures test were conducted.\\n\\nAP performance was enhanced overall compared to RP. Absolute pitch proficiency, visual disembedding ability and musicality predicted approximately 39.2% of variance in the interleaved melody recognition test. No correlations were found between IMRT and autistic traits.\\n\\nThe stable pitch-label associations of AP might serve as additional sensory cues during pre-attentive processing in recognizing interleaved melodies. Results are in line with a detailed-oriented cognitive style and enhanced perceptional functioning of AP musicians similar to that observed in autism.",

    "abstract": "All synapses require fusion-competent vesicles and coordinated Ca2+-secretion coupling for neurotransmission, yet functional and anatomical properties show a high diversity across different synapse types. We show here that the presynaptic protein RIM-BP2 has diversified functions in neurotransmitter release at different central mammalian synapses and thus contributes to synaptic diversity. At hippocampal pyramidal CA3-CA1 synapses, RIM-BP2 loss has a mild effect on neurotransmitter release, by only regulating Ca2+-secretion coupling. However, at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses RIM-BP2 has a strong impact on neurotransmitter release by promoting vesicle docking/priming via recruitment of Munc13-1. In wild type mossy fiber synapses, the distance between RIM-BP2 clusters and Munc13-1 clusters is larger than in hippocampal pyramidal CA3-CA1 synapses, suggesting that spatial organization may dictate the role a protein plays in synaptic transmission and that differences in active zone architecture is a major determinant factor in the functional diversity of synapses.",

    "abstract": "Inter-residue contacts determine the structural properties for each conformer in the ensembles describing the native state of proteins. Structural constraints during evolution could then provide biologically relevant information about the conformational ensembles and their relationship with protein function. Here, we studied the proportion of sites evolving under structural constraints in two very different types of ensembles, those coming from ordered or disordered proteins. Using a structurally constrained model of protein evolution we found that both types of ensembles show comparable, near 40%, number of positions evolving under structural constraints. Among these sites, ~68% are in disordered regions and ~57% of them show long-range inter-residue contacts. Also, we found that disordered ensembles are redundant in reference to their structurally constrained evolutionary information and could be described on average with ~11 conformers. Despite the different complexity of the studied ensembles and proteins, the similar constraints reveal a comparable level of selective pressure to maintain their biological functions. These results highlight the importance of the evolutionary information to recover meaningful biological information to further characterize conformational ensembles.",

    "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a genetically tractable animal host in which to study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of innate immune signaling. We previously showed that the PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates innate immunity of C. elegans through phosphorylation of the CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor, ATF-7. Here, we have undertaken a genomic analysis of the transcriptional response of C. elegans to infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining genome-wide expression analysis by RNA-seq with ATF-7 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We observe that PMK-1-ATF-7 activity regulates a majority of all genes induced by pathogen infection, and observe ATF-7 occupancy in regulatory regions of pathogen-induced genes in a PMK-1-dependent manner. Moreover, functional analysis of a subset of these ATF-7-regulated pathogen-induced target genes supports a direct role for this transcriptional response in host defense. The genome-wide regulation through PMK-1- ATF-7 signaling reveals global control over the innate immune response to infection through a single transcriptional regulator in a simple animal host.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInnate immunity is the first line of defense against invading microbes across metazoans. Caenorhabditis elegans lacks adaptive immunity and is therefore particularly dependent on mounting an innate immune response against pathogens. A major component of this response is the conserved PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, the activation of which results in phosphorylation of the bZIP transcription factor ATF-7. Signaling via PMK-1 and ATF-7 causes broad transcriptional changes including the induction of many genes that are predicted to have antimicrobial activity including C-type lectins and lysozymes. In this study, we show that ATF-7 directly regulates the majority of innate immune response genes upon pathogen infection of C. elegans, and demonstrate that many ATF-7 targets function to promote pathogen resistance.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells transmit information by signaling through complex networks of interacting proteins. Here we develop a theoretical and computational framework that relates the biophysics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within a signaling network to its information processing properties. To do so, we generalize statistical physics-inspired models for protein binding to account for interactions that depend on post-translational state (e.g. phosphorylation). By combining these models with information-theoretic methods, we find that PPIs are a key determinant of information transmission within a signaling network, with weak interactions giving rise to \\\"noise\\\" that diminishes information transmission. While noise can be mitigated by increasing interaction strength, the accompanying increase in transmission comes at the expense of a slower dynamical response. This suggests that the biophysics of signaling protein interactions give rise to a fundamental \\\"speed-information\\\" trade-off. Surprisingly, we find that cross-talk between pathways in complex signaling networks do not significantly alter information capacity-an observation that may partially explain the promiscuity and ubiquity of weak PPIs in heavily interconnected networks. We conclude by showing how our framework can be used to design synthetic biochemical networks that maximize information transmission, a procedure we dub \\\"InfoMax\\\" design.",

It remains a challenge to obtain high resolution structure of molecules smaller than 100 kDa using single particle cryo-EM, mainly due to the low contrast of the molecules embedded in vitreous ice. In this work, we applied the Cs-corrector-VPP coupled cryo-EM to study 52 kDa streptavidin (SA) protein supported on a thin layer of graphene film and embedded in vitreous ice. We were able to solve both the apo-SA and biotin-bound SA at near-atomic resolution using single particle cryo-EM. We demonstrated that the method is capable to determine the structure of molecule as small as 39 kDa and potentially even smaller molecules. Furthermore, we found that using the graphene film to avoid the adsorption to the air-water interface is critical to maintain the proteins high-resolution structural information.",

A few systematic reports on Babesia spp. was involved with ticks, especially in the human babesiosis endemic areas.\\n\\nMethodsThe ticks were collected from 30 individual waypoints along 2.0 km transects in two recreational forested areas in Northeastern China. Then we screened them for Babesia spp. infection by amplifying the partial 18s rRNA gene with subsequent sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to access the association between infections and some related risk factors. The cluster analyses were performed using SaTScan v6.0 Software for identifying the geographic cluster of the positive samples in ticks from each waypoint.\\n\\nResultsA total of Ixodes persulcatus (n=2380) and Haemaphysalis concinna (n=461) ticks were collected. The 0.97% of I. persulcatus ticks were infected with five Babesia species, including B. bigemina (n=6), B. divergens (n=2), B. microti (n=3), B. venatorum (n=11) and one novel strain HLJ-8. Thirteen (2.92%) H.concinna ticks contained B. bigemina (n=1), B. divergens (n=1), three genetic variants of Babesia represented by HLJ-874 which was closely related to Babesia sp.MA#361-1, and eight other Babesia variants represented by HLJ242 which were similar to B.crassa.

In China, many probably human babesiosis cases who had a history of recent tick bite were found in Lyme endemic area in Northeastern China, where the prevalence of Babesia parasite in the ticks still was far underestimated. In the present study, we conducted a field survey for ticks to identify diversities and complexity of babesia, and then to assess the risk of human babesiosis, by means of a three years longitudinal study that mapped the location of the ticks tested positive for Babesia spp. at two forestry areas with a heavy burden of tick-borne pathogens. We firstly presented the prevalence of Babesia spp. especially the genetic diversities and coexistence of seven Babesia spp. including 2 novel species or variants at one small scale \\\"natural foci\\\" in northeastern China. This work is useful to understand the complexity of Babesia pathogen in China, and how the Babesia perpetuates over the long term in the environment, as well as potential risks for human health.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies of bacterial DNA replication have led to a picture of the replisome as an entity that freely exchanges DNA polymerases and displays intermittent coupling between the helicase and polymerase(s). Challenging the textbook model of the polymerase holoenzyme acting as a stable complex coordinating the replisome, these observations suggest a role of the helicase as the central organizing hub. We show here that the molecular origin of this newly-found plasticity lies in the >400-fold increase in strength of the interaction between the polymerase holoenzyme and the replicative helicase upon association of the primase with the replisome. By combining in vitro ensemble-averaged and single-molecule assays, we demonstrate that this conformational switch operates during replication and promotes recruitment of multiple holoenzymes at the fork. Our observations provide a molecular mechanism for polymerase exchange and offer a revised model for the replication reaction that emphasizes its stochasticity.",

    "abstract": "Lamina-associated domains (LADs) cover a large part of the human genome and are thought to play a major role in shaping the nuclear architectural landscape. Here, we use simulations based on concepts from polymer physics to dissect the roles played by heterochromatin- and lamina-mediated interactions in nuclear organisation. Our model explains the conventional organisation of heterochromatin and euchromatin in growing cells, as well as the pathological organisation found in oncogene-induced senescence and progeria. We show that the experimentally observed changes in the locality of contacts in senescent and progeroid cells can be explained naturally as arising due to phase transitions in the system. Our model predicts that LADs are highly stochastic, and that, once established, the senescent phenotype should be metastable even if lamina-mediated interactions were reinstated. Overall, our simulations uncover a universal physical mechanism that can regulate heterochromatin segregation and LAD formation in a wide range of mammalian nuclei.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of microtubule-associated protein tau into abundant filamentous inclusions underlies a range of neurodegenerative diseases. The finding that tau filaments adopt different conformations in Alzheimers and Picks diseases raises the question of what kinds of structures of tau filaments form in vitro. Here, we used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and negative-stain immuno-gold electron microscopy (immuno-EM) to characterise filaments that were assembled from recombinant full-length human tau with four (2N4R) or three (2N3R) microtubule-binding repeats in the presence of heparin. 4R tau assembles into at least four different types of filaments. Cryo-EM structures of three types of 4R filaments reveal similar \\\"kinked hairpin\\\" folds, in which the second and third repeats pack against each other. 3R tau filaments are structurally homogeneous, and adopt a dimeric core, where the third repeats of two tau molecules pack against each other in a parallel, yet asymmetric, manner. None of the heparin-induced tau filaments resemble those of Alzheimers or Picks disease, which have larger cores with different repeat compositions. Our results indicate that tau filaments are structurally versatile, and raise questions about the relevance of in vitro assembled amyloids.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) comprise diverse lineages that serve distinct roles necessary for regulation of nutrient absorption, regeneration, immunity, and homeostasis1,2. Goblet cells secrete Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) to maintain mucus viscosity and drive mucosal healing by inhibiting cell death and influencing tight junction protein expression3. However, whether TFF3 signaling relies upon conventional ligand-receptor interactions has been unclear for decades. This study demonstrates that the orphan transmembrane protein leucine rich repeat receptor and nogo-interacting protein 2 (LINGO2) immunoprecipitates with TFF3, that LINGO2 and TFF3 co-localize at the IEC cell surface, and that TFF3/LINGO2 interactions block IEC apoptosis. Loss of function studies show that TFF3-driven STAT3 and EGFR activation are both LINGO2 dependent. Importantly, we demonstrate that TFF3 disrupts LINGO2/EGFR interactions that normally restrict EGFR activity, resulting in enhanced EGFR signaling. Excessive EGFR activation in Lingo2 gene deficient mice exacerbates colitic disease and accelerates host resistance to parasitic nematodes, whereas TFF3 deficiency results in host susceptibility. Thus, our data demonstrating that TFF3 functions through a previously unrecognized ligand-receptor interaction with LINGO2 to de-repress LINGO2-dependent inhibition of EGFR activation provides a novel conceptual framework explaining how TFF3-mediates mucosal wound healing through enhanced activation of the EGFR pathway.",

    "abstract": "During tendon healing, it is postulated that intrinsic tendon cells drive tissue regeneration while extrinsic cells drive pathological scar formation. Intrinsic tendon cells are frequently described as a homogenous, fibroblast population that is positive for the marker Scleraxis. It is controversial whether intrinsic Scleraxis localize within the forming scar tissue during adult tendon healing. We have previously demonstrated that calcium binding protein S100a4 is a driver of tendon scar formation and marks a subset of intrinsic tendon cells. However, the relationship between Scleraxis and S100a4 has not been explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the localization of Scleraxis lineage cells following adult murine flexor tendon repair and to establish the relationship between Scleraxis and S100a4 throughout both homeostasis and healing. We have shown that adult Scleraxis lineage cells localize within the scar tissue and organize into a highly aligned cellular bridge during tendon healing. Additionally, we demonstrate that markers Scleraxis and S100a4 label distinct populations in tendon during homeostasis and localize differently within tendon scar tissue, with Scleraxis found specifically in the organized bridging tissue and S100a4 localized throughout the entire scar region. These studies define a heterogeneous tendon cell environment and demonstrate discreet contributions of subpopulations during healing. Taken together, these data enhance our understanding and ability to target the complex cellular environment of the tendon during homeostasis and healing.",

    "abstract": "In the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, long-lived germline stem cells (GSCs) migrate to new germline niches as they develop during repetitive cycles of asexual reproduction. ABC-transporters are involved in the export of lipid-signaling molecules, but their roles in germ cell migration are poorly understood. Here, we show that in Botryllus, abcc1 and abcb1 are highly expressed in germ cells, and inhibition of ABC-transporter activity leads to failure of germ cell migration. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) produces arachidonic acid, which is further metabolized to eicosanoid signaling molecules. In humans, 12-lipoxygenase (LOX) metabolizes arachidonic acid to12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-S-HETE), which stimulates migration of mammalian cancer cells and smooth muscle cells. We show that PLA2 and LOX activity are required for germ cell migration. A potential homolog to the human receptor for 12-S-HETE, BSgpr31, is expressed in germ cells. 12-S-HETE rescues migration towards S1P in the presence of inhibitors of ABCC1, ABCB1, PLA2 or LOX, and a gradient of 12-S-HETE enhances chemotaxis towards S1P and stimulates motility. We conclude that 12-S-HETE is a secondary chemoattractant exported by ACB-transporters that is required for migration of germ cells towards S1P. We also find that in the presence of S1P, detection of an 12-S-HETE gradient initiates an autologous positive feedback loop that may sustain migration. This is the first report of an eicosanoid-signaling molecule regulating germ cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal epithelia are constantly exposed to damaging stimuli from mechanical, chemical, or biologic entities, and depend on rapid repair mechanisms to maintain tissue homeostasis and immunological quiescence. The reparative cytokine Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) serves to enforce mucosal barrier integrity, but whether TFF2 receptor(s) exist is controversial. Herein, we demonstrate leucine rich repeat and immunoglobulin like domain containing nogo receptor interacting protein 3 (LINGO3) is a necessary transmembrane component for TFF2-mediated ERK signaling, proliferation, and recovery of trans-epithelial resistance of primary epithelia during wound healing. Human respiratory and intestinal epithelia express LINGO3 and mice lacking Lingo3 have impaired intestinal barrier function and fail to recover from DSS-induced colitis. Compared to wild-type controls, LINGO3 deficiency impairs both crypt regeneration and expression of the intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5. Importantly, Lingo3-/- mice display a phenotype similar to that previously reported for Tff2 deficiency, with increased paracellular permeability, and significant accumulation of mucosal CD4+ TH1 cells expressing IFN{gamma}+ TNF+ even under steady-state conditions. Combined, these data reveal a previously unrecognized role for LINGO3 as a putative TFF2 receptor that regulates mucosal barrier integrity and GI inflammation.\\n\\nSignificanceIntestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are necessary for maintenance of homeostasis, resistance to infectious organisms, and overall organismal health. When injured the IEC and the underlying stroma and progenitor cell pool undergo restitutive and regenerative processes driven by the reparative cytokine Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2). This report identifies a novel receptor component for TFF2 signaling expressed on both human and mouse epithelial cells that is necessary for barrier integrity at the steady state and during colitic disease.

    "abstract": "To enable robust patterning, morphogen systems should be resistant to variations in gene expression and tissue size. Here we explore how the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) morphogen gradient in the ventral neural tube enables scaled patterning in embryos of varying sizes. Using zebrafish eggs that have been surgically reduced in size, we find that ventral neural tube patterning remains proportional in smaller embryos. Intriguingly, a secreted protein implicated in Shh release, Scube2, is expressed in the dorsal-intermediate neural tube far from Shh producing cells. Overexpression of scube2 expands the Shh gradient whereas loss of scube2 causes gradient contraction. Conversely, upregulation of Shh represses scube2 expression while Shh downregulation increases scube2 expression thus establishing a negative feedback loop. This regulatory feedback is necessary for scaling, as demonstrated by its loss in scube2 overexpressing embryos. Using mathematical modeling, we show that feedback control on diffusion and release rates of Shh allows the morphogen gradient to be robust to differences in field length and Shh gene dosage. We conclude that Scube2 promotes release and diffusion of Shh to allow gradient scaling in an extension to the expander-repressor model.\n\nSummary StatementThe Shh morphogen gradient can scale to different size tissues by feedback between Scube2 mediated release and diffusion of Shh and Shh based inhibition of Scube2 expression",

    "abstract": "Organ left-right (LR) asymmetry is a conserved vertebrate feature, which is regulated by left-sided activation of Nodal signaling. Nodal asymmetry is established by a leftward fluid-flow generated at the ciliated LR organizer (LRO). While the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways during mesoderm development are conserved, diverging results from different model organisms suggested a non-conserved function in LR asymmetry. Here, we demonstrate that FGF is required during gastrulation in a dual function at consecutive stages of Xenopus embryonic development. In the early gastrula, FGF is necessary for LRO precursor induction, acting in parallel to FGF-mediated mesoderm induction. During late gastrulation, the FGF/Ca2+-branch is required for specification of the flow sensing lateral LRO cells, a function related to FGF-mediated mesoderm morphogenesis. This second function in addition requires input from the calcium channel Polycystin-2. Thus, analogous to mesoderm development, FGF activity is required in a dual role for laterality specification, namely for generating and sensing of leftward flow. Moreover, our data show that FGF functions in LR asymmetric development are conserved across vertebrate species, from fish to mammals.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in many pathological conditions and diseases. The normal functioning of mitochondria relies on maintaining the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) potential (a.k.a. {Delta}{Psi}m) that is essential for ATP synthesis, Ca2+ homeostasis, redox balance and regulation of other key signaling pathways such as mitophagy and apoptosis. However, the detailed mechanisms by which {Delta}{Psi}m regulates cellular function remain incompletely understood, partially due to difficulty of manipulating {Delta}{Psi}m with spatiotemporal resolution, reversibility, or cell type specificity. To address this need, we have developed a next-generation optogenetic-based technique for controllable mitochondrial depolarization with light. We demonstrate successful targeting of the heterologous Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) fusion protein to the IMM and formation of functional cationic channels capable of light-induced selective {Delta}{Psi}m depolarization and mitochondrial autophagy. Importantly, we for the first time show that optogenetic-mediated mitochondrial depolarization can be well-controlled to differentially influence the fate of cells expressing mitochondrial ChR2: while sustained moderate light illumination induces substantial apoptotic cell death, transient mild light illumination elicits cytoprotection via mitochondrial preconditioning. Finally, we show that Parkin overexpression exacerbates, instead of ameliorating, mitochondrial depolarization-mediated cell death in HeLa cells. In summary, we provide evidence that the described mitochondrial-targeted optogenetics may have a broad application for studying the role of mitochondria in regulating cell function and fate decision.",

Failure to degrade CAT-tailed proteins disrupts global protein homeostasis, as CAT-tailed proteins aggregate and sequester chaperones. Why cells employ such a potentially toxic process during RQC is unclear. Here, we developed quantitative techniques to assess how CAT tails affect stalled polypeptide degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that CAT tails improve Ltn1s efficiency in targeting structured polypeptides, which are otherwise poor Ltn1 substrates. If Ltn1 fails, CAT tails undergo a backup route of ubiquitylation off the ribosome, mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Hul5. Thus, CAT tails functionalize the carboxy-termini of stalled polypeptides to drive their degradation on and off the ribosome.",

A thorough understanding of the cellular diversity, transitions and regulatory networks of normal OFT development is essential to decipher the etiology of OFT malformations.\\n\\nObjectiveWe sought to explore the cellular diversity and transitions between cell lineages during OFT development.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of 55,611 mouse OFT cells from three developmental stages that generally correspond to the early, middle and late stages of OFT remodeling and septation. We identified 17 cell clusters that could be assigned to six cell lineages. Among these lineages, the macrophage and VSMC lineages of the developing OFT have seldom been previously described. Known cellular transitions, such as endothelial to mesenchymal transition, have been recapitulated. In particular, we identified convergent development of the VSMC lineage, where intermediate cell subpopulations were found to be involved in either myocardial to VSMC trans-differentiation or mesenchymal to VSMC transition. Through single-molecule in situ hybridization, we observed that cells expressing the myocardial marker Myh7 co-expressed the VSMC marker gene Cxcl12 in OFT walls, thus confirming the existence of myocardial to VSMC trans-differentiation. Moreover, we found that the Penk+ cluster c8, a relatively small mesenchymal subpopulation that was undergoing mesenchymal to VSMC transition, was associated with the fusion of OFT cushions. We also uncovered the expression dynamics and critical transcriptional regulators potentially governing cell state transitions. Finally, we developed web-based interactive interfaces to facilitate further data exploration.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a single-cell reference map of cell states for normal OFT development, which will be a valuable resource for the CHD community.

    "abstract": "Unlike adult mammals, zebrafish are able to naturally regenerate their heart. A key mechanism in zebrafish heart regeneration is the activation of the epicardium, leading to the establishment of a supporting scaffold for newly formed cardiomyocytes, angiogenesis and cytokine secretion. Neuropilins (NRPs) are cell surface co-receptors mediating functional signaling of kinase receptors for cytokines known to play critical roles in zebrafish heart regeneration, including Platelet-Derived growth factor (PDGF), Vascular Endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Herein, we investigated the role of neuropilins in the response of the zebrafish heart to injury and its subsequent regeneration. All four zebrafish neuropilin isoforms, nrp 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b, were upregulated following cardiac cryoinjury and were strongly expressed by the activated epicardium. A nrp1a mutant, coding for a truncated, non-functional protein, showed a significant delay in heart regeneration in comparison to Wild-Type fish and displayed persistent collagen deposition. The regenerating hearts of nrp1a mutants were less vascularized and epicardial-derived cell migration and re-expression of the developmental gene Wilms tumor 1 was severely impaired in nrp1a mutants. Moreover, cryoinjury-induced activation and migration of epicardial cells in heart explants was strongly reduced in nrp1a mutant zebrafish. These results identify a key role for Nrp1 in zebrafish heart regeneration, mediated through epicardial activation, migration and revascularization.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, impairing cognitive and motor functions. One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is neuronal loss, which is not reflected in mouse models of AD. Therefore, the role of neuronal death is still uncertain. Here, we used a Drosophila AD model expressing a secreted form of human amyloid-{beta}42 peptide and show that it recapitulates key aspects of AD pathology, including neuronal death and impaired long-term memory. We found that neuronal apoptosis is mediated by cell fitness-driven neuronal culling, which selectively eliminates impaired neurons from brain circuits. We show that removal of less fit neurons delays amyloid-{beta}42-induced brain damage and protects against cognitive and motor decline, suggesting that - contrary to common knowledge - neuronal death may have a beneficial effect in AD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDivide-and-conquer methods, which divide the species set into over-lapping subsets, construct a tree on each subset, and then combine the subset trees using a supertree method, provide a key algorithmic framework for boosting the scalability of phylogeny estimation methods to large datasets. Yet the use of supertree methods, which typically attempt to solve NP-hard optimization problems, limits the scalability of such approaches.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that does not require supertree estimation: we divide the species set into pairwise disjoint subsets, construct a tree on each subset using a base method, and then combine the subset trees using a distance matrix. For this merger step, we present a new method, called NJMerge, which is a polynomial-time extension of Neighbor Joining (NJ); thus, NJMerge can be viewed either as a method for improving traditional NJ or as a method for scaling the base method to larger datasets. We prove that NJMerge can be used to create divide-and-conquer pipelines that are statistically consistent under some models of evolution. We also report the results of an extensive simulation study evaluating NJMerge on multi-locus datasets with up to 1000 species. We found that NJMerge sometimes improved the accuracy of traditional NJ and substantially reduced the running time of three popular species tree methods (ASTRAL-III, SVDquartets, and \\\"concatenation\\\" using RAxML) without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, although NJMerge can fail to return a tree, in our experiments, NJMerge failed on only 11 out of 2560 test cases.\\n\\nConclusionsTheoretical and empirical results suggest that NJMerge is a valuable technique for large-scale phylogeny estimation, especially when computational resources are limited.

    "abstract": "Morphological surface features are a record of genetic and developmental processes as well as environmental influences. The 3D geometric \"terrain\" of the surface consists of slopes via tangents, peaks and valleys via normals, smoothness of the transition between peaks and valleys, and point connections as flatness or curvature among all features. Such geometric quantities can be used to indicate morphological changes in valve formation over time. Quantified 3D surface features as geometric pattern ensembles may be representative of structural snapshots of the morphogenetic process.\n\nFor diatoms, valve formation and pattern morphogenesis has been modeled using Turing-like and other algorithmic techniques to mimic the way in which diatoms exhibit the highly diverse patterns on their valve surfaces. How the created surface features are related to one another is not necessarily determined via such methods. With the diatom valve face structure of layered areolae, cribra, and other morphological characters, valve formation exhibits different combined geometries unfolding as 3D structural ensembles in particular spatial arrangements. Quantifying ensemble 3D surface geometries is attainable via models devised using parametric 3D equations and extracting surface features via partial derivatives for slopes, peaks and valleys, smoothness, and flatness as feature connectedness. Differences in ensemble 3D surface features may be used to assess structural differences among selected diatom genera as indicators of different valve formation sequences in surface generation and morphogenesis.",
