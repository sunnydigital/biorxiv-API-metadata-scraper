    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in oxidative damage, leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. The oxidative status of RGCs is regulated intrinsically and also extrinsically by retinal glia. The mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) relieves oxidative and neuronal damage in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models. We hypothesized that deletion of Ucp2 in either RGCs or retinal glia would increase retinal damage and retinal ganglion cell death in a mouse model of glaucoma. Paradoxically, we found the reverse, and deletion of mitochondrial UCP2 decreased oxidative protein modification and reduced retinal ganglion cell death in male and female mice. This paradox was resolved after finding that Ucp2 deletion also increased levels of mitophagy in cell culture and retinal tissue. Our data suggest that Ucp2 deletion facilitates increased mitochondrial function by improving quality control. An increase in mitochondrial function explains the resistance of Ucp2-deleted retinas to glaucoma and may provide a therapeutic avenue for other chronic neurodegenerative conditions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany unsolved neurodegenerative conditions result from defects in mitochondrial function. Molecular tools that can manipulate mitochondria will therefore be central to developing neuroprotective therapies. Among the most potent regulators of mitochondrial function are the uncoupling proteins, particularly UCP2. In this manuscript we show that while loss of UCP2 does increase mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species, it also initiates an increase in mitophagy that is ultimately neuroprotective. This novel protective consequence of uncoupling protein inhibition may lead to new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative disease, particularly because pharmacological compounds do exist that can selectively inhibit UCP2.",

    "abstract": "Individuals vary in their behavioral and physiological responses to environmental changes. These behavioral responses are often described as  coping styles along a proactive-reactive continuum. Studies in laboratory populations often, but not always, find that behavioral responses and physiological responses to stressors covary, where more proactive (more aggressive and active) individuals have a lower physiological stress response, specifically as measured by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. These studies support the possibility of hormonal pleiotropy underlying the presentation of behaviors that make up the proactive-reactive phenotype. However, recent research in wild populations is equivocal, with some studies reporting the same pattern as found in many controlled laboratory studies, whereas others do not. We tested the hypothesis that physiological and behavioral stress responses are correlated in wild adult North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We used fecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) as a non-invasive, integrated estimate of circulating glucocorticoids for our measurement of HPA axis activity. We found that FCM concentrations were not correlated with three measures of behavioral coping styles (activity, aggression, and docility) among individuals. This does not support the hypothesis that hormonal pleiotropy underlies a proactive-reactive continuum of coping styles. Instead, our results support the \\\"two-tier\\\" hypothesis that behavioral and physiological stress responses are independent and uncorrelated traits among individuals in wild populations that experience naturally varying environments rather than controlled environments. If also found in other studies, this may alter our predictions about the evolutionary consequences of behavioral and endocrine coping styles in free-living animals.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIndividuals vary in how they respond to stressors through behavior and physiology, but we find the two responses are independent in wild animals. Many laboratory studies find links between the behavioral and physiological stress responses, however studies conducted with wild populations are less conclusive. In wild North American red squirrels, independence between the physiological response and behavioral response may allow adaptive responses to a changing environment without pleiotropic constraint.",

    "abstract": "There is an unmet need for new treatment methods for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can reliably maintain remission without leading to detrimental side effects. Beneficial bacteria have been utilized as an alternative treatment for IBD albeit with low efficacy. We genetically engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create an anti-inflammatory fibrous matrix in situ. This matrix consists of EcN-produced curli nanofibers displaying trefoil factors (TFFs), known to promote intestinal barrier function and epithelial restitution. We confirmed that engineered EcN was able to secrete the curli-fused TFFs in vitro and in vivo, and was non-pathogenic. We observed an enhanced protective effect of engineered EcN against dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis in mice, associated with barrier function reinforcement and immunomodulation. This work sets the foundation for the development of a novel therapeutic platform in which the in situ production of a therapeutic protein matrix from beneficial bacteria can be exploited.",

It currently is hampered by CRISPR-Cas-mediated \\\"base editing\\\" being limited to certain nucleotide changes, and only achievable within a small window around CRISPR-Cas target sites. The more versatile alternative, HDR (homology directed repair), has a 4-fold lower efficiency with known optimization factors being largely immutable in experiments. Here, we investigated the variable efficiency-governing factors on a novel mouse dataset using machine learning. We found the sequence composition of the repair template (ssODN) to be a governing factor, where different regions of the ssODN have variable influence, which reflects the underlying biophysical mechanism. Our model improves HDR efficiency by 83% compared to traditionally chosen targets. Using our findings, we develop CUNE (Computational Universal Nucleotide Editor), which enables users to identify and design the optimal targeting strategy using traditional base editing or - for-the-first-time - HDR-mediated nucleotide changes.\\n\\nCUNE can be run via the web at: https://gt-scan.net/cune",

Here, we investigate the cryptic variation underlying a Saccharomyces cerevisiae colony phenotype that is typically suppressed in a cross. Mapping of the traits genetic basis after induction by three different genetic perturbations identifies 21 total loci. The perturbations largely uncover distinct loci, and strongly influence additivity, epistasis, and genotype-environment interaction among these loci. Only a single locus-- the coding region of the cell surface gene FLO11--is common to all three perturbations. While the remaining loci mostly influence FLO11 transcription in cis or trans, we detect loci in different pathways and sub-pathways in the presence of each perturbation. Our work shows that complex gene regulatory networks can harbor multiple layers of cryptic variation, each of which may only be visible in highly specific genotypic and environmental contexts.\\n\\nArticle SummaryThe extent and regulation of cryptic genetic variation within populations is not fully understood. To address these questions, we comprehensively dissect the genetic basis of a budding yeast colony trait following its induction by three different genetic perturbations. In total, we identify 21 distinct loci, most of which show phenotypic effects that depend on particular perturbations, other segregating loci, and temperature. We find that nearly all involved loci participate in a common gene regulatory network (GRN). Thus, our work demonstrates the large amount of cryptic variation underlying a single trait and ties the visibility of this variation to GRN activity.",

    "abstract": "In anthropoid primates, SETMAR is a fusion between a methyltransferase gene and a domesticated DNA transposase. SETMAR has been found to be involved in several cellular functions including regulation of gene expression, DNA integration and DNA repair. These functions are thought to be mediated through the histone methyltransferase, the DNA binding and the nuclease activities of SETMAR. To better understand the cellular roles of SETMAR, we generated several U2OS cell lines expressing either wild type SETMAR or a truncated or mutated variant. We tested these cell lines with in vivo plasmid-based assays to determine the relevance of the different domains and activities of SETMAR in DNA integration and repair. We found that expressing the SET and MAR domains, but not wild type SETMAR, partially affect DNA integration and repair. The methyltransferase activity of SETMAR is also needed for an efficient DNA repair whereas we did not observe any requirement for the putative nuclease activity of SETMAR. Overall, our data support a non-essential function for SETMAR in DNA integration and repair.",

    "abstract": "The earliest human graphic productions dating to the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic are associated with anatomically modern and archaic hominins. These productions, which consist of abstract patterns engraved on a variety of media, may have been used as symbols, and their emergence is thought to be associated with the evolution of the properties of the visual cortex. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activations triggered by the perception of engraved patterns dating between 540,000 and 30,000 years before the present with those elicited by the perception of scenes, objects, symbol-like characters, and written words. The perception of the engravings bilaterally activated regions in the ventral route in a pattern similar to that produced by the perception of objects, suggesting that these graphic productions are processed as organized visual representations in the brain. Moreover, the perception of the engravings led to a leftward activation of the visual word form area. These results support the hypothesis that in contrast to random doodles, the earliest abstract graphic productions had a representational purpose for modern and archaic hominins.",

Using a novel task that directs attention toward breathing rhythm, we assessed the involvement of the AIC in interoceptive attention in healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging and examined the necessity of the AIC in interoceptive attention in patients with AIC lesions. We found that interoceptive attention was associated with greater AIC activation, as well as enhanced coupling between the AIC and somatosensory area along with reduced coupling between AIC and visual sensory areas. AIC activation and connectivity were predictive of individual differences in interoceptive accuracy. Importantly, AIC lesion patients showed disrupted interoceptive discrimination accuracy and sensitivity.

    "abstract": "The bridging integrator 1 gene (BIN1) is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). In this report, we investigated how BIN1-dependent pathophysiological processes might be associated with Tau. We first generated a cohort of control and transgenic mice either overexpressing human MAPT (TgMAPT) or both human MAPT and BIN1 (TgMAPT;TgBIN1), which we followed-up from 3 to 15 months. In TgMAPT;TgBIN1 mice short-term memory deficits appeared earlier than in TgMAPT mice; however - unlike TgMAPT mice - TgMAPT;TgBIN1 mice did not exhibit any long-term or spatial memory deficits for at least 15 months. After sacrifice of the cohort at 18 months, immunohistochemistry revealed that BIN1 overexpression prevents both Tau mislocalization and somatic inclusion in the hippocampus, where an increase in BIN1-Tau interaction was also observed. We then sought mechanisms controlling the BIN1-Tau interaction. We developed a high-content screening approach to characterize modulators of the BIN1-Tau interaction in an agnostic way (1,126 compounds targeting multiple pathways), and we identified - among others - an inhibitor of Calcineurin, a Ser/Thr phosphatase. We determined that Calcineurin dephosphorylates BIN1 on a Cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site at T348, promoting the open conformation of the neuronal BIN1 isoform. Phosphorylation of this site increases the availability of the BIN1 SH3 domain for Tau interaction, as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and in primary neurons. Finally, we observed that the levels of the neuronal BIN1 isoform were decreased in AD brains, whereas phospho-BIN1(T348):BIN1 ratio was increased, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. In conclusion, our data support the idea that BIN1 modulates the AD risk through an intricate regulation of its interaction with Tau. Alteration in BIN1 expression or activity may disrupt this regulatory balance with Tau and have direct effects on learning and memory.",

Hippocampal theta oscillations that are critical in spatial navigation, learning and memory are impaired in AD. Since GABAergic interneurons, such as somatostatin-positive (SST+) and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, are believed to play key roles in the hippocampal oscillogenesis, we asked whether A{beta}O selectively impairs these SST+ and PV+ interneurons. To selectively manipulate SST+ or PV+ interneuron activity in mice with A{beta}O pathology in vivo, we co-injected A{beta}O and adeno-associated virus (AAV) for expressing floxed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the hippocampus of SST-Cre or PV-Cre mice. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in vivo in these A{beta}O-injected mice showed a reduction in the peak power of theta oscillations and desynchronization of spikes from CA1 pyramidal neurons relative to theta oscillations compared to those in control mice. Optogenetic-activation of SST+ but not PV+ interneurons in A{beta}O-injected mice fully restored the peak power of theta oscillations and resynchronized the theta spike phases to a level observed in control mice. In vitro whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices treated with A{beta}O revealed that short-term plasticity of SST+ interneuron inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons at theta frequency were selectively disrupted while that of PV+ interneuron inputs were unaffected. Together, our results suggest that dysfunction in inputs from SST+ interneurons to CA1 pyramidal neurons may underlie the impairment of theta oscillations observed in A{beta}O-injected mice in vivo. Our findings identify SST+ interneurons as a target for restoring theta-frequency oscillations in early AD.",

For instance, in object lifting, the forces applied by the fingertips must be scaled to the objects weight. When lifting a series of objects, forces are usually scaled according to recent experience from previously lifted objects, an effect often referred to as sensorimotor memory. In this study, we investigated the specific time period during which stored information from previous object manipulation is used to mediate sensorimotor memory. More specifically, we examined whether sensorimotor memory was based on weight information obtained between object contact and lift completion (lifting phase) or during stable holding (holding phase). Participants lifted objects in virtual reality that could increase or decrease in weight after the object was lifted and held in the air. In this way, we could distinguish whether the force planning in the next lift was scaled depending on weight information gathered from either the dynamic lifting or static holding period. We found that force planning was based on the previous object weight experienced during the lifting, but not holding, phase. This suggest that the lifting phase, while merely lasting a few hundred milliseconds, is a key time period for building up internal object representations used for planning future hand-object interactions.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWhen lifting objects, fingertip force scaling is based on the most recent lift\\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated what time period is critical for acquiring sensorimotor memory\\nC_LIO_LISensorimotor memory is based on weight experienced during previous lift, not hold\\nC_LIO_LIThe lifting phase is a key period for building up internal models of object lifting\\nC_LI",

However, evolutionary dynamics of cancer clone populations remain poorly understood. Quantification of clonal selection and inference of fitness landscapes of tumors is a key step to understanding evolutionary mechanisms driving cancer. These problems could be addressed using single cell sequencing, which provides an unprecedented insight into intra-tumor heterogeneity allowing to study and quantify selective advantages of individual clones. Here we present SCIFIL, a computational tool for inference of fitness landscapes of heterogeneous cancer clone populations from single cell sequencing data. SCIFIL allows to estimate maximum likelihood fitnesses of clone variants, measure their selective advantages and order of appearance by fitting an evolutionary model into the tumor phylogeny. We demonstrate the accuracy and utility of our approach on simulated and experimental data. SCIFIL can be used to provide new insight into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer.

We then simulate Wolbachia release strategies similar to that used in field trials.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that our model can produce rates of spatial spread of Wolbachia similar to those observed following field releases.\\nC_LIO_LIWe then investigate how different types of spatio-temporal variation in mosquito habitat, as well as different fitness costs incurred by Wolbachia on the mosquito host, influence predicted spread rates. We find that fitness costs reduce spread rates more strongly when the habitat landscape varies temporally due to stochastic and seasonal processes.\\nC_LIO_LIOur empirically based modelling approach represents effects of environmental heterogeneity on the spatial spread of Wolbachia. The models can assist in interpreting observed spread patterns following field releases and in designing suitable release strategies for targeting spatially heterogeneous vector populations.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The targetable DNA endonuclease CRISPR-Cas9 has transformed analysis of biological processes by enabling robust genome editing in model and non-model organisms. Although rules directing Cas9 to its target DNA via a guide RNA are straightforward, wide variation occurs in editing efficiency and repair outcomes, both imprecise error-prone repair and precise templated repair. We found that imprecise and precise DNA repair from double-stranded breaks (DSBs) is asymmetric, favoring repair in one direction. Using this knowledge, we designed RNA guides and repair templates that increased the frequency of imprecise insertions and deletions and greatly enhanced precise insertion of point mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans. We devised strategies to insert long (10 kb) exogenous sequences or incorporate multiple nucleotide substitutions at considerable distance from DSBs. We expanded the repertoire of co-conversion markers appropriate for diverse nematode species. These selectable markers enable rapid identification of Cas9-edited animals also likely to carry edits in desired targets. Lastly, we explored the timing, location, frequency, sex-dependence, and categories of DSB repair events by developing loci with allele-specific Cas9 targets that can be contributed during mating from either male or hermaphrodite germ cells. Our studies revealed a striking difference in editing efficiency between maternally and paternally contributed genomes. Furthermore, imprecise repair and precise repair from exogenous repair templates occur with high frequency before and after fertilization. Our strategies enhance Cas9 targeting efficiency, lend insight into the timing and mechanisms of DSB repair, and establish guidelines for achieving predictable precise and imprecise repair outcomes with high frequency.",

    "abstract": "Limited antifungal diversity and availability are growing problems for the treatment of fungal infections in the face of increasing drug resistance. The echinocandins, one of the newest classes of antifungal drugs, inhibit production of a crucial cell wall component. However, these compounds do not effectively inhibit the growth of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, despite potent inhibition of the target enzyme. We therefore performed a forward genetic screen to identify cellular processes that mediate the relative tolerance of this organism to the echinocandin drug, caspofungin. Through these studies, we identified 14 genetic mutants that enhance caspofungin antifungal activity. Rather than directly affecting caspofungin antifungal activity, these mutations seem to prevent the activation of various stress-induced compensatory cellular processes. For example, the pfa4{Delta} mutant has defects in the palmitoylation and localization of many of its target proteins, including the Ras GTPase and the Chs3 chitin synthase which are both required for caspofungin tolerance. Similarly, we have confirmed the link between caspofungin treatment and calcineurin signaling in this organism, but we suggest a deeper mechanism in which caspofungin tolerance is mediated by multiple pathways downstream of calcineurin function. Additionally, a partial loss-of-function mutant of a COP9 signalosome component results in a highly caspofungin-susceptible strain of C. neoformans. In summary, we describe here several pathways in C. neoformans that contribute to the complex caspofungin tolerance phenotype in this organism.",

    "abstract": "One of sleeps putative functions is mediation of adaptation to waking experiences. Chronic stress is a common waking experience, however, which specific aspect of sleep is most responsive, and how sleep changes relate to behavioral disturbances and molecular correlates remain unknown. We quantified sleep, physical, endocrine and behavioral variables and the brain and blood transcriptome in mice exposed to nine weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Comparing 46 phenotypical variables revealed that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), corticosterone regulation and coat state were most responsive to UCMS. REMS theta oscillations were enhanced whereas delta oscillations in non-REMS were unaffected. Transcripts affected by UCMS in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and blood were associated with inflammatory and immune responses. A machine learning approach controlling for unspecific UCMS effects identified transcriptomic predictors for specific phenotypes and their overlap. Transcriptomic predictor sets for the inter-individual variation in REMS continuity and theta activity shared many pathways with corticosterone regulation and in particular pathways implicated in apoptosis, including mitochondrial pathways. Predictor sets for REMS and anhedonia, one of the behavioral changes following UCMS, shared pathways involved in oxidative stress, cell proliferation and apoptosis. RNA predictor sets for non-NREMS parameters showed no overlap with other phenotypes. These novel data identify REMS as a core and early element of the response to chronic stress, and identify apoptotic pathways as a putative mechanism by which REMS mediates adaptation to stressful waking experiences.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSleep is responsive to experiences during wakefulness and is altered in stress-related disorders. Whether sleep changes primarily concern rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) or non-REM sleep, and how they correlate with stress hormones, behavioral and transcriptomic responses remained unknown. We demonstrate using unpredictable chronic (9-weeks) mild stress that REMS is the most responsive of all the measured sleep characteristics, and correlates with deficiency in corticosterone regulation. An unbiased machine learning, controlling for unspecific effects of stress, revealed that REMS correlated with RNA predictor sets enriched in apoptosis including mitochondrial pathways. Several pathways were shared with predictors of corticosterone and behavioral responses. This unbiased approach point to apoptosis as a molecular mechanism by which REMS mediates adaptation to an ecologically relevant waking experience.",

    "abstract": "Coordination of multiple propulsors can provide performance benefits in swimming organisms. Siphonophores are marine colonial organisms that orchestrate the motion of multiple swimming zooids for effective swimming. However, the kinematics at the level of individual swimming zooids (nectophores) have not been examined in detail. We used high speed, high resolution microvideography and particle image velocimetry (PIV) of the physonect siphonophore, Nanomia bijuga, to study the motion of the nectophores and the associated fluid motion during jetting and refilling. The integration of nectophore and velum kinematics allow for a high-speed (maximum ~1 m s-1), narrow (1-2 mm) jet and rapid refill as well as a 1:1 ratio of jetting to refill time. Overall swimming performance is enhanced by velocity gradients produced in the nectophore during refill, which lead to a high pressure region that produces forward thrust. Generating thrust during both the jet and refill phases augments the distance travelled by 17% over theoretical animals, which generate thrust only during the jet phase. The details of velum kinematics and associated fluid mechanics elucidate how siphonophores effectively navigate three-dimensional space and could be applied to exit flow parameters in multijet underwater vehicles.\\n\\nSummary statementColonial siphonophores produce high speed jets and generate forward thrust during refill using a flexible velum to achieve effective propulsion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMosquitoes are colonized by a large but mostly uncharacterized natural virome of RNA viruses. Anopheles mosquitoes are efficient vectors of human malaria, and the composition and distribution of the natural RNA virome may influence the biology and immunity of Anopheles malaria vector populations.\\n\\nResultsAnopheles vectors of human malaria were sampled in forest village sites in Senegal and Cambodia, including Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae group sp., and Anopheles coustani in Senegal, and Anopheles hyrcanus group sp., Anopheles maculatus group sp., and Anopheles dirus in Cambodia. Small and long RNA sequences were depleted of mosquito host and de novo assembled to yield non-redundant contigs longer than 500 nucleotides. Analysis of the assemblies by sequence similarity to known virus families yielded 125 novel virus sequences, 39 from Senegal Anopheles and 86 from Cambodia. Important monophyletic virus clades in the Bunyavirales and Mononegavirales orders are found in these Anopheles from Africa and Asia. Small RNA size and abundance profiles were used to cluster non-host RNA assemblies that were unclassified by sequence similarity. 39 unclassified non-redundant contigs >500 nucleotides strongly matched a pattern of classic RNAi processing of viral replication intermediates, and 1566 unclassified contigs strongly matched a pattern consistent with piRNAs. Analysis of piRNA expression in Anopheles coluzzii after infection with Onyong nyong virus (family Togaviridae) suggests that virus infection can specifically alter abundance of some piRNAs.\\n\\nConclusionsRNA viruses ubiquitously colonize Anopheles vectors of human malaria worldwide. At least some members of the mosquito virome are monophyletic with other arthropod viruses. However, high levels of collinearity and similarity of Anopheles viruses at the peptide level is not necessarily matched by similarity at the nucleotide level, indicating that Anopheles from Africa and Asia are colonized by closely related but clearly diverged virome members. The interplay between small RNA pathways and the virome may represent an important part of the homeostatic mechanism maintaining virome members in a commensal or nonpathogenic state, and host-virome interactions could influence variation in malaria vector competence.",

Here we present data and analyses of ChIP-seq experiments for 208 DNA-associated proteins (DAPs) in the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma line, spanning nearly a quarter of its expressed TFs, transcriptional co-factors, and chromatin regulator proteins. The DAP binding profiles classify into major groups associated predominantly with promoters or enhancers, or with both. We confirm and expand the current catalog of DNA sequence motifs; 77 factors showed similar motifs to those previously described using in vivo and/or in vitro methods, and 17 yielded novel motifs. We also describe motifs corresponding to other TFs that co-enrich with the primary ChIP target. FOX family motifs are, for example, significantly enriched in ChIP-seq peaks of 37 other DAPs. We show that promoters and enhancers can be discriminated based on motif content and occupancy patterns. This large catalog reveals High Occupancy Target (HOT) regions at which many DAPs associate, although each contains motifs for only a minority of the numerous associated DAPs. These analyses provide a deeper and more complete overview of the gene regulatory networks that define this cell type.",

We investigated brain network dynamics in a neurodevelopmental disorder of known genetic origin, by comparing individuals with ZDHHC9-associated intellectual disability to individuals with no known impairment. We used Hidden Markov Modelling on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, at rest and during auditory oddball stimulation, to characterise transient network dynamics. At rest, network dynamics distinguished the groups, with ZDHHC9 participants showing longer state activation. Crucially, ZDHHC9 gene expression levels predicted the group differences across networks, supporting an association between molecular pathology and neurophysiology. In contrast, network dynamics during auditory oddball stimulation did not show this association. We demonstrate a link between brain network dynamics and regional gene expression, and present a valuable method for understanding the real-time neural mechanisms linking genetic variation to cognitive difficulties.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous different odorant molecules in nature. Typical odors are sparse mixtures of a few types of odorant molecules each with a wide range of concentrations. However, there are only a relatively small number of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which respond to odorant concentration nonlinearly (sigmoidal) with a finite sensitivity range. Thus, how to encode a large number of sparse odor mixtures with a relatively small number of nonlinear ORNs - the nonlinear compressed sensing problem - remains a puzzle. Here, by using an information theory approach, we study the optimal coding strategies that enable nonlinear ORNs to best represent olfactory information (both the odorants identities and their concentrations) in sparse odor mixtures. Our extensive numerical simulations and analytical analysis show that the optimal odor-receptor sensitivity matrix is sparse and the nonzero sensitivities follow roughly a log-normal distribution(matching the statistics of the odorants), both of which are consistent with existing experiments. For ORNs with a finite basal activity, our study shows that co-existence of both odor-evoked excitation and inhibition increases coding capacity, which provides a plausible explanation for such co-existence observed in the fly olfactory system. Furthermore, we show that coding the inputs with the optimal sensitivity matrix can enhance accuracy of the downstream decoding and learning tasks. These general statistical properties of the optimal sensitivity matrix for nonlinear compressed sensing may shed light on understanding the peripheral olfactory sensory system and improving performance of artificial neural networks.",

However, neuron-astrocyte coupling of lipid metabolism, particularly in response to neural activity, remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that toxic, peroxidated fatty acids (FAs) produced in hyperactive neurons are transferred to astrocytic lipid droplets by lipoprotein particles. Astrocytes consume the FAs stored in lipid droplets via mitochondrial {beta}-oxidation in response to neuronal activity and turn on a detoxification gene expression program. Together, our findings reveal that FA metabolism between neurons and astrocytes is coupled in an activity-dependent manner to protect neurons from FA toxicity. This coordinated mechanism for metabolizing FAs could underlie both homeostasis and a variety of disease states of the brain.",

Because of its iterative nature, we wondered whether predictive coding could be related to brain oscillatory dynamics. First, we show that a simple 2-layers predictive coding model of visual cortex, with physiological communication delays between layers, naturally gives rise to alpha-band rhythms, similar to experimental observations. Then, we demonstrate that a multi-layer version of the same model can explain the occurrence of oscillatory travelling waves across layers, both feedforward (during visual stimulation) and backward (during rest). Remarkably, the predictions of our model are matched by the analysis of two independent EEG datasets, in which we observed oscillatory travelling waves in both directions.",

Repetitive content makes up more than one-third of this genome, and previously uncharacterized transposable elements are the most abundant type of repetitive DNA. We predicted 10,847 protein coding genes, and identify 479 of these undergoing positive directional selection with the use of population genetic analysis based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing of 19 individuals. We found evidence of recent population bottlenecks, but no significant evidence of population structure. We also identify 45 genes enriched for protein translation and folding, transcriptional regulation, and triglyceride metabolism evolving slower in alkali bees compared to other halictid bees. These resources will be useful for future studies of bee comparative genomics and pollinator health research.",
