    "abstract": "FDA approval of multiple drugs differing in chemical structures but targeting the same protein raises the question whether such drugs have sufficiently similar mechanisms of action to be considered functionally equivalent. In this paper we compare three recently approved inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4/6 - palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib - that are becoming important therapies for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast and potentially other cancers. We find that transcriptional and proteomic changes induced by the three drugs differ significantly and that abemaciclib has unique cellular activities including induction of cell death (even in pRb-deficient cells), arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and reduced drug adaptation. These activities appear to arise from inhibition of kinases other than CDK4/6 including CDK2/Cyclin A/E and CDK1/Cyclin B.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe target profiles of most drugs are established relatively early in their development and are not systematically revisited at the time of approval. Scattered reports suggest that palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib differ in pharmacokinetics, dosing, and adverse effects but the three drugs are generally regarded as similar. Our finding that the drugs differ substantially in mechanism of action - abemaciclib retains activities of the earlier-generation drug alvocidib - suggests the potential for different uses in the clinic: in particular, abemaciclib may show activity in patients progressing on palbociclib or ribociclib. More generally, our approach relying on data from five distinct phenotypic and biochemical assays strongly suggests that a multi-faceted approach is necessary to get a reliable picture the target spectrum of kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWNutrient cycling is fundamental to ecosystem functioning. Despite recent major advances in the understanding of complex food web dynamics, food web models have so far generally ignored nutrient cycling. However, nutrient cycling is expected to strongly impact food web stability and functioning. To make up for this gap, we built an allometric and size structured food web model including nutrient cycling. By releasing mineral nutrients, recycling increases the availability of limiting resources for primary producers and links each trophic level to the bottom of food webs. We found that nutrient cycling can provide a significant part of the total nutrient supply of the food web, leading to a strong enrichment effect that promotes species persistence in nutrient poor ecosystems but leads to a paradox of enrichment at high nutrient inputs. The presence of recycling loops linking each trophic level to the basal resources weakly affects species biomass temporal variability in the food web. Recycling loops tend to slightly dampen the destabilising effect of nutrient enrichment on consumer temporal variability while they have opposite effects for primary producers. By considering nutrient cycling, this new model improves our understanding of the response of food webs to nutrient availability and opens perspectives to better link studies on food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning.",

    "abstract": "Social environment influences drug consumption, its persistence and evolution. Little is known regarding the influence of the presence of a peer during drug consumption and especially how the relationship between peers (familiarity and dominance) can influence drug consumption. We used here a translational and transdisciplinary approach to explore the influence of peer presence and peer familiarity in rats and humans that self-administer stimulants. In rats, cocaine intake was compared when rats were alone with intake when peers with different characteristics (familiar or not, cocaine naive or not, dominant or subordinate) were present. In humans, 77 cocaine and/or methylphenidate users were asked to detail their most recent drug use episodes and their relationship with peers present at consumption. The results show that in both humans and rats, the risk of cocaine/stimulant consumption was significantly reduced by 37% and 32%, respectively, when a peer was present. Moreover, the lowest risk of consumption was consistently observed when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar) with a further 38% and 17% risk reduction, respectively. In rats, a decreased risk of consumption was greater when the peer was cocaine naive (vs non-cocaine naive).\\n\\nThe presence of a non-familiar and possibly drug-naive peer is the most efficient condition to diminish stimulant intake. Our results indirectly support the use of harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.",

Here, we describe an engineered system able to sense and respond to the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the most common cause of candidemia. In doing so, we identified hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA) as a novel molecule secreted by C. albicans. Furthermore, we engineered E. coli to be able to sense HPA produced by C. albicans. Finally, we constructed a sense-and-respond system by coupling the C. albicans sensor to the production of an inhibitor of hypha formation thereby reducing filamentation, virulence factor expression and fungal-induced epithelial damage.

A slightly significant rate of gene turnover was inferred. Both the number of repeats and the repeat sequence were found to diverge rapidly, even between closely related species. We also detected high repeat number variation at the intrapopulation level in D. melanogaster.\\n\\nConclusionMost conspicuous signs of accelerated evolution are found in the repeat regions of several glue genes.",

    "abstract": "The clock of life ticks as fast as how efficiently proteins could perform their functional dynamics. Protein complexes execute functions via several large-scale intrinsic motions across multiple conformational states, which occur at a timescale of nano-to milliseconds for well-folded proteins. Computationally expensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been the only theoretical tool to time and size these motions, though barely to their slowest ends. Here, we convert a simple elastic network model (ENM), which takes a few seconds (ubiquitin) to hours (ribosome) for the analysis, into a molecular timer and sizer to gauge the slowest functional motions of proteins. Quasi-harmonic analysis, fluctuation-profile matching (FPM) and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem (WKT) are used to define the \\\"time-periods\\\", t, for anharmonic principal components (PCs) which are validated by NMR order parameters. The PCs with their respective \\\"time-periods\\\" are mapped to the eigenvalues ({lambda}ENM) of the corresponding ENM modes. Thus, the power laws t(ns) = 86.9{lambda}ENM-1.9 and {sigma}2([A]2) = 46.1 {lambda}ENM-2.5 are established allowing the characterization of the time scales of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-solved conformers, crystallographic anisotropic displacement parameters, and important ribosomal motions, as well as motional sizes of the latter.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe time scale of biological processes is governed by protein functional dynamics that often corresponds to the largest conformational spread and the longest time scales among all possible motions. Current simulation methodologies cannot reach the slowest, often functional, motions especially for supramolecular machineries. Borrowing the spring-bead model used in polymer physics since 60s, the efficient elastic network model (ENM), introduced in 90s, captured all modes of protein motions but largely underestimated the time scales of slowest modes due to its harmonic approximation.\\n\\nHere we map water-damped modes sampled by MD simulations to corresponding ones in ENM and thereby establish 2 power laws that describe the authentic time scales and sizes for the slowest anharmonic modes as functions of ENM eigenvalues. With that, we adequately describe the sizes and time scales for three proteins, confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and ribosome that contains ~0.2 million heavy atoms (~ 20 thousands coarse-grained nodes).",

    "abstract": "Both reciprocity and positive assortment (like with like) are predicted to promote the evolution of cooperation, yet how partners influence each others behavior within dynamic networks is not well understood. One way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behavior (the \\\"direct effect\\\"), and plasticity within individuals in response to the social environment (the \\\"indirect effect\\\"). A positive correlation between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate social contagion and selection on cooperative behavior. Testing this hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated measures of behavior across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an automated data-logging system to quantify the behavior of 179 wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions, and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in cooperative behavior. Our results show strong positive correlations between a birds own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners, consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation. These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can facilitate selection for cooperative behavior within social networks.",

    "abstract": "The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) comprises a huge group of bacteria that have small genomes that rarely encode CRISPR-Cas systems for phage defense. Consequently, questions remain about their mechanisms of phage resistance and the nature of phage that infect them. The compact CRISPR-CasY system (Cas12d) with potential value in genome editing was first discovered in these organisms. Relatively few CasY sequences have been reported to date, and little is known about the function and activity of these systems in the natural environment. Here, we conducted a genome-resolved metagenomic investigation of hot spring microbiomes and recovered CRISPR systems mostly from Roizmanbacteria that involve CasY proteins that are divergent from published sequences. Within population diversity in the spacer set indicates current in situ diversification of most of the loci. In addition to CasY, some Roizmanbacteria genomes also encode large type I-B and/or III-A systems that, based on spacer targeting, are used in phage defense. CRISPR targeting identified three phage represented by complete genomes and a prophage, which are the first reported for bacteria of the Microgenomates superphylum. Interestingly, one phage encodes a Cas4-like protein, a scenario that has been suggested to drive acquisition of self-targeting spacers. Consistent with this, the Roizmanbacteria population that it infects has a CRISPR locus that includes self-targeting spacers and a fragmented CasY gene (fCasY). Despite gene fragmentation, the PAM sequence is the same as that of other CasY reported in this study. Fragmentation of CasY may avoid the lethality of self-targeting spacers. However, the spacers may still have some biological role, possibly in genome regulation. The findings expand our understanding of CasY diversity, and more broadly, CRISPR-Cas systems and phage of CPR bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now a widely used therapeutic strategy, its precise mechanism remains largely unclear. Since this approach is progressively extended to treat non-motor disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, the comprehension of its effects on motivated behaviors appears of the upmost importance for a possible application for addiction. In intact rats, we used inhibition and high frequency optogenetic activation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons to test whether or not we could reproduce the effects of electric deep brain stimulation on rats motivation for sweet food and cocaine. Rats motivation was assessed using fixed-ratio 5 and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement for both rewards and illumination was applied during behavioral testing. Efficiency of optogenetic manipulations has been validated using in-vitro electrophysiological recordings. Optogenetic inhibition of STN increased motivation for food and reduced motivation for cocaine. In contrast, optogenetic high frequency stimulation reduced the motivation for food without impacting motivation for cocaine. Optical inhibition mimics the effect of electric deep brain stimulation on food and cocaine motivation, confirming that the effects observed under electric DBS result from a specific inactivation of the STN. In contrast, optogenetic high frequency stimulation induces opposite effects to those of electric one, suggesting a stimulation of the STN that only seems to affect food motivation.",

    "abstract": "Endosperm misdevelopment leading to hybrid seed failure is a common cause of postzygotic isolation in angiosperms and is observed in both interploidy and homoploid crosses between closely related lineages. Moreover, parental dosage is critical for successful endosperm and seed development, typically requiring a ratio of two maternal to one paternal genome(s) in within-species crosses. The recently revived concept of  effective ploidy can largely explain the outcome of experimental crosses that (partly) ameliorate hybrid seed failure by manipulating the actual ploidy in one of the parents. However, genome-wide expression perturbations concomitant with levels of hybrid seed failure have yet to be reported. The tomato clade (Solanum section Lycopersicon), encompassing closely related diploids with partial-to-complete hybrid seed failure and diverse mating systems, provides outstanding opportunities to study these issues. Here we compared replicated endosperm transcriptomes from six crosses within and among three wild tomato lineages. Strikingly, both strongly inviable hybrid crosses displayed conspicuous, asymmetric expression perturbations with strong signatures of cross direction. In particular, Solanum peruvianum, the species inferred to have evolved higher effective ploidy than the other two, drove hybrid expression landscapes in both maternal and paternal roles. This global expression divergence was mirrored in functionally important gene families such as transcription factors and E3 ubiquitin ligases, and revealed differences in cell-cycle tuning between lineages that match phenotypic differences in developing endosperm and mature seed size between reciprocal crosses. Our work initiates the exploration of links between parental conflict, genomic imprinting, expression dosage and hybrid seed failure in flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is a fundamental process in biological systems, playing an important role for diverse physiological processes. Cells often exhibit directed migration in a specific direction in response to various types of cues. In particular, cells are able to sense the rigidity of surrounding environments and then migrate towards stiffer regions. To understand this mechanosensitive behavior called durotaxis, several computational models have been developed. However, most of the models made phenomenological assumptions to recapitulate durotactic behaviors, significantly limiting insights provided from these studies. In this study, we developed a computational biomechanical model without any phenomenological assumption to illuminate intrinsic mechanisms of durotactic behaviors of cells migrating on a two-dimensional substrate. The model consists of a simplified cell generating contractile forces and a deformable substrate coarse-grained into an irregular triangulated mesh. Using the model, we demonstrated that durotactic behaviors emerge from purely mechanical interactions between the cell and the underlying substrate. We investigated how durotactic migration is regulated by biophysical properties of the substrate, including elasticity, viscosity, and stiffness profile.",

    "abstract": "The cadherin superfamily of proteins is defined by the presence of extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats that engage in protein-protein interactions to mediate cell-cell adhesion, cell signaling, and mechanotransduction. The extracellular domains of non-classical cadherins often have a large number of EC repeats along with other subdomains of various folds. Protocadherin-15 (PCDH15), a protein component of the inner-ear tip link filament essential for mechanotransduction, has eleven EC repeats and a membrane adjacent domain (MAD12) of atypical fold. Here we report the crystal structure of a pig PCDH15 fragment including EC10, EC11, and MAD12 in a parallel dimeric arrangement. MAD12 has a unique molecular architecture and folds as a ferredoxin-like domain similar to that found in the nucleoporin protein Nup54. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments along with size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering corroborate the crystallographic dimer and show that MAD12 induces parallel dimerization of PCDH15 near its membrane insertion point. In addition, steered molecular dynamics simulations suggest that MAD12 is mechanically weak and may unfold before tip-link rupture. Sequence analyses and structural modeling predict the existence of similar domains in cadherin-23, protocadherin-24, and the \\\"giant\\\" FAT and CELSR cadherins, indicating that some of them may also exhibit MAD-induced parallel dimerization.",

    "abstract": "Pigs (Sus scrofa) exhibit diverse phenotypes in different breeds shaped by the combined effects of various local adaptation and artificial selection. To comprehensively characterize the genetic diversity of pigs, we construct a pig pan-genome by comparing genome assemblies of 11 representative pig breeds with the reference genome (Sscrofa11.1). Approximately 72.5 Mb non-redundant sequences were identified as pan-sequences which were absent from the Sscrofa11.1. On average, 41.7 kb of spurious heterozygous SNPs per individual are removed and 12.9 kb novel SNPs per individual are recovered using pan-genome as the reference for SNP calling, thereby providing enhanced resolution for genetic diversity in pigs. Homolog annotation and analysis using RNA-seq and Hi-C data indicate that these pan-sequences contain protein-coding regions and regulatory elements. These pan-sequences can further improve the interpretation of local 3D structure. The pan-genome as well as the accompanied web-based database will serve as a primary resource for exploration of genetic diversity and promote pig breeding and biomedical research.",

Reflecting this, the rapid eradication of pathogens appears to have resulted in reduced microbiome diversity and generation of chronically activated immune systems, presaging the recent rise of allergic, autoimmune and metabolic disorders. Certainly, gastrointestinal helminths can protect against gut and lung mucosa inflammatory conditions by modulating the microbiome and suppressing the chronic inflammation associated with dysbiosis. Here, we employ ES-62, an immunomodulator secreted by tissue-dwelling Acanthocheilonema viteae to show that modulation of the gut microbiome does not require live infection with gastrointestinal-based helminths nor is protection restricted to mucosal diseases. Specifically, subcutaneous administration of this defined parasitic worm product affords protection against joint disease in collagen-induced arthritis, a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, which is associated with normalisation of gut microbiota and prevention of loss of intestinal barrier integrity.",

Here, we analyze gut metagenomic data from mother-infant pairs and patients undergoing fecal microbiota transplantation to evaluate the patterns of acquisition, transmission and strain diversity of crAss-like phages. We find that crAss-like phages are rarely detected at birth but are increasingly prevalent in the infant microbiome after one month of life. We observe nearly identical genomes in 50% of cases where the same crAss-like clade is detected in both the mother and the infant, suggesting vertical transmission. In cases of putative transmission of prototypical crAssphage (p-crAssphage), we find that a subset of strains present in the mother are detected in the infant, and that strain diversity in infants increases with time. Strain diversity in the p-crAssphage population in mothers is generally low, with a median of 50 variable sites in the 97kb genome. Putative tail fiber proteins are enriched for nonsynonymous strain variation compared to other genes, suggesting a potential evolutionary benefit to maintaining strain diversity in specific genes. Finally, we show that p-crAssphage can be acquired through fecal microbiota transplantation. These results enhance our understanding of the acquisition, individual-level strain diversity, and transmission of crAss-like phages, which have emerged as some of the most successful human-associated microbes.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and simultaneous development of new efficacious ICB strategy are unmet needs for cancer immunotherapy1-5. Despite the advance of existing clinical or computational biomarkers6-10, it is very limited in explicating phenotypic variability of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs) at the single-cell level, including tumor-specificity11,12 and distinct exhaustion profiles13-16, that are crucial for the responsiveness to ICB. Here we show that a quantitative criterion, D value, for evaluating tumor-specific TIL exhaustion, identified by our new high-dimensional single-cell-based computational method, called HD-scMed, accurately predicts response to the ICB, i.e., PD-1, CTLA-4, and PD-1+CTLA-4, with the performance of AUC=100% in human tumors. D-value is the Euclidean distance from a subset of exhausted CD8+ TILs, identified as Pareto Front (PF)18-21 by HD-scMed within the high-dimensional expression space of a variety of exhaustion markers, to the baseline TILs excluded by the PF. We phenotypically distinguished two types of TIL \\\"exhaustion\\\" by the D value, namely \\\"D Extremely-high\\\" in non-responders, associating with high tumor-specificity imprinted with enhanced exhaustion and inactivated effector and cytotoxic signatures; and \\\"D low\\\" specific to responders, alternatively enriched with T cell activation and cytolytic effector T cell signatures. We also observed a large portion of \\\"D negative\\\" bystander T cells irrelevant to response. Notably, D-low TILs in clinical responders display very low LAG3 expression. To reverse the functionality of the LAG3-high TILs after receiving PD-1+CTLA-4, we combined LAG3 with PD-1+CTLA-4 in treating a murine tumor model. Remarkably, LAG3+PD-1+CTLA-4 displays extraordinary antitumor efficacy to eradicate advanced tumors, which is associated with burst GZMBhi TIL populations; whereas PD-1+CTLA-4 or PD-1+CTLA-4 plus other ICBs as control only induce moderate tumor growth inhibition. Our study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy as providing both accurate predictions of ICB response and alternative strategy to reverse ICB resistance.",

    "abstract": "Single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to discover and annotate cell types and states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, including high-dimensional immunophenotypes, chromatin accessibility, and spatial positioning, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets into a harmonized atlas that can be used to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a computational strategy to \\\"anchor\\\" diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate and compare single cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but different modalities as well. After demonstrating substantial improvement over existing methods for data integration, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq datasets to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets, and project single cell protein measurements onto a human bone marrow atlas to annotate and characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how anchoring can harmonize in-situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing for the transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns, and the identification of spatial relationships between mapped cell types in the visual cortex. Our work presents a strategy for comprehensive integration of single cell data, including the assembly of harmonized references, and the transfer of information across datasets.\\n\\nAvailability: Installation instructions, documentation, and tutorials are available at: https://www.satijalab.org/seurat",

Although FHL2 has a confirmed important role in muscle development, its autophagy-related function in muscle differentiation has not been fully determined. To explore the role of FHL2 in autophagy-related muscle regulation, FHL2-silenced and -overexpressing C2C12 mouse cells were examined. Immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assay findings showed that FHL2 silencing reduced LC3- protein expression and the amount of LC3 that co-immunoprecipitated with FHL2, indicating that FHL2 interacts with LC3- in the formation of autophagosomes. Moreover, the expression of muscle development marker genes such as MyoD1 and MyoG was lower in FHL2-silenced C2C12 cells but not in FHL2-overexpressing C2C12 cells. Electron microscopy analysis revealed large empty autophagosomes in FHL2-silenced myoblasts, while flow cytometry suggested that FHL2 silencing made cells more vulnerable to staurosporine-induced cell death. In conclusion, we propose that FHL2 interacts with LC3- in autophagosome formation to regulate the development of muscle cells.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has the potential to play a significant role in the endeavor of understanding cellular processes. However, the presence of a considerable fraction of false positives is a bottleneck in realizing this potential. There have been continuous efforts to utilize complementary resources for scoring confidence of PPIs in a manner that false positive interactions get a low confidence score. Gene Ontology (GO), a taxonomy of biological terms to represent the properties of gene products and their relations, has been widely used for this purpose. We utilize GO to introduce a new set of specificity measures: Relative Depth Specificity (RDS), Relative Node-based Specificity (RNS), and Relative Edge-based Specificity (RES), leading to a new family of similarity measures. We use these similarity measures to obtain a confidence score for each PPI. We evaluate the new measures using four different benchmarks. We show that all the three measures are quite effective. Notably, RNS and RES more effectively distinguish true PPIs from false positives than the existing alternatives. RES also shows a robust set-discriminating power and can be useful for protein functional clustering as well.",

    "abstract": "Genomic DNA of zebrafish was first digested incompletely with Msp I, and then the fragments were joined to form rearranged genomic DNA. This rearranged genomic DNA was incompletely digested with EcoR I, and the fragments were linked with a long adaptor. Two primers (Gmprimer1 and Gmprimer2) were designed according to the adaptor sequence for two-step amplification. The Gmprimer1-amplified products were microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs after purification and a red flesh mutant was observed among 42 surviving zebrafish. We obtained several introduced sequences by two-step amplification. The second set of Gmprimer2-amplified products were purified and microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs; all 37 surviving fish were red flesh mutants. We found that the largest amplified band from the mutant from the first microinjection was also present in the amplified pattern from six mutants from the second microinjection. The length of the sequence was 2,565 bp, but it did not encode any proteins. Microinjecting this sequence into fertilized zebrafish eggs produced the red flesh mutant. The sequences differed slightly among different individuals from the second microinjection. Most regions of these sequences were the same, with the exception of a hypervariable region. We mixed 10 such sequences equally and microinjected them into zebrafish zygotes; the findings showed that most zygotes died and the surviving zebrafish were almost all mutants. By genome walking, we found that the site of insertion of the fragment was the same, beginning at position 41,365,003 of the eighth chromosome, and that downstream of the introduced fragment is a conservative sequence of 6,536 bp (named Cao-sequence), starting from a small reverse repeat sequence, not encoding any gene, nor similar to any known regulatory sequence. It has 322 homologous sequences in the zebrafish genome, which are distributed in all chromosomes. We designed two primers within Cao-sequence and several primers specific for different locations upstream of it. Compared with normal zebrafish, we found that the amplified patterns of all mutants in Cao-sequence regions changed to varying degrees. To further understand the effect of the introduced sequence on the zebrafish genomes, we selected six mutants for whole-genome resequencing. The results showed that numerous Cao-sequences from these six mutants were partially deleted and the lengths of the deletions was mostly approximately 6,100 bp, being located at the 5' end of Cao-sequences. Among them, 43 Cao-sequence loci were commonly deleted from the six mutants (with slightly different locations), and the other deletion sites were not identical. We think that different deletion combinations of Cao-sequence may show different mutation characteristics. The tail part from four red flesh mutants and three individuals of wild type were collected for transcriptome sequencing. TopGO analysis showed that the 4 most significant enrichment nodes were sequence specific DNA binding proteins, sequence specific transcription factors, chromatin proteins and zinc binding proteins. The results of KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the top four affected KEGG-pathways were metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, citrate cycle and 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism.We conclude that deletion of Cao-sequence can affect the expression of a series of transcription regulators and specific DNA binding proteins, then many basic metabolic processes were disturbed which led to mutations.",

New image-construction techniques were developed to enable the use of the low-cost Bayer color sensor, to compensate for the highly aberrated re-used camera lens and to compensate for misalignments associated with the 3D-printed microscope structure. This high ratio of performance to cost is of particular interest to high-throughput microscopy applications, ranging from drug discovery and digital pathology to health screening in low-income countries. 3D models and assembly instructions of our microscope are made available for open source use.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria are not only ubiquitous on earth but can also be incredibly diverse within clean laboratories and reagents. The presence of both living and dead bacteria in laboratory environments and reagents is especially problematic when examining samples with low endogenous content (e.g. skin swabs, tissue biopsies, ice, water, degraded forensic samples, or ancient material), where contaminants can outnumber endogenous microorganisms within samples. The contribution of contaminants within high-throughput studies remains poorly understood because of the relatively low number of contaminant surveys. Here, we examined 144 negative control samples (extraction blank and no-template amplification controls) collected in both typical molecular laboratories and an ultraclean ancient DNA laboratory over five years to characterize long-term contaminant diversity. We additionally compared the contaminant content within a homemade silica-based extraction method, commonly used to analyse low-endogenous samples, with a widely used commercial DNA extraction kit. The contaminant taxonomic profile of the ultraclean ancient DNA laboratory was unique compared to the modern molecular biology laboratories, and changed over time according to researchers, month, and season. The commercial kit contained higher microbial diversity and several human-associated taxa in comparison to the homemade silica extraction protocol. We recommend a minimum of two strategies to reduce the impacts of laboratory contaminants within low-biomass metagenomic studies: 1) extraction blank controls should be included and sequenced with every batch of extractions and 2) the contributions of laboratory contamination should be assessed and reported in each high-throughput metagenomic study.",

Increasingly, attention has been focussing on antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST), allowing rapid and appropriate prescribing of antibiotics. Current AST are limited in speed as they rely on detecting growth of microorganisms. Faster AST could be enabled by the recent discovery that living bacteria manifest nano-scale fluctuations, which reduce when the bacteria die. Here, we demonstrate a direct method of visualising fluctuations within bacterial cells using Sub-Cellular Fluctuation Imaging (SCFI), which is based on Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM). We show that SCFI can measure the viability of bacterial samples within minutes, distinguishing not only between live and dead bacteria but also live bacteria in different metabolic states. Importantly, we subsequently show that SCFI can rapidly distinguish antibiotic-treated resistant and susceptible bacteria, and therefore has particular application as a rapid AST.",

    "abstract": "Physicians, nurses and allied health staff play very vital roles in addressing palliative care (PC) needs of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The healthcare professionals experiences determine the success of palliative care delivery. There is paucity of data on palliative care for PLWHA. For this reason, we assessed the knowledge, attitude and practice of palliative care for PLWHA and associated factors among health care professionals.\\n\\nWe conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study among healthcare workers (HCWs) in public health facilities in the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria between February and May, 2017. Multistage sampling technique with proportionate-to-size allocation was used to determine facility sample size and HCWs per professional discipline. Data were collected with questionnaires adapted from Palliative Care Quiz for Nursing, Frommelt Attitude toward Care of the Dying and practical questions adapted from PC standard guidelines. Univariate analysis was done to compute frequencies and proportions. Odds ratios were calculated to assess the statistical association between variables and P-value [&le;] 0.05 was considered significant. Multivariate analysis was conducted on variables that were significant with bivariate analysis. Epi-Info software was used for statistical analyses.\\n\\nThe mean age of the 348 participants was 37.5 years (SD: {+/-}8.9) and 201 (57.8%) were female. Thirty-six (10.3%) participants had good knowledge, 344 (98.9%) had favourable attitude and 90 (25.9%) had good practice of PC for PLWHA. Major determinants of good knowledge of PC include being a doctor (aOR = 2.70; 95%CI: 1.28 - 5.56). Determinants of good practice of palliative care include possessing a minimum of a bachelor degree (aOR=2.30; 95%CI : 1.05-5.08) and practicing in a tertiary hospital (aOR=6.67; 95%CI : 3.57-12.5).\\n\\nHCWs had favourable attitude towards PC for PLWHA despite an overall poor knowledge and practice. We recommended quality in-service training and continuous education on palliative care for HCWs.",

    "abstract": "Transfer entropy (TE) is a powerful algorithm which attempts to detect the transfer of information from one system to another. In neuroscience, it has the potential to track the movement of information through complex neuronal systems, and provide powerful insights into their organization and operation. One such application is the ability to infer the existence of causal connectivity (such as synaptic pathways) between neurons in a culture being recorded by micro-electrode array (MEA).\\n\\nThere are several challenges, however, in applying TE to neurological data; one of these is the ability to robustly classify what experimental TE value qualifies as significant. We find that common methods in spike train analysis such as a Z-test cannot be applied, as their assumptions are not met. Instead, we utilize surrogate data to compute a sample under the null hypothesis (no causal connection), and resample experimental data through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to create a sample of TE values under experimental conditions. A standard non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U-test) is then applied to compare these samples, and determine if they represent a significant connection.\\n\\nWe have applied this methodology to MEA recordings of neuronal cultures developing over a period of roughly a month, and find that it provides a wealth of information regarding the cultures' maturity. This includes features such as the directed graph of causal connections across the MEA and identification of information exchange centers. These results are consistent and carry a well-defined significance level.",

    "abstract": "Humans can estimate numerosities - such as the number sheep in a flock - without deliberate counting. A number of biases have been identified in these estimates, which seem primarily rooted in the spatial organization of objects (grouping, symmetry, etc). Most previous studies on the number sense used static stimuli with extremely brief exposure times. However, outside the laboratory, visual scenes are often dynamic and freely viewed for prolonged durations (e.g., a flock of moving sheep). The purpose of the present study is to examine grouping-induced numerosity biases in stimuli that more closely mimic these conditions. To this end, we designed two experiments with limited-dot-lifetime displays (LDDs), in which each dot is visible for a brief period of time and replaced by a new dot elsewhere after its disappearance. The dynamic nature of LDDs prevents subjects from counting even when they are free-viewing a stimulus under prolonged presentation. Subjects estimated the number of dots in arrays that were presented either as a single group or were segregated into two groups by spatial clustering, dot size, dot color, or dot motion. Grouping by color and motion reduced perceived numerosity compared to viewing them as a single group. Moreover, the grouping effect sizes between these two features were correlated, which suggests that the effects may share a common, feature-invariant mechanism. Finally, we find that dot size and total stimulus area directly affect perceived numerosity, which makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about grouping effects induced by spatial clustering and dot size. Our results provide new insights into biases in numerosity estimation and they demonstrate that the use of LDDs is an effective method to study the human number sense under prolonged viewing.",

    "abstract": "Advanced imaging techniques generate large datasets capable of describing the structure and kinematics of tissue spreading in embryonic development, wound healing, and the progression of many diseases. These datasets can be integrated with mathematical models to infer biomechanical properties of the system, typically identifying an optimal set of parameters for an individual experiment. However, these methods offer little information on the robustness of the fit and are generally ill-suited for statistical tests of multiple experiments. To overcome this limitation and enable efficient use of large datasets in a rigorous experimental design, we use the approximate Bayesian computation rejection algorithm to construct probability density distributions that estimate model parameters for a defined theoretical model and set of experimental data. Here, we demonstrate this method with a 2D Eulerian continuum mechanical model of spreading embryonic tissue. The model is tightly integrated with quantitative image analysis of different sized embryonic tissue explants spreading on extracellular matrix (ECM) and is regulated by a small set of parameters including forces on the free edge, tissue stiffness, strength of cell-ECM adhesions, and active cell shape changes. We find statistically significant trends in key parameters that vary with initial size of the explant, e.g., for larger explants cell-ECM adhesion forces are weaker and free edge forces are stronger. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimated parameters for one explant can be used to predict the behavior of other similarly sized explants. These predictive methods can be used to guide further experiments to better understand how collective cell migration is regulated during development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNew imaging tools and automated microscopes are able to produce terabytes of detailed images of protein activity and cell movements as tissues change shape and grow. Yet, efforts to infer useful quantitative information from these large datasets have been limited by the inability to integrate image analysis and computational models with rigorous statistical methods. In this paper, we describe a robust methodology for inferring mechanical processes that drive tissue spreading in embryonic development. Tissue spreading is critical during wound healing and the progression of many diseases including cancer. Direct measurement of biomechanical properties during spreading is not possible in many cases, but can be inferred through mathematical and statistical means. This approach identifies model parameters that are able to robustly predict results of new experiments. These methods can be integrated with more general studies of morphogenesis and to guide further experiments to better understand how tissue spreading is regulated during development and potentially control spreading during wound healing and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background: Malnourished children are more prone to infectious diseases including severe diarrhea compared to non-malnourished children. Understanding of the differences in the presentation of severe diarrhea such as cholera in children with varying nutritional status may help in the early identification and management these children. However, data are scarce on differences in the presentation in such children. Thus, we aimed to identify the clinical differentials among children with cholera with or without malnutrition.\\n\\nMethods: Data were extracted from diarrheal disease surveillance system (DDSS) of the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b for the period, January 2008 to December 2017. Among under-five children, cholera positive (culture confirmed) and malnourished children (weight-for-age, weight-for-length or height-for-age Z score (WAZ, WHZ or HAZ) <-2) were considered as the cases (n=305) and children with cholera but non-malnourished (WAZ, HAZ, and WHZ [&ge;]-2.00 to [&le;]+2.00) were the controls (n=276).\\n\\nResults: A total of 14,403 under-five children were enrolled in the surveillance system during the study period. After adjusting for potential covariates such as maternal illiteracy and slum dwelling, it was revealed that under-five malnourished children with cholera significantly more often presented to the hospital during evening hours (6 pm to 12 mid-night) (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.16-2.31, P<0.05), had fathers who were illiterate (OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.11-2.62, P<0.05), presented with history of cough within last 7 days (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.10-2.43, P<0.05), dehydrating diarrhea (OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.15-2.53, P<0.05), and had longer hospitalization (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.05-2.14, P<0.05).\\n\\nConclusions: The study results underscore the importance of understanding of the basic differences in the presentation of severe cholera in malnourished children for prompt identification and the subsequent management of these children. These observations may help policy makers in formulating better case management strategy.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMalnourished children are more vulnerable to infectious diseases including cholera in comparison to the non-malnourished children. They often have suboptimal immune function, though there is no precise information on whether there is any difference in associated factor(s) or clinical course of cholera in under-five children with varying nutritional status. Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate these insights by using the surveillance data of the Dhaka hospital of icddr,b. Among all the under-five children with cholera, 305 malnourished (WAZ or WLZ or HAZ <-2) children constituted as the cases (malnourished), and another 276 non-malnourished (WAZ, HAZ, and WHZ [&ge;]-2.00GtoG[&le;]+2.00) cholera children formed the comparison group.\\n\\nIn this study we revealed that care seeking at evening time was more common in the malnourished children with cholera compared to those without malnutrition. Dehydrating diarrhea was about two folds higher and prolonged hospitalization was frequent in malnourished children with cholera than their counterparts. These key findings may help policy makers in formulating better case management strategy in the near future.",

Each analogue showed either increased or reduced repellence compared with 4-methylguaiacol. The structural feature that was associated with the highest repellence was 4-propyl moiety in the guaiacol unit (RD75 = 0.031 for 4-propyl-2- methoxyphenol; that of 4-methylguaiacol = 0.564). Effects of blending selected analogues with high repellence were also compared. However, none of the blends showed incremental increase in repellence compared with that of 4- propyl-2-methoxyphenol.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe early use of broad-spectrum antibiotics remains the cornerstone for the treatment of neonatal late onset sepsis (LOS). However, which antibiotics should be used is still debatable, as relevant studies were conducted more than 20 years ago, were single centre or country, insufficiently powered, evaluated antibiotics not in clinical use anymore and had variable inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a major problem in many countries worldwide. We hypothesized that efficacy of meropenem as a broad spectrum antibiotic is superior to standard of care regimen (SOC) in empiric treatment of LOS and thus aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of meropenem to SOC in infants aged <90 days with LOS.\\n\\nMethods and findingsNeoMero-1 was a randomized, open-label, phase III superiority trial conducted in 18 neonatal units in 6 countries. Infants with post-menstrual age (PMA) of [&le;]44 weeks with positive blood culture and one, or those with negative culture and at least with two predefined clinical and laboratory signs suggestive of LOS, or those with PMA >44 weeks meeting the Goldstein criteria of sepsis, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive meropenem or SOC (ampicillin+gentamicin or cefotaxime+gentamicin) for 8-14 days. The primary outcome was treatment success (survival, no modification of allocated therapy, resolution/improvement of clinical and laboratory markers, no need of additional antibiotics and presumed/confirmed eradication of pathogens) at test-of-cure visit (TOC) in full analysis set. Stool samples were tested at baseline and day 28 for meropenem-resistant Gram-negative organisms (CRGNO).\\n\\nThe primary analysis was performed in all randomised patients (full analysis set) and in patients with culture confirmed LOS. Proportions of participants with successful outcome were compared by using a logistic regression model adjusted for the stratification factors.\\n\\nFrom September 3rd 2012 to November 30th 2014, in total 136 patients in each arm were randomized; 140 (52%) were culture positive. Success at TOC was achieved in 44/136 (32%) in the meropenem arm vs. 31/135 (23%) in the SOC arm (p=0.087); 17/63 (27%) vs. 10/77 (13%) in patients with positive cultures (p=0.022). The main reason of failure was modification of allocated therapy. Adverse events occurred in 72% and serious adverse events in 17% of patients, the mortality rate was 6% with no differences between study arms. Cumulative acquisition of CRGNO by day 28 occurred in 4% in the meropenem and 12% in the SOC arm (p=0.052).\\n\\nConclusionsMeropenem was not superior to SOC in terms of success at TOC, short term hearing disturbances, safety or mortality and did not outselect colonization with CRGNOs. Meropenem as broad-spectrum antibiotic should be reserved for neonates who are more likely to have Gram-negative LOS, especially in NICUs where microorganisms producing ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases are circulating.",

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were screened for insulin and EV protein using immunohistochemistry, and frozen tissue for EV genome using RT-PCR. The presence of EV protein in the pancreatic islets correlated with the presence of insulin-positive cells. Altogether 62 % of T1D and aab+ donors were positive for EV protein in pancreatic islets (only insulin-positive donors included), 40 % in duodenum and 32 % in spleen, compared to 33 %, 14 %, and 27 % of non-diabetic controls. Pancreatic lymph nodes were positive for EV protein in 60 % of T1D and aab+ cases. T1D and aab+ donors were more frequently VP1-positive in multiple organs than control donors (39 % vs. 11 %; including only insulin-positive donors). EV RNA was found in selected donors and from multiple tissue types except for duodenum, and individual T1D and aab+ donors were EV RNA-positive in multiple organs. The role of extra-pancreatic organs and their interplay with EV in T1D pathogenesis remains to be solved, but we hypothesize that these organs may serve as a reservoir for the virus which may reside in these tissues in a slow-replicating persistent form.",

Using a detailed stochastic individual-based network model of disease transmission calibrated to the HIV epidemic, we investigate population-level impact and maximum cost of an HIV vaccine to remain cost-effective.\\n\\nMethodsConsistent with the original pox-protein regimen, we model a primary series of five vaccinations meeting the goal of 50% cumulative efficacy 24 months after the first dose and include two-yearly boosters that maintain durable efficacy over 10 years. We simulate vaccination programs in South Africa starting in 2027 under various vaccine targeting and HIV treatment and prevention assumptions.\\n\\nResultsOur analysis shows that this partially effective vaccine could prevent, at catch-up vaccination with 60% coverage, up to 941,000 (15.6%) new infections between 2027 and 2047 assuming current trends of antiretroviral treatment. An impact of up to 697,000 (11.5%) infections prevented could be achieved by targeting age cohorts of highest incidence. Economic evaluation indicates that, if treatment scale-up was achieved, vaccination could be cost-effective at a total cost of less than $385 and $62 per 10-year series (cost-effectiveness thresholds of $5,691 and $750).\\n\\nConclusionsWhile a partially effective, rapidly waning vaccine could help to prevent HIV infections, it will not eliminate HIV as a public health priority in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccination is expected to be most effective under targeted delivery to age groups of highest HIV incidence. Awaiting results of trial, the introduction of vaccination should go in parallel with continued innovation in HIV prevention, including studies to determine the costs of delivery and feasibility and further research into products with greater efficacy and durability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic disease management requires the ability to link patient records across multiple interactions with the health sector. South Africas National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) conducts all routine laboratory monitoring for the countrys national public sector HIV program. However, the absence of a validated patient identifier has limited the potential of the NHLS database for epidemiological research, policy evaluation, and longitudinal patient care. We developed and validated a record linkage algorithm, creating a unique patient identifier and enabling analysis of the NHLS database as a national HIV cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first national HIV cohort in any low-or middle-income country.\\n\\nMethods.We linked data on all CD4 counts, HIV viral loads (VL), and ART workup laboratory tests from 2004-2016. Each NHLS laboratory test result is associated with a name, sex, date of birth (DOB), gender, and facility. However, due to typographical and other errors and patient mobility between facilities, different patient specimens may be associated with different sets of identifying information. We developed a graph-based probabilistic record linkage algorithm and used it to construct a unique identifier for all patients with laboratory results in the national HIV program. We used standard probabilistic linkage methods with Jaro-Winkler string comparisons and weights informed by response frequency. We also used graph concepts to guide the linkage in determining whether a cluster of patient specimens could plausibly reflect a single patient. This approach allows matching thresholds to vary with the density of the network and limits over-matching.\\n\\nTo train and validate our approach, we constructed a quasi-gold standard based on manual review of 59,000 candidate matches associated with 1000 randomly sampled specimens. These data were divided into training and validation sets. Domain weights and graph parameters were optimized using the manually matched training data.\\n\\nTo evaluate performance, we calculated the probability that a true match was correctly identified by our algorithm (sensitivity, Sen) and the probability that a match identified by our algorithm was truly a match (positive predictive value, PPV) in the manually-matched data. We also assessed validity in the full cohort using proxies for under-and over-matching and assessed sensitivity vis-a-vis national identification numbers and patient folder numbers, which were available for a sub-set of records. We compared the performance of our algorithm for exact matching and a prior identifier that had been developed by the NHLS Corporate Data Warehouse.\\n\\nResults.As of December 2016, the NHLS database contained 117 million patient specimens with a CD4, VL, or other laboratory test used in HIV care. These specimens had 63 million unique combinations of patient identifying information. From these data, our matching algorithm identified 11.6 million unique HIV patients who had at least one CD4 count or VL result. These patients 70.9 million total specimens, with a median of 3 specimens per patient (IQR 1 to 8). Sensitivity and PPV of the algorithm were estimated to be 93.7% and 98.6% in manually-matched data, compared to 64.1% and 100.0% for the existing NHLS identifier. We estimated that in 2016 there were 3.35 million patients on ART and virologically monitored, similar to the National Department of Health estimate of 3.50 million.\\n\\nConclusion.We constructed a South African National HIV Cohort by applying novel graph-based probabilistic record linkage techniques to routinely collected laboratory data, with high sensitivity and positive predictive value. Information on graph structure can guide record linkage in large populations when identifying data are limited.",

DNA methylation is a molecular mechanism that could underlie interindividual variation in mammographic density. We aimed to investigate the association between breast cancer risk-predicting mammographic density measures and blood DNA methylation. For 436 women from the Australian Mammographic Density Twins and Sisters Study and 591 women from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, mammographic density (dense area, non-dense area and percentage dense area) defined by the conventional brightness threshold was measured using the CUMULUS software, and peripheral blood DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip assay. Associations between DNA methylation at >400,000 sites and mammographic density measures adjusted for age and BMI were assessed within each cohort and pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Associations with methylation at genetic loci known to be associated with mammographic density were also examined. We found no genome-wide significant(P<10-7)association for any mammographic density measure from the meta-analysis, or from the cohort-specific analyses. None of the 299 methylation sites located at genetic loci associated with mammographic density was associated with any mammographic density measure after adjusting for multiple testing (all P>0.05/299 = 1.7 x 10-4). In summary, our study did not detect associations between blood DNA methylation, as measured by the HM450 assay, and conventional mammographic density measures that predict breast cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeThe extra-medical use of, and addiction to, prescription opioid analgesics is a growing health problem. To characterize how prescription opioid abuse develops, this study investigated the affective consequences of escalating prescription opioid use using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) reward and oxycodone intravenous self-administration (IVSA) models.\n\nExperimental ApproachMale Wistar rats were given access to oxycodone IVSA (0.15 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) in Short Access (ShA; 1 h) or Long Access (LgA; 12 h) sessions for 5 sessions/week followed by intermittent 60 h discontinuations from drug access, a novel explicit test of the negative reinforcement hypothesis. Separate groups were first trained in the ICSS procedure and then in oxycodone IVSA in 11 h LgA sessions.\n\nKey ResultsRats given LgA to oxycodone escalated their responding more than ShA rats, with further significant increases observed following each 60 h discontinuation. Pre-session brain reward thresholds increased with sequential daily LgA IVSA sessions, consistent with a growing negative affective state consequent to successive daily intoxication/abstinence cycles. A 1 h oxycodone IVSA interval was sufficient to normalize these elevated reward thresholds, as was, paradoxically, a 60 h weekend abstinence. The increase in ICSS thresholds was attenuated in a group treated with the long-acting kappa opioid antagonist norBNI prior to IVSA training.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsChanges in brain reward function during escalation of oxycodone self-administration are driven by an interplay between kappa opioid receptor-mediated negative affective state associated with escalated oxycodone intake and dynamic restoration of brain reward status during longer periods of abstinence.",

    "abstract": "Long-term plasticity mediated by NMDA receptors supports input-specific, Hebbian forms of learning at excitatory CA3-CA1 connections in the hippocampus. An additional layer of stabilizing mechanisms that act globally as well as locally over multiple time scales may be in place to ensure that plasticity occurs in a constrained manner. Here, we investigate the potential role of calcium (Ca2+) stores associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the local regulation of plasticity dynamics at individual CA1 synapses. Our study is spurred by (1) the curious observation that ER is sparsely distributed in dendritic spines, but over-represented in large spines that are likely to have undergone activity-dependent strengthening, and (2) evidence suggesting that ER motility within synapses can be rapid, and accompany activity-regulated spine remodeling. Based on a physiologically realistic computational model for ER-bearing CA1 spines, we characterize the contribution of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores to spine Ca2+ dynamics during activity patterns mimicking the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Our results suggest graded modulation of the NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity profile by ER, which selectively enhances LTD induction. We propose that spine ER can locally tune Ca2+-based plasticity on an as-needed basis, providing a braking mechanism to mitigate runaway strengthening at potentiated synapses. Our model suggests that the presence of ER in the CA1 spine may promote re-use of synapses with saturated strengths.",

    "abstract": "Low-intensity ultrasound is an emerging modality for neuromodulation. Yet, piezo-based transducers offer poor spatial confinement of excitation volume, often bigger than a few millimeters in diameter. In addition, the bulky size limits their implementation in a wearable setting and prevents integration with other experimental modalities. Here, we report spatially confined optoacoustic neural stimulation through a novel miniaturized Fiber-Optoacoustic Converter (FOC). The FOC has a diameter of 600 m and generates omnidirectional ultrasound wave locally at the fiber tip through the optoacoustic effect. We show that the optoacoustic wave can directly activate individual cultured neurons and generate intracellular Ca2+ transients. The FOC activates neurons within a radius of 500 m around the fiber tip, delivering superior spatial resolution over conventional piezo-based low-frequency transducers. Combining FOC with electrophysiology, direct and spatially confined neural stimulation of mouse brain is achieved in vivo.",

    "abstract": "After decades of study in humans and animal models, there remains a lack of consensus regarding how the action of electrical stimulation on neuronal and non-neuronal elements - e.g. neuropil, cell bodies, glial cells, etc. - leads to the therapeutic effects of neuromodulation therapies. To further our understanding of neuromodulation therapies, there is a critical need for novel methodological approaches using state-of-the-art neuroscience tools to study neuromodulation therapy in preclinical models of disease. In this manuscript we outline one such approach combining chronic behaving single-photon microendoscope recordings in a pathological mouse model with electrical stimulation of a common deep brain stimulation (DBS) target. We describe in detail the steps necessary to realize this approach, as well as discuss key considerations for extending this experimental paradigm to other DBS targets for different therapeutic indications. Additionally, we make recommendations from our experience on implementing and validating the required combination of procedures that includes: the induction of a pathological model (6-OHDA model of Parkinsons disease) through an injection procedure, the injection of the viral vector to induce GCaMP expression, the implantation of the GRIN lens and stimulation electrode, and the installation of a baseplate for mounting the microendoscope. We proactively identify unique data analysis confounds occurring due to the combination of electrical stimulation and optical recordings and outline an approach to address these confounds. In order to validate the technical feasibility of this unique combination of experimental methods, we present data to demonstrate that 1) despite the complex multifaceted surgical procedures, chronic optical recordings of hundreds of cells combined with stimulation is achievable over week long periods 2) this approach enables measurement of differences in DBS evoked neural activity between anesthetized and awake conditions and 3) this combination of techniques can be used to measure electrical stimulation induced changes in neural activity during behavior in a pathological mouse model. These findings are presented to underscore the feasibility and potential utility of minimally constrained optical recordings to elucidate the mechanisms of DBS therapies in animal models of disease.",

The structure revealed the different binding modes between IRL2500 and ET-1, and provides structural insights into its ET B-selectivity. Notably, the biphenyl group of IRL2500 penetrates into the transmembrane core proximal to D2.50, stabilizing the inactive conformation.

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is a widely-used diag-reproducibility regarding radiomic features, such as intensity, nostic image modality routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics. However, non-standardized imaging pro-tocols are commonplace, which poses a fundamental challenge in large-scale cross-center CT image analysis. One approach to address the problem is to standardize CT images using generative adversarial network models (GAN). GAN learns the data distribution of training images and generate synthesized images under the same distribution. However, existing GAN models are not directly applicable to this task mainly due to the lack of constraints on the mode of data to generate. Furthermore, they treat every image equally, but in real applications, some images are more difficult to standardize than the others. All these may lead to the lack-of-detail problem in CT image synthesis. We present a new GAN model called GANai to mitigate the differences in radiomic features across CT images captured using non-standard imaging protocols. Given source images, GANai composes new images by specifying a high-level goal that the image features of the synthesized images should be similar to those of the standard images. GANai introduces an alternative improvement training strategy to alternatively and steadily improve model performance. The new training strategy enables a series of technical improvements, including phase-specific loss functions, phase-specific training data, and the adoption of ensemble learning, leading to better model performance. The experimental results show that GANai is significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art image synthesis algorithms on CT image standardization. Also, it significantly improves the efficiency and stability of GAN model training.",

    "abstract": "The Oxford MinION, the first commercial nanopore sequencer, is also the first to implement molecule-by-molecule real-time selective sequencing or \"Read Until\". As DNA transits a MinION nanopore, real-time pore current data can be accessed and analyzed to provide active feedback to that pore. Fragments of interest are sequenced by default, while DNA deemed non-informative is rejected by reversing the pore bias to eject the strand, providing a novel means of background depletion and/or target enrichment. In contrast to the previously published pattern-matching Read Until approach, our RUBRIC method is the first example of real-time selective sequencing where on-line basecalling enables alignment against conventional nucleic acid references to provide the basis for sequence/reject decisions. We evaluate RUBRIC performance across a range of optimizable parameters, apply it to mixed human/bacteria and CRISPR/Cas9-cut samples, and present a generalized model for estimating real-time selection performance as a function of sample composition and computing configuration.",

    "abstract": "Renal functional units known as nephrons undergo patterning events during development that create a segmental array of cellular populations with discrete physiological tasks. Knowledge about the terminal differentiation programs of each nephron segment has central importance for understanding kidney disease and to advance regenerative medicine, as mammalian nephrons grown in organoid cultures from pluripotent cells fail to terminally differentiate. Here, from a novel forward genetic screen using zebrafish we report the discovery that transcription factor AP-2 alpha (tfap2a) coordinates a gene regulatory network that controls the progression of nephron distal segment progenitors into the differentiated state. Overexpression of tfap2a rescued differentiation in mutants and caused ectopic expression of distal segment markers in wild-type nephrons, indicating tfap2a is sufficient to instigate the distal segment differentiation program. tfap2a/2b deficiency exacerbated distal nephron segment differentiation defects, revealing functional redundancy where tfap2a has a dominant role upstream of its family member. With further genetic studies, we assembled a blueprint of the tfap2a gene regulatory network during nephrogenesis. We demonstrate that tfap2a acts downstream of Iroquois homeobox 3b, a conserved distal lineage transcription factor. tfap2a controls a circuit consisting of irx1a, tfap2b, and genes encoding solute transporters that dictate the specialized metabolic functions of the distal nephron segments, and we show for the first time that this regulatory node is distinct from the pathway circuits controlling aspects such as apical-basal polarity and ciliogenesis during the differentiation process. Thus, our studies reveal new insights into the genetic control of differentiation, where tfap2a regulates the suite of segment transporter traits. These findings have relevance for understanding renal birth defects, as well as efforts to recapitulate nephrogenesis in vivo to make functional units that can facilitate organoid applications such as drug discovery and regenerative therapies.\\n\\nSummary StatementHere, we report for the first time that transcription factor AP-2 alpha (tfap2a) controls the progression from nephron progenitor into the fully differentiated state. This fundamentally deepens our knowledge about the genetic control of kidney development.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change is rapidly altering coastal marine ecosystems important for food production. A comprehensive understanding of how organisms will respond to these complex environmental changes can come only from observing and studying species within their natural environment. To this end, the effects of environmental drivers -- pH, dissolved oxygen content, salinity, and temperature -- on Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) physiology were evaluated in an outplant experiment. Sibling juvenile oysters were outplanted to eelgrass and unvegetated habitat at five different estuarine sites within the Acidification Nearshore Monitoring Network in Washington State, USA to evaluate how regional environmental drivers influence molecular physiology. Within each site, we also determined if eelgrass presence that buffered pH conditions changed the oysters expressed proteome. A novel, two-step, gel-free proteomic approach was used to identify differences in protein abundance in C. gigas ctenidia tissue after a 29 day outplant by 1) identifying proteins in a data independent acquisition survey step and 2) comparing relative quantities of targeted environmental response proteins using selected reaction monitoring. While there was no difference in protein abundance detected between habitats or among sites within Puget Sound, C. gigas outplanted at Willapa Bay had significantly higher abundances of antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperones. Environmental factors at Willapa Bay, such as higher average temperature, may have driven this protein abundance pattern. These findings generate a suite of new hypotheses for lab and field experiments to compare the effects of regional conditions on physiological responses of marine invertebrates.",

Organization of these components lends spatial organization to the biofilm community such that biofilm residents can benefit from the production of common goods, while being protected from exogenous insults. Spatial organization is driven by the presence of chemical gradients, such as oxygen. Here we quantified and localized the expression of two Escherichia coli cytochrome oxidases in cells found in the biofilm state and defined their contribution to biofilm architecture. These studies elucidated a role for the high-affinity quinol oxidase cytochrome bd in matrix production and biofilm resident protection. Cytochrome bd was the most abundantly expressed respiratory complex in the biofilm community and was localized in the biofilm interior. Depletion of the cytochrome bd-expressing subpopulation led to decreased extracellular matrix and increased sensitivity of the community to exogenous stresses. Interrogation of the distribution of cytochrome oxidases in the planktonic state revealed that [~]15% of the population expresses cytochrome bd at atmospheric oxygen concentration, and this population dominates during acute urinary tract infection. These data point towards a bet-hedging mechanism in which heterogeneous expression of respiratory complexes ensures respiratory plasticity of E. coli across diverse host niches.",

Recent technological developments in single-cell analysis have enabled high-throughput profiling of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and spatial relationships amongst cells in complex tissues, but computational approaches that deliver a sensitive and specific joint analysis of these datasets are lacking. We developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity, allowing flexible modeling of highly heterogeneous single-cell datasets. We demonstrated its broad utility by applying it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined both cell-type-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, an anatomically complex brain region that plays important roles in sex-specific behaviors. Second, we analyzed gene expression in the substantia nigra of seven postmortem human subjects, comparing cell states in specific donors, and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we jointly leveraged in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we integrated mouse cortical scRNA-seq profiles with single-cell DNA methylation signatures, revealing mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene regulation. Integrative analyses using the LIGER algorithm promise to accelerate single-cell investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) estimation methods are extensively used in neuroimaging to measure brain inter-regional interactions. The weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and the weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (wSMI) represent relatively robust exemplars of spectral (wPLI) and information-theoretic (wSMI) connectivity measures that recently gained increased popularity due to their relative immunity to volume conduction. wPLI and wSMI are posited to have different sensitivity to linear and nonlinear relationships between neural sources, but their performance has never been directly compared. Here, using simulated high-density (hd-)EEG data, we evaluated the accuracy of these two metrics for detecting distinct types of regional interdependencies characterised by different combinations of linear and nonlinear components. Our results demonstrate that while wPLI performs generally better at detecting functional couplings presenting a mixture of linear and nonlinear interdependencies, only wSMI is able to detect exclusively nonlinear interaction dynamics. To evaluate the potential impact of these differences on real experimental data, we computed wPLI and wSMI connectivity in hd-EEG recordings of 12 healthy adults obtained in wakefulness and deep (N3-)sleep. While both wPLI and wSMI revealed a relative decrease in alpha-connectivity during sleep relative to wakefulness, only wSMI identified a relative increase in theta-connectivity, while wPLI detected an increase in delta-connectivity, likely reflecting the occurrence of traveling slow waves. Overall, our findings indicate that wPLI and wSMI provide distinct but complementary information about functional brain connectivity, and that their combined use could advance our knowledge of neural interactions underlying different behavioural states.",

    "abstract": "The mirror neuron network (MNN) has been proposed as a neural substrate of action understanding. Electroencephalography (EEG) mu suppression has commonly been studied as an index of MNN activity during execution and observation of hand and finger movements. However, in order to establish its role in higher order processes, such as recognising and sharing emotions, more research using social emotional stimuli is needed. The current study aims to contribute to our understanding of the sensitivity of mu suppression to facial expressions. Modulation of the mu and occipital alpha (8 - 13 Hz) rhythms was calculated in 22 participants while they observed dynamic video stimuli, including emotional (happy and sad) and neutral (mouth opening) facial expressions, and non-biological stimulus (kaleidoscope pattern). Across the four types of stimuli, only the neutral face was associated with a significantly stronger mu suppression than the non-biological stimulus. Occipital alpha suppression was significantly greater in the non-biological stimulus than all the face conditions. Source estimation (sLORETA) analysis comparing the neural sources of mu/alpha modulation between neutral face and non-biological stimulus showed more suppression in the central regions, including the supplementary motor and somatosensory areas, than the more posterior regions. EEG and source estimation results may indicate that reduced availability of emotional information in the neutral face condition requires more sensorimotor engagement in deciphering emotion-related information than the full-blown happy or sad expressions that are more readily recognised.",

    "abstract": "Copy-number variants (CNVs) are a major cause of several genetic disorders, making their detection an essential component of genetic analysis pipelines. Current methods for detecting CNVs from exome sequencing data are limited by high false positive rates and low concordance due to the inherent biases of individual algorithms. To overcome these issues, calls generated by two or more algorithms are often intersected using Venn-diagram approaches to identify \\\"high-confidence\\\" CNVs. However, this approach is inadequate, as it misses potentially true calls that do not have consensus from multiple callers. Here, we present CN-Learn, a machine-learning framework (https://github.com/girirajanlab/CN_Learn) that integrates calls from multiple CNV detection algorithms and learns to accurately identify true CNVs using caller-specific and genomic features from a small subset of validated CNVs. Using CNVs predicted by four exome-based CNV callers (CANOES, CODEX, XHMM and CLAMMS) from 503 samples, we demonstrate that CN-Learn identifies true CNVs at higher precision (~90%) and recall (~85%) rates while maintaining robust performance even when trained with minimal data (~30 samples). CN-Learn recovers twice as many CNVs compared to individual callers or Venn diagram-based approaches, with features such as exome capture probe count, caller concordance and GC content providing the most discriminatory power. In fact, about 58% of all true CNVs recovered by CN-Learn were either singletons or calls that lacked support from at least one caller. Our study underscores the limitations of current approaches for CNV identification and provides an effective method that yields high-quality CNVs for application in clinical diagnostics.",

Our results reveal that the combination of neural responses from VTC face- and body-selective regions more accurately explains behavioral categorization than neural responses from either region alone. Furthermore, we built a model that predicts a persons behavioral performance using estimated parameters of brain-behavioral relationships from a different group of people. We further show that this brain-behavioral model generalizes to adjacent face- and body-selective regions in lateral occipito-temporal cortex. Thus, while face- and body-selective regions are located within functionally-distinct domain-specific networks, cortically adjacent regions from both networks likely integrate neural responses to resolve competing and perceptually ambiguous information from both categories.",

    "abstract": "Cantharidin (CTD) is a potent anticancer small molecule produced by several species of blister beetle. It has been a traditional medicine for the treatment of warts and tumors for many decades. CTD suppresses the tumor growth by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA damage. It is a known inhibitor of PP2A and PP1. In this study, we identified new molecular targets of CTD using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism which expresses a Cantharidin Resistance Gene (CRG1). CRG1 encodes a SAM-dependent methyltransferase that inactivates CTD by methylation. CTD alters lipid homeostasis, cell wall integrity, endocytosis, adhesion, and invasion in yeast cells. We found that CTD specifically affects the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) associated functions which can be rescued by supplementation of ethanolamine (ETA) in the growth media. CTD also perturbed ER homeostasis and cell wall integrity by altering the GPI-anchored protein sorting. The CTD dependent genetic interaction profile of CRG1 revealed that Cdc1 activity in GPI-anchor remodeling is the key target of CTD, which we found to be independent of PP2A and PP1. Furthermore, our experiments with human cells suggest that CTD functions through a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes as well. Altogether, we conclude that CTD induces cytotoxicity by targeting Cdc1 activity in GPI-anchor remodeling in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundC4 photosynthesis is a remarkable complex trait, elucidations of the evolutionary trajectory of C4 photosynthesis from its ancestral C3 pathway can help us to better understand the generic principles of complex trait evolution and guide engineering of C3 crops for higher yields. We used the genus Flaveria that contains C3, C3-C4, C4-like and C4 species as a system to study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis.\\n\\nResultsWe mapped transcript abundance, protein sequence, and morphological features to the phylogenetic tree of the genus Flaveria, and calculated the evolutionary correlation of different features. Besides, we predicted the relative changes of ancestral nodes of those features to illustrate the key stages during the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Gene expression and protein sequence showed consistent modification pattern along the phylogenetic tree. High correlation coefficients ranging from 0.46 to 0.9 among gene expression, protein sequence and morphology were observed, and the greatest modification of those different features consistently occurred at the transition between C3-C4 species and C4-like species.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data shows highly coordinated changes in gene expression, protein sequence and morphological features. Besides, our results support an obviously evolutionary jump during the evolution of C4 metabolism.",

    "abstract": "A bacteriums ability to thrive in the presence of multiple environmental stressors simultaneously determines its resilience. We showed that activation of the SigB-controlled general stress response by mild environmental or nutritional stress provided significant cross-protection to subsequent lethal oxidative, disulfide and nitrosative stress exposure. SigB activation is mediated via the stressosome and RsbP, the main conduits of environmental and nutritional stress, respectively. Cells exposed to mild environmental stress while lacking the major stressosome components RsbT or RsbRA were highly sensitive to subsequent oxidative stress, whereas rsbRB, rsbRC, rsbRD and ytvA null mutants showed a spectrum of sensitivity, confirming their redundant roles and suggesting they could modulate the signal generated by environmental stress or oxidative stress. Furthermore, from mutant analysis we infer that RsbRA phosphorylation by RsbT was important for this cross-resistance to oxidative stress. By contrast, cells encountering stationary phase stress required RsbP but not RsbT to survive subsequent oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide and diamide. Interestingly, optimum cross-protection against nitrosative stress caused by SNP required SigB but not the known regulators, RsbT and RsbP, suggesting an additional and as yet uncharacterized route of SigB activation independent of the known environmental and energy-stress pathways. Together, these results provide a mechanism for how Bacillus subtilis promotes enhanced resistance against lethal oxidative stress during likely physiologically relevant conditions such as mild environmental or nutrient stress.",

I argue that the biggest deficiency of bar plots (and other mean-and-error plots) is that they fail to directly communicate modeled effects and uncertainty, and dot and box plots do not address this deficiency. A Harrell plot combines a forest plot of modeled treatment effects and uncertainty, a dot plot of raw data, and a box plot of the distribution of the raw data into a single, two-part graph. A Harrell plot encourages best practices such as communication of the distribution of the data and a focus on effect size and uncertainty, while discouraging poor practices such as hiding distributions and focusing on p-values.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) mediates clearance of circulating lipoproteins from blood by binding to ApoE receptors. Humans express three genetic variants, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, that exhibit distinct ApoE receptor binding properties. In brain, ApoE is abundantly produced by activated astrocytes and microglia, and three variants differentially affect Alzheimers disease (AD), such that ApoE2 protects against, and ApoE4 predisposes to the disease. A role for ApoE4 in driving microglial dysregulation and impeding A{beta} clearance in AD is well documented, but the direct effects of three variants on neurons are poorly understood. Extending previous studies, we here demonstrate that ApoE variants differentially activate multiple neuronal signaling pathways and regulate synaptogenesis. Specifically, using human neurons cultured in the absence of glia to exclude indirect glial mechanisms, we show that ApoE broadly stimulates signal transduction cascades which among others enhance synapse formation with an ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2 potency rank order, paralleling the relative risk for AD conferred by these variants. Unlike the previously described induction of APP transcription, however, ApoE-induced synaptogenesis involves CREB rather than cFos activation. We thus propose that in brain, ApoE acts as a glia-secreted paracrine signal and activates neuronal signaling pathways in what may represent a protective response, with the differential potency of ApoE variants causing distinct levels of chronic signaling that may contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Although techniques for non-invasive brain stimulation are under intense investigation, an approach that has received limited attention is transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM), the delivery of near-infrared light to the brain with a laser directed at the scalp. Here we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in n = 20 healthy humans while concurrently stimulating their right frontal pole with a near-infrared laser. We failed to detect an evoked BOLD response at illumination. However, functional connectivity with the illuminated region increased by an average of 10% during stimulation, with some connections strengthening by as much as 40%. 23% of connections with the illuminated region experienced a significant acute increase, with the time course of connectivity exhibiting a sharp rise at illumination onset. Brain-wide connectivity increases were also observed, with connections in the stimulated hemisphere showing a significantly larger increase than those in the non-stimulated hemisphere. We subsequently employed MR Thermometry to measure brain temperature during tPBM (separate cohort, n = 20), and found no significant temperature differences between active and sham stimulation. Our findings suggest that near-infrared light synchronizes brain activity with a non-thermal mechanism, underscoring the promise of tPBM as a new technique for stimulating brain function.",

We observed that substantial portion of the naive CD8 T cell repertoire expressed granzyme B and became pre-mitotic cytotoxic cells (PMCs) immediately in response to Listeria monocytogenes or Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. The surprising breadth arose from sufficiency of low potency peptide-MHC to induce granzyme B expression in the context of infection. PMCs killed antigen bearing dendritic cells (DCs) in a granzyme B-dependent but largely perforinindependent fashion between 1-2 days post infection. This terminated antigen presentation at 3 days and resulted in reduced clonal expansion. As additional consequences, we highlight that PMCs reduced the burden of DC-borne infectious agents, but also opened a window of vulnerability for secondary infection. Thus, PMCs serve antigen-specific, regulatory and host defence functions, that are innate-like in scale, at the onset of the adaptive immune response.",

    "abstract": "Theory and simulations predicted sometime ago that the sizes of unfolded states of globular proteins should decrease continuously as the denaturant concentration is shifted from a high to a low value. However, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data were used to assert the opposite, while interpretation of single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer experiments (FRET) supported the theoretical predictions. The disagreement between the two experiments is the SAXS-FRET controversy. By harnessing recent advances in SAXS and FRET experiments and setting these findings in the context of a general theory and simulations, we establish that compaction of unfolded states is universal. The theory also predicts that proteins rich in {beta}-sheets are more collapsible than -helical proteins. Because the extent of compaction is small, experiments have to be accurate and their interpretations should be as model free as possible. Theory also suggests that collapsibility itself could be a physical restriction on the evolution of foldable sequences, and provides a physical basis for the origin of multi-domain proteins.",

    "abstract": "In phylogenetic inference we commonly use models of substitution which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible and homogeneous (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic datasets. We show that many partitions (39.5%) reject the SRH assumptions, and that for most datasets, the topologies of trees inferred from all partitions differ significantly from those inferred using the subset of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior to tree reconstruction. They also suggest that further effort in developing models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq methods are being increasingly applied in complex study designs, which involve measurements of many samples, commonly spanning multiple individuals, conditions, or tissue compartments. Joint analysis of such extensive, and often heterogeneous, sample collections requires a way of identifying and tracking recurrent cell subpopulations across the entire collection. Here we describe a flexible approach, called Conos (Clustering On Network Of Samples), that relies on multiple plausible inter-sample mappings to construct a global graph connecting all measured cells. The graph can then be used to propagate information between samples and to identify cell communities that show consistent grouping across broad subsets of the collected samples. Conos results enable investigators to balance between resolution and breadth of the detected subpopulations. In this way, it is possible to focus on the fine-grained clusters appearing within more similar subsets of samples, or analyze coarser clusters spanning broader sets of samples in the collection. Such multi-resolution joint clustering provides an important basis for downstream analysis and interpretation of sizeable multi-sample single-cell studies and atlas-scale collections.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive models are a fundamental tool in computational neuroscience, embodying in software precise hypotheses about the algorithms by which the brain gives rise to behavior. The development of such models is often a hypothesis-first process, drawing on inspiration from the literature and the creativity of the individual researcher to construct a model, and afterwards testing the model against experimental data. Here, we adopt a complementary approach, in which richly characterizing and summarizing the patterns present in a dataset reveals an appropriate cognitive model, without recourse to an a priori hypothesis. We apply this approach to a large behavioral dataset from rats performing a dynamic reward learning task. The revealed model suggests that behavior in this task can be understood as a mixture of three components with different timescales: a quick-learning reward-seeking component, a slower-learning perseverative component, and a very slow \"gamblers fallacy\" component.",

Here we quantify for the first time whole-brain XCI at single-cell resolution and discover a preferential inactivation of paternal to maternal X at [~]60:40 ratio, which surprisingly impacts disease penetrance. In Fragile-X-syndrome mouse model, Fmr1-KO allele transmitted maternally in [~]60% brain cells causes phenotypes, but paternal transmission in [~]40% cells is unexpectedly tolerated. In the affected maternal Fmr1-KO(m)/+ mice, local XCI variability within distinct brain networks further determines sensory versus social manifestations, revealing a stochastic source of X-linked phenotypic diversity. Taken together, our data show that a modest [~]60% bias favoring the healthy allele is sufficient to ameliorate X-linked phenotypic penetrance, suggesting that conclusions of many clinical XCI studies using the 80-90% threshold should be re-evaluated. Furthermore, the paternal origin of the XCI bias points to a novel evolutionary mechanism acting to counter the higher rate of de novo mutations in male germiline11-16. Finally, the brain capacity to tolerate a major genetic lesion in [~]40% cells is also relevant for interpreting other neurodevelopmental genetic conditions, such as brain somatic mosaicism.",
