    "abstract": "BackgroundThe viral component of microbial communities play a vital role in driving bacterial diversity, facilitating nutrient turnover and shaping community composition. Despite their importance, the vast majority of viral sequences are poorly annotated and share little or no homology to reference databases. As a result, investigation of the viral metagenome (virome) relies heavily on de novo assembly of short sequencing reads to recover compositional and functional information. Metagenomic assembly is particularly challenging for virome data, often resulting in fragmented assemblies and poor recovery of viral community members. Despite the essential role of assembly in virome analysis and difficulties posed by these data, current assembly comparisons have been limited to subsections of virome studies or bacterial datasets.\\n\\nDesignThis study presents the most comprehensive virome assembly comparison to date, featuring 16 metagenomic assembly approaches which have featured in human virome studies. Assemblers were assessed using four independent virome datasets, namely; simulated reads, two mock communities, viromes spiked with a known phage and human gut viromes.\\n\\nResultsAssembly performance varied significantly across all test datasets, with SPAdes (meta) performing consistently well. Performance of MIRA and VICUNA varied, highlighting the importance of using a range of datasets when comparing assembly programs. It was also found that while some assemblers addressed the challenges of virome data better than others, all assemblers had limitations. Low read coverage and genomic repeats resulted in assemblies with poor genome recovery, high degrees of fragmentation and low accuracy contigs across all assemblers. These limitations must be considered when setting thresholds for downstream analysis and when drawing conclusions from virome data.",

    "abstract": "Allopolyploidy has played a major role in plant evolution but its impact on genome diversity and expression patterns remains to be understood. Some studies found important genomic and transcriptomic changes in allopolyploids, whereas others detected a strong parental legacy and more subtle changes. The allotetraploid C. bursa-pastoris originated around 100,000 years ago and one could expect the genetic polymorphism of the two subgenomes to become more similar and their transcriptomes to start functioning together. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the genomes and the transcriptomes (three tissues) of allote-traploid C. bursa-pastoris and its parental species, the outcrossing C. grandiflora and the self-fertilizing C. orientalis. Comparison of the divergence in expression between subgenomes, on the one hand, and divergence in expression between the parental species, on the other hand, indicated a strong parental legacy with a majority of genes exhibiting a conserved pattern and cis-regulation. However, a large proportion of the genes that were differentially expressed between the two subgenomes, were also under trans-regulation reflecting the establishment of a new regulatory pattern. Parental dominance varied among tissues: expression in flowers was closer to that of C. orientalis and expression in root and leaf to that of C. grandiflora. Since deleterious mutations accumulated preferentially on the C. orientalis subgenome, the bias in expression towards C. orientalis observed in flowers suggests that expression changes could be adaptive and related to the selfing syndrome, while biases in the roots and leaves towards the C. grandiflora subgenome may be reflective of the differential genetic load.",

    "abstract": "When many gametes compete to fertilize a limited number of compatible gametes, sexual selection will favour traits that increase competitive success during mating. In animals and plants, sperm and pollen competition have yielded many interesting adaptations for improved mating success. In fungi, similar processes have not been shown directly yet. We test the hypothesis that sexual selection can increase competitive fitness during mating, using experimental evolution in the mushroom-forming fungus Schizophyllum commune (Basidiomycota). Mating in mushroom fungi occurs by donation of nuclei to a mycelium. These fertilizing  male nuclei migrate through the receiving  female mycelium. In our setup, an evolving population of nuclei was serially mated with a non-evolving female mycelium for 20 sexual generations. From the twelve tested evolved lines, four had increased and one had decreased fitness relative to an unevolved competitor. Even though only two of those five remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, for all five lines we found a correlation between the efficiency with which the female mycelium is accessed and fitness, providing additional circumstantial evidence for fitness change in those five lines. In two lines, fitness change was also accompanied by increased spore production. The one line with net reduced competitive fitness had increased spore production, but reduced fertilisation efficiency. We did not find trade-offs between male reproductive success and other fitness components. We compare these findings with examples of sperm and pollen competition and show that many similarities between these systems and nuclear competition in mushrooms exist.",

Here we report the discovery of a novel Rickettsiales bacterium associated with Paramecium, displaying a unique extracellular lifestyle, including the ability to replicate outside host cells. Genomic analyses show that the bacterium possesses a higher capability to synthesize amino acids, compared to all investigated Rickettsiales. Considering these observations, phylogenetic and phylogenomic reconstructions, and re-evaluating the different means of interaction of Rickettsiales bacteria with eukaryotic cells, we propose an alternative scenario for the evolution of intracellularity in Rickettsiales. According to our reconstruction, the Rickettsiales ancestor would have been an extracellular and metabolically versatile bacterium, while obligate intracellularity and genome reduction would have evolved later in parallel and independently in different sub-lineages. The proposed new scenario could impact on the open debate on the lifestyle of the last common ancestor of mitochondria within Alphaproteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Large African barbs of the genus Labeobarbus are widely distributed in African freshwaters, and exhibit profound phenotypic plasticity that could be a prerequisite for adaptive radiation. Using morphological, molecular, and stable isotope analyses, we investigated whether an adaptive radiation has occurred in a riverine assemblage of the L. gananensis complex. This complex is composed of six phenotypically distinct sympatric forms inhabiting the Genale River (Ethiopian highlands, East Africa). Of the six forms, five were divergent in their mouth morphology, corresponding to  generalized,  lipped,  scraping (two forms) and  large-mouthed phenotypes. Stable isotope analysis revealed differences in 15N and 13C among these forms, representing different foraging strategies (omnivorous, scraping and piscivorous). Phylogenetic analysis of two mtDNA markers confirmed the monophyly of L. gananensis, suggesting an intra-riverine radiation. However, the Genale assemblage appears to have originated through a combination of allopatric and sympatric events. Some of the specialized forms within this drainage originated independently from the local generalized forms in three different river regions within local  mini-flocks composed of two to three sympatric forms. Our study shows that adaptive radiation in rivers can be enhanced by a combination of sympatric speciation and temporal geographic isolation, leading to local sympatric speciation followed by migration.",

    "abstract": "In the era of CRISPR gene editing and genetic screening, there is an increasing demand for quick and reliable nucleic acid extraction pipelines for rapid genotyping of large and diverse sample sets. Despite continuous improvements of current workflows, the handling-time and material costs per sample remain the major limiting factors. Here we present a robust method for low-cost DIY-pipet tips addressing these needs; i.e. using a cellulose filter disc inserted into a regular pipet tip. These filter-in-tips allow for a rapid, stand-alone three-step genotyping workflow by simply binding the DNA contained in the primary lysate to the cellulose filter, washing it in water and eluting it directly into the buffer for the downstream application (e.g. PCR). This drastically cuts down processing time to maximum 30 seconds per sample, with the potential for parallelizing and automation. We show the ease and sensitivity of our procedure by genotyping genetically modified medaka and zebrafish embryos (targeted CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out and knock-in) in a 96-well plate format. The robust isolation and detection of multiple alleles of various abundancies in a mosaic genetic background allows phenotype-genotype correlation already in the injected generation, demonstrating the reliability and sensitivity of the filter-in-tips. Furthermore, our method is applicable across kingdoms with samples ranging from cells to tissues (e.g. plant seedlings, adult flies, mouse cell culture and tissue as well as adult fish fin-clips).",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells are surrounded by cell wall, whose main component is peptidoglycan (PG), a macromolecule that withstands the internal turgor of the cell. PG composition can vary considerably between species. The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus possesses highly crosslinked PG due to the presence of cross bridges containing five glycines, which are synthesised by the FemXAB protein family. FemX adds the first glycine of the cross bridge, while FemA and FemB add the second and the third, and the fourth and the fifth glycines, respectively. Of these, FemX was reported to be essential. To investigate the essentiality of FemAB, we constructed a conditional S. aureus mutant of the femAB operon. Depletion of femAB was lethal, with cells appearing as pseudomulticellular forms that eventually lyse due to extensive membrane rupture. This deleterious effect was mitigated by drastically increasing the osmolarity of the medium, indicating that pentaglycine crosslinks are required for S. aureus cells to withstand internal turgor. Despite the absence of canonical membrane targeting domains, FemA has been shown to localise at the membrane. To study its mechanism of localisation, we constructed mutants in key residues present in the putative transferase pocket and the 6 helix of FemA, possibly involved in tRNA binding. Mutations in the 6 helix led to a sharp decrease in protein activity in vivo and in vitro but did not impair correct membrane localisation, indicating that FemA activity is not required for localisation. Our data indicates that, contrarily to what was previously thought, S. aureus cells do not survive in the absence of a pentaglycine cross bridge.",

    "abstract": "The diverse subtypes of excitatory neurons that populate the neocortex are born from progenitors located in the ventricular zone (apical progenitors, APs). During corticogenesis, APs progress through successive temporal states to sequentially generate deep- followed by superficial-layer neurons directly or via the generation of intermediate progenitors (IPs). Yet little is known about the plasticity of AP temporal identity and whether individual progenitor subtypes remain multipotent throughout corticogenesis. To address this question, we used FlashTag (FT), a method to pulse-label and isolate APs in the mouse neocortex with high temporal resolution to fate-map neuronal progeny following heterochronic transplantation of APs into younger embryos. We find that unlike daughter IPs, which lose the ability to generate deep layer neurons when transplanted into a younger host, APs are temporally uncommitted and become molecularly respecified to generate normally earlier-born neuron types. These results indicate that APs are multipotent cells that are able to revert their temporal identity and re-enter past molecular and neurogenic states. AP fate progression thus occurs without detectable fate restriction during the neurogenic period of corticogenesis. These findings identify unforeseen cell-type specific differences in cortical progenitor fate plasticity, which could be exploited for neuroregenerative purposes.",

Invasively-measured brain activity (electrocorticography; ECoG) supplies the necessary temporal and spatial resolution to decode fast and complex processes such as speech production. A number of impressive advances in speech decoding using neural signals have been achieved in recent years, but the complex dynamics are still not fully understood. However, it is unlikely that simple linear models can capture the relation between neural activity and continuous spoken speech.\\n\\nApproachHere we show that deep neural networks can be used to map ECoG from speech production areas onto an intermediate representation of speech (logMel spectrogram). The proposed method uses a densely connected convolutional neural network topology which is well-suited to work with the small amount of data available from each participant.\\n\\nMain resultsIn a study with six participants, we achieved correlations up to r = 0.69 between the reconstructed and original logMel spectrograms. We transfered our prediction back into an audible waveform by applying a Wavenet vocoder. The vocoder was conditioned on logMel features that harnessed a much larger, pre-existing data corpus to provide the most natural acoustic output.\\n\\nSignificanceTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that high-quality speech has been reconstructed from neural recordings during speech production using deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Body movements drop with sleep and this behavioural signature is widely exploited to infer sleep duration. However, a reduction in body movements may also occur in periods of intense cognitive activity and the ubiquitous use of smartphones may capture these wakeful periods otherwise hidden in the standard measures of sleep. Here we continuously captured the gross body movements using standard wrist-worn accelerometers to quantify sleep (actigraphy) and logged the timing of the day-to-day touchscreen events ( tappigraphy). Using these measures, we addressed how the gross body movements overlap with the cognitively engaging digital behaviour (from n = 84 individuals, accumulating 1384 nights). We find that smartphone use was distributed across a broad spectrum of physical activity levels but consistently peaked at rest. We estimated the putative sleep onset and wake-up times from the actigraphy data to find that these times were well correlated to the estimates from tappigraphy (R2 = 0.9 for sleep onset and wake-up time). However, actigraphy overestimated sleep as virtually all of the users used their phones during the putative sleep period. Interestingly, the probability of touches remained greater than zero for ~ 2 h after the putative sleep onset and ~ 2 h before the putative wake-up time. Our findings suggest that touchscreen interactions are widely integrated into modern sleeping habits - surrounding both sleep onset and waking-up periods - yielding a new approach to measuring sleep. Smartphone taps can be leveraged to update the behavioural signatures of sleep with these peculiarities of modern digital behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Directed evolution of enzymes toward improved catalytic performance has become a powerful tool in protein engineering. To be effective, a directed evolution campaign requires the use of high-throughput screening. In this study we describe the development of a high-throughput lysis-free procedure to screen for improved sulfatase activity by combining microdroplet-based single-variant activity sorting with E. coli autodisplay. For the first step in a 4-step screening procedure we quantitatively screened >105 variants of the homodimeric arylsulfatase from Silicibacter pomeroyi (SpAS1), displayed on the E. coli cell surface, for improved sulfatase activity using fluorescence activated droplet sorting. Display of the sulfatase variants on living E. coli cells ensured the continuous linkage of genotype and phenotype during droplet sorting and allowed for direct recovery by simple regrowth of the sorted cells. The use of autodisplay on living cells simplified and reduced the degree of liquid handling during all steps in the screening procedure to the single event of simply mixing substrate and cells. The percentage of apparent improved variants was enriched >10-fold as a result of droplet sorting. We ultimately identified 25 SpAS1-variants with improved performance toward 4-nitrophenyl sulfate (up to 6.2-fold) and/or fluorescein disulfate (up to 30-fold). In SpAS1 variants with improved performance toward the bulky fluorescein disulfate, many of the beneficial mutations occur in residues that form hydrogen bonds between -helices in the C-terminal oligomerization region, suggesting a non-trivial, previously unknown role for the dimer interface in shaping the substrate binding site of SpAS1.\\n\\nTable of contents graphic\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/479162v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (29K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9211aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ec3b2dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1214667org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1952a50_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The concerted action of many protein kinases helps orchestrate the error-free progression through mitosis of mammalian cells. The roles and regulation of some prominent mitotic kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases, are well-established. However, these and other known mitotic kinases alone cannot account for the extent of protein phosphorylation that has been reported during mammalian mitosis. Here we demonstrate that CK1, of the casein kinase 1 family of protein kinases, localises to the spindle and is required for proper spindle-positioning and timely cell division. CK1 is recruited to the spindle by FAM83D, and cells devoid of FAM83D, or those harbouring CK1-binding-deficient FAM83DF283A/F283A knockin mutation, display pronounced spindle-positioning defects, and a prolonged mitosis. Restoring FAM83D at the endogenous locus in FAM83D-/- cells, or artificially delivering CK1 to the spindle in FAM83DF283A/F283A cells, rescues these defects. These findings implicate CK1 as new mitotic kinase that orchestrates the kinetics and orientation of cell division.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that individual differences in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) are associated with disrupted threat extinction. However, it is unknown what maintains the learned threat association in high IU individuals: is it the experienced uncertainty during extinction or the combination of experienced uncertainty with potential threat during extinction? Here we addressed this question by running two independent experiments with uncertain auditory stimuli that varied in threat level (Experiment 1, aversive human scream (n = 30); Experiment 2, benign tone (n = 47) and mildly aversive tone (n = 49)). During the experiments, we recorded skin conductance responses and subjective ratings to the learned cues during acquisition and extinction. In experiment 1, high IU was associated with heightened skin conductance responding to the learned threat vs. safe cue during extinction. In experiment 2, high IU was associated only with larger skin conductance responding to the learned cues with threatening properties during extinction i.e. mildly aversive tone. These findings suggest that uncertainty in combination with threat, even when mild, disrupts extinction in high IU individuals. Such findings help us understand the link between IU and threat extinction, and its relevance to anxiety disorder pathology.",

    "abstract": "Eater and NimC1 are transmembrane receptors of the Drosophila Nimrod family, specifically expressed in hemocytes, the insect blood cells. Previous ex vivo and in vivo RNAi studies have pointed to their role in the phagocytosis of bacteria. Here, we have created a novel null mutant in NimC1 to re-evaluate the role of NimC1, alone or in combination with Eater, in the cellular immune response. We show that NimC1 functions as an adhesion molecule ex vivo, but in contrast to Eater is not required for hemocyte sessility in vivo. Ex vivo phagocytosis assays and electron microscopy experiments confirmed that Eater is the main phagocytic receptor for Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative bacteria, and contributes to microbe tethering to hemocytes. Surprisingly, the NimC1 deletion did not impair phagocytosis of bacteria, nor their adhesion to the hemocytes. However, phagocytosis of both types of bacteria was almost abolished in NimC11;eater1 hemocytes. This indicates that both receptors contribute synergistically to the phagocytosis of bacteria, but that Eater can bypass the requirement for NimC1. Finally, we uncovered that NimC1, but not Eater, is essential for uptake of latex beads and zymosan particles. We conclude that Eater and NimC1 are the two main receptors for phagocytosis of bacteria in Drosophila, and that each receptor likely plays distinct roles in microbial uptake.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages play a dynamic role in tissue repair following injury. Here we found that following streptozotocin (STZ)-induced beta-cell death, mouse islet macrophages expressed increased Igf1, decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression, and transcriptome changes consistent with macrophages undergoing efferocytosis and having an enhanced state of metabolism. Macrophages were the major, if not sole, contributors to islet IGF-1 production. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that macrophages can maintain insulin secretion in vivo following beta-cell death with no effects on islet-cell turnover. IGF-1 neutralization during STZ-treatment decreased insulin secretion without affecting islet-cell apoptosis or proliferation. Interestingly, high fat diet (HFD) combined with STZ further skewed islet macrophages to a reparative state. Finally, islet macrophages from db/db mice also expressed decreased proinflammatory cytokines and increased Igf1 mRNA. These data have important implications for islet biology and pathology and show that islet macrophages preserve their reparative state following beta-cell death even during HFD feeding and severe hyperglycemia.",

Antibiotic treatment for these infections is often unsuccessful, partly due to Mabs high intrinsic antibiotic resistance. It is not clear whether antibiotic tolerance caused by biofilm formation also contributes to poor treatment outcomes. We studied the surface glycolipids and antibiotic tolerance of Mab biofilms grown in Artificial Cystic Fibrosis Sputum media in order to determine how they are affected by nutrient conditions that closely mimic infection. We found that Mab biofilms grown in ACFS display more of the virulence lipid trehalose dimycolate than biofilms grown in standard lab media. Biofilms in ACFS media also afford more protection against clinically important antibiotics than biofilms grown in lab media. These results indicate that Mab cell physiology in biofilms depends on environmental factors, and that nutrient conditions found within Cystic Fibrosis infections could contribute to both increased virulence and antibiotic tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Colistin is an antibiotic of last resort, but has poor efficacy and resistance is a growing problem. Whilst it is well established that colistin disrupts the bacterial outer membrane by selectively targeting lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it was unclear how this led to bacterial killing. We discovered that MCR-1 mediated colistin resistance is due to modified LPS at the cytoplasmic rather than outer membrane. In doing so, we also demonstrated that colistin exerts bactericidal activity by targeting LPS in the cytoplasmic membrane. We then exploited this information to devise a new therapeutic approach. Using the LPS transport inhibitor murepavadin, we were able to cause LPS accumulation in the cytoplasmic membrane, which resulted in increased susceptibility to colistin in vitro and improved treatment efficacy in vivo. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which colistin kills bacteria, providing the foundations for novel approaches to enhance therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause the most important rapidly emerging arthropod-borne disease globally. The humoral immune response to DENV infection is predominantly directed against the immunodominant cross-reactive weakly neutralizing epitopes located in the highly conserved fusion peptide of ectodomain II of envelope (E) protein (EDIIFP). Antibodies recognizing EDIIFP have been shown to associate with immune enhancement in an ex vivo animal model. In this study, we explored how prime-boost strategies influence the immunogenicity of a cross-reactivity reduced (CRR) DENV-2 vaccine with substitutions in EDIIFP residues (DENV-2 RD) and found that mice in various DENV-2 RD prime-boost immunizations had significantly reduced levels of EDIIFP antibodies. In addition, heterologous DENV-2 RD DNA-VLP prime-boost immunization induced higher and broader levels of total IgG and neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) although IgG titers to DENV-2 and 3 were statistically significant. Consistently, mice from DENV-2 RD DNA-VLP prime-boost immunization were fully protected from homologous DENV-2 lethal challenge and partially protected (60% survival rate) from heterologous lethal DENV-3 challenge. Our results conclude that the CRR DENV-2 RD vaccine requires a multivalent format to effectively elicit a balanced and protective immunity across all four DENV serotypes.\\n\\nImportanceThe low vaccine efficacy of the live-attenuated chimeric yellow fever virus-DENV tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is unexpected and there is an urgent need to develop a next generation of dengue vaccine. Antibodies against the fusion peptide in envelope protein (E) ectodomain II (EDIIFP) can potentially induce a severe disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. This study evaluated different formats of an EDIIFP-modified DENV-2 vaccine (DENV-2 RD) in its capability of inducing a reduced EDIIFP antibodies, and sculpting the immune response towards an increased DENV complex-reactive neutralizing antibodies (CR NtAb). The results from this study confirmed the poor correlate of neutralizing assay with protection as suggested by the results of CYD-TDV clinical trials. There is a urgent need to develop a biological correlate with protection while evaluating the efficacy of the next generation dengue vaccine.",

    "abstract": "T-cells are activated when their receptor molecules recognize complexes of MHC proteins bound to peptides on the surface of neighbouring cells. Each T-cell expresses one variant of many possible receptor molecules, which are generated through a partially random process that culminates in approximately 107 possible T-cell receptors. As the peptide sequence bound to an MHC molecule is also highly variable, the optimal strategy of an antigen-presenting cell for displaying peptide-MHC complexes is not obvious. A natural compromise arises between aggressive peptide filtering, displaying a few peptides with high stability MHC binding in high abundance and regularity, and promiscuous peptide binding, which can result in more diverse peptides being presented, but in lower abundance. To study this compromise, we have combined a model of MHC class I peptide filtering with a simple probabilistic description of the interactions between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and cytotoxic Tcells (CTLs). By asking how long it takes, on average, for an APC to encounter a circulating CTL that recognises one of the peptides being presented by its MHC molecules, we found that there often exists an optimal degree of peptide filtering, which minimises this expected time until first encounter. The optimal degree of filtering is often in the range of values that the chaperone molecule tapasin confers on peptide selection, but varies between MHC class I molecules that have different peptide binding properties. Our model-based analysis therefore helps to understand how variations in the antigen presentation profile might be exploited for vaccine design or immunotherapies.",

Herein, combining data derived from a meta-analysis of 45 informative disease-causing 5SS GT>GC mutations (from 42 genes) and a cell culture-based full-length gene splicing assay of 103 5SS GT>GC mutations (from 30 genes), we estimate that [~]15-18% of the canonical GT 5SSs are capable of generating between 1 and 84% normal transcripts as a consequence of the substitution of GT by GC. We further demonstrate that the canonical 5SSs whose substitutions of GT by GC generated normal transcripts show stronger complementarity to the 5 end of U1 snRNA than those sites whose substitutions of GT by GC did not lead to the generation of normal transcripts. We also observed a correlation between the generation of wild-type transcripts and a milder than expected clinical phenotype but found that none of the available splicing prediction tools were able to accurately predict the functional impact of 5SS GT>GC mutations.
