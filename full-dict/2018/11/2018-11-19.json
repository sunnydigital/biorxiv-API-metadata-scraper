    "abstract": "Beige fat dissipates energy and functions as a defense against cold and obesity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that the signaling of interleukin (IL)-25 including its cognate receptor, IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), increased in adipose tissue upon cold and {beta}3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. IL-25 induced the browning effect in white adipose tissue (WAT) by releasing IL-4, 13 and promoting alternative activation of macrophages to regulate innervation, which characterized as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) up-regulation to produce more catecholamine including norepinephrine. Blockade of IL-4R and depletion of macrophages with clodronate-loaded liposomes in vivo significantly impaired the browning of WAT. Obese mice administered with IL-25 were protected from obesity on a high-fat diet and the subsequent metabolic disorders, and the process involved the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. In conclusion, the activation of IL-25 signaling on beige fat might play a therapeutic potential for obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Canine cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common skin cancer in dogs, and due to its low metastatic rate, local treatments such as electrochemotherapy (ECT) promote disease control or even complete remission and increase the survival time in most cases. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of BAX, Bcl-2, and Ki67 and clinical parameters in dogs with cSCC subjected to ECT. A prospective clinical nonrandomized study was performed in dogs with naturally occurring cSCC treated with ECT. Eighteen lesions (from 11 dogs) were selected, independent of breed, sex and age. The ECT protocol consisted of bleomycin plus doxorubicin followed by electric pulses characterized by 8 biphasic electric pulses lasting 100 ms, 1 Hz and 1000 V/cm. Among the 18 lesions, the lesion volume significantly decreased after treatment (p=0.04). The tumor size at D0 had no impact on survival time or prognosis (P>0.05). A decreased mitotic index was observed at compared with D0 (P=0.019). We also observed more intratumoral necrosis at D21 compared to D0 (P=0.041). The median expression level of Ki67 was 277.96 at D0 and 193.92 at D21. Thus, tumor samples had a lower proliferative index after ECT (D21) (P=0.031). The survival times of subjects with Ki67 values lower and higher than the Ki67 median value were not significantly different (P>0.05). Regarding apoptotic markers, there was no significant difference in BAX or Bcl-2 expression between D0 and D21 (P>0.05) or in overall survival between subjects with different levels of apoptotic markers. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between BAX and Bcl-2 before ECT (D0) (P=0.0379, r=0.5067). In conclusion, there was no change in BAX and Bcl-2 protein expression levels in response to ECT at the time points evaluated, and ECT was able to reduce tumor volume and cellular proliferation in cSCC.",

    "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) is associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of malignant diseases, but its biological function on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been explored. This study was aimed to analyze apoptosis induced by Knockdown of DGKZ and its mechanism in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells.In the present study qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of DGKZ in HL-60, THP-1, K562, H9, Jurkat and CD34 cell lines. DGKZ-shRNA lentiviral vector was established and used to infect acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the viability of HL-60 cells DGKZ knocked down. Apoptosis and cell cycle phase of HL-60 cells after DGKZ knockdown were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to investigated the protein expression related to apoptosis and cell cycle. Results showed DGKZ expression were stable and higher in Jurkat, HL-60, THP-1,K562 leukemia cells than those of H9 and CD34 cells. Compared with cells of the shCtrl group, DGKZ was markedly knocked down in cells which were transfected with lentivirus encoding shRNA of DGKZ in HL-60 cells. DGKZ knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in HL-60 cells. Western blot results indicated the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-8, and survivin markedly increased in HL-60 cells after knockdown of DGKZ. The results suggest Knockdown of DGKZ can inhibit proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase through caspases pathway.",

However, introduction of the telomerase catalytic protein component (TERT) is insufficient to immortalize most, but not all, human cell types under typical cell culture conditions. Originally, telomerase activity was only detected in cancer cells but is now recognized as being detectable in transit amplifying cells in tissues undergoing regeneration or in extreme conditions of wound repair. Here we report that in vitro low stress culture conditions allow normal human lung basal epithelial cells to grow for over 200 population doublings without engaging any telomere maintenance mechanism. This suggests that most reported instances of telomere-based replicative senescence are due to cell culture stress-induced premature senescence.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryHuman lung cells growing in reduced stress conditions can divide well beyond the Hayflick limit.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman CD4+ and CD8+ stem cell memory T cells (TSCM) represent a minor fraction of circulating lymphocytes characterized by stemness and long-term in vivo persistence. CD4+ TSCM are preferentially infected and constitute a reservoir for HIV-1, whereas CD8+ TSCM appear to play a protective role. However, little is known about CD4+ and CD8+ TSCM in the only other human pathogenic retroviral infection, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of both Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP), a neuroinflammatory disorder. In ATL, CD4+ TSCM cells were identified as the hierarchical leukemic stem cell, but data in HAM/TSP are lacking. Age is a major risk factor for both ATL and HAM/TSP, as both diseases generally manifest several decades after infection. Therefore, we explored a possible link between TSCM, age and disease status in human retroviral infections in a cross-sectional study, using multiparametric flow cytometry.\\n\\nResultsWe found that CD4+ or CD8+ TSCM levels (quantified as CD3+CD45RA+CD45RO- CD27+CCR7+Fashi) do not differ between healthy controls and untreated HTLV-1 infected individuals with and without neuroinflammatory disorder. However, we found both TSCM as well as CD8+ TSCM significantly accumulated with age, resulting in a >400% increase in elderly HTLV-1 infected individuals (>60 years). A significant correlation between age and TSCM signature genes was validated at the transcriptome level in an independent cohort. CD8+ but not CD4+ TSCM were significantly decreased in untreated HIV-1 infection. Unexpectedly, CD8+ TSCM recovery upon successful antiretroviral treatment was essentially complete (92.2{+/-}11.0%) in younger (<45 years) individuals, but significantly lower (37.3{+/-}6.1%) in older (>45 years) individuals (p=0.0003).\\n\\nConclusionIn HTLV-1 infection, an age-dependent accumulation of CD4+ and CD8+ TSCM points towards a possible protective role of CD8 TSCM in the elderly against leukemic but not neuroinflammatory disease. HIV-1-infected individuals lose their ability to restore CD8+ TSCM levels upon successful antiretroviral therapy at later age (>45 years), which might eventually lead to immunological failure and decreased vaccine efficacy.",

We investigated the dynamics of expression of MTS1338, a small non-coding RNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in the mouse model in vivo, regulation of its expression in the ex vivo infected macrophages, and the consequences of its overexpression in bacterial cultures. Here we demonstrate that MTS1338 significantly contributes to host-pathogen interactions. Activation of the host immune system triggered NO-inducible up-regulation of MTS1338 in macrophage-engulfed mycobacteria. Constitutive overexpression of MTS1338 in cultured mycobacteria improved their survival in vitro under low pH conditions. MTS1338 up-regulation launched a spectrum of shifts in the transcriptome profile similar to those reported for M. tuberculosis adaptation to hostile intra-macrophage environment. Using the RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate that gene expression changes accompanying MTS1338 overexpression indicate reduction in translational activity and bacterial growth, which is consistent with entering the dormant state. Taken together, our results suggest a direct involvement on this sRNA in the interplay between mycobacteria and the host immune system during infectious process.",

    "abstract": "Designing synthetic microbial consortia is an emerging area in synthetic biology and a major goal is to realize stable and robust coexistence of multiple species. Co-operation and competition are fundamental intra/interspecies interactions that shape population level behaviors, yet it is not well-understood how these interactions affect the stability and robustness of coexistence. In this paper, we show that communities with cooperative interactions are more robust to population disturbance, e.g., depletion by antibiotics, by forming intermixed spatial patterns. Meanwhile, competition leads to population spatial heterogeneity and more fragile coexistence in communities. Using reaction-diffusion and nonlocal PDE models and simulations of a two-species E. coli consortium, we demonstrate that cooperation is more beneficial than competition in maintaining coexistence in spatially structured consortia, but not in well-mixed environments. This also suggests a trade-off between constructing heterogeneous communities with localized functions and maintaining robust coexistence. The results provide general strategies for engineering spatially structured consortia by designing interspecies interactions and suggest the importance of cooperation for biodiversity in microbial community.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe causes of poor respiratory function and COPD are incompletely understood, but it is clear that genes and the environment play a role. As DNA methylation is under both genetic and environmental control, we hypothesised that investigation of differential methylation associated with these phenotypes would permit mechanistic insights, and improve prediction of COPD. We investigated genome-wide differential DNA methylation patterns using the recently released 850K Illumina EPIC array in the largest single population sample to date.\\n\\nMethodsEpigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of respiratory function and COPD were performed in peripheral blood samples from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) cohort (N=3,791; 274 COPD cases and 2,928 controls). In independent COPD incidence data (N=150), significantly differentially methylated sites (DMSs; p<3.6x10-8) were evaluated for their added predictive power when added to a model including clinical variables, age, sex, height and smoking history using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) was used to replicate association (N=895) and prediction (N=178) results.\\n\\nFindingsWe identified 29 respiratory function and/or COPD associated DMSs, which mapped to genes involved in alternative splicing, JAK-STAT signalling, and axon guidance. In prediction analyses, we observed significant improvement in discrimination between COPD cases and controls (p<0.05) in independent GS:SFHS (p=0.014) and LBC1936 (p=0.018) datasets by adding DMSs to a clinical model.\\n\\nInterpretationIdentification of novel DMSs has provided insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating respiratory function and aided prediction of COPD risk.\\n\\nFundingWellcome Trust Strategic Award 10436/Z/14/Z.\\n\\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched for articles in PubMed published in English up to July 25, 2018, with the search terms \\\"DNA methylation\\\" and \\\"respiratory function\\\", or \\\"COPD\\\". We found some evidence for association between differential DNA methylation and both respiratory function and COPD. Of the twelve previous studies identified, eight used peripheral blood samples (sample size [N] range = 100-1,085) and four used lung tissue samples (N range = 24-160). The number of CpG loci analysed range from 27,578 to 485,512. These studies have not identified consistent changes in methylation, most likely due to a combination of factors including small sample sizes, technical issues, phenotypic definitions, and study design. In addition, no previous study has: analysed a sample from a large single cohort; used the recently released Illumina EPIC array (which assesses ~850,000 CpG loci); adjusted methylation data and phenotype for smoking history, or used both prevalent and incident COPD electronic health record data.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the largest single cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of respiratory function and COPD to date (N=3,791). After applying stringent genome-wide significance criteria (P <3.6x10-8), we found that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites in peripheral blood were associated with respiratory function or COPD. Of these 29, seven were testable in an independent population sample: all seven showed consistent direction of effect between the two samples and three showed replication (p<0.007 [0.05/7 CpG sites tested]). Our results suggest that adjustment of both the phenotypic and the DNA methylation probe data for smoking history, which has not been carried out in previous studies, reduces the confounding effects of smoking, identifies larger numbers of associations, and reduces the heterogeneity of effects across smoking strata. We used gene set enrichment and pathway analyses, together with an approach that combines DNA methylation results with gene expression data to provide evidence for enrichment of differentially methylated sites in genes linked to alternative splicing, and JAK-STAT signalling and axon guidance. Finally, we demonstrated that the inclusion of DNA methylation data improves COPD risk prediction over established clinical variables alone in two independent datasets.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceThere is now accumulating evidence that DNA methylation in peripheral blood is associated with respiratory function and COPD.\\n\\nOur study has shown that DNA methylation levels at 29 CpG sites are robustly associated with respiratory function and COPD, provide mechanistic insights, and can improve prediction of COPD risk. Further studies are warranted to improve understanding of the aetiology of COPD and to assess the utility of DNA methylation profiling in the clinical management of this condition.",

    "abstract": "There is significant interest in the development and application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to neuroimaging data. A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. When predicting fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as DNNs for RSFC-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Since their discovery in the early  70s1, hippocampal place cells have been studied in numerous animal and human spatial memory paradigms2-4. These pyramidal cells, along with other spatially tuned types of neurons (e.g. grid cells, head direction cells), are thought to provide the mammalian brain a unique spatial signature characterizing a specific environment, and thereby a memory trace of the subjects place5. While grid and head direction cells are found in various brain regions, only few hippocampal-related structures showing  place cell-like neurons have been identified6,7, thus reinforcing the central role of the hippocampus in spatial memory. Concurrently, it is increasingly suggested that visual areas play an important role in spatial cognition as recent studies showed a clear spatial selectivity of visual cortical (V1) neurons in freely moving rodents8-10. We therefore thought to investigate, in the rat, such spatial correlates in a thalamic structure located one synapse upstream of V1, the dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (dLGN), and discovered that a substantial proportion (ca. 30%) of neurons exhibits spatio-selective activity. We found that dLGN place cells maintain their spatial selectivity in the absence of visual inputs, presumably relying on odor and locomotor inputs. We also found that dLGN place cells maintain their place selectivity across sessions in a familiar environment and that contextual modifications yield separated representations. Our results show that dLGN place cells are likely to participate in spatial cognition processes, creating as early as the thalamic stage a comprehensive representation of one given environment.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding accounts of psychosis state that an overweighing of high-level priors relative to sensory information may lead to the misperception of meaningful signals underlying the experience of auditory hallucinations and delusions. However, it is currently unclear whether the hypothesized overweighing of priors (1) represents a pervasive alteration that also affects the visual modality, and, (2) takes already effect at early automatic processing stages.\\n\\nHere, we addressed these questions by studying visual perception of socially meaningful stimuli in healthy individuals with varying degrees of psychosis proneness (n=39). In a first task, we quantified participants prior for detecting faces in visual noise. In a second task, we measured participants prior for detecting direct gaze stimuli that were rendered invisible by continuous flash suppression. We found that the prior for detecting faces in noise correlated with hallucination proneness (rho=0.50, p=0.001) as well as delusion proneness (rho=0.44, p=0.005). Similarly, the prior for detecting invisible direct gaze was significantly associated with hallucination proneness (rho = 0.42, p = 0.010) and trend-wise with delusion proneness (rho = 0.29, p = 0.087). Our results provide evidence for the idea that overly strong high-level priors for automatically detecting socially meaningful stimuli might constitute a generic processing alteration in psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastid parasites including Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania harbor unique organelles known as glycosomes, which are evolutionarily related to peroxisomes. Glycosome/peroxisome biogenesis is mediated by proteins called peroxins that facilitate organelle formation, proliferation and degradation, and import of proteins housed therein. Import of matrix proteins occurs via one of two pathways that are dictated by their peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS). In PTS1 import, a C-terminal tripeptide sequence, most commonly SKL, is recognized by the soluble receptor Pex5. In PTS2 import, a less conserved N-terminal sequence is recognized by Pex7. The soluble receptors deliver their cargo to the import channel consisting minimally of Pex13 and Pex14. While much of the import process is conserved, kinetoplastids are the only organisms to have two Pex13s, TbPex13.1 and TbPex13.2. In previous studies, GFP-tagged TbPex13.1 localized to glycosomes and silencing either protein in the stage of the parasite that lives in the mammalian bloodstream impaired glycosome protein import and slowed parasite growth. While these findings suggest Pex13s are involved in protein import, the mechanisms by which they function are unknown and it is unclear why kinetoplastids would require two Pex13s. In this work, we demonstrate that TbPex13.2 is associated with the glycosome membrane with its N-terminus facing the cytoplasm. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that TbPex13.2 localizes to a few (1-3) foci per glycosome and import of PTS2 proteins was disrupted in TbPex13.2-deficient cells suggesting it may be an accessory factor for PTS2 import.",

Here we used peripheral optogenetic stimulation and transcriptome profiling in the mouse whisker system to investigate the time course of changes in neuromuscular function following complete unilateral facial nerve transection. While most skeletal muscles rapidly lose functionality after lower motor neuron denervation, optogenetic muscle stimulation of the paralyzed whisker pad revealed sustained increases in the sensitivity, velocity, and amplitude of whisker movements, and reduced fatigability, starting 48 h after denervation. RNA-seq analysis showed distinct regulation of multiple gene families in denervated whisker pad muscles compared to the atrophy-prone soleus, including prominent changes in ion channels and contractile fibers. Together, our results define the unique functional and transcriptomic landscape of denervated facial muscles, and have general implications for restoring movement after neuromuscular injury or disease.\n\nNew & NoteworthyOptogenetic activation of muscle can be used to non-invasively induce movements and probe muscle function.

Strikingly, Rac1-KO mice exhibited thinner dermal white adipose tissue, which was considerably further reduced in Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice. DNA microarray using primary keratinocytes from Rac1/Rac3-DKO mice exhibited decreased mRNA levels of Bmp2, Bmp5, Fgf20, Fgf21, Fgfbp1, and Pdgf. Combinational treatment with BMP2 and FGF21 or BMP2 and FGF20 in culture medium, but not individual purified recombinant proteins, could differentiate 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes, as could culture media obtained from primary keratinocytes. Conversely, addition of anti-BMP2 or anti-FGF21 antibodies into the culture medium inhibited fibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, combinational treatment with BMP2 and FGF21 promoted adipocyte differentiation only of rat primary white, but not brown, adipocyte precursors. Notably, brown adipogenesis by FGF21 was inhibited by BMP2. Thus, we proposed novel paracrine pathways from keratinocytes to intradermal pre-adipocytes, which function as Rac-dependent modulators of white adipogenesis, but also brown adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccording to well-established evolutionary biology theory reproduction trades-off against longevity, implying that upregulating the reproductive axis might drive major diseases. We assessed whether the central driver of reproduction gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) had a causal effect on the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, i.e. ischemic heart disease (IHD). As a contrast we similarly examined the role of GnRH2 because it is more a driver of female sexual behavior.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied strong (p-value <5x10-6) and independent genetic predictors of GnRH1 and GnRH2 to an extensively genotyped IHD case (n=76,014) - control (n=264,785) study using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO estimates.\\n\\nResultsGnRH1, predicted by 11 genetic variants, was positively associated with IHD (IVW odds ratio (OR) 1.04 per effect size, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.08), but GnRH2, predicted by 15 genetic variants, was not (IVW OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.02).\\n\\nConclusionsGnRH1 is a potential IHD genetic target. Apart from demonstrating a central tenet of evolutionary biology in humans, our study suggests that existing treatments and environmental factors targeting GnRH1, its drivers or consequences could be re-purposed to prevent and treat IHD. Given, the importance of reproduction to the human species, many such exposures likely exist.",

    "abstract": "Pesticide resistance arises rapidly in arthropod herbivores, as can host plant adaptation, and both are significant problems in agriculture. These traits have been challenging to study as both are often polygenic and many arthropods are genetically intractable. Here, we examined the genetic architecture of pesticide resistance and host plant adaptation in the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a global agricultural pest. We show that the short generation time and high fecundity of T. urticae can be readily exploited in experimental evolution designs for high-resolution mapping of quantitative traits. As revealed by selection with spirodiclofen, an acetyl-CoA decarboxylase inhibitor, in populations from a cross between a spirodiclofen resistant and a susceptible strain, and which also differed in performance on tomato, we found that a limited number of loci could explain quantitative resistance to this compound. These were resolved to narrow genomic intervals, suggesting specific candidate genes, including acetyl-CoA decarboxylase itself, clustered and copy variable cytochrome P450 genes, and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, which encodes a redox partner for cytochrome P450s. For performance on tomato, candidate genomic regions for response to selection were distinct from those responding to the synthetic compound and were consistent with a more polygenic architecture. In accomplishing this work, we exploited the continuous nature of allele frequency changes across experimental populations to resolve the existing fragmented T.urticae draft genome to pseudochromosomes. This improved assembly was indispensable for our analyses, as it will be for future research with this model herbivore that is exceptionally amenable to genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Sulfonamides are synthetic chemotherapeutic agents that work as competitive inhibitors of the di-hydro-pteroate synthase (DHPS) enzyme, encoded by the folP gene. Resistance to sulfonamides is widespread in the clinical setting and predominantly mediated by plasmid- and integron-borne sul1-3 genes encoding mutant DHPS enzymes that do not bind sulfonamides. In spite of their clinical importance, the genetic origin of sul1-3 genes remains unknown. Here we analyze sul genes and their genetic neighborhoods to uncover sul signature elements that enable the elucidation of their genetic origin. We identify a protein sequence Sul motif associated with sul-encoded proteins, as well as consistent association of a phosphoglucosamine mutase gene (glmM) with the sul2 gene. We identify chromosomal folP genes bearing these genetic markers in two bacterial families: the Rhodobiaceae and the Leptospiraceae. Bayesian phylogenetic inference of FolP/Sul and GlmM protein sequences clearly establishes that sul1-2 and sul3 genes originated as a mobilization of folP genes present in, respectively, the Rhodobiaceae and the Leptospiraceae, and indicate that the Rhodobiaceae folP gene was transferred from the Leptospiraceae. Analysis of %GC content in folP/sul gene sequences supports the phylogenetic inference results and indicates that the emergence of the Sul motif in chromosomally-encoded FolP proteins is ancient and considerably predates the clinical introduction of sulfonamides. In vitro assays reveal that both the Rhodobiaceae and the Leptospiraceae, but not other related chromosomally-encoded FolP proteins confer resistance in a sulfonamide-sensitive Escherichia coli background, indicating that the Sul motif is associated with sulfonamide resistance. Given the absence of any known natural sulfonamides targeting DHPS, these results provide a novel perspective on the emergence of resistance to synthetic chemotherapeutic agents, whereby preexisting resistant variants in the vast bacterial pangenome may be rapidly selected for and mobilized upon the clinical introduction of novel chemotherapeuticals.",

This study verifies improved agronomic package for sustainable yam production in yam growing areas in the forest - savannah transition zone of Ghana during the 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. The improved agronomic package included use of ridging as seedbed, seed treatment before planting, fertilizer application at a rate of 30:30:36 N:P205:K20 kg/ha plus 15 kg/ha Mg and 20 kg/ha S as MgSO4 and the use of minimum stakes (trellis; 30-50% less number of stakes used by farmers staking).

    "abstract": "DNA methylation of various genomic regions plays an important role in regulating gene expression in diverse biological contexts. However, most genome-wide studies have focused on the effect of 1) methylation in cis, not in trans and 2) a single CpG, not the collective effects of multiple CpGs, on gene expression. In this study, we developed a statistical machine learning model, geneEXPLORER (gene expression prediction by long-range epigenetic regulation), that quantifies the collective effects of both cis- and trans- methylations on gene expression. By applying geneEXPLORER to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast and lung cancer data, we found that most genes are affected by methylations of as much as 10Mb from promoter regions or more, and the long-range methylation explains 50% of the variation in gene expression on average, far greater than cis-methylation. The highly predictive genes are related to breast cancer, especially oncogenes and suppressor genes. Further, the predicted gene expressions could predict clinical phenotypes such as breast tumor status and estrogen receptor status (AUC=0.999, 0.94 respectively) as accurately as the measured gene expression levels. These results suggest that geneEXPLORER provides a means for accurate imputation of gene expression, which can be further used to predict clinical phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algae blooms (HAB) in coastal marine environments are increasing in number and duration, pressuring local resource managers to implement mitigation solutions to protect human and ecosystem health. However, insufficient spatial and temporal observations create uninformed management decisions. In order to better detect and map blooms, as well as the environmental conditions responsible for their formation, long-term, unattended observation platforms are desired. In this article, we describe a new cost-efficient, autonomous, mobile platform capable of accepting several sensors that can be used to monitor harmful algae blooms in near real-time. The Navocean autonomous sail-powered surface vehicle is deployable by a single person from shore, capable of waypoint navigation in shallow and deep waters, and powered completely by renewable energy. We present results from three surveys of the Florida Red Tide harmful algae bloom (Karenia brevis) of 2017-2018. The vessel made significant progress towards waypoints regardless of wind conditions while underway chl. a measurements revealed HAB bloom patches and CDOM and turbidity provided environmental contextual information. While the autonomous sailboat directly adds to our HAB monitoring capabilities, the boat can also help to ground-truth and thus improve satellite monitoring of HABs. Finally, several other pending and future use cases for coastal and inland monitoring are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a sail-driven vessel used for coastal HAB monitoring.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental aim of adaptation genomics is to identify polymorphisms that underpin variation in fitness traits. In D. melanogaster latitudinal life-history clines exist on multiple continents and make an excellent system for dissecting the genetics of adaptation. We have previously identified numerous clinal SNPs in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), a pathway known from mutant studies to affect life history. However, the effects of natural variants in this pathway remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how two clinal alternative alleles at foxo, a transcriptional effector of IIS, affect fitness components (viability, size, starvation resistance, fat content). We assessed this polymorphism from the North American cline by reconstituting outbred populations, fixed for either the low- or high-latitude allele, from inbred DGRP lines. Since diet and temperature modulate IIS, we phenotyped alleles across two temperatures (18{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C) and two diets differing in sugar source and content. Consistent with clinal expectations, the high-latitude allele conferred larger body size and reduced wing loading. Alleles also differed in starvation resistance and expression of InR, a transcriptional target of FOXO. Allelic reaction norms were mostly parallel, with few GxE interactions. Together, our results suggest that variation in IIS makes a major contribution to clinal life-history adaptation.",

    "abstract": "People who opt to participate in scientific studies tend to be healthier, wealthier, and more educated than the broader population. While selection bias does not always pose a problem for analysing the relationships between exposures and diseases or other outcomes, it can lead to biased effect size estimates. Biased estimates may weaken the utility of genetic findings because the goal is often to make inferences in a new sample (such as in polygenic risk score analysis). We used data from UK Biobank and Generation Scotland and conducted phenotypic and genome-wide association analyses on two phenotypes that reflected mental health data availability: (1) whether participants were contactable by email for follow-up) and (2) whether participants responded to a follow-up surveys of mental health. We identified nine genetic loci associated with email contact and 25 loci associated with mental health survey completion. Both phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with higher educational attainment and better health and negatively genetically correlated with psychological distress and schizophrenia. Recontact availability and follow-up participation can act as further genetic filters for data on mental health phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often conceptualized as \\\"disconnection syndromes\\\", with substantial evidence of abnormalities in deep white matter tracts, forming the substrates of long-range connectivity, seen in both disorders. However, the study of superficial white matter (SWM) U-shaped short-range tracts remained challenging until recently, although findings from post-mortem studies suggest they are likely integral components of SZ and BD neuropathology. This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labelling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ. We thus illustrate that short U-fibers are vulnerable to the pathological processes in major psychiatric illnesses, encouraging improved understanding of their anatomy and function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe prevalence of depression is higher in individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases, but the mechanisms underlying the observed comorbidities are unknown. Epidemiological findings point to a bi-directional relationship - that depression increases the risk of developing an autoimmune disease, and vice-versa. Shared genetic etiology is a plausible explanation for the overlap between depression and autoimmune diseases. In this study we tested whether genetic variation in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which is associated with risk for autoimmune diseases, is also associated with risk for depression.\\n\\nMethodWe fine-mapped the classical MHC (chr6: 29.6-33.1 Mb), imputing 216 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and four Complement Component 4 (C4) haplotypes in studies from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) working group and the UK Biobank (UKB). In the 26 PGC-MDD studies, cases met a lifetime diagnosis of MDD, determined by a structured diagnostic interview. In the UKB, cases and controls were identified from an online mental health questionnaire. The total sample size was 45,149 depression cases and 86,698 controls. We tested for association between depression status and imputed MHC variants in each study and performed an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis across the PGC-MDD and UKB samples, applying both a conservative region-wide significance threshold (3.9-e6) and a candidate threshold (1.6e-4).\\n\\nResultsNo HLA alleles or C4 haplotypes were associated with depression at the conservative threshold in the PGC, UKB or meta-analysis. HLA-B*08:01 was associated with modest protection for depression at the candidate threshold in the meta-analysis. Under the conservative threshold, 70 SNPs were detected in the UKB and 143 SNPs were detected in the meta-analysis, mirroring previous findings from highly powered GWAS of depression.\\n\\nDiscussionWe found no evidence that HLA alleles, which play a major role in the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, or C4 haplotypes, which are strongly associated with schizophrenia, confer risk for depression. These results indicate that autoimmune diseases and depression do not share common risk loci of moderate or large effect in the MHC.",

    "abstract": "Hox protein transcription factors specify segmental diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis in metazoans. Understanding the basis of Hox function has long faced the problem that, while the different members of the Hox family show clear functional specificity in vivo, they all show very similar binding specificity in vitro. Based on in vitro studies, cofactors may increase Hox binding selectivity however a satisfactory understanding of in vivo Hox target selectivity is still lacking.\\n\\nWe have carried out a systematic analysis of the in vivo genomic binding profiles of all eight Drosophila Hox proteins using transient transfection in Kc167 cells to examine Hox protein targeting. We find that Hox proteins show considerable binding selectivity in vivo in the absence of the canonical Hox cofactors Extradenticle and Homothorax. Hox binding selectivity is strongly associated with chromatin accessibility; binding sites in less accessible chromatin show the highest selectivity and the different Hox proteins exhibit different propensities to bind less accessible chromatin. High Hox binding selectivity is also associated with high affinity binding regions, leading to a model where Hox proteins derive binding selectivity through an affinity-based competition with nucleosomes. Provision of the Extradenticle/Homothorax cofactors generally leads to an increase in the number of Hox binding regions and promotes the binding to regions in less accessible chromatin, however the provision of these cofactors has little effect on the overall selectivity of Hox targeting.\\n\\nThese studies indicate that chromatin accessibility plays a key role in Hox selectivity and we propose that relative chromatin accessibility provides a basis for subtle differences in binding specificity and affinity to generate significantly different sets of genomic targets for different Hox proteins. We suggest that this mechanism may also be relevant to other transcription factor families.",

Recent published studies showthat several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial populations predominantly constitutes the C. elegans gut microbiome but surprisingly lack any yeast species. Here, we show that C. elegans display low satiety on yeast diet of Cryptococcus neoformans, C. laurentii or S. cerevisiae. We found that average size of budding yeast cells is much larger than E. coli cells. Yeast cells also cause pharyngeal obstruction, diminished feeding, and lower level of neutral lipids in adult C. elegans. Using scanning electron microscopy, we show that the mouth size of C. elegans larvae is smaller than average yeast cell. The larvae have no detectable yeast in their alimentary canal and they undergo delayed development on yeast diet. We propose that microbial cell size or bite size could be one of the crucial factors in regulation of feeding in C. elegans.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe microbiome in C. elegans gut is composed of diverse genera of bacteria but it lacks yeast and other fungi. In this study, we provide evidence that yeast cell size is bigger than the mouth size of C. elegans larvae. We propose that \\\"bigger than the bite size of yeast cells is one possible reason for low satiety on yeast diet, reduced feeding, lower stored lipids and delayed development.

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have opened new possibilities to scale the image analysis processes through automation. However, the annotation of fluorescent features with a low signal-to-noise ratio is frequently based on subjective criteria. Training on subjective annotations may ultimately lead to biased DL models yielding irreproducible results. An end-to-end analysis process that integrates data annotation, ground truth estimation, and model training can mitigate this risk. To highlight the importance of this integrated process, we compare different DL-based analysis approaches. Based on data from different laboratories, we show that ground truth estimation from multiple human annotators is indispensable to establish objectivity in fluorescent feature annotations. We demonstrate that ensembles of multiple models trained on the estimated ground truth establish reliability and validity.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo determine if resting state functional MRI biomarkers of Alzheimers disease (AD) differ between older African Americans and Caucasians.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed MRI profiles from 78 individuals (31 African Americans, 47 Caucasians) with normal cognition (n=36) or mild cognitive impairment/mild AD dementia (MCI/AD, n=42). We compared AD-associated intra-network functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) according to race, and correlated domain-specific cognitive functions with functional connectivity which differed between the racial groups.\\n\\nResultsWe identified key differences in DMN functional connectivity associated with AD between the races. Whereas MCI/AD was associated with decreased functional connectivity within the midline core DMN subsystem in older Caucasians, MCI/AD was instead associated with increased functional connectivity within the same subsystem of older African Americans. This is despite decreased functional connectivity in the medial temporal lobe DMN subsystem in both races. Memory function was also positively associated with connectivity between the precuneus and the posterior cingulate/inferior parietal lobule within the midline core subsystem, in keeping with a less amnestic-profile in older African Americans with MCI/AD.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings provide structural support that race modifies the AD phenotypes downstream from cerebral amyloid deposition, and suggests a rsf-MRI correlate of African Americans less amnestic neuropsychological profile in MCI/AD.",

    "abstract": "Matrilineal descent confers lineage membership via the female line. In matrilineal descent systems, men share lineage membership not with their own children, but with their sisters children. The theoretically influential concept of the matrilineal puzzle posits that men experience tension between the desire to exert control over their natal kin (i.e., the lineage to which they belong) and over their affinal kin (i.e., their spouses and their biological children). The rationale for this puzzle rests on two fundamental assumptions: (i) that men are always in positions of authority over women; and (ii) that men are interested in the outcomes of parenting. In this paper, we suggest that the  matrilineal puzzle does not exist from an evolutionary perspective. Instead, we examine what ecological conditions might render men expendable within local kinship configurations-specifically when (i) women, without significant assistance from men, are capable of meeting the subsistence needs of their families; and (ii) men have little to gain from parental investment in children. We conclude that the expendable male hypothesis may explain the evolution of matrilineal descent in numerous cases, and by noting that female-centered approaches that call into doubt assumptions inherent to male-centered models of kinship are justified in evolutionary perspective.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"...for some females there exist important advantages for male care ...

    "abstract": "Pancreatic {beta}-cells undergo profound hyperplasia during pregnancy to maintain maternal euglycemia. Failure to reprogram {beta}-cells into a more replicative state has been found to underlie susceptibility to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We recently identified a requirement for prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling in the metabolic adaptations to pregnancy, where mice lacking {beta}-cell PRLR ({beta}PRLRKO) exhibit a metabolic phenotype consistent with GDM. However, the underlying transcriptional program that is responsible for the PRLR-dependent metabolic adaptations during gestation remains incompletely understood. To identify PRLR signaling gene regulatory networks and target genes within {beta}-cells during pregnancy, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of pancreatic islets isolated from either {beta}PRLRKO mice or littermate controls in late gestation. Gene set enrichment analysis identified Forkhead box protein M1 (Foxm1) and polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) subunits, Suz12 and Ezh2, as novel candidate regulators of PRLR-dependent {beta}-cell adaptation. GO-term pathway enrichment revealed both established and novel PRLR signaling target genes that together describe a state of increased cellular metabolism and/or proliferation. In contrast to the requirement for {beta}-cell PRLR signaling in maintaining euglycemia during pregnancy, PRLR target genes were not induced following high-fat-diet feeding. Altogether, the current study expands our understanding of which transcriptional regulators and networks mediate gene expression required for islet adaptation during pregnancy. The current work also supports the presence of pregnancy-specific adaptive mechanisms distinct from those activated by nutritional stress.",

    "abstract": "Diverse host communities commonly inhibit the spread of parasites in studies at small and intermediate scales, leading some to suggest that conserving biodiversity could help control infectious diseases. However, the generality of this \\\"dilution effect\\\" remains controversial. First, most studies assume a linear, monotonic relationship between biodiversity and disease, though the actual shape is unknown. Second, most studies are conducted at a single spatial scale, though biotic interactions are often-scale-dependent, thus spatial scale might determine the direction of biodiversity-disease relationships. Third, most studies focus only on a small range of possible diversity levels, though the direction of biodiversity-disease relationships may change outside of this range. By analyzing 231 biodiversity-disease relationships on 77 parasite species, we provide broad evidence that biodiversity-disease relationships are generally non-linear and moderated by spatial scale; biodiversity generally inhibits disease at local scales (<100 km2) and amplifies disease at regional scales (>1,000,000 km2). These effects did not depend on any tested host, parasite, or study characteristics, though the spatial scale of a study was often related to study design and parasite type, highlighting the need for additional multiscale research. Few studies were missing substantial data at low diversity, but missing data at low diversity could result in underreporting of amplification. Experiments might be missing data at high diversity, which could result in underreporting of dilution. Despite context-dependence in biodiversity-disease relationships, most conservation is implemented at local scales where biodiversity appears to inhibit disease and thus these results suggest that local conservation actions could reduce disease risk.\\n\\nSignificance statementIt has been suggested that diverse ecological communities limit disease spread, but the generality of this pattern is contentious. Therefore, the degree to which biodiversity conservation can limit harmful epidemics remains unresolved. We address this fundamental question by analyzing 231 published relationships between biodiversity and disease. We find evidence that most biodiversity-disease relationships are nonlinear and scale-dependent with biodiversity generally associated with reduced disease at small and intermediate scales, but increased disease at large scales. Moreover, these results were generally robust to missing data at low and high biodiversity levels and variation in host, parasite, and study characteristics. This suggests that conservation efforts aimed at reducing the impacts of human and wildlife diseases will be most successful at local scales.",

Estimating YF burden, as well as vaccine impact, while accounting for the features of urban YF transmission such as indirect benefits of vaccination, is key to informing this strategy.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe developed two model variants to estimate YF burden in sub-Saharan Africa, assuming all infections stem from either the sylvatic or the urban cycle of the disease. Both relied on an ecological niche model fitted to the local presence of any YF reported event in 34 African countries. We calibrated under-reporting using independent estimates of transmission intensity provided by 12 serological surveys performed in 11 countries. We calculated local numbers of YF infections, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost based on estimated transmission intensity while accounting for time-varying vaccination coverage. We estimated vaccine demand and impact of future preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) according to various vaccination scenarios.\\n\\nVaccination activities conducted in Africa between 2005 and 2017 were estimated to prevent from 3.3 (95% CI 1.2-7.7) to 6.1 (95% CI 2.4-13.2) millions of deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees, representing extreme scenarios of all transmission due to the sylvatic or the urban cycle, respectively. By prioritizing provinces based on the risk of urban YF transmission, an average of 37.7 million annual doses for PMVCs over eight years would avert an estimated 9,900,000 (95% CI 7,000,000-13,400,000) infections and 480,000 (180,000-1,140,000) deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees, corresponding to 1.7 (0.7-4.1) deaths averted per 1,000 vaccine doses.\\n\\nLimitations include substantial uncertainty in the estimates arising from the scarcity of reliable data from surveillance and serological surveys.\\n\\nConclusionsBy estimating YF burden and vaccine impact over a range of spatial and temporal scales, while accounting for the specificity of urban transmission, our model can be used to inform the current EYE strategy.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 8 (BTV-8) during 2006-2009 in Europe was the most costly epidemic of the virus in recorded history. In 2015, a BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France which has continued to circulate since then. To examine anecdotal reports of reduced pathogenicity and transmission efficiency, we investigated the infection kinetics of a 2007 UK BTV-8 strain alongside the re-emerging BTV-8 strain isolated from France in 2017. Two groups of eight BTV-naive British mule sheep were inoculated with 5.75 log10TCID50 ml-1 of either BTV-8 strain. BTV RNA was detected by 2 dpi in both groups with peak viremia occurring between 5-9 dpi. A significantly greater amount of BTV RNA was detected in sheep infected with the 2007 strain (6.0-8.8 log10 genome copies mL-1) than the re-emerging BTV-8 strain (2.9-7.9 log10 genome copies mL-1). All infected sheep developed BTV-specific antibodies by 9 dpi. BTV was isolated from 2 dpi to 12 dpi for 2007 BTV-8-inoculated sheep and from 5 to 10 dpi for sheep inoculated with the remerging BTV-8. In Culicoides sonorensis feeding on the sheep over the period 7-12 dpi, vector competence was significantly higher for the 2007 strain than the re-emerging strain. Both the proportion of animals showing moderate (as opposed to mild or no) clinical disease (6/8 vs 1/8) and the overall clinical scores (median 5.25 vs 3) were significantly higher in sheep infected with the 2007 strain, compared to those infected with the re-emerging strain. However, one sheep infected with the re-emerging strain was euthanized at 16 dpi having developed severe lameness. This highlights the potential of the re-emerging BTV-8 to still cause illness in naive ruminants with concurrent costs to the livestock industry.\\n\\nSummaryThe re-emerging Bluetongue virus serotype 8 still presents a threat to naive ruminants in Europe despite reduced virulence",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNorovirus outbreaks in hospital settings are a common challenge for infection prevention teams. Given the high burden of norovirus in most communities, it can be difficult to distinguish between on-going in-hospital transmission of virus and new introductions from the community and challenging to understand the long-term impacts of outbreak-associated viruses within medical systems using traditional epidemiological approaches alone.\\n\\nMethodsReal-time metagenomic sequencing during an on-going norovirus outbreak associated with a retrospective cohort study.\\n\\nResultsWe describe a hospital-associated norovirus outbreak that affected 13 patients over a 27-day period in a large tertiary pediatric hospital and was chronologically associated with a spike in self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms among staff. Real-time metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of norovirus genomes demonstrated that 10 chronologically overlapping hospital-acquired norovirus cases were partitioned into three discrete transmission clusters. Sequencing data also revealed close genetic relationships between some hospital-acquired and some community-acquired cases. Finally, this data was used to demonstrate chronic viral shedding by an immunocompromised hospital-acquired case patient. Analysis of serial samples from this patient provided novel insights into the evolution of norovirus within an immunocompromised host.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study documents one of the first applications of real-time mNGS during a hospital-associated viral outbreak. Given its demonstrated ability to detect transmission patterns within outbreaks and elucidate the long-term impacts of outbreak-associated viral strains on patients and medical systems, mNGS constitutes a powerful resource to help infection control teams understand, prevent, and respond to viral outbreaks.\\n\\nSummary StatementReal-time metagenomic sequencing performed during a hospital-associated norovirus outbreak identified genetically-distinct, chronologically-overlapping case clusters. After the epidemiologically-defined outbreak had ceased, on-going transmission and shedding of outbreak-associated virus was also detected.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of APOE genotype on microflora speciation and metabolism is completely lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between APOE genotype and the gut microbiome composition in human and APOE-targeted replacement (TR, APOE3 and APOE4) transgenic mice. Faecal microbiota amplicon sequencing from matched individuals with different APOE genotypes revealed no significant differences in overall microbiota diversity (alpha or beta diversity) in group-aggregated human APOE genotypes. However, several bacterial taxa showed significantly different relative abundance between APOE genotypes. Notably, we detected an association of Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae and several butyrate-producing genera abundances with APOE genotypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the gut microbiota of APOE-TR mice. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of faecal water from murine samples detected significant differences in microbe-associated amino acids and short-chain fatty acids between APOE genotypes. Together, the findings indicate that APOE genotype associated with specific gut microbiome profiles in both humans and in APOE-TR mice. This suggests that the gut microbiome is worth further investigation as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the deleterious impact of the APOE4 allele on cognitive decline and the prevention and treatment of AD.",

A signature comprising 109 genes correlated with symptom scores, and these mapped to cytokine signalling/T-cell activation-associated pathways, with upstream drivers including hallmark Th1/Th2-and inflammation-associated genes. Reanalysis after 3.5mths SCIT updosing detected minimal changes to pathway/upstream regulator profiles despite 32.5% reduction in symptoms, however network analysis revealed underlying merging of FOXP3/IL2-with Inflammation-and Th2-associated modules. By 12mths on SCIT, symptoms had reduced by 41% without further significant changes to pathway/upstream regulator or network profiles. Continuing SCIT to 24mths stabilised symptoms at 47% of baseline, accompanied by upregulation of the Type1-IFN-associated network module and its merging into the Th2/FOXP3/IL2/Inflammation module.\n\nConclusionsSCIT stimulates progressive integration of Th-memory-associated Th2-,FOXP3/IL2-, Inflammation-, and Type1-IFN-signalling subnetworks, forming a single highly integrated co-expression network module, maximising potential for stable homeostatic control of allergen-specific Th2 responses via cross-regulation.

    "abstract": "Given the heterogeneity of depression the Research Domain Criteria Framework suggests a dimensional approach to understanding the nature of mental health and illness. Neural reward function has been suggested as underpinning the symptom of anhedonia in depression but less is known about how anhedonia is related to aversion processing. We examined how anhedonia relates to neural activity during reward and aversion processing in adolescents and emerging adults (N=84) in the age range 13-21yrs. Using a dimensional approach we examined how anhedonia and depression severity correlated with an fMRI task measuring anticipation, effort and consummation of reward and aversion. We show for the first time that the dimensional experience of anhedonia correlated with neural responses during effort to avoid aversion in the precuneus with a trend in the insula and during aversive consummation in the caudate. Using a categorical approach we also examined how the neural responses during each phase of the task differed in those with depression symptoms compared to healthy controls. We found participants with depression symptoms invested less physical effort to gain reward than controls and had blunted neural anticipation of reward and aversion in the precuneus, insula, and prefrontal cortex and blunted neural effort for reward in the putamen. This work highlights blunted neural responses to reward and aversion in depression and how anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia may be enhanced via dysfunctional neural processing of aversion. Future work will assess if these neural mechanisms can be used to predict blunted behavioural approach to reward and avoidance of negative experiences in adolescents at risk of depression.",

A whole-brain analysis of beta suppression revealed that the only cortical regions sensitive to the difficulty of semantic access were the higher order motor areas on the medial and lateral surfaces of the frontal lobe. This differential activation of cortical motor system accompanied effortful verb retrieval and preceded the preparation of vocal response for more than 500 milliseconds. Since the mid-frontal frontal brain areas are involved in maintaining abstract representations of actions during their initiating and planning, we argue that our finding supports the view that motor associations contribute to retrieval of verb semantics.",

Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as proxies for modifiable risk factors to strengthen causal inference in observational studies.\\n\\nMethodsWe used MR to evaluate the causal role of 13 previously reported risk factors in overall and histotype-specific EOC in up to 25,509 case subjects and 40,941 controls in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Inverse-variance weighted models were employed to generate effect estimates and MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were performed to examine evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. A Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold was used to establish \\\"strong evidence\\\" (P<0.0038) and \\\"suggestive evidence\\\" (0.0038<P<0.05) for associations.\\n\\nResultsThere was strong or suggestive evidence that 9 of 13 risk factors were causally associated with overall or histotype-specific EOC. Genetic liability to endometriosis was strongly associated with EOC (OR per log odds higher liability: 1.27,95%CI:1.16-1.40;P=6.94x10-7) and lifetime smoking exposure was suggestively associated with EOC (OR per unit increase in smoking score:1.36,95%CI:1.04-1.78;P=0.02). In histotype-stratified analyses, the strongest associations found were between: height and clear cell carcinoma (OR per SD increase:1.36,95%CI:1.15-1.61;P=0.0003); age at natural menopause and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per year later onset:1.09,95% CI:1.02-1.16;P=0.007); and genetic liability to polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per log odds higher liability:0.74,95% CI:0.62-0.90;P=0.002). There was little evidence that genetic liability to type 2 diabetes, parity, or circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and sex hormone-binding globulin were associated with ovarian cancer or its subtypes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur comprehensive examination of possible etiological drivers of ovarian carcinogenesis supports a causal role for few of these factors in epithelial ovarian cancer and suggests distinct etiologies across histotypes.",

However, antibiotic use can be distributed in different ways in a population, and the association between the distribution of use and antibiotic resistance has not been explored. Here we tested the hypothesis that repeated use of antibiotics has a stronger association with population-wide antibiotic resistance than broadly- distributed, low-intensity use. First, we characterized the distribution of outpatient antibiotic use across US states, finding that antibiotic use is uneven and that repeated use of antibiotics makes up a minority of antibiotic use. Second, we compared antibiotic use with resistance for 72 pathogen-antibiotic combinations across states. Finally, having partitioned total use into extensive and intensive margins, we found that intense use had a weaker association with resistance than extensive use. If the use-resistance relationship is causal, these results suggest that reducing total use and selection intensity will require reducing broadly-distributed, low- intensity use.",

Large dataset sizes often require automated methods, but automation can introduce errors that are difficult to detect. Here we show that automatic time course estimation can sometimes lead to significant misattribution errors, in which fluorescence is ascribed to the wrong cell. Misattribution arises when the shapes of overlapping cells are imperfectly defined, or when entire cells or processes are not identified, and misattribution can even be produced by methods specifically designed to handle overlap. To diagnose this problem, we develop a transient-by-transient metric and a visualization tool that allow users to quickly assess the degree of misattribution in large populations. To filter out misattribution, we also design a robust estimator that explicitly accounts for contaminating signals in a generative model. Our methods can be combined with essentially any cell finding technique, empowering users to diagnose and correct at large scale a problem that has the potential to significantly alter scientific conclusions.",

    "abstract": "In addition to memory impairments, patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) exhibit a number of behavioural and psychological symptoms that can affect social interactions over the course of the disease. While altered social interactions have been demonstrated in a number of mouse models of AD, many models only recapitulate the initial stages of the disease, and these behavioural changes have yet to be examined over the course of disease progression. By performing a longitudinal study using the 5xFAD mouse model, we have demonstrated that transgenic females exhibit progressive alterations in social investigation compared to wild-type controls. Transgenic females exhibited an age-related reduction in interest for social odours, as well as reduced investigative behaviours towards novel conspecifics in a novel environment. However, transgenic mice exhibited no obvious olfactory deficits, nor any changes in scent-marking behaviour compared to wild-type controls, indicating that changes in investigative behaviour were due to motivation to engage with a social stimulus. This evidence suggests that transgenic 5xFAD females exhibit increased social anxiety in novel environments compared to wildtype controls. Overall, transgenic 5xFAD female mice mimic some features of social withdrawal observed in human AD patients suggesting this strain may be suitable for modelling aspects of the social dysfunction observed in human patients.",

    "abstract": "Infections with human herpesviruses are ubiquitous and a public health concern worldwide. Current treatments reduce the morbidity of some manifested symptoms but neither remove the viral reservoir from the infected host nor protect from the recurrent symptom outbreaks that characterize herpetic infections. The difficulty in therapeutically tackling these viral systems stems in part from their remarkably large proteomes and the complex networks of physical and functional associations that they tailor. This study presents our efforts to unravel the complexity of the interactome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), the prototypical herpesvirus species. Inspired by our previous work, we present an improved computational pipeline for the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network reconstruction in HSV1, combining both experimentally supported and bioinformatic predictions. Our newly-developed consensus clustering approach allows us to extend the analysis beyond binary physical interactions and reveals higher order functional associations including that of pUS10 with capsid proteins. In-depth bioinformatics sequence analysis unraveled structural features of this 34-36 kDa protein reminiscent of those observed in some capsid-associated proteins in tailed bacteriophages, with which herpesviruses are thought to share a common ancestry. This suggests that pUS10 could represent an evolutionary vestige between these two viral lineages. Using immunoaffinity purification-mass spectrometry we found that pUS10 specifically co-isolated with the inner tegument protein pUL37, which binds cytosolic capsids, contributing to initial tegumentation and eventual virion maturation. In summary, this study unveils new insights at both the system and molecular levels that can help better understand the complexity behind herpesvirus infections.",

    "abstract": "Voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) are used for in vitro drug screening and for in vivo imaging of patterns of electrical activity. However, wide application of this technology is limited by poor sensitivity. A promising approach uses a 2-component system consisting of charged membrane permeable quenchers together with fluorophores labeling one side of the membrane; this produces voltage-dependent fluorescence quenching. However, to achieve good sensitivity, the quencher compound must be used at high concentrations, which can perturb the membrane capacitance or have other pharmacological effects. By developing tethered bichromophoric fluorophore quencher (TBFQ) dyes, where the fluorophore and quencher are covalently connected by a long hydrophobic chain, the concentration required is minimized, and the sensitivity is maximized. A series of 13 TBFQ dyes based on the AminoNaphthylEthenylPyridinium (ANEP) fluorophore and the dipicrylamine anion (DPA) quencher have been synthesized and tested in an artificial lipid bilayer apparatus. The best one from the screening, TBFQ1, shows a 2.5 fold change in fluorescence per 100mV change in membrane potential, and the response kinetics is in 10-20 ms range. This sensitivity is an order of magnitude better than commonly used fluorescent voltage sensors. The design principles for TBFQ VSDs described here can be readily extended to other spectral regions and promise to greatly enhance our ability to monitor electrical activity in cells and tissues.",

Here, we describe a mechanism by which the nuclear and cytoplasmic arms of the silencing mechanism are linked. During mitosis of Drosophila spermatogonia, nuclear Piwi interacts with nuage, the compartment that mediates the cytoplasmic arm of piRNA-mediated silencing. At the end of mitosis, Piwi leaves nuage to return to the nucleus. We found that dissociation of Piwi from nuage occurs at the depolymerizing microtubules of the central spindle, mediated by a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A. Depletion of klp10A delays Piwis return to the nucleus and affects piRNA production, suggesting the importance of nuclear-cytoplasmic communication in piRNA biogenesis. We propose that cell cycle-dependent communication between the nuclear and cytoplasmic arms of the piRNA pathway plays important roles in coordinated piRNA production.",

As hypothesized, we found that the susceptibility of larger hosts and hosts from lower latitudes was strongly influenced by thermal mismatches. Furthermore, hosts of conservation concern are more susceptible than others following thermal mismatches, suggesting that thermal mismatches might have contributed to recent amphibian declines.\\n\\nData Accessibility StatementShould the manuscript be accepted, the data supporting the results will be archived in an appropriate public repository such as Dryad or Figshare and the data DOI will be included at the end of the article.",

However, activation of the hypoxia response has been shown to protect mice against metabolic dysfunction2-4. We used Hb levels as an indicator for oxygenation status and studied its association with >170 anthropometric and metabolic parameters in two Finnish birth cohorts both in cross-sectional and longitudinal design (max n = 7,175). Here we show a positive linear association between Hb levels and body mass index (BMI). Subjects with the lower Hb levels had better glucose tolerance, lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels, less adverse metabolite profiles and lower inflammatory load. Notably, these associations were not only mediated by the lower BMI, and the effect size of many of them increased with age. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses indicated shared genetic determinants between Hb levels and BMI, insulin, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses could not demonstrate causal relationships between Hb and metabolic parameters. However, manipulation of Hb levels by venesection in mice showed evidence for causal associations with body weight and metabolic parameters. Our findings suggest that lower-end normal Hb levels may be favorable for systemic metabolism involving mild chronic activation of the hypoxia response. Therefore modulation of Hb levels could be a novel strategy towards maintenance of metabolic health.",

Here we present a database of 10,449 morphological descriptions of insect eggs, with records for 6,706 unique insect species and representatives from every extant hexapod order. The dataset includes eggs whose volumes span more than eight orders of magnitude. We created this database by partially automating the extraction of egg traits from the primary literature. In the process, we overcame challenges associated with large-scale phenotyping by designing and employing custom bioinformatic solutions to common problems. We matched the taxa in this database to the currently accepted scientific names in taxonomic and genetic databases, which will facilitate the use of this data for testing pressing evolutionary hypotheses in offspring size evolution.",

    "abstract": "The effects of cilium length on the dynamics of cilia motion were investigated by high-speed video microscopy of uniciliate mutants of the swimming alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Cells with short cilia were obtained by deciliating cells via pH shock and allowing cilia to reassemble for limited times. The frequency of cilia beating was estimated from motion of the cell body and of the cilium. Key features of the ciliary waveform were quantified from polynomial curves fitted to the cilium in each image frame. Most notably, periodic beating did not emerge until the cilium reached a critical length between 2-4 {micro}m. Surprisingly, in cells that exhibited periodic beating, the frequency of beating was similar for all lengths with only a slight decrease in frequency as length increased from 4 {micro}m to the normal length of 10-12 {micro}m. The waveform average curvature (rad/{micro}m) was also conserved as the cilium grew. The mechanical metrics of ciliary propulsion: force, torque, and power all increased in proportion to length. Mechanical efficiency of beating appeared to be maximal at the normal wild-type length of 10-12 m. These quantitative features of ciliary behavior illuminate the biophysics of cilia motion and, in future studies, may help distinguish competing hypotheses of the underlying mechanism of oscillation.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms of viral oncogenesis are diverse and include the off-target activity of enzymes expressed by the infected cells, which evolved to target viral genomes for controlling their infection. Among these enzymes, the single-strand DNA editing capability of APOBECs represent a well-conserved viral infection response that can also cause untoward mutations in host DNA. Here we show, after evaluating somatic single-nucleotide variations and transcriptome data in 240 gastric cancer samples, a positive correlation between APOBEC3s mRNA-expression and the APOBEC-mutation signature, both increased in EBV+ tumors. The correlation was reinforced by the observation of APOBEC-mutations preferentially occuring in transcriptionally-active loci. The EBV-infection and APOBEC3 mutation-signature axis was confirmed in a validation cohort of 112 gastric cancer patients. Our findings suggest that APOBEC3 upregulation in EBV+ cancer may boost the mutation load, providing further clues to the mechanisms of EBV-induced gastric carcinogenesis. After further validation, this EBV-APOBEC axis may prove to be a secondary driving force in the mutational evolution of EBV+ gastric tumors, whose consequences in terms of prognosis and treatment implications should be vetted.",

    "abstract": "The association between lower birth weight and childhood asthma is well established by observational studies. However, it remains unclear whether the influence of lower birth weight on asthma can persist into adulthood. Here, we conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the causal relationship of birth weight on the risk of adult asthma. Specifically, we carefully selected genetic instruments based on summary statistics obtained from large-scale genome-wide association meta-analyses of birth weight (up to ~160,000 individuals) and adult asthma (up to ~62,000 individuals). We performed Mendelian randomization using two separate approaches: a genetic risk score approach and a two-sample inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach. With 37 genetic instruments for birth weight, we estimated the causal effect per one standard deviation (SD) change of birth weight to be an odds ratio (OR) of 1.00 (95% CI 0.98~1.03, p=0.737) using the genetic risk score method. We did not observe nonlinear relationship or gender difference for the estimated causal effect. In addition, with the IVW method, we estimated the causal effect of birth weight on adult asthma was observed (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.84~1.24, p=0.813). Additionally, the iMAP method provides no additional genome-wide evidence supporting the causal effects of birth weight on adult asthma. The result of the IVW method was robust against various sensitivity analyses, and MR-PRESSO and the Egger regression showed that no instrument outliers and no horizontal pleiotropy were likely to bias the results. Overall, this Mendelian randomization study provides no evidence for the fetal origins of diseases hypothesis for adult asthma, implying that the impact of birth weight on asthma in years of children and adolescents does not persist into adult and previous findings may be biased by confounders.",

    "abstract": "The impact of leisure time or recreational physical activity (RPA) on cancer risk has been extensively studied. However, the association of the occupational physical activity (OPA), which differs in dose and intensity from RPA, with different cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), has received less attention. Here, we present data from a case-control study which was conducted for assessing the risk factors for ESCC. Histopathologically confirmed 703 ESCC cases and 1664 controls, individually matched to the respective cases for age, sex and district of residence were recruited. Information on type, duration and intensity of physical activity was obtained in face-to-face interviews with participants using a structured questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A high level of occupational physical activity was associated with increased ESCC risk (OR = 2.17, 95% CI; 1.41 - 3.32), compared to subjects with moderate occupational physical activity. The association with ESCC risk was stronger in strenuous workers (OR = 3.64, 95% CI; 2.13 - 6.20). The association of strenuous OPA with ESCC risk persisted only in subjects that were involved in strenuous activities for equal to or greater than 5days/week. Our study suggests a possible association of strenuous occupational physical activity with ESCC risk. Although, our results were adjusted for multiple factors including indicators of socioeconomic status, more replicative occupational epidemiological studies are needed to rule out any residual confounding.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoid drugs are widely used to treat immune-related diseases, but their use is limited by side effects and by resistance, which especially occurs in macrophage-dominated diseases. In order to improve glucocorticoid therapies, more research is required into the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action. In the present study, we have used a zebrafish model for inflammation to study glucocorticoid effects on the innate immune response. In zebrafish larvae, the migration of neutrophils towards a site of injury is inhibited by the synthetic glucocorticoid beclomethasone, while migration of macrophages is glucocorticoid resistant. We show that wounding-induced increases in expression of genes encoding neutrophil-specific chemoattractants (Il8 and Cxcl18b) are attenuated by beclomethasone, but that beclomethasone does not attenuate the induction of the genes encoding Ccl2 and Cxcl11aa, which we show to be required for macrophage recruitment. RNA sequencing on Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)-sorted macrophages showed that the vast majority of the wounding-induced transcriptional changes in these cells are inhibited by beclomethasone, whereas a small subset is glucocorticoid-insensitive. As a result, beclomethasone decreases the number of macrophages that differentiate towards a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype, which we demonstrated using a tnfa:eGFP-F reporter line and analysis of macrophage morphology. We conclude that the glucocorticoid resistance of the wounding-induced macrophage migration is due to the insensitivity of the induction of macrophage-specific chemoattractants to glucocorticoid inhibition, which may explain the relative resistance of macrophage-dominated diseases to glucocorticoid therapy. However, the induction of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages is strongly attenuated, which inhibits their differentiation to an M1 phenotype.\\n\\nSummary statementIn a zebrafish model for inflammation, glucocorticoids do not affect the migration of macrophages, but inhibit differentiation towards an M1 phenotype, by strongly attenuating transcriptional responses in these cells.",

    "abstract": "Interaction of apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms with amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides is considered a critical determinant of the progression of Alzheimers disease. However, molecular mechanism of the apoE-A{beta} interaction is poorly understood. Here we characterize the nature of the apoE-A{beta} complexes and identify the region of apoE that interacts with A{beta}. We have prepared three distinct fragments of apoE4, viz., the N-terminal fragment (NTF), hinge domain fragment (HDF) and C-terminal fragment (CTF) to compare its interactions with A{beta}. Kinetics of aggregation of A{beta} is delayed dramatically in presence of low, substoichiometric concentrations of both NTF and CTF in lipid-free, as well as, in lipidated forms. Effect of HDF is found to be small. Strong inhibition by NTF and CTF at substoichiometric concentrations indicate interactions with the  intermediates or the oligomers of A{beta}. Kinetics of Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between full-length apoE4 labeled with EDANS at positions 62, 139, 210, 247, and 276 and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled A{beta} further support involvement of multiple regions of apoE in the interactions. Since the interactions involve intermediates of A{beta} quantitative evaluation of the binding affinities are not feasible. Hence we employed a competitive binding assay to examine whether the N- and C-terminal domains interact cooperatively. Addition of unlabeled full-length apoE eliminates the FRET between EDANS-NTF + EDANS-CTF and TMR-A{beta} almost completely but not vice versa. Furthermore, full-length apoE but not the equimolar mixture of the fragments could displace the already bound EDANS-apoE molecules from the complexes. Therefore, binding affinity of the A{beta} oligomers to the intact full-length apoE is much higher than the affinity to the domains when mixed together as fragments. Thus, our results indicate that apoE-A{beta} complex formation is mediated by positively cooperative multivalent binding between the multiple sites on apoE and the oligomeric forms of A{beta}.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSuicide only present the tip of the iceberg of maternal mental health issues. Only a fraction of pregnant women with suicidal ideation proceeds to intentional self-harm (ISH) and even a smaller proportion are fatal. The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of depression, suicidal ideation (present and past) and history of ISH among pregnant mothers in rural Sri Lanka.\\n\\nMethodsWe have conducted a hospital based cross sectional study in the third largest hospital in Sri Lanka and a another tertiary care center. Pregnant women admitted to hospital at term were included as study participants. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), a self-administered questionnaire for demographic and clinical data and a data extraction sheet to get pregnancy related data from the pregnancy record was used.\\n\\nResultsThe study sample consisted of 475 pregnant women in their third trimester. For the tenth question of EPDS \\\"the thought of harming myself has occurred to me during last seven days\\\" was answered as \\\"yes quite a lot\\\" by four (0.8%), \\\"yes sometimes\\\" by eleven (2.3%) and hardly ever by 13 (2.7%). Two additional pregnant women reported that they had suicidal ideation during the early part of the current pregnancy period though they are not having it now. Four (0.8%) pregnant women reported having a history of ISH during the current pregnancy. History of ISH prior to this pregnancy was reported by eight women and five of them were reported to hospitals, while others were managed at home. Of the 475 pregnant females included in the study, 126 (26.5%) had an EPDS score more than nine, showing probable anxiety and depression. Pregnant women who had primary/post-primary or tertiary education compared to those who were in-between those two categories were at higher risk of high EPDS with a OR of 1.94 (95% CI 1.1-3.3). Reported suicidal ideation prior to pregnancy had a OR of 6.4 (95% CI 2.3-17.5).\\n\\nConclusionsBased on our data, we conservatively estimate around 3000 ISH annually in Sri Lanka, which should be considered as a high priority for an urgent intervention.\\n\\nPlain English SummaryMental disturbances are common during pregnancy. Most of the time, these are normal. However, these disturbances may become serious and lead to self-harm and suicide. In this study, we estimated the proportion of pregnant women who had depression and idea of self-harming during pregnancy.\\n\\nRespondents were pregnant women admitted to two large hospitals for the childbirth. They answered a list o questions about the thought of self-harm and attempts of self-harm during the present as well as past pregnancies.\\n\\nRespondents included 475 pregnant women. Of them, 3.1% reported that \\\"the thought of self-harming has occurred to them during last seven days quite a lot (0.8%) or sometimes\\\" (2.3%). Four (0.8%) pregnant women reported that they actually did it to some extent. Of the 475 pregnant women included in the study, 126 (26.5%) had symptoms of anxiety/depression. Level of education seemed to have an association with anxiety and depression. When women reported that they had thought of self-harm prior to pregnancy, they were about 6.4 times more likely to have depression/anxiety during the pregnancy. Adding a simple screening question (as we used in this study) during the initial pregnancy assessment to detect history of suicidal thoughts will be helpful in identification of high-risk mothers for depression and suicide.",

    "abstract": "Spatially selective firing in the forms of place cells, grid cells, boundary vector/border cells and head direction cells are the basic building blocks of a canonical spatial navigation system centered on the hippocampal-entorhinal complex. While head direction cells can be found throughout the brain, spatial tuning outside the hippocampal formation are often non-specific or conjunctive to other representations such as a reward. Although the precise mechanism of spatially selective activities is not understood, various studies show sensory inputs (particularly vision) heavily modulate spatial representation in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit. To better understand the contribution from other sensory inputs in shaping spatial representation in the brain, we recorded from the primary somatosensory cortex in foraging rats. To our surprise, we were able to identify the full complement of spatial activity patterns reported in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, namely, place cells, head direction cells, boundary vector/border cells, grid cells and conjunctive cells. These newly identified somatosensory spatial cell types form a spatial map outside the hippocampal formation and support the hypothesis that location information is necessary for body representation in the somatosensory cortex, and may be analogous to spatially tuned representations in the motor cortex relating to the movement of body parts. Our findings are transformative in our understanding of how spatial information is used and utilized in the brain, as well as functional operations of the somatosensory cortex in the context of rehabilitation with brain-machine interfaces.",

Most research investigating this neurodevelopmental disorder has focused on music perception, but pitch also has a critical role for intentional and emotional prosody in speech. Two previous studies investigating amusics emotional prosody recognition have shown either some deficit or no deficit (compared to controls). However, these previous studies have used only long sentence stimuli, which allow for limited control over acoustic content. Here, we tested amusic individuals for emotional prosody perception in sentences and vowels. For each type of material, participants performed an emotion categorization task, followed by intensity ratings of the recognized emotion. Compared to controls, amusic individuals had similar recognition of emotion in sentences, but poorer performance in vowels, especially when distinguishing sad and neutral stimuli. These lower performances in amusics were linked with difficulties in processing pitch and spectro-temporal parameters of the vowel stimuli. For emotion intensity, neither sentence nor vowel ratings differed between participant groups, suggesting preserved implicit processing of emotional prosody in amusia. These findings can be integrated into previous data showing preserved implicit processing of pitch and emotion in amusia alongside deficits in explicit recognition tasks. They are thus further supporting the hypothesis of impaired conscious analysis of pitch and timbre in this neurodevelopmental disorder.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAmusics showed preserved emotional prosody recognition in sentences\\nC_LIO_LIAmusics showed a deficit for emotional prosody recognition in short voice samples\\nC_LIO_LIPreserved intensity ratings of emotions in amusia suggest spared implicit processes\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate causes of correlated evolution among sites in a genome remain difficult to tease apart. To address this problem directly, we performed a high-throughput search for correlated evolution among sites associated with resistance to a fluoroquinolone antibiotic using whole genome data from clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, before validating our computational predictions experimentally. We show that for at least two sites, this correlation is underlain by epistasis. Our analysis also revealed eight additional pairs of synonymous substitutions displaying correlated evolution underlain by physical linkage, rather than selection associated with antibiotic resistance. Our results provide direct evidence that both epistasis and physical linkage among sites can drive the correlated evolution identified by high throughput computational tools. In other words, the observation of correlated evolution is not by itself sufficient evidence to guarantee that the sites in question are epistatic; such a claim requires additional evidence, ideally coming from direct estimates of epistasis, based on experimental evidence.",

    "abstract": "Success in precision medicine depends on our ability to determine which rare human genetic variants have functional effects. Classical homocystinuria--characterized by elevated homocyst(e)ine in plasma and urine--is caused by primarily-rare variants in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. About half of patients respond to vitamin B6 therapy. With early detection in newborns, existing therapies are highly effective. Functional CBS variants, especially those that respond to vitamin B6, can be detected based on their ability to restore growth in yeast cells lacking CYS4 (the yeast ortholog of CBS). This assay has previously been carried out only  reactively after first observation of a variant in patients. Here we describe a  proactive comprehensive missense variant effect map for human CBS. Together, saturation codon-replacement mutagenesis, en masse growth selection at different vitamin B6 levels, and sequencing yielded a  look-up table for CBS missense variant function and vitamin B6-remediability in yeast. The CBS variant effect map identified disease variants and predicted both disease severity (r = 0.82) and human clinical response to vitamin B6 (r = 0.89). Thus, highly-multiplexed cell-based assays can yield proactive maps of variant function and patient response to therapy, even for rare variants not previously seen in the clinic.",
