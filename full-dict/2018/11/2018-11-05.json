    "abstract": "The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) attenuates the rate of protein synthesis while inducing expression of stress proteins in cells. Various insults activate kinases that phosphorylate the GTPase eIF2 leading to inhibition of its exchange factor eIF2B. Vanishing White Matter (VWM) is a neurological disease caused by eIF2B mutations that, like phosphorylated eIF2, reduce its activity. We show that introduction of a human VWM mutation into mice leads to persistent ISR induction in the central nervous system. ISR activation precedes myelin loss and development of motor deficits. Remarkably, long-term treatment with a novel eIF2B activator, 2BAct, prevents all measures of pathology and normalizes the transcriptome and proteome of VWM mice. 2BAct stimulates the remaining activity of mutant eIF2B complex in vivo, abrogating the maladaptive stress response. Thus, 2BAct-like molecules may provide a promising therapeutic approach for VWM and provide relief from chronic ISR induction in a variety of other disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "Neurexins are neuronal adhesion molecules important for synapse maturation, function, and plasticity. Neurexins have been genetically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia, but can have variable penetrance and phenotypic severity. Heritability studies indicate that a significant percentage of risk for ASD and schizophrenia includes environmental factors, highlighting the poorly understood interplay between genetic and environmental factors in pathogenesis of these disorders. The singular C. elegans ortholog of human neurexins, nrx-1, controls experience-dependent morphologic remodeling of a GABAergic neuron in adult males. Here I show that this GABAergic neurons morphology is altered in response to each of three environmental stressors (nutritional, heat, or genotoxic stress) applied during sexual maturation, but not during adulthood. Increased outgrowth of axon-like neurites following adolescent stress results from an altered morphologic plasticity that occurs upon entry into adulthood. Despite axonal remodeling being induced by each of the three stressors, only nutritional stress (starvation) impacts behavior and is dependent on neurexin/nrx-1. Heat or genotoxic stress during sexual maturation did not alter behavior despite inducing GABAergic neuron remodeling, and this remodeling was independent of neurexin/nrx-1. Remodeling induced by starvation stress was found be dependent on neuroligin/nlg-1, the canonical binding partner for neurexin/nrx-1, as well as the stress signaling transcription factors FOXO/daf-16 and HSF1/hsf-1, each of which was also found to have unique roles in remodeling induced by heat and UV stress. The differential molecular mechanisms underlying GABAergic neuron remodeling in response to different stressors, and the disparate effects of stressors on behavior, is a novel paradigm for understanding how genetics, environmental exposures, and plasticity may contribute to brain dysfunction in ASDs and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Humans use emotions to decipher complex cascades of internal events. However, which mechanisms link descriptions of affective states to brain activity is unclear, with evidence supporting either local or distributed processing. A biologically favorable alternative is provided by the notion of gradient, which postulates the isomorphism between functional representations of stimulus features and cortical distance. Here, we use fMRI activity evoked by an emotionally charged movie and continuous ratings of the perceived emotion intensity to reveal the topographic organization of affective states. Results show that three orthogonal and spatially overlapping gradients encode the polarity, complexity and intensity of emotional experiences in right temporo-parietal territories. The spatial arrangement of these gradients allows the brain to map a variety of affective states within a single patch of cortex. As this organization resembles how sensory regions represent psychophysical properties (e.g., retinotopy), we propose emotionotopy as a principle of emotion coding.",

There are no large scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age (GA).\\n\\nMethodsA one-day point prevalence study (PPS) was performed as part of the European Study of Neonatal Exposure to Excipients (ESNEE) from January to June 2012. All neonatal prescriptions and demographic data were registered in a web-based database. The impact of GA and region on prescription rate were analyzed with logistic regression.\\n\\nResultsIn total, 21 European countries with 89 neonatal units participated. Altogether 2173 prescriptions given to 726 neonates were registered. The 10 drugs with the highest prescription rate were multivitamins, vitamin D, caffeine, gentamicin, amino acids for parenteral nutrition, phytomenadione, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, fat emulsion for parenteral nutrition and probiotics. The six most commonly prescribed ATC groups (alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system) covered 98% of prescriptions. GA significantly affected the use of all commonly used drug groups. Geographic region influenced the use of alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous and respiratory system drugs.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile GA-dependent differences in neonatal drug use were expected, regional variations (except for systemic anti-infectives) indicate a need for cooperation in developing harmonized evidence-based guidelines and suggest priorities for collaborative work.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical molecule that plays an important role in hypoxic stress. We studied the impact of hypoxia-induced NO production on the expression of genes and production of metabolites involved in carbon, oxygen sensing, nitrogen, and antioxidant metabolism using wild type (WT), non-symbiotic haemoglobin-overexpressing (Hb+) and nitrate reductase double mutant (nia1,2) of Arabidopsis. Futher application of NO scavenger cPTIO was used to confirm NO role. We found that imposing hypoxia leads to the increaseof NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in WT, while the reduced levels of NO and higher levels of ROS were observed in roots of Hb+ and nia1,2 mutant. Expression of the genes encoding oxygen sensing and the enzymes involved in fermentative pathways, their activities and metabolite levels were highly induced in WT suggesting that NO plays a role in the induction of fermentation. Several genes and metabolites involved in the TCA cycle were also induced in WT in comparison to Hb+ and nia mutant line suggesting that NO can accelerate TCA cycle to regenerate reducing equivalents under hypoxia. Interestingly, we found that the genes and metabolites involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle were modulated by NO under hypoxia. The alternative oxidasegene (AOX1A) was induced under hypoxia in WTdue to increased levels of NO rather than ROS. Futher, we found that NO improves plant survival. Overall these findings suggest that NO is a major player in plant survival under hypoxia by modulating gene expression and metabolite levels of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen sensing and antioxidant metabolism.\\n\\nHighlightHypoxia-induced nitric oxide plays a central role in activation of genes and metabolites involved in fermentation, TCA cycle, nitrogen and antioxidant metabolism",

In Escherichia coli, initiation of MMR involves recognition of the mismatch by MutS, recruitment of MutL, activation of endonuclease MutH and DNA strand incision at a hemimethylated GATC site. Here we studied the mechanism of communication that couples mismatch recognition to daughter strand incision. We investigated the effect of catalytically-deficient Cas9 as well as stalled RNA polymerase as roadblocks placed on DNA in between the mismatch and GATC site in ensemble and single molecule nanomanipulation incision assays. The MMR proteins were observed to incise GATC sites beyond a roadblock, albeit with reduced efficiency. This residual incision is completely abolished upon shortening the disordered linker regions of MutL. These results indicate that roadblock bypass can be fully attributed to the long, disordered linker regions in MutL and establish that communication during MMR initiation occurs along the DNA backbone.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the StudyMale gametophytes of most seed plants deliver sperm to eggs via a pollen tube. Pollen tube growth rates (PTGRs) of angiosperms are exceptionally rapid, a pattern attributed to more effective haploid selection under stronger pollen competition. Paradoxically, whole genome duplication (WGD) has been common in angiosperms but rare in gymnosperms. Pollen tube polyploidy should initially accelerate PTGR because increased heterozygosity and gene dosage should increase metabolic rates, however polyploidy should also independently increase tube cell size, causing more work which should decelerate growth. We asked how genome size changes have affected the evolution of seed plant PTGRs.\\n\\nMethodsWe assembled a phylogenetic tree of 451 species with known PTGRs. We then used comparative phylogenetic methods to detect effects of neo-polyploidy (within-genus origins), DNA content, and WGD history on PTGR, and correlated evolution of PTGR and DNA content.\\n\\nKey ResultsGymnosperms had significantly higher DNA content and slower PTGR optima than angiosperms, and their PTGR and DNA content were negatively correlated. For angiosperms, 89% of model weight favored Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models with a faster PTGR optimum for neo-polyploids, but PTGR and DNA content were not correlated. In comparisons of within-genus and intraspecific-cytotype pairs, PTGRs of neo-polyploids [&le;] paleo-polyploids.\\n\\nConclusionsGenome size increases should negatively affect PTGR when genetic consequences of WGDs are minimized, as found in intra-specific autopolyploids (low heterosis) and gymnosperms (few WGDs). But in angiosperms, the higher PTGR optimum of neo-polyploids and non-negative PTGR-DNA content correlation suggest that recurrent WGDs have caused substantial PTGR evolution in a non-haploid state.",

    "abstract": "ABSTARCTAdenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a very common post-transcriptional modification that can lead to A-to-G changes at the RNA level and compensate for G-to-A genomic changes to a certain extent. It has been shown that each healthy individual can carry dozens of missense variants predicted to be severely deleterious. Why strongly detrimental variants are preserved in a population and not eliminated by negative natural selection remains mostly unclear. Here we ask if RNA editing correlates with the burden of deleterious A/G polymorphisms in a population. Integrating genome and transcriptome sequencing data from 447 human lymphoblastoid cell lines, we show that nonsynonymous editing activities (prevalence/level) are negatively correlated with the deleteriousness of A-to-G genomic changes and positively correlated with that of G-to-A genomic changes within the population. We find a significantly negative correlation between nonsynonymous editing activities and allele frequency of A within the population. This negative editing-allele frequency correlation is particularly strong when editing sites are located in highly important genes/loci. Examinations of deleterious missense variants from the 1000 genomes project further show a significantly higher mutational burden in G-to-A changes than in other types of changes. The level of the mutational burden in G-to-A changes increases with increasing deleterious effects of the changes. Moreover, the deleteriousness of G-to-A changes is significantly positively correlated with the percentage of binding motif of editing enzymes at the variants. Overall, we show that nonsynonymous editing contributes to the increased burden of G-to-A missense mutations in healthy individuals, expanding RNA editing in pathogenomics studies.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) generates phenotypic diversity to persist and survive the harsh conditions encountered during infection. MTB avoids immune effectors and antibacterial killing by entering into distinct physiological states. The surviving cells, persisters, are a major barrier to the timely and relapse-free treatment of tuberculosis (TB). We present for the first time, PerSort, a method to isolate and characterize persisters in the absence of antibiotic, or other pressure. We demonstrate the value of PerSort to isolate translationally dormant cells that pre-exist in small numbers within Mycobacterium spp. cultures growing under optimal conditions, but which dramatically increased in proportion under stress conditions. The translationally dormant subpopulation exhibited multidrug tolerance and regrowth properties consistent with persister cells. Furthermore, PerSort enabled single-cell transcriptional profiling that provided evidence that the translationally dormant persisters were generated through a variety of mechanisms, including vapC30, mazF, and relA/spoT overexpression. Finally, we demonstrate that notwithstanding the varied mechanisms by which the persister cells were generated, they converge on a similar low oxygen metabolic state that was reversed through activation of respiration to rapidly eliminate persisters fostered under host-relevant stress conditions. We conclude that PerSort provides a new tool to study MTB persisters, enabling targeted strategies to improve and shorten the treatment of TB.\n\nSummaryWe have developed a novel method, PerSort, to isolate translationally dormant cells that pre-exist in small numbers within Mycobacterium spp. cultures growing under naive conditions (i.e., absence of antibiotic treatment), but dramatically increase in proportion under stress conditions. The translationally dormant cells have high tolerance to isoniazid and rifampicin, and can regenerate the parental population structure in standard media, albeit after a significantly longer lag phase, indicating they are persister cells. Single-cell expression profiling demonstrated that the translationally dormant persister subpopulation is a mixture of vapC30, mazF, and relA/spoT overexpressing cells, indicating there are multiple pathways to become a persister cell. Regardless of the mechanism by which they are generated, the persister cells have reduced oxidative metabolism, which is reversed upon addition of L-cysteine to effect complete clearance by INH and RIF under host-related stress.",

    "abstract": "The localization and translation of mRNAs is controlled by a diverse array of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), multimolecular complexes containing mRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Fragile X granules (FXGs) are a family of RNPs that exemplify the diversity of RNA granules in the mammalian nervous system. FXGs are found in a conserved subset of neurons, where they localize exclusively to the axonal compartment. Notably, the specific RNA binding proteins and mRNAs found in FXGs depend on brain circuit and neuron type, with all forebrain FXGs containing Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the protein mutated in the human autism-related disorder Fragile X syndrome. FMRP negatively regulates FXG abundance but is not required for their association with ribosomes or mRNA. To better understand the circuit-dependent mechanisms whereby FMRP associates with and regulates FXGs, we asked how a disease-causing point mutation, I304N, in the KH2 RNA binding domain of FMRP affects these granules in two brain regions - cortex and hippocampus. We found that FMRPI304N had a reduced association with FXGs, as it was absent from approximately half of FXGs in cortex and nearly all FXGs in hippocampus. FXG abundance correlated with the number of FMRP-containing FXGs, suggesting that FMRP regulates FXG abundance by KH2-independent mechanisms that occur locally within the granules. Together, these findings illustrate that cell type-dependent mechanisms guide the assembly of similar RNA granules. Further, point mutations in RNA granule components may lead to cell type-dependent phenotypes that produce atypical forms of disorders that normally arise from more severe mutations.",

    "abstract": "Humans have long wondered about the function of mental imagery and its relationship to vision. Although visual representations are utilized during imagery, the computations they subserve are unclear. Building on a theory that treats vision as inference about the causes of sensory stimulation in an internal generative model, we propose that mental imagery is inference about the sensory consequences of predicted or remembered causes. The relation between these complementary inferences yields a relation between the brain activity patterns associated with imagery and vision. We show that this relation has the formal structure of an echo that makes encoding of imagined stimuli in low-level visual areas resemble the encoding of seen stimuli in higher areas. To test for evidence of this echo effect we developed imagery encoding models--a new tool for revealing how imagined stimuli are encoded in brain activity. We estimated imagery encoding models from brain activity measured with fMRI while human subjects imagined complex visual stimuli, and then compared these to visual encoding models estimated from a matched viewing experiment. Consistent with an echo effect, imagery encoding models in low-level visual areas exhibited decreased spatial frequency preference and larger, more foveal receptive fields, thus resembling visual encoding models in high-level visual areas where imagery and vision appeared to be almost interchangeable. Our findings support an interpretation of mental imagery as a predictive inference that is conditioned on activity in high-level visual cortex, and is related to vision through shared dependence on an internal model of the visual world.",

Electrical stimulation of a single site in visual cortex can reliably produce a percept of a spot of light in a fixed visual field location, known as a phosphene.

However, existing data do not support this assumption. Therefore, we developed a novel stimulation paradigm for VCPs termed dynamic current steering in which the visual form to be conveyed is traced on the surface of visual cortex by electrically stimulating electrodes in a dynamic sequence.

    "abstract": "In north-temperate small passerines, overwinter survival is associated with a reversibly increased maximum cold-induced metabolism (Msum). This strategy may incur increased energy consumption. Therefore, species inhabiting ecosystems characterized by cold winters and low productivity (i.e., low available energy) may be precluded from displaying an increase in maximum metabolic rates. To examine whether Msum is a flexible phenotype in such challenging environments, and ultimately uncover its underpinning mechanisms, we studied an arid-endemic small bird (Karoo scrub-robin) whose range spans a primary productivity and minimum temperature gradient. We measured Msum, body condition, mass of thermogenic muscles and two indices of cellular aerobic capacity from populations living in three environmentally different regions. We found that Msum was seasonally flexible, associated with aerobic capacity of limb muscles, but not increasing with lower temperatures, as predicted. Notwithstanding, the cold limit (temperature at which birds reached their maximum metabolic capacity) decreased in winter. These results indicate that birds from arid-zones may respond to cold conditions by altering thermosensation, rather than spending energy to produce heat in skeletal muscles.",

    "abstract": "Many protein families harbor pseudoenzymes that have lost the catalytic function of their enzymatically active counterparts. Assigning alternative function and importance to these proteins is challenging [1]. Because the evolution towards pseudoenzymes is driven by gene duplication, they often accumulate in multigene families. Plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) are prominent examples of expanded gene families. The pectolytic glycoside hydrolase family 28 (GH28) allows herbivorous insects to break down the PCW polysaccharide pectin. GH28 in the Phytophaga clade of beetles contains many active enzymes but also many inactive counterparts. Using functional characterization, gene silencing, global transcriptome analyses and recordings of life history traits, we found that not only catalytically active but also inactive GH28 proteins are part of the same pectin-digesting pathway. The robustness and plasticity of this pathway and thus its importance for the beetle is supported by extremely high steady-state expression levels and counter-regulatory mechanisms. Unexpectedly, the impact of pseudoenzymes on the pectin-digesting pathway in Phytophaga beetles exceeds even the influence of their active counterparts, such as a lowered efficiency of food-to-energy conversion and a prolongation of the developmental period.",

We present a strategy that combines sparse paramagnetic solid-state NMR restraints with physics-based atomistic simulations. Our approach explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the interpretation of experimental data through the use of a semi-quantitative mapping between the data and the restraint energy that is calibrated by extensive simulations. We apply our approach to solid-state NMR data for the model protein GB1 labeled with Cu2+-EDTA at six different sites. We are able to determine the structure to ca. 1 [A] accuracy within a single day of computation on a modest GPU cluster.

    "abstract": "While microRNAs (miRNAs) were widely considered to repress target genes at mRNA and/or protein levels, emerging evidence from in vitro experiments has shown that miRNAs can also activate gene expression in particular contexts. However, this counterintuitive observation has rarely been reported or interpreted in in vivo conditions. We systematically explored the positive correlation between miRNA and gene expressions and its potential implications in tumorigenesis, based on 8375 patient samples across 31 major human cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results indicated that positive miRNA-gene correlations are surprisingly prevalent and consistent across cancer types, and show distinct patterns than negative correlations. The top-ranked positive correlations are significantly involved in the immune cell differentiation and cell membrane signaling related processes, and display strong power in stratifying patients in terms of survival rate, demonstrating their promising clinical relevance. Although intragenic miRNAs generally tend to co-express with their host genes, a substantial portion of miRNAs shows no obvious correlation with their host gene due to non-conservation. A miRNA can upregulate a gene by inhibiting its upstream suppressor, or shares transcription factors with that gene, both leading to positive correlation. The miRNA/gene sites associated with the top-ranked positive correlations are more likely to form super-enhancers compared to randomly chosen pairs, suggesting a potential epigenetics mechanism underlying the upregulation. Wet-lab experiments revealed that positive correlations partially remain in the in vitro condition. Our study provides the field with new perspectives on the critical role of miRNA in gene regulation and novel insights regarding the complex mechanisms underlying miRNA functions, and reveals the clinical significance of the potential positive regulation of gene expression by miRNA.",

Here, using immunopeptidomics in combination with novel cell-based assays that assess TAPBPR-mediate peptide exchange, we reveal a critical role for the K22-D35 loop of TAPBPR in mediating peptide exchange on MHC I. We identify a specific leucine within this loop that enables TAPBPR to facilitate peptide dissociation from MHC I. Moreover, we delineate the molecular features of the MHC I F pocket required for TAPBPR to promote peptide dissociation in a loop-dependent manner. These data reveal that chaperone-mediated peptide editing of MHC I can occur by different mechanisms dependent on the C-terminal residue that the MHC I accommodates in its F pocket and provide novel insights that may inform the therapeutic potential of TAPBPR manipulation to increase tumour immunogenicity.\\n\\nImpact StatementThis work demonstrates for the first time that the K22-D35 loop of TAPBPR is the essential region for mediating peptide exchange and peptide selection on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, and cognitive defects in DS patients may arise form imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Understanding the mechanisms underlying such imbalances may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from DS patients overproduce OLIG2+ ventral forebrain neural progenitors. As a result, DS hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids excessively produce specific subclasses of GABAergic interneurons and cause impaired recognition memory in neuronal chimeric mice. Increased OLIG2 expression in DS cells directly upregulates interneuron lineage-determining transcription factors. shRNA-mediated knockdown of OLIG2 largely reverses abnormal gene expression in early-stage DS neural progenitors, reduces interneuron production in DS organoids and chimeric mouse brains, and improves behavioral deficits in DS chimeric mice. Thus, altered OLIG2 expression may underlie neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cognitive defects in DS patients.",

Learning in that model relies on a Bayesian-Hebbian learning rule to condition recurrent connectivity between pyramidal cells. We here demonstrate that the inclusion of a biophysically plausible double bouquet cell model can solve earlier concerns about learning rules that simultaneously learn excitation and inhibition and might thus violate Dales Principle.\\n\\nWe show that learning ability and resulting effective connectivity between functional columns of previous network models is preserved when pyramidal synapses onto double-bouquet cells are plastic under the same Hebbian-Bayesian learning rule. The proposed architecture draws on experimental evidence on double bouquet cells and effectively solves the problem of duplexed learning of inhibition and excitation by replacing recurrent inhibition between pyramidal cells in functional columns of different stimulus selectivity with a plastic disynaptic pathway. We thus show that the resulting change to the microcircuit architecture improves the models biological plausibility without otherwise impacting the models spiking activity, basic operation, and learning abilities.",

    "abstract": "A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has previously been associated with a reduction in recognition memory performance. While previous findings have highlighted that this SNP contributes to recognition memory, little is known about its influence on subprocesses of recognition, familiarity and recollection. Previous research has reported reduced hippocampal volume and decreased fractional anisotropy in carriers of the Met allele across a range of white matter tracts, including those networks that may support recognition memory. Here, we used a source memory task to measure accuracy on each recognition subprocess, in order to determine whether the Val66Met SNP influences these equally. Additionally, we compared grey matter volume between these groups for structures that underpin familiarity and recollection separately. Finally, we used probabilistic tractography to reconstruct tracts that subserve each of these two recognition systems. Behaviourally, we found group differences on the familiarity measure, but not on recollection. However, we did not find any group difference on grey- or white-matter structures. Together, these results suggest a functional influence of the Val66Met SNP that is independent of coarse structural changes, and nuance previous research highlighting the relationship between BDNF, brain structure, and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "We have used computational and experimental biology approaches to identify candidate mechanisms of action of a traditional Chinese medicine. Compound Kushen Injection (CKI), in a breast cancer cell line in which CKI causes apoptosis. Because CKI is a complex mixture of plant secondary metabolites, we used a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation and reconstitution approach to define chemical fractions required for CKI to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our initial fractionation separated major from minor compounds, and showed that the major compounds accounted for little of the activity of CKI. By systematically perturbing the major compounds in CKI we found that removal of no single major compound could alter the effect of CKI on cell viability and apoptosis. However, simultaneous removal of two major compounds identified oxymatrine and oxysophocarpine as critical compounds with respect to CKI activity. We then used RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis to correlate compound removal with gene expression and phenotype data. We determined that many compounds in CKI are required for its effectiveness in triggering apoptosis but that significant modulation of its activity is conferred by a small number of compounds. In conclusion, CKI may be typical of many plant based extracts that contain many compounds in that no single compound is responsible for all of the bioactivity of the mixture and that many compounds interact in a complex fashion to influence a network containing many targets.",

Here, we show how the shape of a defense-growth trade-off governs seasonal trait dynamics of a natural community, using high-frequency, long-term measurements of phytoplankton from Lake Constance. As expected from the lab-derived concave trade-off curve, we observed an alternating dominance of several fast-growing species with intermediate defense levels and gradual changes of the biomass-trait distribution due to seasonally changing grazing pressure. By combining data and modelling, we obtain mechanistic insights on the underlying fitness landscape, and show that low fitness differences can maintain trait variation along the trade-off curve.

Moreover, the repetitive nature of large genomes often represents a challenge in bioinformatic and downstream analyses. Here we use in-depth transcriptome sequencing to design probes for exome capture in Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra), a conifer with an estimated genome size of 29.3 Gbp and no reference genome available. We successfully applied around 55,000 self-designed probes, targeting 25,000 contigs, to DNA pools of seven populations from the Swiss Alps and identified > 140,000 SNPs in around 13,000 contigs. The probes performed equally well in pools of the closely related species Pinus sibirica; in both species, more than 70% of the targeted contigs were sequenced at a depth [&ge;] 40x, i.e. the number of haplotypes in the pool. However, a thorough analysis of individually sequenced P. cembra samples indicated that a majority of the contigs (63%) represented multi-copy genes. We therefore removed paralogous contigs based on heterozygote excess and deviation from allele balance. Without putatively paralogous contigs, allele frequencies of population pools represented accurate estimates of individually determined allele frequencies. Using population genetic and landscape genomic methods, we show that inferences of neutral and adaptive genetic variation may be biased when not accounting for such multi-copy genes. Future studies should therefore put more emphasis on identifying paralogous loci, which will be facilitated by the establishment of additional high-quality reference genomes.",

However, participants often show above-chance accuracy when asked which condition involved active/sham retrospectively.\\n\\nObjective/HypothesisWe aimed to assess the time course of sham-blinding during active and sham tDCS.

A forced-choice reaction time task was undertaken before, during and after active (10min 1mA) and sham (20s 1mA) tDCS. The anode was placed over the left primary motor cortex (C3) to target the right hand, and the cathode on the right forehead.

Several inconsistencies arise from the description of A. carishina, and given the lack of a comparison with the dentition and external characters of A. latidens, here we compare the taxonomic characters of these species. To understand the position of A. carishina in the morphospace occupied by large Anoura, we conducted a Principal Component Analysis on 12 craniodental and 11 external variables. We complement our results with further analysis of traits thought to be diagnostic for these species, including 1) an elliptical Fourier transformation analysis of the shape of the third upper premolar (P4), 2) a comparison of the area of the second (P3) and third (P4) upper premolars, and 3) a comparison of maxillary toothrow angles. We find that A. carishina is morphologically indistinguishable from A. latidens, and that there is broad overlap in morphology between A. latidens and A. geoffroyi. However several characters found in A. latidens are lacking in A. geoffroyi, including a triangular shape to the P4 caused by a medial-internal cusp enclosed by the base of the tooth, a lack of development of the anterobasal cusp in the P3, a smaller braincase, and a shorter rostrum. We reassess the distribution of Anoura latidens in Colombia, adding new records and correcting previously-published records that were misidentified. Overall, our results suggest that a stable taxonomy for the group should consider A. carishina as a junior synonym of A. latidens, and that, although A. latidens is distinguishable from A. geoffroyi, further genetic and taxonomic work is needed in to clarify species limits within the A. geoffroyi species complex.\\n\\nEl complejo de especies Anoura geoffroyi se compone de 3 especies, A. geoffroyi, A. peruana, y A. carishina. La descripcion de Anoura carishina posee varias inconsistencias, y dado que no se realizo una comparacion con A. latidens, realizamos una comparacion de los caracteres taxonomicos de ambas especies. Para entender la posicion de A. carishina en el morfoespacio ocupado por los Anoura grandes realizamos un Analisis de Componentes Principales usando 12 variables craneo-dentales y 11 variables externas. Complementamos nuestros resultados con 1) un analisis de transformacion eliptica de Fourier de la forma del tercer premolar superior (P4) 2) una comparacion del area del segundo (P3) y tercer (P4) premolares superiores y 3) una comparacion de los angulos de las hileras dentales maxilares. Encontramos que A. carishina es morfologicamente indistinguible de A. latidens y que existe una amplio superposicion en la morfologia de A. latidens y A. geoffroyi. Sin embargo, la forma del P4, una cuspide anterobasal no desarrollada en el P3, y caracteres relacionados con una caja craneana menos inflada y un rostro corto son utiles en distinguir A. latidens de A. geoffroyi. Reevaluamos la distribucion de Anoura latidens en Colombia, al agregar nuevos registros y corrigiendo registros previamente publicados que se encontraban mal identificados. En general, nuestros resultados sugieren que una taxonomia estable para el grupo deberia considerar a A. carishina como un sinonimo junior de A. latidens, que A. latidens es distinguible de A. geoffroyi utilizando medidas craneo-dentales y resalta la necesidad de estudios geneticos para esclarecer las relaciones filogeneticas entre A. latidens y el complejo de especies A. geoffroyi.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for bioelectronics is to deliver power to miniature devices inside the body. Wires are common failure points and limit device placement. On the other hand, wireless power by electromagnetic or ultrasound waves must overcome absorption by the body and impedance mismatches between air, bone, and tissue. In contrast, magnetic fields suffer little absorption by the body or differences in impedance at interfaces between air, bone, and tissue. These advantages have led to magnetically-powered stimulators based on induction or magnetothermal effects. However, fundamental limitations in these power transfer technologies have prevented miniature magnetically-powered stimulators from applications in many therapies and disease models because they do not operate in clinical \"high-frequency\" ranges above 50 Hz. Here we show that magnetoelectric materials - applied in bioelectronic devices - enable miniature magnetically-powered neural stimulators that can operate up to clinically-relevant high-frequencies. As an example, we show that ME neural stimulators can effectively treat the symptoms of a hemi-Parkinsons disease model in freely behaving rodents. We further demonstrate that ME-powered devices can be miniaturized to mm-sized devices, fully implanted, and wirelessly powered in freely behaving rodents. These results suggest that ME materials are an excellent candidate for wireless power delivery that will enable miniature bioelectronics for both clinical and research applications.",

    "abstract": "Adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia are important parameters in describing abnormalities in adipogenesis that are concomitant to diseases such as obesity, diabetes, anorexia nervosa and osteoporosis. Therefore, technical developments in detection of adipocytes become an important driving factor in adipogenesis research. Current techniques such as optical microscopy and flow cytometry are available in detection and examination of adipocytes, driving cell- and molecular-based research of adipogenesis. Even though microscopy techniques are common and straightforward, they are restricted for manipulation and separation of the cells. Flow cytometry is an alternative, but mature adipocytes are fragile and cannot withstand the flow process. Other separation methods usually require labeling of the cells or usage of microfluidic platforms that utilize fluids with different densities. Magnetic levitation is a novel label-free technology with the principle of movement of cells towards the lower magnetic field in a paramagnetic medium depending on their individual densities. In this study, we used magnetic levitation device for density-based single cell detection of differentiated adipogenic cells in heterogeneous populations. Results showed that magnetic levitation platform was sensitive to changes in lipid content of mesenchymal stem cells committed to adipogenesis and it could be successfully used to detect adipogenic differentiation of cells.",

    "abstract": "Although most proteins conform to the classical one-structure/one-function paradigm, an increasing number of proteins with dual structures and functions are emerging. These fold-switching proteins remodel their secondary structures in response to cellular stimuli, fostering multi-functionality and tight cellular control. Accurate predictions of fold-switching proteins could both suggest underlying mechanisms for uncharacterized biological processes and reveal potential drug targets. Previously, we developed a prediction method for fold-switching proteins based on secondary structure predictions and structure-based thermodynamic calculations. Given the large number of genomic sequences without homologous experimentally characterized structures, however, we sought to predict fold-switching proteins from their sequences alone. To do this, we leveraged state-of-the-art secondary structure predictions, which require only amino acid sequences but are not currently designed to identify structural duality in proteins. Thus, we hypothesized that incorrect and inconsistent secondary structure predictions could be good initial predictors of fold-switching proteins. We found that secondary structure predictions of fold-switching proteins with solved structures are indeed less accurate than secondary structure predictions of non-fold-switching proteins with solved structures. These inaccuracies result largely from the conformations of fold-switching proteins that are underrepresented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and, consequently, the training sets of secondary structure predictors. Given that secondary structure predictions are homology-based, we hypothesized that decontextualizing the inaccurately-predicted regions of fold-switching proteins could weaken the homology relationships between these regions and their overpopulated structural representatives. Thus, we reran secondary structure predictions on these regions in isolation and found that they were significantly more inconsistent than in regions of non-fold-switching proteins. Thus, inconsistent secondary structure predictions can serve as a preliminary marker of fold switching. These findings have implications for genomics and the future development of secondary structure predictors.",

Imaging markers of small vessel disease (SVD) (white matter hyperintensities [WMH] on structural MRI, visual scores and volume; perivascular spaces; lacunes and microbleeds), and vascular risk measures were assessed in both cohorts. We assessed associations between retinal and brain measurements using structural equation modelling and regression analysis. In the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 arteriolar fractal dimension accounted for 4% of the variance in WMH load. In the Mild Stroke Study lower arteriolar fractal dimension was associated with deep WMH scores (odds ratio [OR] 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87). No other retinal measure was associated with SVD. Reduced fractal dimension, a measure of vascular complexity, is related to SVD imaging features in older people.

We used this material to characterize the genome-wide transcriptomic response to selection in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) before, during and after floral transition in realistic field conditions during two consecutive years.

We found that roughly half of maize genes were expressed in the SAM, 59.3% of which were differentially expressed. We detected a majority of genes with differential expression between inbreds and across meristem status, and retrieved a subset of 2,451 genes involved in the response to selection. Among these, we found a significant enrichment for genes with known function in maize flowering time. Furthermore, they were more often shared between inbreds than expected by chance, suggesting convergence of gene expression.

Here we report unexpected topological incongruence among mitochondrial markers as evidence of mitochondrial introgression in the phylogenetic history of Stylophora species distributed along broad geographic ranges. Our analyses include specimens from the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the full latitudinal (2000 km) and environmental gradient (21{degrees}C-33{degrees}C) of the Red Sea (N=827). The analysis of Stylophora lineages in the framework of the mitogenome phylogenies of the family Pocilloporidae, coupled with analyses of recombination, shows the first evidence of asymmetric patterns of introgressive hybridization associated to mitochondrial recombination in this genus. Hybridization likely occurred between an ancestral lineage restricted to the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden basins and migrants from the Indo-Pacific/Indian Ocean that reached the Gulf of Aden. The resulting hybrid lives in sympatry with the descendants of the parental Red Sea lineage, from which it inherited most of its mtDNA (except a highly variable recombinant region that includes the nd6, atp6, and mtORF genes) and expanded its range into the hottest region of the Arabian Gulf, where it is scarcely found. Noticeably, across the Red Sea both lineages exhibit striking differences in terms of phylogeographic patterns, clades-morphospecies association, and zooxanthellae composition. Our data suggest that the early colonization of the Red Sea by the ancestral lineage, which involved overcoming multiple habitat changes and extreme temperatures, resulted in changes in mitochondrial proteins, which led to its successful adaptation to the novel environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the considerable progress that has been achieved in the development of vaccines, infectious diseases continue to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. The first year of life remains the time of greatest risk with more than half of all deaths caused by infectious diseases in children under the age of five years occurring during this period. For most infections, antibodies are the strongest immune correlate of protective immunity and characterizing the breadth of the antibody repertoire against infectious diseases in early life is key to profiling individual disease risk.\\n\\nMethodsIn order to comprehensively profile the antibody repertoire against infectious diseases in early life, we developed a synthetic peptide-based microarray to simultaneously measure antibodies against forty one common infectious diseases. 82 empirically-validated linear B-cell epitopes were selected from the Immune Epitope Database (IEBD), expressed as synthetic peptides and printed onto microarray glass slides (microarray chip). The chip was used to simultaneously measure antigen-specific IgG and IgA in serum and mucosal samples from thirty eight infants and young children presenting to hospital with different illnesses. We also used the data from the microarray to estimate antibody decay kinetics for the five most frequently detected antigens during the first year of life.\\n\\nResultsA synthetic peptide microarray to measure antibodies against forty one infectious diseases was successfully developed. Although the combination of antigens that were recognized were different for each child, antigens derived from Epstein-Barr virus, poliovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, plasmodium falciparum and varicella zoster were recognized by most study participants. While the combination of antigens recognized in serum was generally similar as those recognized in mucosal samples, antibodies to antigens such as herpesvirus, rubella and echinococcus were more predominant in either serum or mucosal samples. With the exception of the pneumococcus, we observed a progressive decline in serum IgG specific to all the infections above in the first six months of life. Pneumococcal IgG in serum exhibited a continuous rise in the first six months of life.\\n\\nConclusionsWe successfully developed a synthetic peptide microarray and used it to profile the diversity of systemic and mucosal antibody against multiple infectious diseases in children. The data from the slide provide a snapshot overview of the breadth and kinetics of infectious disease antibodies early in life and opens the opportunity for conducting in-depth multi, multi-target serological studies of infectious diseases in future.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are critical for the function and maintenance of myelinated axons notably through ATP production. A by-product of this activity is reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly deleterious for neurons. While ROS and metabolism are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, it is still unclear how axonal activity or myelin modulates ATP and ROS production in axonal mitochondria. We imaged and quantified mitochondrial ATP and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in resting or stimulated peripheral nerve myelinated axons in vivo, using genetically-encoded fluorescent probes, two-photon time-lapse and CARS imaging. ATP and H2O2 productions are intrinsically higher in nodes of Ranvier even in resting conditions. Axonal firing increased both ATP and H2O2 productions but with different dynamics. In neuropathic MFN2R94Q mice, mimicking Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2A disease, defective mitochondria failed to upregulate ATP production following axonal activity. However, H2O2 production was dramatically sustained. Mimicking demyelinating peripheral neuropathy resulted in a reduced production of ATP while H2O2 level soared. Taken together, our results suggest that ATP and ROS productions are decoupled under neuropathic conditions, which may compromise axonal function and integrity.",

    "abstract": "Inferring genome-scale metabolic networks in emerging model organisms is challenging because of incomplete biochemical knowledge and incomplete conservation of biochemical pathways during evolution. This limits the possibility to automatically transfer knowledge from well-established model organisms. Therefore, specific bioinformatic tools are necessary to infer new biochemical reactions and new metabolic structures that can be checked experimentally. Using an integrative approach combining both genomic and metabolomic data in the red algal model Chondrus crispus, we show that, even metabolic pathways considered as conserved, like sterol or mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA) synthesis pathways, undergo substantial turnover. This phenomenon, which we formally define as \\\"metabolic pathway drift\\\", is consistent with findings from other areas of evolutionary biology, indicating that a given phenotype can be conserved even if the underlying molecular mechanisms are changing. We present a proof of concept with a new methodological approach to formalize the logical reasoning necessary to infer new reactions and new molecular structures, based on previous biochemical knowledge. We use this approach to infer previously unknown reactions in the sterol and MAA pathways.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenome-scale metabolic models describe our current understanding of all metabolic pathways occuring in a given organism. For emerging model species, where few biochemical data are available about really occurring enzymatic activities, such metabolic models are mainly based on transferring knowledge from other more studied species, based on the assumption that the same genes have the same function in the compared species. However, integration of metabolomic data into genome-scale metabolic models leads to situations where gaps in pathways cannot be filled by known enzymatic reactions from existing databases. This is due to structural variation in metabolic pathways accross evolutionary time. In such cases, it is necessary to use complementary approaches to infer new reactions and new metabolic intermediates using logical reasoning, based on available partial biochemical knowledge. Here we present a proof of concept that this is feasible and leads to hypotheses that are precise enough to be a starting point for new experimental work.",

Using 341 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with chronotype, 91 SNPs associated sleep duration and 57 SNPs associated with insomnia symptoms, one-sample MR analysis in UK Biobank provided some supportive evidence for a protective effect of morning preference on breast cancer risk (HR 0.85, 95% 0.70, 1.03 per category increase) but imprecise estimates for sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Two-sample MR using data from BCAC supported findings for a protective effect of morning preference (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82, 0.93 per category increase) and adverse effect of increased sleep duration (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02, 1.39 per hour increase) on breast cancer (both estrogen receptor positive and negative), while there was inconsistent evidence for insomnia symptoms. Results were largely robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for horizontal pleiotropy.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found consistent evidence for a protective effect of morning preference and suggestive evidence for an adverse effect of sleep duration on breast cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "The Alphaproteobacteria is an extraordinarily diverse and ancient group of bacteria. Previous attempts to infer its deep phylogeny have been plagued with methodological artefacts. To overcome this, we analyzed a dataset of 200 single-copy and conserved genes and employed diverse strategies to reduce compositional artefacts. Such strategies include using novel dataset-specific profile mixture models and recoding schemes, and removing sites, genes and taxa that are compositionally biased. We show that the Rickettsiales and Holosporales (both groups of intracellular parasites of eukaryotes) are not sisters to each other, but instead, the Holosporales has a derived position within the Rhodospirillales. Furthermore, we find that the Rhodospirillales might be paraphyletic and that the Geminicoccaceae could be sister to all ancestrally free-living alphaproteobacteria. Our robust phylogeny will serve as a framework for future studies that aim to place mitochondria, and novel environmental diversity, within the Alphaproteobacteria.",
