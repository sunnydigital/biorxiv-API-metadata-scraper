    "abstract": "Identifying effective therapeutic strategies that can prevent tumor cell proliferation is a major challenge to improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Here we sought to deepen our understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression. We genetically engineered breast cancer cell lines to express a cell cycle reporter and then tracked drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase, which revealed drug-specific cell cycle effects that varied across time. This suggested that a computational model that could account for cell cycle phase durations would provide a framework to explore drug-induced changes in cell cycle changes. Toward that goal, we developed a linear chain trick (LCT) computational model, in which the cell cycle was partitioned into subphases that faithfully captured drug-induced dynamic responses. The model inferred drug effects and localized them to specific cell cycle phases, which we confirmed experimentally. We then used our LCT model to predict the effect of unseen drug combinations that target cells in different cell cycle phases. Experimental testing confirmed several model predictions and identified combination treatment strategies that may improve therapeutic response in breast cancer patients. Overall, this integrated experimental and modeling approach opens new avenues for assessing drug responses, predicting effective drug combinations, and identifying optimal drug sequencing strategies.",

    "abstract": "The canonical NF-{kappa}B transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in PDAC tumours. Here, we characterised previously unknown endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines by live single cell imaging, which revealed rapid, sustained and non-oscillatory nuclear RELA following TNF stimulation. Using Bayesian analysis of single cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we computationally predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. By RNA-seq, we identified the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31 as transcriptionally regulated by RELA. In turn, NUAK2 or ARHGAP31 siRNA depletion downregulates TNF-stimulated RELA nuclear localisation in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop regulating RELA activation by TNF. We identify an additional actin-independent feedback loop involving RELB, which suppresses TNF-mediated RELA nuclear localisation following RELA mediated upregulation of RELB. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.",

In this paper, we present ACCORDION (ACCelerating and Optimizing model RecommenDatIONs), a novel methodology and an expert system that retrieves and selects relevant knowledge from literature and databases to recommend models with correct structure and accurate behavior, enabling mechanistic explanations and predictions, and advancing understanding. ACCORDION introduces an approach that integrates knowledge retrieval, graph algorithms, clustering, simulation, and formal analysis. Here, we focus on biological systems, although the proposed methodology is applicable in other domains. We used ACCORDION in nine benchmark case studies and compared its performance with other previously published tools. We show that ACCORDION is: comprehensive, retrieving relevant knowledge from a range of literature sources; very effective, reducing the error of the initial baseline model by more than 80%, recommending models that closely recapitulate desired behavior, and outperforming previously published tools; selective, recommending only the most relevant, context-specific, and useful subset (15-20%) of candidate knowledge in literature; diverse, accounting for several distinct criteria to recommend more than one solution, thus enabling alternative explanations or intervention directions.",

    "abstract": "Nociception is a neural process that animals have developed to avoid potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. While nociception is triggered in the peripheral nervous system, its modulation by the central nervous system is a critical process in mammals, whose dysfunction has been extensively implicated in chronic pain pathogenesis. The peripheral mechanisms of nociception are largely conserved across the animal kingdom. However, it is unclear whether the brain-mediated modulation is also conserved in non-mammalian species. Here, we show that Drosophila has a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals. We found that mutants lacking dsk or its receptors are hypersensitive to noxious heat. Through a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses, we subsequently revealed neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution and identified a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, raising the possibility that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception.",

    "abstract": "There has been a great deal of research on cell division and its mechanisms; however, its processes have not yet been entirely elucidated. To find novel proteins that regulate cell division, we performed the screening using siRNAs and/or the expression plasmid of the target genes and identified leucine zipper protein 1 (LUZP1). Recent studies have shown that LUZP1 interacts with various proteins and stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton; however, the function of LUZP1 in mitosis is not known. In this study, we found that LUZP1 colocalized with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at the centromere in metaphase and at the central spindle in anaphase and that these LUZP1 localizations were regulated by CPC activity and kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A). Mass spectrometry analysis identified that LUZP1 interacted with death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3), one regulator of the cleavage furrow ingression in cytokinesis. In addition, we found that LUZP1 also interacted with myosin light chain 9 (MYL9), a substrate of DAPK3, and comprehensively inhibited MYL9 phosphorylation by DAPK3. In line with a known role for MYL9 in the actin-myosin contraction, LUZP1 suppression accelerated the constriction velocity at the division plane in our timelapse analysis. Our study indicates that LUZP1 is a novel regulator for cytokinesis that regulates the constriction velocity of the contractile ring.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic bacteria frequently are divided into lifestyle categories oligotroph or copiotroph. Oligotrophs have proportionately fewer transcriptional regulatory genes than copiotrophs and are generally non-motile/chemotactic. We hypothesized that the absence of chemotaxis/motility in oligotrophs prevents them from occupying nutrient patches long enough to benefit from transcriptional regulation. We first confirmed that marine oligotrophs are generally reduced in genes for transcriptional regulation and motility/chemotaxis. Next, using a non-motile oligotroph (Ca. Pelagibacter st. HTCC7211), a motile copiotroph (Alteromonas macleodii st. HOT1A3), and [14C]L-alanine, we confirmed that L-alanine catabolism is not transcriptionally regulated in HTCC7211 but is in HOT1A3. We then found that HOT1A3 took 2.5-4 min to initiate L-alanine oxidation at patch L-alanine concentrations, compared to <30s for HTCC7211. By modeling cell trajectories, we predicted that, in most scenarios, non-motile cells spend <2 min in patches, compared to >4 mins for chemotactic/motile cells. Thus, the time necessary for transcriptional regulation to initiate prevents transcriptional regulation from being beneficial for non-motile oligotrophs. This is supported by a mechanistic model we developed, which predicted that HTCC7211 cells with transcriptional regulation of L-alanine metabolism would produce 12% of their standing ATP stock upon encountering an L-alanine patch, compared to 880% in HTCC7211 cells without transcriptional regulation.",

While recent studies have elucidated important functions of NIK in adaptive immune cells and cancer cell metabolism, the role of NIK in metabolic-driven inflammatory responses in innate immune cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that NIK-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibit defects in mitochondrial-dependent metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which impairs the acquisition of a pro-repair, anti-inflammatory phenotype. Subsequently, NIK-deficient mice exhibit skewing of myeloid cells characterized by aberrant eosinophil, monocyte, and macrophage cell populations in the blood, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Furthermore, NIK-deficient blood monocytes display hyperresponsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and elevated TNF production ex vivo. These findings suggest that NIK governs metabolic rewiring, which is critical for balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory myeloid immune cell function. Overall, our work highlights a previously unrecognized role for NIK as a molecular rheostat that fine-tunes immunometabolism in innate immunity and suggests that metabolic dysfunction may be an important driver of inflammatory diseases caused by aberrant NIK expression or activity.\n\nKey PointsO_LINIK-deficient macrophages exhibit impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation\nC_LIO_LINIK-deficient mice have more inflammatory myeloid cells in blood and bone marrow\nC_LIO_LINIK-dependent metabolic rewiring shapes pro- and anti-inflammatory innate immunity\nC_LI",

Here, we use self-organizing principles to learn a topographic representation of the data manifold of a deep neural network representational space. We find that a smooth mapping of this representational space showed many brain-like motifs, with (i) large-scale organization of animate vs. inanimate and big vs. small response preferences, supported by (ii) feature tuning related to textural and coarse form information, with (iii) naturally emerging face- and scene-selective regions embedded in this larger-scale organization. While some theories of the object-selective cortex posit that these differently tuned regions of the brain reflect a collection of distinctly specified functional modules, the present work provides computational support for an alternate hypothesis that the tuning and topography of the object-selective cortex reflects a smooth mapping of a unified representational space.",

    "abstract": "This study discusses the construction and operation of a membrane-less bioelectrochemical reactor that employs rotating working electrodes with a surface area of up to 1 m2. As a proof-of-principle for an aerobic microbial electrosynthesis process, Kyrpidia spormannii was cultivated in the reactor. Optical coherence tomography was used to examine the spatial distribution of the cathodic biofilm. After 24 days 87% of the cathode surface was covered with biofilm that was characterized by a radial increase in its biovolume towards the circumcenter of the electrodes reaching up to 92.13 m3 m-2. To demonstrate the versatility of the system, we further operated the reactor as a microbial electrolysis cell employing a co-culture of Shewanella oneidensis and Geobacter sulfurreducens. Anodic current densities of up to 130 A cm-2 were measured during these batch experiments. This resulted in a maximum production rate of 0.43 liters of pure hydrogen per liter reactor volume and day.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/507646v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102fbecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e96345org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7476aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac358_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIConstruction of a 10 L membrane-less, pressurizable bioelectrochemical reactor\nC_LIO_LIRotating working electrodes with up to 1 m2 electrode surface\nC_LIO_LIElectroautotrophic cultivation and quantification of K. spormannii biofilms\nC_LIO_LIInitial cell density crucial for successful K. spormannii biofilm formation\nC_LIO_LIAnodic operation as MEC with Shewanella / Geobacter coculture\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic changes are involved in the onset and progression of cancer, and the detection of DNA methylation signatures may foster the improvement of diagnosis and prognosis. While the emergence of innovative technologies has fostered numerous studies in breast cancer, many lack statistical power due to the small sample sizes generally involved. In this study, we present a novel meta-analysis that identifies a common pattern of DNA methylation in all breast cancer subtypes. We obtained DNA methylation signatures at the gene and biological function level, identifying those significant groups of genes and functional pathways affected. To achieve this, we conducted a thorough systematic review following PRISMA statement guidelines for the selection of studies on DNA methylation in breast cancer. In total, we gathered four studies (GSE52865, GSE141338, GSE59901 and GSE101443) that were split into 13 comparisons comprising a set of 144 individuals. We discovered that most breast cancer subtypes share a significant deregulation in the immune system and alterations to the cell cycle. This integrative approach combines all available information from public data repositories and possesses greater statistical power than any individual study. Further evaluations of the identified differential biological processes and pathways may support the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\n\nSimple summaryThe identification of DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer represents a potentially valuable approach in defining more accurate diagnoses and treatment options. In this study, we applied a novel methodology that integrates the DNA methylation profiles of all studies available in public repositories via systematic review and meta-analysis. The results provide evidence of a common DNA methylation signature in distinct breast cancer subtypes, which reflects a significant deregulation of the immune system and alterations to the cell cycle. Overall, these results may support the selection of disease/treatment biomarkers and the identification of therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Along with differences in life histories, metazoans have evolved vast differences in cellularity, involving changes in the molecular pathways controlling the cell cycle. The extent to which the signalling network systemically determines cellular composition throughout the body and whether tissue cellularity is organized locally to match tissue-specific functions are unclear. We cultured genetic lines of Drosophila melanogaster on food with and without rapamycin to manipulate the activity of TOR/insulin pathways and evaluate cell-size changes in five types of adult cells: wing and leg epidermal cells, ommatidial cells, indirect flight muscle cells, and Malpighian tubule epithelial cells. Rapamycin blocks TOR multiprotein complex 1, reducing cell growth, but this effect has been studied in single cell types. As adults, rapamycin-treated flies had smaller bodies and consistently smaller cells in all tissues. Regardless, females eclosed with larger bodies and larger cells in all tissues than males. Thus, differences in TOR activity and sex were associated with the orchestration of cell size throughout the body, leading to differences in body size. We postulate that the activity of TOR/insulin pathways and their effects on cellularity should be considered when investigating the origin of ecological and evolutionary patterns in life histories.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have the power to identify variants that capture significant levels of phenotypic variance in complex traits. However, effort and time are required to select the best methods and optimize parameters and pre-processing steps. Although machine learning approaches have been shown to greatly assist in optimization and data processing, applying them to QTL analysis and GWAS is challenging due to the complexity of large, heterogenous datasets. Here, we describe proof-of-concept for an automated machine learning approach, AutoQTL, with the ability to automate many complex decisions related to analysis of complex traits and generate diverse solutions to describe relationships that exist in genetic data.\n\nResultsUsing a dataset of 18 putative QTL from a large-scale GWAS of body mass index in the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, AutoQTL captures the phenotypic variance explained under a standard additive model while also providing evidence of non-additive effects including deviations from additivity and 2-way epistatic interactions from simulated data via multiple optimal solutions. Additionally, feature importance metrics provide different insights into the inheritance models and predictive power of multiple GWAS-derived putative QTL.\n\nConclusionsThis proof-of-concept illustrates that automated machine learning techniques can be applied to genetic data and has the potential to detect both additive and non-additive effects via various optimal solutions and feature importance metrics. In the future, we aim to expand AutoQTL to accommodate omics-level datasets with intelligent feature selection strategies.",

    "abstract": "Constraint-based modeling has risen as an alternative for characterizing the metabolism of communities. Adaptations of Flux Balance Analysis have been proposed to model metabolic interactions in most cases, considering a unique optimal flux distribution derived from the maximization of biomass production. However, these approaches do not consider the development of other potentially novel essential functions not directly related to cell growth which forces them to display suboptimal growth rates in nature. Additionally, suboptimal states allow a degree of plasticity in the metabolism, thus allowing quick shifts between alternative flux distributions as an initial response to environmental changes.\n\nIn this work, we present a method to explore the abundance-growth space as a representation of metabolic flux distributions of a community. This space is defined by the composition of a community, represented by its members relative abundance and their growth rate. The analysis of this space allows us to represent the whole set of feasible fluxes without needing a complete description of the solution space unveiling abundance-dependent metabolic phenotypes displayed in a given environment. As an illustration, we consider a community composed of two bioleaching bacteria, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Wenelen and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans Cutipay, finding that changes in the composition of their available resources significantly affects their metabolic plasticity.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn nature, organisms live in communities and not as isolated species. Their interactions provide a source of resilience to environmental disturbances. Despite their importance in ecology, human health, and industry, understanding how organisms interact in different environments remains an open question.\n\nIn this work, we provide a novel approach which, only using genomics information, studies the metabolic phenotype exhibited by communities, where the exploration of suboptimal growth flux distributions and the composition of a community allows to unveil its capacity to respond to environmental changes, shedding the light of the degree of metabolic plasticity inherent to the community.",

Increased co-translational protein aggregation reflects altered translation regulation that may have the potential to buffer transcription under genotoxic stress. As an indicator for such event, we followed cytoplasmic aggregation of RPB1, the aggregation prone largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, in biopsy samples taken from patients with invasive carcinoma of no special type. RPB1 frequently aggregates co-translationally in the absence of proper HSP90 chaperone function or in ribosome mutant cells as revealed formerly in yeast. We found that cytoplasmic foci of RPB1 occur in larger sizes in tumors that showed no regression after therapy. Based on these results, we propose that monitoring the cytoplasmic aggregation of RPB1 may be suitable for determining - from biopsy samples taken before treatment - the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsMajor clinical manifestations of Wilson disease (WD) are related to copper accumulation in the liver and the brain, and little is known about other tissues involvement in metabolic changes in WD. In vitro studies suggested that the loss of intestinal ATP7B could contribute to metabolic dysregulation in WD. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating gut microbiota and lipidome in two mouse models of WD and by characterizing a new mouse model with a targeted deletion of Atp7b in intestine.\n\nMethodsCecal content 16S sequencing and untargeted hepatic and plasma lipidome analyses in the Jackson Laboratory toxic-milk and the Atp7b null global knockout mouse models of WD were profiled and integrated. Intestine-specific Atp7b knockout mice (Atp7b{Delta}IEC) was generated using B6.Cg-Tg(Vil1-cre)997Gum/J mice and Atp7bLox/Lox mice, and characterized using targeted lipidome analysis following a high-fat diet challenge.\n\nResultsGut microbiota diversity was reduced in animal models of WD. Comparative prediction analysis revealed amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism functions to be dysregulated in the WD gut microbial metagenome. Liver and plasma lipidomic profiles showed dysregulated tri- and diglyceride, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolism in WD models. When challenged with a high-fat diet, Atp7b{Delta}IEC mice exhibited profound alterations to fatty acid desaturation and sphingolipid metabolism pathways as well as altered APOB48 distribution in intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nConclusionCoordinated changes of gut microbiome and lipidome analyses underlie systemic metabolic manifestations in murine WD. Intestine-specific ATP7B deficiency affected both intestinal and systemic response to a high-fat challenge. WD is a systemic disease in which intestinal-specific ATP7B loss and diet influence phenotypic presentations.",

While most current platforms for spatial transcriptomics only offer multi-cellular resolution, with 10-15 cells per spot, recent technologies provide a much denser spot placement leading to sub-cellular resolution. A key challenge for these newer methods is cell segmentation and the assignment of spots to cells. Traditional image-based segmentation methods are limited and do not make full use of the information profiled by spatial transcrip-tomics. Here we present SCS, which combines imaging data with sequencing data to improve cell segmentation accuracy. SCS assigns spots to cells by adaptively learning the position of each spot relative to the center of its cell using a transformer neural network. SCS was tested on two new sub-cellular spatial transcriptomics technologies and outperformed traditional image-based segmentation methods. SCS achieved better accuracy, identified more cells, and provided more realistic cell size estimation. Sub-cellular analysis of RNAs using SCS spots assignments provides information on RNA localization and further supports the segmentation results.",

    "abstract": "The number of small-scale diversified vegetable growers in industrialized countries has risen sharply over the last ten years. The risks associated with plant viruses in these systems have been barely studied in Europe, yet dramatic virus emergence events, such as tomato brown fruit rugose virus, sometimes occur. We developed a methodology that aimed to understand better the implications related to viruses for tomato production in Belgians vegetable farms by comparing growers perception of the presence of viral symptoms (visual inspection) with non targeting detection of nearly all viruses present in the plants by high throughput sequencing technologies (HTS). Virus presence and impact were interpreted considering the farms typology and cultural practices, the growers professional profiles, and visual inspection of plant-viral-like symptoms. Overall, The data indicated that most growers have limited understanding of tomato viruses and are not concerned about them. Field observations were correlated to this perception as the prevalence of symptomatic plants was usually lower than 1%. However, important and potentially emergent viruses, mainly transmitted by insects, were detected in several farms. Noteworthy, the presence of these viruses was correlated with the number of plant species grown per site (diversity) but not with a higher awareness of the growers regarding plant viral diseases or a higher number of symptomatic plants. In addition, both HTS and perception analysis underlined the rising incidence and importance of an emergent virus: Physostegia chlorotic mottle virus. Overall, the original methodology developed here, combining social science with HTS technologies, could be applied to other crops in other systems to identify emergent risks associated with plant viruses and can highlight the communication needed toward growers to mitigate epidemics.",

Rhythmic stomata movements in daily dark/light cycles prevent water loss at night and allow CO2 uptake during the day. How the actors involved are transcriptionally regulated and how this might contribute to rhythmicity is largely unknown. Here, we show that morning stomata opening depends on the previous night period. The transcription factors PHYTOCHROMEINTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) accumulate at the end of the night and directly induce the guard cell-specific K+ channel KAT1. Remarkably, PIFs and KAT1 are required for blue light-induced stomata opening. Together, our data establish a molecular framework for daily rhythmic stomatal movements under well-water conditions, whereby PIFs are required for accumulation of KAT1 at night, which upon activation by blue light in the morning leads to the K+ intake driving stomata opening.",

As such, it is fundamental to understand the physiological mechanisms and associated molecular basis of their resilience to the long polar night. Here, we report an integrative approach revealing that in prolonged darkness, diatom cells enter a state of quiescence associated with reduced metabolic and transcriptional activity during which no cell division occurs. We propose that minimal energy is provided by respiration and degradation of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid stores and that homeostasis is maintained by autophagy in prolonged darkness. We also report internal structural changes that manifest the morphological acclimation of cells to darkness. Our results further indicate that immediately following a return to light, diatom cells are able to use photoprotective mechanisms and rapidly resume photosynthesis. Cell division resumed rates similar to those before darkness.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDGrafting is a horticultural practice used widely across woody perennial crop species to fuse together the root and shoot system of two distinct genotypes, the rootstock and the scion, combining beneficial traits from both. In grapevine, grafting is used in nearly 80% of all commercial vines to optimize fruit quality, regulate vine vigor, and enhance biotic and abiotic stress-tolerance. Rootstocks have been shown to modulate elemental composition, metabolomic profiles, and the shape of leaves in the scion, among other traits. However, it is currently unclear how rootstock genotypes influence shoot system gene expression as previous work has reported complex and often contradictory findings.\n\nRESULTSIn the present study, we examine the influence of grafting on scion gene expression in leaves and reproductive tissues of grapevines growing under field conditions for three years. We show that the influence from the rootstock genotype is highly tissue and time dependent, manifesting only in leaves, primarily during a single year of our three-year study. Further, the degree of rootstock influence on scion gene expression is driven by interactions with the local environment.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results demonstrate that the role of rootstock genotype in modulating scion gene expression is not a consistent, unchanging effect, but rather an effect that varies over time in relation to local environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plants perceive herbivory induced volatiles and respond to them by upregulating their defenses. So far, the organs responsible for volatile perception remain poorly described. Here, we show that responsiveness to the herbivory induced green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC) in terms of volatile emission, transcriptional regulation and defense hormone activation is largely constrained to younger maize leaves. Older leaves are much less sensitive to HAC. In a given leaf, responsiveness to HAC is high at immature developmental stages and drops off rapidly during maturation. Responsiveness to the non-volatile elicitor ZmPep3 shows an opposite pattern, demonstrating that hyposmia is not driven by defective canonical defense signaling. Neither stomatal conductance nor leaf cuticle composition explain the unresponsiveness of older leaves to HAC, suggesting perception mechanisms upstream of canonical defense signaling as driving factors. Finally, we show that hyposmia in older leaves is not restricted to HAC, and extends to the full blend of herbivory induced volatiles. In conclusion, our work identifies immature maize leaves as dominant stress volatile sensing organs. The tight spatiotemporal control of volatile perception may facilitate within-plant defense signaling to protect young leaves, and may allow plants with complex architectures to explore the dynamic odor landscapes at the outer periphery of their shoots.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the first work of T1-based magnetic resonance thermometry using magnetic resonance fingerprinting (dubbed MRFT). We compared temperature estimation of MRFT with proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) thermometry on ex vivo bovine muscle. We demonstrated MRFTs feasibility in predicting temperature on ex vivo bovine muscles with deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead. B0 maps generated from MRFT were compared with gold standard B0 maps near the DBS lead.\n\nAll experiments were performed on a 3 Tesla whole-body GE Premier system equipped with a 21-channel receive head coil (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Four fluoroptic probes were used to measure the temperature at the center of a cold muscle (probe 1), the room temperature water bottle (probe 2), and the center and periphery of the heated muscle (probes 3 and 4). We selected regions of interest (ROIs) around the location of the probes and used simple linear regression to generate the temperature sensitivity calibration equations that convert T1 maps and {Delta}s maps to temperature maps. We then repeated the same setup and compared MRFT, PRFS thermometry temperature estimation with gold standard probe measurements. For the MRFT experiment on DBS lead, we taped the probe to the tip of the DBS lead and used a turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence to induce heating near the lead. We selected ROIs around the tip of the lead to compare MRFT temperature estimation with probe measurements. Vendor-supplied B0 mapping sequence was acquired to compare with MRFT-generated B0 maps.\n\nWe found strong linear relationships (R2>0.958) between T1 and temperature and {Delta}s and temperatures in our temperature sensitivity calibration experiment. MRFT and PRFS thermometry both accurately predict temperature (RMSE<1.55 {degrees}C) compared to probe measurements. MRFT estimated temperature near DBS lead has a similar trend as the probe temperature. Both B0 maps show inhomogeneities around the lead.",

Many of the currently available methods are mostly specialists in predicting specific properties, leading to the use of many models side-by-side that lead to impossibly high computational overheads for the common researcher. Henceforth, the authors propose a single, generalist unified model exploiting graph convolutional variational encoders that can simultaneously predict multiple properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET), target-specific docking score prediction and drug-drug interactions. Considerably, the use of this method allows for state-of-the-art virtual screening with an acceleration advantage of up to two orders of magnitude. The minimisation of a graph variational encoders latent space also allows for accelerated development of specific drugs for targets with Pareto optimality principles considered, and has the added advantage of explainability.",

Field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is a diploid annual cover crop species that has potential utility for reducing soil erosion and nutrient losses; and has rich seeds (30-35% oil) amenable to biofuel production and as a protein animal feed. The objective of this research was to (1) precisely characterize root system architecture and development, (2) understand adaptive responses of pennycress roots to nitrate nutrition, (3) and determine genotypic variance available in root development and nitrate plasticity. Using a root imaging and analysis pipeline, 4D pennycress root system architecture was characterized under four nitrate regimes (from zero to high nitrate concentration) across four time points (days 5, 9, 13, and 17 after sowing). Significant nitrate condition response and genotype interactions were identified for many root traits with greatest impact on lateral root traits. In trace nitrate conditions a greater lateral root count, length, interbranch density, and a steeper lateral root angle was observed compared to high nitrate conditions. Genotype-by-nitrate condition interaction was observed for root width, width:depth ratio, mean lateral root length, and lateral root density. These results illustrate root trait variance available in pennycress accessions that could be useful targets for breeding of improved nitrate responsive cover crops for greater productivity, resilience, and ecosystem service.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding the geographic distribution of Rickettsia montanensis infections in Dermacentor variabilis is important for tick-borne disease management in the United States, as both a tick-borne agent of interest and a potential confounder in surveillance of other rickettsial diseases. Two previous studies modeled niche suitability for D. variabilis with and without R. montanensis, from 2002-2012, indicating that the D. variabilis niche overestimates the infected niche. This study updates these, adding data since 2012.\n\nMethodsNewer surveillance and testing data were used to update Species Distribution Models (SDMs) of D. variabilis, and R. montanensis infected D. variabilis, in the United States. Using random forest (RF) models, found to perform best in previous work, we updated the SDMs and compared them with prior results. Warrens I niche overlap metric was used to compare between predicted suitability for all ticks and  pathogen positive niche models across datasets.\n\nResultsWarrens I indicated <2% change in predicted niche, and there was no change in order of importance of environmental predictors, for D. variabilis or R. montanensis positive niche. The updated D. variabilis niche model overpredicted suitability compared to the updated R. montanensis positive niche in key peripheral parts of the range, but slightly underpredicted through the northern and midwestern parts of the range. This reinforces previous findings of a more constrained pathogen-positive niche than predicted by D. variabilis records alone.\n\nConclusionsThe consistency of predicted niche suitability for D. variabilis in the United States, with the addition of nearly a decade of new data, corroborates this is a species with generalist habitat requirements. Yet a slight shift in updated niche distribution, even of low suitability, included more southern areas, pointing to a need for continued and extended monitoring and surveillance. This further underscores the importance of revisiting vector and vector-borne disease distribution maps.",

    "abstract": "Tree mortality and partial canopy dieback are increasing in many forest ecosystems from unfavorable climate conditions. Examining how tree growth and mortality are affected by climate variability can help identify proximate causes of tree mortality and canopy dieback. We investigated anomalously high mortality rates and partial canopy dieback of western redcedar (Thuja plicata, WRC), a culturally, ecologically, and economically important species in the Pacific Northwest (USA), using tree-ring methods. We sampled trees in three tree status groups--no canopy dieback, partial canopy dieback, and trees that died (0-30 years ago)--from 11 sites in coastal (maritime climate) and interior (continental climate) populations of WRC trees. In our study, WRC tree mortality was portended by on average 4-5 years of declining radial growth. Warmer and drier climate conditions in May and June that extend the annual July-September dry season reduced radial growth in 9 of 11 sites (1975-2020). Defining drought events as warm, dry May-June climate, we found that WRC trees recovered radial growth to pre-drought rates within three years when post-drought climate conditions were average or cooler and wetter than average. However, radial growth recovery from drought was slower or absent when conditions were warmer and drier during the post-drought recovery period, which appeared to lead to the widespread mortality event across coastal populations. Annually resolved tree mortality in coastal populations predominately occurred in 2017-2018 (80% of sampled trees) and coincided with exceedingly hot temperatures and the longest regionally dry period for May to September (1970-2020). In interior populations, tree mortality was associated with warmer, drier conditions from August to September. Our findings forewarn that a warming climate and more frequent and severe seasonal droughts will likely increase the vulnerability of WRC to canopy dieback and mortality and possibly other drought-sensitive trees in one of the worlds largest carbon sinks.",

Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes from a wide range of species, including model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the sequence representations alone match or outperform specialized methods on 12 of 18 prediction tasks, and up to 15 after fine-tuning. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence.

Some RNA molecules, such as bacterial ribosomes and precursor messenger RNA, are targets of small molecule drugs, while others, e.g., bacterial riboswitches or viral RNA motifs are considered as potential therapeutic targets. Thus, the continuous discovery of new functional RNA increases the demand for developing compounds targeting them and for methods for analyzing RNA--small molecule interactions.

In Heliconius erato, opsin expression is sexually dimorphic; only females express both UV-sensitive opsins, enabling UV wavelength discrimination. However, the ecological pressures that have driven these sex-specific differences in visual perception remain unresolved. Heliconius females invest heavily in finding hostplants to lay their eggs, a behaviour heavily reliant on visual cues. We tested whether UV vision is used for oviposition in H. erato and Heliconius himera females by manipulating the availability of UV in behavioural experiments under naturalistic conditions. We found that UV did not influence the number of oviposition attempts or the number of eggs laid. In addition, their hostplant, Passiflora punctata, does not reflect UV wavelengths, and models of H. erato female vision suggest only minimal stimulation of the UV opsins. Overall, these findings suggest that UV wavelengths do not directly affect the ability of Heliconius females to find suitable oviposition sites. Alternatively, UV discrimination could be used in the context of foraging or mate choice, but this remains to be tested.",

    "abstract": "The reduced costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed researchers to generate nuclear and mitochondrial genome data to gain deeper insights into the phylogeography, evolutionary history, and biology of non-model species. While the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) has been well-studied across its range with traditional genetic markers over the last 25 years, researchers are building on this knowledge by generating whole genome, population-level datasets to improve understanding of its genetic composition and evolutionary history. Using publicly available NGS data, we assembled 40 Cape buffalo mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from four protected areas in South Africa, expanding the geographical range and almost doubling the number of mitogenomes available for this species. Coverage of the mitogenomes ranged from 154-1,036X. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity for Kruger National Park (n = 15) and Mokala National Park (n = 5) were similar to diversity levels in southern and eastern Africa. Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 15) had low levels of genetic diversity, with only four haplotypes detected, reflecting its past bottleneck. Addo Elephant National Park (n = 5) had the highest nucleotide diversity of all populations across Africa, which was unexpected, as it is known from previous studies to have low nuclear diversity. This diversity was driven by a highly divergent mitogenome from one sample, which was also identified in another sample via Sanger sequencing of cytochrome b. Using a fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis, we estimated that this mitogenome diverged from all other Cape buffalo approximately 2.15 million years ago. We discuss several potential sources of this mitogenome but propose that it most likely originated through introgressive hybridisation with the extinct long-horned buffalo, Syncerus (Pelorovis) antiquus. We conclude by discussing the conservation consequences of this finding for the Addo Elephant National Park population, proposing careful genetic management to prevent inbreeding depression while maintaining this highly unique diversity.",

    "abstract": "Prime editing (PE) holds tremendous potential in the treatment of genetic diseases because it can install any desired base substitution or local insertion/deletion. However, the full-length PE effector size (6.3-kb) was beyond the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV), hindering its clinical transformation. Various splitting strategies have been used to improve its delivery, but always accompanied by compromised PE efficiency. Here, we developed a modular and efficient SunTag-PE system that splits PE effectors into GCN4-nCas9 and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) tethered reverse transcriptase (RT). We observed that SunTag-PEs with 1xGCN4 in the N terminus of nCas9 was the most efficient configuration rather than multiple copies of GCN4. This SunTag-PE strategy achieved editing levels comparable to canonical fused-PE and higher than other split-PE strategies (including sPE and MS2-PE) in both PE2 and PE3 forms with no increase in insertion-deletion (indel) byproducts. Moreover, we successfully validated the modularity of SunTag-PE system in the Cas9 orthologs of SauCas9 and FrCas9. Finally, we employed dual AAVs to deliver SunTag-ePE3 and efficiently corrected the pathogenic mutation in HBB mutant cell line. Collectively, our SunTag-PE system provides an efficient modular splitting strategy for prime editing and further facilitate its transformation in clinics.",

    "abstract": "New large scale initiatives, such as the Earth BioGenome Project, require efficient automatic tools for eukaryotic genome annotation. A new automatic tool, GeneMark-ETP, presented here, finds genes by integration of genomic-, transcriptomic- and protein-derived evidence. GeneMark-ETP first identifies genomic loci where extrinsic data is sufficient for gene prediction with  high confidence and then proceeds with finding the remaining genes across the whole genome. The initial set of parameters of the statistical model is estimated on the training set made from the high confidence genes. Subsequently, the model parameters are iteratively updated in the cycles of gene prediction and parameter re-estimation. Upon reaching convergence GeneMark-ETP makes the final prediction of the whole complement of genes. The algorithm development was made with a focus on large plant and animal genomes. GeneMark-ETP performance was compared favorably with the ones of the gene finders using a single type of extrinsic evidence delivered by either short RNA reads (GeneMark-ET), or by mapped to genome homologous proteins (GeneMark-EP+). These outcomes could be expected. Moreover, comparisons were made with the pipelines utilizing both transcript- and protein-derived extrinsic evidence. For these experiments we have chosen TSEBRA, combining BRAKER1 and BRAKER2, as well as MAKER2. The results demonstrated that GeneMark-ETP delivered state-of-the-art gene prediction accuracy with a large margin of improvement in large eukaryotic genomes.",

We obtained pancreata from brain dead donors thus avoiding any warm ischemia time. The 30 donors were diverse in age and race and had no known pancreas disease. Histopathological analysis of the samples revealed PanIN lesions in most individuals irrespective of age. Using a combination of multiplex immunohistochemistry, single cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, we provide the first ever characterization of the unique microenvironment of the adult human pancreas and of sporadic PanIN lesions. We compared healthy pancreata to pancreatic cancer and peritumoral tissue and observed distinct transcriptomic signatures in fibroblasts, and, to a lesser extent, macrophages. PanIN epithelial cells from healthy pancreata were remarkably transcriptionally similar to cancer cells, suggesting that neoplastic pathways are initiated early in tumorigenesis.\n\nStatement of significanceThe causes underlying the onset of pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown, hampering early detection and prevention strategies.

Here, we investigated paracrine factors involved in the regulatory role of microenvironment created by KC in UVB-mediated MC responses using RNA sequencing analysis as well as in vitro and in vivo models. RNA-Seq showed that G-CSF and CCL20 genes were highly upregulated in UVB-irradiated KC and their levels best correlated with paracrine protective effects of KC on stress responses of MC to UVB. Recombinant G-CSF and CCL20 treatment revealed the strongest modulatory effects on UVB-induced MC responses by mitigating apoptosis and ROS formation and upregulating tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) involved in the melanogenic pathway. A similar correlation between G-CSF and CCL20 expression in KC and the tyrosinase level in MC was also observed in the UVB-irradiated mouse skin. Our study reports for the first time that G-CSF and CCL20 might play a regulatory role in the KCs paracrine effects on UVB-mediated MC damage and also provides translational insights for the development of biomarkers for predicting susceptibility to photodamage.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=185 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523939v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113588org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d1af40org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1489df0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7935c5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Networks are far from complete due to time and resource consumption for experimental validation and curation of the interactions. Previous assessments have shown the modest performance of the available network inference methods based on gene expression data. Here, we study several caveats on the inference of regulatory networks and methods assessment through the quality of the input data and gold standard, and the assessment approach with a focus on the global structure of the network. We used synthetic and biological data for the predictions and experimentally-validated biological networks as the gold standard (ground truth). Standard performance metrics and graph structural properties suggest that methods inferring co-expression networks should no longer be assessed equally with those inferring regulatory interactions. While methods inferring regulatory interactions perform better in global regulatory network inference than co-expression-based methods, the latter is better suited to infer function-specific regulons and co-regulation networks. When merging expression data, the size increase should outweigh the noise inclusion and graph structure should be considered when integrating the inferences. We conclude with guidelines to take advantage of inference methods and their assessment based on the applications and available expression datasets.",

    "abstract": "Plants display an incredible variety of forms and functions, which sustains a vast diversity of ecosystems on Earth. This diversity is the result of two forces: environmental filtering, the selection of phenotypes fit to a specific habitat; and evolutionary history, genetic constraints that determine the potential adaptations that species may evolve. To date, most studies have focused on describing macroecological patterns of trait variation, while the role of evolutionary history in determining these patterns has remained much less explored. Here, we combine a traits dataset including 4,213 vascular plant species with a phylogeny of the plant kingdom, to determine the influence of evolutionary history on the patterns of trait variation. Our results show that commonly used plant traits, such as plant height or leaf nitrogen, are strongly constrained by evolutionary history. Accounting for phylogenetic relationships changes the variance explained by the main axes of trait variation in the Plant Kindgom --the leaf economic spectrum and the plant size and organ axis continuum-- with the former explaining more variance than the latter. Moreover, we demonstrate that the plant size continuum is more influenced by evolutionary history than the leaf economics spectrum. These results highlight the influence of evolutionary history in shaping plant life history strategies and the importance of accounting for phylogeny in trait-based studies.",

    "abstract": "1.As a temperature-delineated boundary, the Arctic treeline is predicted to shift northward in response to warming. However, the evidence for northward movement is mixed, with some sections of the treeline advancing while others remain stationary or even retreat. To identify the drivers of this variation, we need a landscape-level understanding of the interactions occurring between climate, tree growth, and population regeneration. In this study, we assessed regeneration alongside annual tree growth and climate during the 20th century. We used an ageheight model combined with tree height from aerial lidar to predict the age structure of 38,652 white spruce trees across 250 ha of Arctic treeline in the central Brooks Range, Alaska, USA. We then used age structure analysis to interpret the trends in regeneration and tree-ring analysis to interpret changes in annual tree growth. The climate became significantly warmer and drier circa 1975, coinciding with divergent responses of regeneration and tree growth. After 1975, regeneration of saplings (trees [&le;] 2m tall) decreased compared to previous decades whereas annual growth in mature trees (trees >2m tall) increased by 54% (p<0.0001, Wilcoxon test). Tree-ring width was positively correlated with May-August temperature (p<0.01, Pearson coefficient) during the 20th century. However, after circa 1950, the positive correlation between temperature and growth weakened (i.e., temperature divergence) while the positive correlation with July precipitation strengthened (p<0.01, Pearson coefficient), suggesting that continued drying may limit future growth at this section of Arctic treeline. We conclude that while warmer temperatures appear to benefit annual growth in mature trees, the warmer and drier environmental conditions in spring and summer inhibit regeneration and therefore may be inhibiting the northward advance at this Arctic treeline site. Researchers should consider the interactions between temperature, water availability, and tree age when examining the future of treeline and boreal forest in a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Plant-soil feedbacks are a key driver of species diversity and composition in plant communities worldwide; however, the factors that may cause feedbacks to vary within species are rarely examined. In dioecious species, the strength of feedbacks may differ near female plants that produce seed versus near male plants (which do not) because repeated inputs of seeds and high seedling densities near females may cause accumulation of host-specific soil microbes that influence seedling performance. To test whether conspecific seedling performance is reduced near seed-producing female trees relative to male or heterospecific trees, we conducted shadehouse and field experiments with a dioecious tropical tree species, Virola surinamensis (Myristicaceae), on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The shadehouse experiment isolated the effect of soil microbial communities on seedling growth and allowed us to quantify colonization by mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, while the field experiment allowed us to assess seedling survival and growth in the presence of nearby conspecific adults and seedlings. In both experiments, seedling performance was similar between seedlings grown in the soil microbial communities and field environments underneath female conspecific, male conspecific, and heterospecific trees. However, contrary to expectation, seedling colonization by AM fungi was higher in male conspecific soil microbial communities than in female or heterospecific soil microbial communities at the end of the shadehouse experiment. Together, our experiments show that while differences among female and male plants in dioecious species may influence the association of conspecific seedlings with AM fungi in their soils, this variation does not necessarily translate directly to differences in seedling performance, at least over the time frame of our experiments. Studies of additional dioecious species are needed to help determine differences in soil microbial communities beneath male and female plants and to assess the role of seed input versus adult root systems in driving plant-soil feedbacks.",

    "abstract": "High alpine regions are threatened but understudied ecosystems that harbor diverse endemic species, making them an important biome in which to test the role of environmental factors in driving functional trait-mediated community assembly processes. In a high mountain system in the central Chilean Andes, we tested hypotheses about the drivers of plant community diversity, functional composition and soil processes along an elevation gradient. We surveyed vegetation and spectroscopic reflectance (400-2400 nm) to quantify taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional, and spectral diversity at five sites from 2400 m to 3500 m elevation. We characterized soil attributes and processes by measuring water content, carbon and nitrogen, and net nitrogen mineralization rates. At high elevation, colder temperatures led to a reduction in available soil nitrogen, while at warmer, lower elevations, soil moisture was lower. Metrics of taxonomic, functional, and spectral alpha diversity peaked at mid-elevations, while phylogenetic species richness was highest at low elevation. Leaf nitrogen followed global patterns of increasing leaf nitrogen with colder temperatures, a pattern consistent at the community level as well as within individual species. The increase in leaf nitrogen, coupled with shifts in taxonomic and functional diversity associated with turnover in lineages, indicate that the ability to acquire and retain nitrogen in colder temperatures may be important in plant community assembly in this range. Such environmental filters have important implications for forecasting shifts in alpine plant communities under a warming climate.",

    "abstract": "Tiny ocean plankton (picoplankton) are fundamental for the functioning of the biosphere, but the ecological mechanisms shaping their biogeography are partially understood. Comprehending whether these microorganisms are structured by niche vs. neutral processes is highly relevant in the context of global change. The ecological drivers structuring picoplankton communities differ between prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes) in the global surface ocean: while prokaryotic communities are shaped by a balanced combination of dispersal, selection, and drift, picoeukaryotic communities are mainly shaped by dispersal limitation. Yet, whether or not the relative importance of these processes in structuring picoplankton varies as we dive into the deep ocean was unknown. Here we investigate the mechanisms structuring picoplanktonic communities inhabiting different ocean depths. We analyzed 451 samples from the tropical and subtropical global ocean and the Mediterranean Sea covering the epi- (0-200m), meso- (200- 1,000m), and bathypelagic (1,000-4,000m) depth zones. We found that selection decreased with depth possibly due to lower habitat heterogeneity. In turn, dispersal limitation increased with depth, possibly due to dispersal barriers such as water masses and bottom topography. Picoplankton {beta}-diversity positively correlated with environmental heterogeneity and water mass variability in both the open-ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. However, this relationship tended to be weaker for picoeukaryotes than for prokaryotes. Community patterns were generally more pronounced in the Mediterranean Sea, probably because of its substantial cross-basin environmental heterogeneity and deep-water isolation. Altogether, we found that different combinations of ecological mechanisms shape the biogeography of the smallest members of the ocean microbiome across ocean depths.",

Heliconius butterflies differ from other nectar-feeders due to their unique ability to digest pollen, which provides a reliable source of amino acids to adults. Pollen-feeding has been associated with prolonged adult lifespan and increased fertility, yet there is a lack of empirical data demonstrating how pollen consumption influences key fitness traits, including chemical defences and adult body weight, as well as fertility over their elongated lifespan. Here, we investigated the effect of pollen-feeding on fertility, weight and chemical defences, as well as offspring defences, controlling for butterfly age and sex. Recently emerged Heliconius erato butterflies of similar size were fed for 14 or 45 days on one of three diets: sugar solution only, or sugar solution replenished with either amino acid supplement or pollen. At the end of the experiment, oviposition assays were performed to evaluate fertility, and afterwards all butterflies and eggs were weighed and used for quantification of cyanogenic glucosides (CG). We found that there is an age-specific and sex-specific effect of pollen-feeding on butterfly weight, with both the sugar-only and amino-acid supplement diets reducing the weight of old females (45d), but not young females (14d) or males of any age. Females fed only sugar significantly reduced their egg-laying through adulthood, whereas females that had access to pollen maintained their fertility. Diet had a significant effect on the maintenance of the chemical defence of females, but not males. Curiously, even though females that have access to pollen were heavier, more toxic and laid more eggs, this did not translate into improvements in offspring defences, as eggs from butterflies of all ages and diet treatments had similar CG content. Our results emphasise the importance of controlling for age-specific and sex-specific effects in studies of life-history evolution and demonstrate that dietary novelty can relax energetic constraints.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of genomic conservation between human and pig at the functional level can help understand and improve the potential of pig as a human biomedical model. To address this, we developed a Deep learning-based approach to learn the Genomic Conservation at the Functional level (DeepGCF) between species by integrating 386 and 374 epigenome and transcriptome profiles from human and pig, respectively. DeepGCF demonstrated a better prediction performance compared to the previous functional conservation prediction method. In addition, we showed that the resulting DeepGCF score captures the functional conservation by examining DeepGCF on chromatin states, sequence ontologies, and regulatory variants. Regions with higher DeepGCF score play a more important role in regulatory activities and show heritability enrichment in human complex traits and diseases. Our DeepGCF approach shows a promising application on the comparison of cross-species functional conservation, and the model framework can be easily adapted to other species. By expanding the model to integrate the functional profiles of multiple species, including human, mouse, pig, cattle, and other livestock animals in the future, the functional conservation information will provide additional insight into the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms behind complex traits and diseases.",

    "abstract": "RationaleExperimental studies suggest that exposures may impact respiratory health across generations via epigenetic changes transmitted specifically through male germ cells. Studies in humans are however limited. We aim to identify epigenetic marks in offspring associated with fathers preconception smoking.\n\nMethodsWe conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in the RHINESSA cohort on fathers any preconception smoking (N=875 offspring) and fathers pubertal onset smoking <15 years (N=304), using Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip arrays, adjusting for offspring age, maternal smoking and personal smoking. EWAS of maternal and offspring personal smoking were performed for replication.\n\nResultsFathers smoking commencing preconception was associated with methylation of blood DNA in offspring at two Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine sites (CpGs) (False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05) in PRR5 and CENPP. Fathers pubertal onset smoking was associated with 19 CpGs (FDR <0.05) mapped to 14 genes (TLR9, DNTT, FAM53B, NCAPG2, PSTPIP2, MBIP, C2orf39, NTRK2, DNAJC14, CDO1, PRAP1, TPCN1, IRS1 and CSF1R). These differentially methylated sites were hypermethylated and associated with promoter regions capable of gene silencing. Some of these sites were associated with offspring outcomes in this cohort including ever-asthma (NTRK2), ever-wheezing (DNAJC14, TPCN1), weight (FAM53B, NTRK2) and BMI (FAM53B, NTRK2) (P< 0.05). Pathway analysis showed enrichment for gene ontology pathways including regulation of gene expression, inflammation and innate immune responses.\n\nConclusionFathers preconception smoking, particularly in puberty, is associated with offspring DNA methylation, providing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms may underly epidemiological observations that pubertal paternal smoking increases risk of offspring asthma, low lung function and obesity.",

Therefore, it is crucial to better understand virus distributions across cultivated and uncultivated communities in agro-ecological interfaces, as well as virus exchange among them. Here we advance fundamental understanding in this area by characterizing the virome of three co-occurring replicated Poaceae community types that represent a gradient of grass species richness and management intensity, from highly managed crop monocultures to little-managed, species-rich grasslands. We performed a large-scale study on 950 wild and cultivated Poaceae over two years combining untargeted virome analysis down to virus species level with targeted detection of three plant viruses. Deep sequencing revealed i) a diversified and largely unknown Poaceae virome (at least 51 virus species/taxa), with an abundance of so-called persistent viruses; ii) an increase of virome richness with grass species richness within the community; iii) a stable virome richness over time but a large viral intraspecific variability; and iv) contrasted patterns of virus prevalence, co-infections and geographical distribution among plant communities and species. Our findings highlight the complex structure of plant virus communities in nature and suggest the influence of anthropic management on viral distribution and prevalence.",

While vascularization is emerging as a necessary physiological organ-level feature required in most such systems, there is no standard tool or morphological metric to measure the performance or biological function of vascularized networks within these models. Further, the commonly reported morphological metrics may not correlate to the networks biological function - oxygen transport. Here, a large library of vascular network images was analyzed by the measure of each samples morphology and oxygen transport potential. The oxygen transport quantification is computationally expensive and user-dependent, so machine learning techniques were examined to generate regression models relating morphology to function. Principal component and factor analyses were applied to reduce dimensionality of the multivariate dataset, followed by multiple linear regression and tree-based regression analyses. These examinations reveal that while several morphological data relate poorly to the biological function, some machine learning models possess a relatively improved, but still moderate predictive potential. Overall, random forest regression model correlates to the biological function of vascular networks with relatively higher accuracy than other regression models.",

By integrating SWIR-OPI with U-Net, a deep learning image segmentation algorithm, we automated the lymph node size measurement process. Changes in lymph nodes in response to cancer progression were monitored in two separate mouse cancer models, through which we obtained insights into pre-metastatic niches and correlation between lymph node masses and many important biomarkers.

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of mortality that occurs when an embolus becomes lodged in the cerebral vasculature and obstructs blood flow in the brain. The severity of AIS is determined by the location and how extensively emboli become lodged, which are dictated in large part by the cerebral flow and the dynamics of embolus migration which are difficult to measure in vivo in AIS patients. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to predict the patient-specific hemodynamics and embolus migration and lodging in the cerebral vasculature to better understand the underlying mechanics of AIS. To be relied upon, however, the computational simulations must be verified and validated. In this study, a realistic in vitro experimental model and a corresponding computational model of the cerebral vasculature are established that can be used to investigate flow and embolus migration and lodging in the brain. First, the in vitro anatomical model is described, including how the flow distribution in the model is tuned to match physiological measurements from the literature. Measurements of pressure and flow rate for both normal and stroke conditions were acquired and corresponding CFD simulations were performed and compared with the experiments to validate the flow predictions. Overall, the CFD simulations were in relatively close agreement with the experiments, to within {+/-}7% of the mean experimental data with many of the CFD predictions within the uncertainty of the experimental measurement. This work provides an in vitro benchmark data set for flow in a realistic cerebrovascular model and is a first step towards validating a computational model of AIS.",

    "abstract": "Young immature granule cells (imGCs) appear via adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In comparison to mature GCs (mGCs) (born during development), the imGCs exhibit two competing distinct properties such as high excitability and low excitatory innervation. We develop a spiking neural network for the DG, incorporating the imGCs, and investigate their effect on pattern separation (i.e., a process of transforming similar input patterns into less similar output patterns). We first consider the effect of high excitability. The imGCs become very highly active due to their low firing threshold. Then, because of high activation, strong pattern correlation occurs, which results in pattern integration (i.e., making association between events). On the other hand, the mGCs exhibit very sparse firing activity due to strongly increased feedback inhibition (caused by the high activation of the imGCs). As a result of high sparsity, the pattern separation efficacy (PSE) of the mGCs becomes very high. Thus, the whole population of GCs becomes a heterogeneous one, composed of a (major) subpopulation of mGCs (i.e., pattern separators) with very low activation degree [Formula] and a (minor) subpopulation of imGCs (i.e., pattern integrators) with very high activation degree [Formula]. In the whole heterogeneous population, the overall activation degree [Formula] of all the GCs is a little reduced in comparison to the activation degree [Formula] in the presence of only mGCs without imGCs. However, no pattern separation occurs, due to heterogeneous sparsity, in contrast to the usual intuitive thought that sparsity could improve PSE. Next, we consider the effect of low excitatory innervation for the imGCs, counteracting the effect of their high excitability. With decreasing the connection probability of excitatory inputs to the imGCs, [Formula] decreases so rapidly, and their effect becomes weaker. Then, the feedback inhibition to the mGCs is also decreased, leading to increase in [Formula] of the mGCs. Accordingly, [Formula] of the whole GCs also increases. In this case of low excitatory connectivity, the imGCs perform pattern integration. On the other hand, due to increase in [Formula], the PSE of the mGCs decreases from a high value to a limit value. In the whole population of all the GCs, when the excitatory connection probability decreases through a threshold, pattern separation starts, the overall PSE increases and approaches that of the mGCs. However, due to heterogeneity caused by the imGCs, the overall PSE becomes deteriorated, in comparison with that in the presence of only mGCs.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathological aging is associated with memory impairment and cognitive decline, and affects several brain areas including the neurogenic niche of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG). In the healthy brain homeostatic mechanisms regulate neurogenesis in the DG to facilitate the continuous generation of neurons from neural stem cells (NSC). Nevertheless, aging reduces the number of activated neural stem cells, and diminishes the number of newly generated neurons. Strategies that promote neurogenesis in the DG may improve cognitive performance in the elderly resulting in the development of treatments to prevent the progression of neurological disorders in the aged population.\n\nOur work is aimed to discover targeting molecules to be used in the design of pharmacological agents to prevent the neurological effects of pathological aging. We study the effect of age on hippocampal neurogenesis using the SAMP8 mouse as a model of pathological aging. Thus, we show that in six-month-old SAMP8 mice, episodic and spatial memory are impaired, concomitantly the generation of neuroblasts and neurons is reduced and the generation of astrocytes is increased in this model. The novelty of our work resides in the fact that treatment of SAMP8 mice with a TGF-alpha targeting molecule, prevents the observed defects, positively regulating neurogenesis and improving cognitive performance. This compound facilitates the release of TGF-alpha in vitro and in vivo and activates signaling pathways initiated by this growth factor. We conclude that targeting the release of TGF-alpha may be the basis of pharmacological drugs to counteract the neurological effects of pathological aging.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional activation depends on the interplay of chromatin modifiers to establish a permissive epigenetic landscape. While histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation has long been associated with gene repression, there is limited evidence to support a role for H3K9 demethylases in gene activation. Here we describe the H3K9 demethylase Kdm4d/JMJD2d as a positive regulator of type I interferon responses. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), depletion of JMJD2d attenuates the transcriptional response, conferring increased viral susceptibility, while overexpression of the demethylase results in more robust IFN activation. We find that the underlying mechanism of JMJD2d in type I interferon responses consists of an effect both on the transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and on dynamic H3K9me2 at associated promoters. In support of these findings, we establish that JMJD2d is associated with enhancer regions throughout the genome prior to stimulation but is redistributed to inducible promoters in conjunction with transcriptional activation. Taken together, our data reveal JMJD2d as a chromatin modifier that connects enhancer transcription with promoter demethylation to modulate transcriptional responses.",

Serine biosynthesis defects present in a broad phenotypic spectrum that includes, at the severe end, Neu-Laxova syndrome, a lethal multiple congenital anomaly disease, intermediately in the form of infantile serine biosynthesis defects with severe neurological manifestations and growth deficiency, and at the mild end, as childhood disease with intellectual disability. However, because L-serine supplementation, especially if started early, can ameliorate and in some cases even prevent symptoms, knowledge of pathogenic variants is highly actionable.\n\nMethodsRecently, our laboratory established a yeast-based assay for human PSAT1 function. We have now applied it at scale to assay the functional impact of 1,914 SNV-accessible amino acid substitutions. In addition to assaying the functional impact of individual variants in yeast haploid cells, we can assay pairwise combinations of PSAT1 alleles that recapitulate human genotypes, including compound heterozygotes, in yeast diploids.\n\nResultsResults of our assays of individual variants (in haploid yeast cells) agree well with clinical interpretations and protein structure-function relationships, supporting the use of our data as functional evidence under the ACMG interpretation guidelines. Results from our diploid assay successfully distinguish patient genotypes from those of healthy carriers and agree well with disease severity. Finally, we present a linear model that uses individual allele measurements (in haploid yeast cells) to accurately predict the biallelic function (in diploid yeast cells) of ~1.8 million allele combinations corresponding to potential human genotypes.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, our work provides an example of how large-scale functional assays in model systems can be powerfully applied to the study of a rare disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLow-pass sequencing followed by sequence variant genotype imputation is an alternative to the routine microarray-based genotyping in cattle. However, the impact of haplotype reference panel composition and its interplay with the coverage of low-pass whole-genome sequencing data has not been sufficiently explored in typical livestock settings where only a small number of reference samples are available.\n\nMethodsSequence variant genotyping accuracy was compared between two variant callers, GATK and DeepVariant, in 50 Brown Swiss cattle with sequencing coverages ranging from 4 to 63-fold. Haplotype reference panels of varying sizes and composition were built with DeepVariant considering 501 cattle from nine breeds. High coverage sequencing data of 24 Brown Swiss cattle was downsampled to between 0.01- and 4-fold coverage to mimic low-pass sequencing. GLIMPSE was used to infer sequence variant genotypes from the low-pass sequencing data using different haplotype reference panels. The accuracy of the sequence variant genotypes imputed inferred from low-pass sequencing data was compared with sequence variant genotypes called from high-coverage data.\n\nResultsDeepVariant was used to establish bovine haplotype reference panels because it outperformed GATK in all evaluations. Same-breed haplotype reference panels were better suited to impute sequence variant genotypes from low-pass sequencing than equally-sized multibreed haplotype reference panels for all target sample coverages and allele frequencies. F1 scores greater than 0.9, implying high harmonic means of recall and precision of called genotypes, were achieved with 0.25-fold sequencing coverage when large breed-specific haplotype reference panels (n = 150) were used. In absence of such large same-breed haplotype panels, variant genotyping accuracy from low-pass sequencing could be increased either by adding non-related samples to the haplotype reference panel or by increasing the coverage of the low-pass sequencing data. Sequence variant genotyping from low pass sequencing was substantially less accurate when the reference panel lacks individuals from the target breed.\n\nConclusionsVariant genotyping is more accurate with Deep-Variant than GATK. DeepVariant is therefore suitable to establish bovine haplotype reference panels. Medium-sized breed-specific haplotype reference panels and large multibreed haplotype reference panels enable accurate imputation of low-pass sequencing data in a typical cattle breed.",

    "abstract": "The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a hallmark of cancer metastasis and morbidity. EMT is a non-binary process, and cells can be stably arrested en route to EMT in an intermediate hybrid state associated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness and worse patient outcomes. Understanding EMT progression in detail will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying metastasis. Despite increasingly available single-cell RNA sequencing data that enable in-depth analyses of EMT at the single-cell resolution, current inferential approaches are limited to bulk microarray data. There is thus a great need for computational frameworks to systematically infer and predict the timing and distribution of EMT-related states at single-cell resolution. Here, we develop a computational framework for reliable inference and prediction of EMT-related trajectories from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our model can be utilized across a variety of applications to predict the timing and distribution of EMT from single-cell sequencing data.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/523978v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c56970org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d7371org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19612f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b7cf96_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA fully stochastic model elucidates the population dynamics of EMT\nC_LIO_LIA data-driven pipeline is introduced to track EMT trajectories from single-cell RNA sequencing\nC_LIO_LICell cycle scoring reveals cell line-dependent patterns of EMT Induction\nC_LI",

Macroscale SMT requires perfusable channels to guarantee cell survival and support elements to enable mechanical cell stimulation and uniaxial myofiber formation.

A perfusable microchannel network is designed to functionally integrate with perfusable anchors for insertion into a maturation culture template. The results demonstrate that (i) co-printed synthetic structures display highly coherent interfaces with the living tissue; (ii) perfusable designs preserve cells from hypoxia all over the scaffold volume; and (iii) constructs can undergo passive mechanical tension during matrix remodeling.

    "abstract": "Metacaspases are part of an evolutionarily broad family of multifunctional cysteine proteases, involved in disease and normal development. Despite the extensive study of metacaspases in the two decades since their discovery, the structure-function relationship of metacaspases remains poorly understood. Furthermore, previous studies on their function have been thwarted by the redundancy in gene copy number and potential phenotypic suppression of genetic mutations, especially in plants. Here, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of an Arabidopsis thaliana type II metacaspase (AtMCA-IIf) that belongs to a particular sub-group that does not require calcium ions for activation. Compared to crystal structures of other metacaspases and caspases, the AtMCA-IIf active site is structurally similar and poses a conundrum for the catalytic mechanism of the cysteine-histidine dyad. To study metacaspase activity in plants, we developed an in vitro chemical screen to identify small molecule metacaspase inhibitors. Several hits with a minimal thioxodihydropyrimidine-dione (TDP) structure were identified, some being specific inhibitors of AtMCA-IIf. We provide a mechanistic basis for inhibition by the TDP-containing compounds through molecular docking onto the AtMCA-IIf crystal structure. Finally, a TDP-containing compound (TDP6) was effective at inhibiting lateral root emergence in vivo, likely through the inhibition of metacaspases that are specifically expressed in the endodermal cells overlaying developing lateral root primordia. In the future, the small compound inhibitors and crystal structure of AtMCA-IIf can be used to study metacaspases in various other species, such as important human pathogens including those causing neglected diseases.",

    "abstract": "Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are pivotal in regulating establishment, progression, and outcome of an infection. Affinity-purification mass spectrometry has become instrumental for the characterization of HPIs, however the targeted nature of exogenously expressing individual viral proteins has limited its utility to the analysis of relatively small pathogens. Here we present the use of co-fractionation mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) for the high-throughput analysis of HPIs from native viral infections of two jumbophages ({phi}KZ and{phi} PA3) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This enabled the detection >6000 unique host-pathogen and >200 pathogen-pathogen interactions for each phage, encompassing >50% of the phage proteome. Interactome-wide comparison across phages showed similar perturbed protein interactions suggesting fundamentally conserved mechanisms of phage predation within the KZ-like phage family. Prediction of novel ORFs revealed a{phi} PA3 complex showing strong structural and sequence similarity to{phi} KZ nvRNAp, suggesting{phi} PA3 also possesses two RNA polymerases acting at different stages of the infection cycle. We further expanded our understanding on the molecular organization of the virion packaged and injected proteome by identifying 23 novel virion components and 5 novel injected proteins, as well as providing the first evidence for interactions between KZ-like phage proteins and the host ribosome. To enable accessibility to this data, we developed PhageMAP, an online resource for network query, visualization, and interaction prediction (https://phagemap.ucsf.edu/). We anticipate this study will lay the foundation for the application of co-fractionation mass spectrometry for the scalable profiling of hostpathogen interactomes and protein complex dynamics upon infection.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The environmental and economic costs of conventional insecticides have stirred an interest in alternative management tactics, including the use of nanotechnologies. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have many applications in agriculture but may not be compatible with biological control; however, low concentrations of SeNPs may benefit natural enemies via hormesis. This study investigates the concentration-dependent effects of SeNPs (0-1000 mg L-1) on Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a generalist parasitoid of stored product pests. RESULTS: The LC50 of SeNPs was 1540 mg L-1 for female parasitoids and 1164 mg L-1 for males. SeNPs had a significant hormetic effect; average lifespan increased by 10% at a concentration of 4.03 mg L-1 for females and by 35% at 13.83 mg L-1 for males. In a bioassay including hosts (the azuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae)), a low concentration of SeNPs (25 mg L-1) enhanced the performance of female parasitoids; lifespan increased by 23% and the number of offspring increased by 88%. However, the number of emerging hosts did not significantly decrease; in the absence of parasitism, SeNPs actually improved host emergence by 17%. CONCLUSION: Because higher concentrations of SeNPs reduced parasitoid lifespan, whereas low concentrations enhanced not only parasitoid performance but also host emergence, practitioners should exercise caution when considering SeNPs for use in integrated pest management.",

    "abstract": "Age and sex are historically understudied factors in biomedical studies even though many complex traits and diseases vary by these factors in their incidence and presentation. As a result, there are massive gaps in our understanding of genes and molecular mechanisms that underlie sex- and age-associated physiology and disease. Hundreds of thousands of publicly-available human transcriptomes capturing gene expression profiles of tissues across the body and subject to various biomedical and clinical factors present an invaluable, yet untapped, opportunity for bridging these gaps. Here, we present a computational framework that leverages these data to infer genome-wide molecular signatures specific to sex and age groups. As the vast majority of these profiles lack age and sex labels, the core idea of our framework is to use the measured expression data to predict missing age/sex metadata and derive the signatures from the predictive models. We first curated [~]30,000 primary samples associated with age and sex information and profiled using microarray and RNA-seq. Then, we used this dataset to infer sex-biased genes within eleven age groups along the human lifespan and then trained machine learning (ML) models to predict these age groups from gene expression values separately within females and males. Specifically, we trained one-vs-rest logistic regression classifiers with elastic-net regularization to classify transcriptomes into age groups. Dataset-level cross validation shows that these ML classifiers are able to discriminate between age groups in a biologically meaningful way in each sex across technologies. Further, these predictive models capture sex-stratified age-group  gene signatures, i.e., the strength and the direction of importance of genes across the genome for each age group in each sex. Enrichment analysis of these gene signatures with prior gene annotations helped in identifying age- and sex-associated multi-tissue and pan-body molecular phenomena (e.g., general immune response, inflammation, metabolism, hormone response). Overall, we have presented a path for effectively leveraging massive public omics data collections to investigate the molecular basis of age- and sex-differences in physiology and disease.",

The corresponding mathematical model consists of a large system of non-linear Ordinary Differential Equations for the unknown proteins concentrations depending on a consistently large number of kinetic parameters and initial concentrations. For this model, the present paper considers the problem of assessing the impact of each parameter and initial concentration on the systems output. More specifically, we introduced a statistical sensitivity index whose values can be easily computed by means of principal component analysis, and which leads to the partition of the parameters and initial concentrations sets into sensible and non-sensible families. This approach allows the identification of those kinetic parameters and initial concentrations that mostly impact the mutation-driven modification of the proteomic profile at equilibrium, and of those pathways in the network that are mostly affected by the presence of mutations in the cancer cell.",

    "abstract": "Data-Dependent and Data-Independent Acquisition modes (DDA and DIA, respectively) are both widely used to acquire MS2 spectra in untargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics analyses. Despite their wide use, little work has been attempted to systematically compare their performance due to the difficulty and cost of performing comparisons with real experimental data due to the lack of ground truth and the costs involved in running large number of acquisitions. Here, we present a systematic in-silico comparison of these two acquisition methods. To do so, we extended our Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometer (ViMMS) framework with a DIA module. Our results show that the performance of these methods varies with the average number of co-eluting ions as the most important factor. At low numbers, DIA outperforms DDA, but at higher numbers, DDA has an advantage as DIA can no longer deal with the large amount of overlapping ion chromatograms. Results from simulation were further validated on an actual mass spectrometer, demonstrating that using ViMMS we can draw conclusions from simulation that translate well into the real world. Embedding this work within ViMMS also allows for researchers to easily simulate DDA and DIA LC-MS/MS runs, validate them on actual instrument, and potentially prototype novel methods that best combine the characteristics of both approaches. We believe that this work provides a useful guide to the choice of DIA or DDA for scientists involved in metabolomics data acquisition.",

To better understand these cells, we conducted an exploratory mass cytometry analysis of immune cell subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), connective-tissue disease (CTD)-related ILD, and sarcoidosis, using two panels including 64 markers.

Analysis of B cells revealed the presence of cells at various stages of differentiation in BALF, with a higher percentage of IgG memory B cells in CTD-ILDs and a trend toward more FCRL5+ B cells. These FCRL5+B cells were also present in the patient with AEx-IPF and sarcoidosis with advanced lung lesions.

Here, we develop an efficient and scalable wet lab and computational protocol for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing that seeks to provide a genuine alternative to short-reads for large-scale genomics projects. We applied our protocol to cell lines and brain tissue samples as part of a pilot project for the NIH Center for Alzheimers and Related Dementias (CARD). Using a single PromethION flow cell, we can detect SNPs with F1-score better than Illumina short-read sequencing. Small indel calling remains difficult within homopolymers and tandem repeats, but is comparable to Illumina calls elsewhere. Further, we can discover structural variants with F1-score comparable to state-of-the-art methods involving Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing and trio information (but at a lower cost and greater throughput). Using ONT-based phasing, we can then combine and phase small and structural variants at megabase scales. Our protocol also produces highly accurate, haplotype-specific methylation calls. Overall, this makes large-scale long-read sequencing projects feasible; the protocol is currently being used to sequence thousands of brain-based genomes as a part of the NIH CARD initiative.

More studies indicated that these cancers are related to the change in the gut microbiome that can cause metabolic and immune system disorders in the body.

In this study, we inoculated 4T1 breast cancer cells to induce breast cancer tumorigenesis in mice and collected their feces samples at different stages during this process. These intestinal florae were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the results showed that at the phylum level, the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes decreased with the development of the tumor; at the family level, the intestinal microbiome had obvious variations of Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, etc. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and COG annotation demonstrated that decreased abundance of cancer related signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Infants and children with MLL-AF4+ leukemia have an urgent need for more efficient and less aggressive therapy. In this study, we studied three microRNAs that are downregulated in MLL-AF4+ B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL): miR-194, miR-99b and miR-125a-5p. When overexpressed, all three microRNAs impaired the survival of MLL-AF4+ leukemic blasts and the maintenance of MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL. We identified microRNA target genes responsible for this phenotype that are upregulated in MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL: CA5B, PPP3CA and PPP2R5C. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and specific inhibitors, we confirmed that CA5B, PPP3CA and PPP2R5C downregulation/inhibition severely compromised the proliferation and survival of MLL-AF4+ leukemic blasts. Importantly, CA5B, PPP3CA and PP2A inhibition by acetazolamide, tacrolimus and LB-100, respectively, showed high toxicity towards MLL-AF4+ leukemic blasts and reduced leukemia burden in vivo. This study highlights how the unique microRNA expression signature of patients with MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL can be used to uncover novel therapeutic avenues and accelerate drug repurposing.\n\nStatement of significanceThere is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic avenues for patients with MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL that are more effective and less aggressive. This study identified three clinically available drugs (acetazolamide, tacrolimus and LB-100) with high and selective toxicity towards MLL-AF4+ leukemic cells.",

    "abstract": "The geographical exchange of non-native insects can be highly asymmetrical, with some world regions  exporting or  importing more species than others. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain such asymmetries, including differences in propagule pressure, environmental features in recipient regions, or biological traits of invaders. We tested aspects of these hypotheses in the context of the exchange of non-native insects between North America, Europe, and Australasia. Europe was the dominant exporter of non-native insect species between the three regions, with most of this asymmetry arising prior to 1950. The European dominance could not be explained by differences in import value, source species pool sizes, or native plant richness in the recipient regions. We identified that the introduction of non-native plants, driven in part by European colonization, best explains the asymmetrical exchange of non-native insects between our focal regions.",
