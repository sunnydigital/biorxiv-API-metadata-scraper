    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease that typically presents late with poor patient outcomes. There is a pronounced medical need for early detection of pancreatic cancer, which can be addressed by identifying high-risk populations. Here we apply artificial intelligence (AI) methods to a dataset of 6 million patient records with 24,000 pancreatic cancer cases in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) and, for comparison, a dataset of three million records with 3,900 pancreatic cancer cases in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (US-VA) healthcare system. In contrast to existing methods that do not use temporal information, we explicitly train machine learning models on the time sequence of diseases in patient clinical histories and test the ability to predict cancer occurrence in time intervals of 3 to 60 months after risk assessment.\n\nFor cancer occurrence within 36 months, the performance of the best model (AUROC=0.88, DNPR), trained and tested on disease trajectories, exceeds that of a model without longitudinal information (AUROC=0.85, DNPR). Performance decreases when disease events within a 3 month window before cancer diagnosis are excluded from training (AUROC[3m]=0.83). Independent training and testing on the US-VA dataset reaches comparable performance (AUROC=0.78, AUROC[3m]=0.76). These results raise the state-of-the-art level of performance of cancer risk prediction on real-world data sets and provide support for the design of prediction-surveillance programs based on risk assessment in a large population followed by affordable surveillance of a relatively small number of patients at highest risk. Use of AI on real-world clinical records has the potential to shift focus from treatment of late-stage to early-stage cancer, benefiting patients by improving lifespan and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive resource defense spans from the transient monopolization of a resource up to the long-term maintenance of a territory. While such interference competition is common in nectar-feeding birds, reports in nectar-feeding bats are rare. Glossophaga bats have been observed to temporarily defend flowers but the extent of this monopolization, its effects on nectar intake, and underlying sexual differences have remained unknown. We investigated resource defense behavior of Glossophaga mutica in the laboratory. We presented bats with two patches of computer-controlled artificial flowers and tracked individual nectar intake. Furthermore, we established an automated method for detecting aggressive interactions at the artificial flowers. Theoretical models of interference competition predict more aggressive interactions when resources are spatially more clumped. To test this, we varied resource distribution across two patches from clumped to dispersed and monitored bats interactions in one male, one female, and four mixed-sex groups. Males engaged in aggressive interactions more often than females and in each group some individuals defended clumped artificial flowers against others. Subordinate males experienced a substantial decrease in nectar intake, while females were only marginally affected by male aggression. These results suggest that aggressive interactions and their effect on nectar intake are sex-dependent in G. mutica. Furthermore, aggressive interactions were more frequent and resource defense was only successful when resources were clumped. Our experimental set-up allowed us to perform an automated test of models of interference competition with a mammal under controlled laboratory conditions. This approach may pave the way for similar studies with other animals.\n\nLay summaryMales bully other males to get more food, but only when food is easy to defend. When flowers are spread out nectar-feeding bats rarely engage in fights. However, when there are rich flowers in one spot and no flowers elsewhere, some males start attacking others, denying them access to the nectar. Females do not seem bothered by such male bullies, but when there are no males around, some females become bullies themselves.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a major means for the elimination of protein inclusions in neurons in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD). Yet, the mechanism of autophagy in the other brain cell type, glia, is less well characterized and remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that the PD risk factor Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK)/dAuxilin (dAux) is a new component in glial autophagy. GAK/dAux directly interacts with ULK1/Atg1 via its uncoating domain. Lack of GAK/dAux increases the autophagosome number and size in adult fly glia and mouse microglia, and generally upregulates levels of components in the initiation and PI3K class III complexes including ULK1/Atg1, demonstrating that GAK/dAux regulates the onset of glial autophagy. Consistently, lack of GAK/dAux enhances Atg1 and Atg9 trafficking to autophagosomes, promoting autophagy initiation. On the other hand, lack of GAK/dAux impairs the autophagic flux and blocks substrate degradation, suggesting that GAK/dAux might play additional roles in glial autophagy. Our findings identify a new autophagy factor in glia; considering the pivotal role of glia under pathological conditions, targeting glial autophagy is potentially a therapeutic strategy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Amplitude modulation (AM) is a common feature of natural sounds, including speech and animal vocalizations. Here, we used operant conditioning and in vivo electrophysiology to determine the AM detection threshold of mice as well as its underlying neuronal encoding. Mice were trained in a Go-NoGo task to detect the transition to AM within a noise stimulus designed to prevent the use of spectral side-bands or a change in intensity as alternative cues. Our results indicate that mice, in comparison with other species, detect high modulation frequencies up to 512 Hz well, but show much poorer performance at low frequencies. Our in vivo multielectrode recordings in the inferior colliculus (IC) of both anesthetized and awake mice revealed a few single units with remarkable phase-locking ability to 512 Hz modulation, but not sufficient to explain the good behavioral detection at that frequency. Using a model of the population response that combined dimensionality reduction with threshold detection, we reproduced the general band-pass characteristics of behavioral detection based on a subset of neurons showing the largest firing rate change (both increase and decrease) in response to AM, suggesting that these neurons are instrumental in the behavioral detection of AM stimuli by the mice.\n\nNew and NoteworthyThe amplitude of natural sounds, including speech and animal vocalizations, often shows characteristic modulations. We examined the relationship between neuronal responses in the mouse inferior colliculus and the behavioral detection of amplitude modulation in sound, and modelled how the former can give rise to the latter. Our model suggests that behavioral detection can be well explained by the activity of a subset of neurons showing the largest firing rate changes in response to AM.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented shift in childrens daily lives. Children are increasingly spending time with screens to learn and connect with others. As the online environment rapidly substitutes in-person experience, understanding childrens neuropsychological trajectories associated with screen experiences is important. Previous findings suggest that excessive screen use can lead children to prefer more immediate rewards over delayed outcomes. We hypothesized that increased screen time delays a childs development of inhibitory control. By analyzing neuropsychological data from 8,324 children (9-11ys) from the ABCD Study, we found that children who had more screen time showed a higher reward orientation and a weaker inhibitory control system (i.e., fronto-striatal circuitry) in the brain. Importantly, we found that the interaction between screen exposure and reward sensitivity negatively influenced the development of the inhibitory control system in the brain over a two year period. These results indicate possible negative long-term impacts of increased daily screen time on childrens neuropsychological development. The results further demonstrated that screen time influences dorsal striatum connectivity, which suggests that the effect of daily screen use is a habitual seeking behavior. The study provides neural and behavioral evidence on the negative impact of daily screen use on developing children.",

    "abstract": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a growth factor-like bioactive phospholipid recognising LPA receptors (LPARs) and mediating signalling pathways that regulate embryonic development, wound healing, carcinogenesis, and fibrosis, via effects on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Extracellular LPA is generated from lysophospholipids by the secreted hydrolase - ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2; also, AUTOTAXIN / ATX) and metabolised by different membrane-bound phospholipid phosphatases (PLPPs). Here, we use public bulk and singlecell RNA sequencing datasets to explore the gene expression of Lpar1-6, Enpp2, and Plpp genes under skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration conditions. We show that the skeletal muscle system dynamically expresses the Enpp2-Lpar-Plpp gene axis, with Lpar1 being the highest expressed member among LPARs. Lpar1 was expressed by mesenchymal fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and tenocytes, whereas FAPs mainly expressed Enpp2. Clustering of FAPs identified populations representing distinct cell states with robust Lpar1 and Enpp2 transcriptome signatures in homeostatic cells expressing higher levels of markers Dpp4 and Hsd11b1. However, tissue injury induced transient repression of Lpar genes and Enpp2. The role of LPA in modulating the fate and differentiation of tissue-resident FAPs has not yet been explored. Ex vivo, LPAR1/3 and ENPP2 inhibition significantly decreased the cell-cycle activity of FAPs and impaired fibro-adipogenic differentiation, implicating LPA signalling in the modulation of the proliferative and differentiative fate of FAPs. Together, our results demonstrate the importance of the ENPP2-LPAR-PLPP axis in different muscle cell types and FAP lineage populations in homeostasis and injury, paving the way for further research on the role of this signalling pathway in skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration, and that of other organs and tissues, in vivo.\n\nSummaryOur reanalysis of single-cell transcriptomics revealed the involvement and temporally dynamic expression of the ENPP2-LPAR-PLPP axis in response to skeletal muscle regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a stage of development characterized by neurodevelopmental specialization of cognitive processes. In particular, working memory continues to improve through adolescence, with increases in response accuracy and decreases in response latency continuing well into the twenties. Human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate that gamma oscillations (35-65 Hz) during the working memory delay period support the maintenance of mnemonic information guiding subsequent goal-driven behavior, which decrease in power with development. Importantly, recent electrophysiological studies have shown that gamma events, more so than sustained activity, may underlie working memory maintenance during the delay period. However, developmental differences in gamma events during working memory have not been studied. Here, we used EEG in conjunction with a novel spectral event processing approach to investigate age-related differences in transient gamma band activity during a memory guided saccade (MGS) task in 164 10- to 30-year-olds. Total gamma power was found to significantly decrease through adolescence, replicating prior findings. Results from the spectral event pipeline showed age-related decreases in the mean power of gamma events and trial-by-trial power variability across both the delay period and fixation epochs of the MGS task. In addition, we found that while event number decreased with age during the fixation period, it did not appear to change during the delay period resulting in an increasing difference between the number of events during fixation and delay period with development, suggesting that as working memory develops there is greater specificity for gamma events supporting working memory. While average power of the transient gamma events was found to mediate age-related changes in total gamma power, the number of gamma events was unrelated to total power, suggesting that the power of gamma events may underlie the sustained gamma activity seen in EEG literature while the number of events may directly support age-related improvements in working memory maintenance. Our findings provide compelling new evidence for mechanistic changes in neural processing characterized by refinements in neural function as behavior becomes optimized in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Under conditions of proteostasis disequilibrium, neurons can enhance intracellular and extracellular protective mechanisms to guard against neurotoxicity. In mammals, an intracellular response to severe proteostasis imbalance that results from proteosome inhibition is the formation of juxtanuclear intermediate filament-surrounded, aggregate-filled aggresomes, which sequester threatening aggregates for later disposal via lysosomal degradation. Highly proteo-stressed neurons can also engage the assistance of neighboring cells in aggregate removal by loading threatening materials into large exopher vesicles that are transferred to neighboring cells for remote degradation of contents, a process that has been suggested to be analogous to the process that enables aggregate spreading in the human brain in neurodegenerative disease. In C. elegans these large extruded vesicles are called exophers.\n\nHere we document that players involved in aggresome biology are required for the elimination of potentially deleterious materials in neuronal exophers. We show that in proteostressed C. elegans touch receptor neurons, intermediate filament proteins IFD-1 and IFD-2 can assemble into juxtanuclear structures with multiple molecular and cellular characteristics of mammalian aggresomes. IFD-concentrating structures depend upon orthologs of mammalian adapter proteins, dynein motors, and microtubule integrity for aggregate collection into juxtanuclear compartments where they associate with ubiquitinated and neurotoxic polyglutamine expansion proteins. Strikingly, disruption of aggresome-decoration genes encoding IFDs or disruption of the BAG/14-3-3/Hsc70 adapter that promote aggregate loading of aggresome-like organelles, lowers exopher production via a cell autonomous mechanism. Although aggresome-like structures are not mandatory exopher cargo, IFD compartments can be extruded from neurons in exophers, revealing a previously unreported strategy to eliminate neuronal aggresome-like organelles via transfer to neighboring cells. Human IF neurofilament light chain hNFL can partially substitute for C. elegans IFD-2 proteins in promoting exopher production, indicating conservation of the capacity of intermediate filaments to influence neuronal aggregate extrusions across phyla. In sum, we identify a requirement for specific intermediate filaments, counterparts of human biomarkers of neuronal injury and disease and major components of Parkinsons disease Lewy bodies, in C. elegans neuronal aggresome-like organelle formation and large vesicle exopher extrusion from stressed neurons.",

    "abstract": "Ufmylation, a protein modification by Ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein UFM1, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes including DNA damage response, protein translation and ER homeostasis. To date, little is known how the enzymes responsible for this modification coordinate their action. Here we have studied the details of UFL1 (E3) activity, its binding to UFC1 (E2), and its relation to UBA5 (E1), using a combination of structural modeling with Alphafold2, X-ray crystallography, NMR, and in vitro biochemical activity assays. Guided by an Alphafold2 model, we generated an active UFL1 fusion construct that includes its cofactor DDRGK1, and solved the first crystal structure of this critical interaction. This fusion construct also unveiled the importance of the N-terminal helix of UFL1 for its binding to UFC1, which was validated by ITC and NMR experiments. Importantly, the binding site suggested by our structural model of the UFL1-UFC1 interaction reveals a conserved interface, and suggests a competition for binding to UFC1 between UFL1 and UBA5, which we reconfirmed by NMR. Altogether, our study reveals a novel, terminal helix-mediated regulatory mechanism which coordinates the cascade of E1-E2-E3 mediated transfer of UFM1 to its substrate, and provides new leads to target this important modification.\n\nSignificance statementUfmylation is an important post-translational modification, but little is known about the mechanistic details of its machinery, and in particular how the UFM1 E3 ligase (UFL1) binds and functions together with the E2 conjugating enzyme (UFC1). We combined AlphaFold2 modeling, X-ray crystallography, NMR and biochemical experiments to reveal crucial elements that govern UFL1 activity and ufmylation. We discover a crucial role for the UFL1 N-terminal helix in binding to UFC1 and productive ufmylation. This helix competes with the E1 (UBA5) C-terminal helix for binding to UFC1.

    "abstract": "We examined the neural signature of directed exploration by contrasting MEG beta (16-30 Hz) power changes between disadvantageous and advantageous choices in the two-choice probabilistic reward task. We analyzed the choices made after the participants have learned the probabilistic contingency between choices and their outcomes, i.e., acquired the inner model of choice values. Therefore, rare disadvantageous choices might serve explorative, environment-probing purposes. The study brought two main findings. Firstly, decision making leading to disadvantageous choices took more time and evidenced greater large-scale suppression of beta oscillations than its advantageous alternative. Additional neural resources recruited during disadvantageous decisions strongly suggest their deliberately explorative nature. Secondly, an outcome of disadvantageous and advantageous choices had qualitatively different impact on feedback-related beta oscillations. After the disadvantageous choices, only losses - but not gains - were followed by late beta synchronization in frontal cortex. Our results are consistent with the role of frontal beta oscillations in the stabilization of neural representations for selected behavioral rule when explorative strategy conflicts with value-based behavior.

    "abstract": "The advance of single-cell proteomics sequencing technology sheds light on the research in revealing the protein-protein interactions, the post-translational modifications, and the proteoform dynamics of proteins in a cell. However, the uncertainty estimation for peptide quantification, data missingness, severe batch effects and high noise hinder the analysis of single-cell proteomic data. It is a significant challenge to solve this set of tangled problems together, where existing methods tailored for single-cell transcriptome do not address. Here, we proposed a novel versatile framework scPROTEIN, composed of peptide uncertainty estimation based on a multi-task heteroscedastic regression model and cell embedding learning based on graph contrastive learning designed for single-cell proteomic data analysis. scPROTEIN estimated the uncertainty of peptide quantification, denoised the protein data, removed batch effects and encoded single-cell proteomic-specific embeddings in a unified framework. We demonstrate that our method is efficient for cell clustering, batch correction, cell-type annotation and clinical analysis. Furthermore, our method can be easily plugged into single-cell resolved spatial proteomic data, laying the foundation for encoding spatial proteomic data for tumor microenvironment analysis.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces aggregable {beta}-amyloid peptides and its mutations are associated with familial Alzheimers disease, which makes it one of the most studied proteins. However, APPs role in the human brain remains unclear despite years of investigation. One problem is that most studies on APP have been carried out in cell lines or model organisms, which are physiologically different from human neurons in the brain. Recently, human induced neurons (hiNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells provide a practical platform for studying the human brain in vitro. Here, we generated APP-null iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and differentiate them to matured human neurons with functional synapses using a two-step procedure. During hiN differentiation and maturation, APP-null cells exhibited less neurite growth and reduced synaptogenesis in serum-free but not serum-containing media. We have found that cholesterol (Chol) remedies those developmental defects in APP-null cells, consistent with Chols role in neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. Phenotypic rescue was also achieved by co-culturing those cells with wildtype mouse astrocytes, suggesting that APPs developmental role is likely astrocytic. Next, we examined matured hiNs using patch-clamp recording and detected reduced synaptic transmission in APP-null cells. This change was largely due to decreased synaptic vesicle (SV) release and retrieval, which was confirmed by live-cell imaging using two SV-specific fluorescent reporters. Adding Chol shortly before stimulation mitigated the SV deficits in APP-null iNs, indicating that APP facilitates presynaptic membrane Chol turnover during SV exo-/endocytosis cycle. Taken together, our study in hiNs supports the notion that APP contributes to neurodevelopment, synaptogenesis and neurotransmission via maintaining brain Chol homeostasis. Given the vital role of Chol in the central nervous system, the functional connection between APP and Chol bears important implication in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Sensory hair cells are the receptors for auditory, vestibular, and lateral line sensory organs in vertebrates. These cells are distinguished by \"hair\"-like projections from their apical surface collectively known as the hair bundle. Along with the staircase arrangement of actin-filled stereocilia, the hair bundle features a single, non-motile, true cilium called the kinocilium. The kinocilium plays important roles in bundle development and the mechanics of sensory detection. To understand more about kinocilial development and structure, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish hair cells looking for cilia-associated genes that have yet to be characterized in hair cells. Here, we focus on three such genes - ankef1a, odf3l2a, and saxo2 - because the human or mouse orthologs are either associated with sensorineural hearing loss or are located near uncharacterized deafness loci. We made transgenic fish that express fluorescently tagged versions of their proteins, demonstrating their localization to the kinocilia of zebrafish hair cells. Furthermore, we find that Ankef1a, Odf3l2a, and Saxo2 exhibit distinct localization patterns along the length of the kinocilium and within the cell body. Lastly, we report a novel overexpression phenotype for Saxo2. Overall, these results suggest that the hair cell kinocilium is regionalized along its proximal-distal axis and set the groundwork to understand more about the roles of these kinocilial proteins in hair cells.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the American black bear (Ursus americanus) may be responsible for a significant number of purported sightings of an alleged unknown species of hominid in North America. Previous analyses have identified correlation between  sasquatch or  bigfoot sightings and black bear populations in the Pacific Northwest using ecological niche models and simple models of expected animal sightings. The present study expands the analysis to the entire US and Canada by regressing sasquatch sightings on bear populations in each state/province while adjusting for human population and forest area in a generalized linear model. Sasquatch sightings were statistically significantly associated with bear populations such that, on the average, every 1, 000 bear increase in the bear population is associated with a 4% (95% CI: 1%-7%) increase in sasquatch sightings. Thus, as black bear populations increase, sasquatch sightings are expected to increase also. On the average, across all states and provinces in 2006, after controlling for human population and forest area, there were approximately 5, 000 bears per sasquatch sighting. Based on statistical considerations, it is likely that many supposed sasquatch are really misidentified known forms. If bigfoot is there, it may be a bear.",

    "abstract": "People form metacognitive representations of their own abilities across a range of tasks. How these representations are influenced by errors during learning is poorly understood. Here we ask how metacognitive confidence judgments of performance during motor learning are shaped by the learners recent history of errors. Across four motor learning experiments, our computational modeling approach demonstrated that peoples confidence judgments are best explained by a recency-weighted averaging of visually observed errors. Moreover, in the formation of these confidence estimates, people appear to re-weight observed motor errors according to a subjective cost function. Confidence judgments were adaptive, incorporating recent motor errors in a manner that was sensitive to the volatility of the learning environment, integrating a shallower history when the environment was more volatile. Finally, confidence tracked motor errors in the context of both implicit and explicit motor learning, but only showed evidence of influencing behavior in the latter. Our study thus provides a novel descriptive model that successfully approximates the dynamics of metacognitive judgments during motor learning.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYThis study examined how, during visuomotor-learning, peoples confidence in their performance is shaped by their recent history of errors. Using computational modeling, we found that confidence incorporated recent error-history, tracked subjective error-costs, was sensitive to environmental volatility, and in some contexts may influence learning. Together, these results provide a novel model of metacognitive judgments during motor-learning that could be applied to future computational and neural studies at the interface of higher-order cognition and motor control.",

We developed immunomagnetic cell sorting after in vivo radiotracer injection (scRadiotracing) in combination with 3D-histology via tissue clearing to dissect the cellular allocation of PET signals in the TME. In SB28 glioblastoma mice, translocator protein (TSPO) radiotracer uptake per tumor cell was higher compared to tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs). Cellular radiotracer uptake was validated by proteomics and confirmed for in vitro samples of patients with glioblastoma. Regional agreement between PET signals and single cell tracer uptake predicted the individual cell distribution in 3D-histology. In consideration of cellular tracer uptake and cell type abundance, tumor cells were the main contributor to TSPO enrichment in glioblastoma, however proteomics identified potential PET targets highly specific for TAMs. Combining cellular tracer uptake measures with 3D-histology facilitates precise allocation of complex PET signal sources and will serve to validate novel TAM-specific radioligands.",

    "abstract": "The measurement of time in the subsecond scale is critical for many sophisticated behaviors, yet its neural underpinnings are largely unknown. Recent neurophysiological experiments from our laboratory have shown that the neural activity in the medial premotor areas (MPC) of macaques can represent different aspects of temporal processing. During interval categorization, we found that preSMA encodes a subjective category limit by reaching a peak of activity at a time that divides the set of test intervals into short and long. We also observed neural signals associated with the category selected by the subjects and the reward outcomes of the perceptual decision. On the other hand, we have studied the behavioral and neurophysiological basis of rhythmic timing. First, we have shown in different tapping tasks that macaques are able to produce predictively and accurately intervals that are cued by auditory or visual metronomes or when intervals are produced internally without sensory guidance. In addition, we found that the rhythmic timing mechanism in MPC is governed by different layers of neural clocks. Next, the instantaneous activity of single cells shows ramping activity that encode the elapsed or remaining time for a tapping movement. In addition, we found MPC neurons that build neural sequences, forming dynamic patterns of activation that flexibly cover all the produced interval depending on the tapping tempo. This rhythmic neural clock resets on every interval providing an internal representation of pulse. Furthermore, the MPC cells show mixed selectivity, encoding not only elapsed time, but also the tempo of the tapping and the serial order element in the rhythmic sequence. Hence, MPC can map different task parameters, including the passage of time, using different cell populations. Finally, the projection of the time varying activity of MPC hundreds of cells into a low dimensional state space showed circular neural trajectories whose geometry represent the internal pulse and the tapping tempo. Overall, these findings support the notion that MPC is part of the core timing mechanism for both single interval and rhythmic timing, using neural clocks with different encoding principles, probably to flexibly encode and mix the timing representation with other task parameters.",

    "abstract": "Diseases caused by POLG mutations are the most common form of mitochondrial disease and associated with phenotypes of varying severity. Clinical studies have shown that patients with compound heterozygous POLG mutations have a lower survival rate than patients with homozygous mutations, but the molecular mechanisms behind this remain unexplored. Using an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model, we investigate differences between homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes in different cell types, including patient-specific fibroblasts, iPSCs, and iPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and astrocytes. We found that compound heterozygous lines exhibited greater impairment of mitochondrial function in NSCs than homozygous NSCs, but not in fibroblasts, iPSCs, or astrocytes. Compared with homozygous NSCs, compound heterozygous NSCs exhibited more severe functional defects, including reduced ATP production, loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and complex I expression, disturbance of NAD+ metabolism, and higher ROS levels, which further led to cellular senescence and activation of mitophagy. RNA sequencing analysis revealed greater downregulation of mitochondrial and metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, in compound heterozygous NSCs. Our iPSC-based disease model can be widely used to understand the genotype-phenotype relationship of affected brain cells in mitochondrial diseases, and further drug discovery applications.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/526021v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ce1761org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@610ed3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1460b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7fd53_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Previous work proposed several hierarchical extensions of this learning rule. However, it remains unclear when a flat (non-hierarchical) versus a hierarchical strategy is optimal, or when it is implemented by humans. To address this question, current work evaluates multiple models in multiple reinforcement learning environments both computationally (which approach performs best) and empirically (which approach fits human data best). We consider ten empirical datasets (N = 410) divided over three reinforcement learning environments. Consistent with the idea of the human brain as a mixture of expert system, our results demonstrate that different environments are best solved with different learning strategies; and that humans seemed to adaptively select the optimal learning strategy. Specifically, while flat learning fitted best in less complex stable learning environments, humans employed more hierarchically complex models in more complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Effective interactions with the environment rely on integration of multisensory signals: our brains must efficiently combine signals that share a common source, and segregate those that do not. Healthy ageing can change or impair this process. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study assessed the neural mechanisms underlying age differences in the integration of auditory and visual spatial cues. Participants were presented with synchronous audiovisual signals at various degrees of spatial disparity and indicated their perceived sound location. Behaviourally, older adults were able to maintain localisation accuracy, albeit with longer response times. At the neural level, they integrated auditory and visual cues into spatial representations along dorsal auditory and visual processing pathways similarly to their younger counterparts, but showed greater activations in a widespread system of frontal, temporal and parietal areas. According to multivariate Bayesian decoding, these areas encoded critical stimulus information beyond that which was encoded in the brain areas commonly activated by both groups. Surprisingly, however, the boost in information provided by these areas with age-related activation increases was comparable across the two age groups.\n\nThis dissociation--between comparable response accuracy and information encoded in brain activity patterns across the two age groups, but age-related increases in response times and regional activations--suggests that older participants accumulate noisier sensory evidence for longer, to maintain reliable neural encoding of stimulus-relevant information and thus preserve localisation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The human structural brain network, or connectome, has a rich-club organization with a small number of brain regions showing high network connectivity, called hubs. Hubs are centrally located in the network, energy costly, and critical for human cognition. Aging has been associated with changes in brain structure, function, and cognitive decline, such as processing speed. At a molecular level, the aging process is a progressive accumulation of oxidative damage, which leads to subsequent energy depletion in the neuron and causes cell death. However, it is still unclear how age affects hub connections in the human connectome. The current study aims to address this research gap by utilizing a novel measure of structural connectivity strength, fiber bundle capacity (FBC), which is derived from Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) modeling of white-matter fiber bundles. FBC represents the capacity of a fiber bundle to transfer information and is a less biased measure for quantifying connection strength within biological pathways. We found that hubs exhibit longer-distance connections and higher metabolic rates compared to peripheral brain regions, suggesting that hubs are biologically costly. Although the landscape of structural hubs was relatively age-invariant, there were wide-spread age effects on FBC in the connectome. Critically, these age effects were larger in connections within hub compared to peripheral brain connections. These findings were supported by both a cross-sectional sample with wide age-range (N=137) and a longitudinal sample across 5 years (N=83). Moreover, our results demonstrated that associations between FBC and processing speed were more concentrated in hub connections than chance level, and FBC in hub connections mediated the age-effects on processing speed. Overall, our findings indicate that structural connections of hubs, which demonstrate greater energy demands, are particular vulnerable to aging. The vulnerability may contribute to age-related impairments in processing speed among older adults.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellar-dependent implicit adaptation has been regarded as a rigid process that automatically operates in response to movement errors in order to keep the sensorimotor system calibrated. This hypothesis has been challenged by recent evidence suggesting flexibility in this learning process. One compelling line of evidence comes from work suggesting that this form of learning is context-dependent, with the rate of learning modulated by error history. Specifically, learning was attenuated in the presence of perturbations exhibiting high variance compared to when the perturbation is fixed. However, these findings are confounded by the fact that the adaptation system corrects for errors of different magnitudes in a non-linear manner, with the adaptive response increasing in a proportional manner to small errors and saturating to large errors. Through simulations, we show that this non-linear motor correction function is sufficient to explain the effect of perturbation variance without referring to an experience-dependent change in error sensitivity. Moreover, by controlling the distribution of errors experienced during training, we provide empirical evidence showing that there is no measurable effect of perturbation variance on implicit adaptation. As such, we argue that the evidence to date remains consistent with the rigidity assumption.",

    "abstract": "Improving cardiac function through stem-cell regenerative therapy requires functional and structural integration of the transplanted cells with the host tissue. Visualizing the electromechanical interaction between native and graft cells necessitates 3D imaging with high spatio-temporal resolution and low phototoxicity. A custom light-sheet fluorescence microscope was used for volumetric imaging of calcium dynamics in co-cultures of adult rat left ventricle cardiomyocytes and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Aberration-free remote refocus of the detection plane synchronously to the scanning of the light sheet along the detection axis enabled fast dual-channel 3D imaging at subcellular resolution without mechanical sample disturbance at up to 8 Hz over a [~]300 {micro}m x 40 {micro}m x 50 {micro}m volume. The two cell types were found to undergo electrically stimulated and spontaneous synchronized calcium transients and contraction. Electromechanical coupling was found to improve with co-culture duration, with 50% of adult-CM coupled after 24 hours of co-culture, compared to 19% after 4 hours (p = 0.0305). Immobilization with para-nitroblebbistatin did not prevent calcium transient synchronization, with 35% and 36% adult-CM coupled in control and treated samples respectively (p = 0.91), indicating that electrical coupling can be maintained independently of mechanotransduction.",

    "abstract": "Microvillus Inclusion Disease (MVID), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the motor protein Myosin Vb (MYO5B), is a severe infantile disease characterized by diarrhea, malabsorption, and acid-base instability, requiring intensive parenteral support for nutritional and fluid management. Human patient-derived enteroids represent a model for investigation of monogenic epithelial disorders but are a rare resource from MVID patients. We developed human enteroids with different loss-of function MYO5B variants and showed that they recapitulated the structural changes found in native MVID enterocytes. Multiplex Immunofluorescence imaging of patient duodenal tissues revealed patient-specific changes in localization of brush border transporters. Functional analysis of electrolyte transport revealed profound loss of Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) activity in MVID patient enteroids with near-normal chloride secretion. The chloride channel-blocking anti-diarrheal drug, Crofelemer, dose-dependently inhibited agonist-mediated fluid secretion. MVID enteroids exhibited altered differentiation and maturation versus healthy enteroids. Inhibition of Notch signaling with the {gamma}-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, recovered apical brush border structure and functional Na+/H+ exchange activity in MVID enteroids. Transcriptomic analysis revealed potential pathways involved in the rescue of MVID cells including serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 2 (SGK2), and NHE regulatory factor 3 (NHERF3). These results demonstrate the utility of patient-derived enteroids for developing therapeutic approaches to MVID.\n\nConflict-of-interest statementThe authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.",

    "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is one of the most abundant proteins in neutrophil granules. It catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species, which are important in inflammation and immune defense. MPO also binds to several proteins, lipids, and DNA to alter their function. MPO is present at the feto-maternal interface during pregnancy, where neutrophils are abundant. In this study, we determined the effect of MPO on JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells as a model of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) during early pregnancy. We found that MPO was internalized by JEG-3 cells and localized to the cytoplasm and nuclei. MPO internalization and activity enhanced JEG-3 cell migration, whereas this effect was impaired by pre-treating cells with heparin, to block cellular uptake, and MPO-activity inhibitor 4-ABAH. This study identifies a novel mechanism for the effect of MPO on EVT function during normal pregnancy and suggests a potential role of MPO in abnormal pregnancies.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/526039v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5fd67borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa4f7dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78a0c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1828760_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neuronal autophagosomes, \"self-eating\" degradative organelles, form at presynaptic sites in the distal axon and are transported to the soma to recycle their cargo. During transit, autophagic vacuoles (AVs) mature through fusion with lysosomes to acquire the enzymes necessary to breakdown their cargo. AV transport is driven primarily by the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein in concert with dynactin and a series of activating adaptors that change depending on organelle maturation state. The transport of mature AVs is regulated by the scaffolding proteins JIP3 and JIP4, both of which activate dynein motility in vitro. AV transport is also regulated by ARF6 in a GTP-dependent fashion. While GTP-bound ARF6 promotes the formation of the JIP3/4-dynein-dynactin complex, RAB10 competes with the activity of this complex by increasing kinesin recruitment to axonal AVs and lysosomes. These interactions highlight the complex coordination of motors regulating organelle transport in neurons.\n\nSummaryMature autophagosomes in the axon are transported by the microtubule motor dynein, activated by JNK-interacting proteins 3 and 4 (JIP3/4). This motility is regulated by the small GTPases ARF6 and RAB10. The tight regulation of autolysosomal transport is essential for intracellular recycling to maintain neuronal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that generate patterns of cell types unique to humans are poorly understood. In the central region of the human retina, the high-acuity foveola is notable, in part, for its dense packing of green (M) and red (L) cones and absence of blue (S) cones. To identify mechanisms that promote M/L and suppress S cone patterning in the foveola, we examined human fetal retinas and differentiated human retinal organoids. During development, sparse S-opsin-expressing cones are observed in the foveola initially. Later, the foveola contains a mix of cones that either co-express S- and M/L-opsins or express M/L-opsin only. In adulthood, only M/L cones are present. Two signaling pathway regulators are highly and continuously expressed in the central retina: Cytochrome P450 26 subfamily A member 1 (CYP26A1) that degrades retinoic acid (RA) and Deiodinase 2 (DIO2) that promotes thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. CYP26A1 null mutant organoids and high RA conditions increased S cones and limited M/L cones in human retinal organoids. Sustained TH signaling promoted the generation of M/L-opsin-expressing cones and induced M/L-opsin expression in S-opsin-expressing cones, showing that cone fate is plastic. Our data suggest that early CYP26A1 degrades RA to specify M/L cones and limit S cones and that continuous DIO2 expression sustains high levels of TH to convert S cones into M/L cones, yielding the M/L cone subtype patterning of the foveola. As the foveola is highly susceptible to impairment in diseases such as macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss, our findings inform organoid design for potential therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate translation is essential in all organisms to produce properly folded and functional proteins. mRNA codons that define the protein coding sequences are decoded by tRNAs on the ribosome in the aminoacyl (A) binding site. The mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon interaction is extensively monitored by the ribosome to ensure accuracy in tRNA selection. While other polymerases that synthesize DNA and RNA can correct for misincorporations, the ribosome is unable to correct mistakes. Instead, when a misincorporation occurs, the mismatched tRNA-mRNA pair moves to the peptidyl (P) site and from this location, causes a reduction in the fidelity at the A site, triggering post-peptidyl transfer quality control. This reduced fidelity allows for additional incorrect tRNAs to be accepted and for release factor 2 (RF2) to recognize sense codons, leading to hydrolysis of the aberrant peptide. Here, we present crystal structures of the ribosome containing a tRNALys in the P site with a U*U mismatch with the mRNA codon. We find that when the mismatch occurs in the second position of the P-site codon-anticodon interaction, the first nucleotide of the A-site codon flips from the mRNA path to engage highly conserved 16S rRNA nucleotide A1493 in the decoding center. We propose that this mRNA nucleotide mispositioning leads to reduced fidelity at the A site. Further, this state may provide an opportunity for RF2 to initiate premature termination before erroneous nascent chains disrupt the cellular proteome.",

With newly emerging variants there is a concern that mutations in Mpro may alter structural and functional properties of protease and subsequently the potency of existing and potential antivirals. We explored the effect of 31 mutations belonging to 5 variants of concern (VOC) on catalytic parameters and substrate specificity, which revealed changes in substrate binding and rate of cleavage of a viral peptide. Crystal structures of 11 Mpro mutants provided structural insight into their altered functionality. Additionally, we show Mpro mutations influence proteolysis of an immunomodulatory host protein Galectin-8 (Gal-8) and subsequent significant decrease in cytokine secretion, providing evidence for alterations in escape of host-antiviral mechanisms. Accordingly, mutations associated with the highly virulent Delta VOC resulted in significant increase in Gal-8 cleavage. Importantly, IC50s of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer) and our irreversible inhibitor AVI-8053 demonstrated no changes in potency for both drugs for all mutants, suggesting Mpro will remain a high-priority antiviral drug candidate as SARS-CoV-2 evolves.",

The collection of such motifs forms a relational structure over the polymorphic sites. Motifs are constructed using distances quantifying the co-evolutionary coupling of pairs and manifest as co-evolving clusters of sites. We present an approach to genomic surveillance based on this notion of relational structure. Our system will issue an alert regarding a lineage, based on its contribution to drastic changes in the relational structure. We then conduct a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic based on SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data in GISAID from October 2020 to September 2022, across 21 lineages and 27 countries with weekly resolution. We investigate the performance of this surveillance system in terms of its accuracy, timeliness and robustness. Lastly, we study how well each lineage is classified by such a system.",

    "abstract": "Pandemic caused by viral protein is characterized by waves of transmission triggered by new variants replacing old ones, resulting in immune escape and threatening public health. Therefore, there is an obvious need to accurately identify the vital mutation sites and understand the complex patterns of mutation effect of viral protein. However, existing work do not explicitly modelling vital positions functioning for virus fitness, leading to large search space with money- and time-consuming search cost. Here, we propose EVPMM (evolutionary integrated viral protein mutation machine), a co-evolution profiles integrated deep learning framework for dominant variants forecasting, vital mutation sites prediction and fitness landscape depicting. It consists of a position detector to directly detect the functional positions as well as a mutant predictor to depict fitness landscape. Moreover, pairwise dependencies between residues obtained by a Markov Random Field are also incorporated to promote reasonable variant generation. We show that EVPMM significantly outperforms existing machine learning algorithms on mutation position detection, residue prediction and fitness prediction accuracies. Remarkably, there is a highly agreement between positions identified by our method with current variants of concern and provides some new mutation pattern hypothesis. The method can prioritize mutations as they emerge for public health concern.",

    "abstract": "Levoglucosan is produced in the pyrolysis of cellulose and starch, including from bushfires or the burning of biofuels, and is deposited from the atmosphere across the surface of the earth. We describe two levoglucosan degrading Paenarthrobacter spp. (Paenarthrobacter nitrojuajacolis LG01 and Paenarthrobacter histidinolovorans LG02) that were isolated from soil by metabolic enrichment using levoglucosan as the sole carbon source. Genome sequencing and proteomics analysis revealed the expression of a series of genes encoding known levoglucosan degrading enzymes, levoglucosan dehydrogenase (LGDH, LgdA), 3-keto-levoglucosan {beta}-eliminase (LgdB1) and glucose 3-dehydrogenase (LgdC), along with an ABC transporter cassette and an associated solute binding protein. However, no homologues of 3-ketoglucose dehydratase (LgdB2) were evident, while the expressed genes contained a range of putative sugar phosphate isomerases/xylose isomerases with weak similarity to LgdB2. Sequence similarity network analysis of genome neighbours of LgdA revealed that homologues of LgdB1 and LgdC are generally conserved in a range of bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. One group of sugar phosphate isomerase/xylose isomerase homologues (named LgdB3) was identified with limited distribution that is mutually exclusive with LgdB2, and we propose that they may fulfill a similar function. LgdB1, LgdB2 and LgdB3 adopt similar predicted 3D folds, suggesting overlapping function in processing intermediates in LG metabolism. Our findings highlight diversity within the LGDH pathway, through which bacteria utilize levoglucosan as a nutrient source.",

    "abstract": "The chromosome of archetypal bacteria E. coli is known for a complex topology with 4.6 x 106 base pairs (bp) long sequence of nucleotide packed within a micrometer-sized celllular confinement. The inherent organization underlying this chromosome eludes general consensus due to the lack of a high-resolution picture of its conformation. Here we present our development of an integrative model of E. coli at a 500 bp resolution (https://github.com/JMLab-tifrh/ecoli_finer), which optimally combines a set of multi-resolution genome-wide experimentally measured data within a framework of polymer based architecture. In particular the model is informed with intra-genome contact probability map at 5000 bp resolution derived via Hi-C experiment and RNA-sequencing data at 500 bp resolution. Via dynamical simulations, this data-driven polymer based model generates appropriate conformational ensemble commensurate with chromosome architectures that E. coli adopts. As a key hallmark, the model chromosome spontaneously self-organizes into a set of non-overlapping macrodomains and suitably locates plectonemic loops near the cell membrane. As novel extensions, it predicts a contact probability map simulated at a higher resolution than precedent experiments and can demonstrate segregation of chromosomes in a partially replicating cell. Finally, the modular nature of the model helps us to devise control simulations to quantify the individual role of key features in hierarchical organization of the bacterial chromosome.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella quasivariicola was a novel strain of Klebsiella species and had potential pathogenicity. Our previously studies showed dopamine, one of the most commonly used rescue drugs for critically ill patients, had clear effects on the growth of K. quasivariicola in culture medium, however, its effects on host immune system were ignored. Therefore, in consideration of the host immunity, the interactions of K. quasivariicola, dopamine and macrophages were explored. In this study, RAW264.7 cells and C57/BL6 mice were infected with K. quasivariicola, and the bacterial growth in macrophage, the production of inflammatory cytokines and the pathological changes of mice lung were detected, in the absence or presence of dopamine. Our results showed dopamine inhibited the K. quasivariicola growth in medium, but promoted the bacterial growth when K. quasivariicola was co-cultured with macrophages; The expression of proinflammatory cytokines in K. quasivariicola infected RAW 264.7 were increased, while a sharp rise was observed with the addition of dopamine; Infection of K. quasivariicola to mice induced an inflammatory response and lung injury, which were exacerbated by dopamine administration. It can be concluded that dopamine administration resulted in a significantly increase of K. quasivariicola burdens in the presence of macrophage, consequently, aggravated the inflammatory response and inflammatory injury.\n\nImportanceDopamine is one of the most commonly used rescue drugs for critically ill patients. Here we indicated K. quasivariicola was a potential pathogen of pulmonary infection, and dopamine significantly increased the proliferation of K. quasivariicola when exposed to macrophage, subsequently result in severe inflammatory response and inflammatory injury. We also proposed an in vitro model of microbes-drugs-host immune cells that could better mimic in vivo environment and more suitable for the studies of inhibitor screening. This fundamental work had contributed to the present understanding of the crosstalk between pathogen, dopamine and host immune cells. Furthermore, our data showed dopamine was one of the risk factors for patients with K. quasivariicola infection, which provided a basis for clinical precision medicine.",

To date, identification of cpn60 sequence variants from microbiome studies has been accomplished by alignment of queries to a reference database. Naive Bayesian classifiers including the RDP classifier offer an alternative identification method that provides variable rank classification and shorter analysis times. We curated a set of cpn60 barcode sequences to train the RDP classifier and tested its performance on data from previous human microbiome studies. Results showed that sequences accounting for 79%, 86% and 92% of the observations (read counts) in saliva, vagina and infant stool microbiome data sets were classified to the species rank. We also established a threshold confidence value of 0.6 at phylum rank for filtering non-target amplicon sequences from study data and demonstrated that trimming the training sequences to match the lengths of the queries is not needed for accurate cpn60 sequence classification. Successful implementation of a naive Bayesian classifier for cpn60 sequences will facilitate future microbiome studies and open opportunities to integrate cpn60 amplicon sequence identification into existing analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Power analyses are often used to determine the number of animals required for a genome wide association analysis (GWAS). These analyses are typically intended to estimate the sample size needed for at least one locus to exceed a genome-wide significance threshold. A related question that is less commonly considered is the number of significant loci that will be discovered with a given sample size. We used simulations based on a real dataset that consisted of 3,173 male and female adult N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats to explore the relationship between sample size and the number of significant loci discovered. Our simulations examined the number of loci identified in sub-samples of the full dataset. The sub-sampling analysis was conducted for four traits with low (0.15 {+/-} 0.03), medium (0.31 {+/-} 0.03 and 0.36 {+/-} 0.03) and high (0.46 {+/-} 0.03) SNP-based heritabilities. For each trait, we sub-sampled the data 100 times at different sample sizes (500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and 2,500). We observed an exponential increase in the number of significant loci with larger sample sizes.

    "abstract": "KAR4, the yeast homolog of the mammalian mRNA N6A-methyltransferase complex component METTL14, is required for two disparate developmental programs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: mating and meiosis. To understand KAR4s role in yeast mating and meiosis, we used a genetic screen to isolate 25 function-specific mutant alleles, which map to non-overlapping surfaces on a predicted structure of the Kar4 protein (Kar4p). Most of the mating-specific alleles (Mat-) abolish Kar4ps interaction with the transcription factor Ste12p, indicating that Kar4ps mating function is through Ste12p. In yeast, the mRNA methyltransferase complex was previously defined as comprising Ime4p (Kar4ps paralog and the homolog of mammalian METTL3), Mum2p (homolog of mammalian WTAP), and Slz1p (MIS), but not Kar4p. During meiosis, Kar4p interacts with Ime4p, Mum2p, and Slz1p. Moreover, cells lacking Kar4p have highly reduced levels of mRNA methylation during meiosis indicating that Kar4p is a key member of the methyltransferase complex, as it is in humans. Analysis of kar4{Delta}/{Delta} and 7 meiosis-specific alleles (Mei-) revealed that Kar4p is required early in meiosis, before initiation of S-phase and meiotic recombination. High copy expression of the meiotic transcriptional activator IME1 rescued the defect of these Mei- alleles. Surprisingly, Kar4p was also found to be required at a second step for the completion of meiosis and sporulation. Over-expression of IME1 in kar4{Delta}/{Delta} permits pre-meiotic S-phase, but most cells remained arrested with a monopolar spindle. Analysis of the function-specific mutants revealed that roughly half became blocked after premeiotic DNA synthesis and did not sporulate (Spo-). Loss of Kar4ps Spo function was suppressed by overexpression of RIM4, a meiotic translational regulator. Overexpression of IME1 and RIM4 together allowed sporulation of kar4{Delta}/{Delta} cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Kar4p regulates meiosis at multiple steps, presumably reflecting requirements for methylation in different stages of meiotic gene expression.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn yeast, KAR4 is required for mating and meiosis. A genetic screen for function-specific mutations identified 25 alleles that map to different surfaces on a predicted structure of the Kar4 protein (Kar4p). The mating-specific alleles interfere with Kar4ps ability to interact with the transcription factor Ste12p, its known partner in mating. The meiosis-specific alleles revealed an independent function: Kar4p is required for entry into meiosis and initiation of S-phase. During meiosis, Kar4p interacts with all components of the mRNA methyltransferase complex and kar4{Delta}/{Delta} mutants have greatly reduced levels of mRNA methylation. Thus, Kar4p is a member of the yeast methyltransferase complex. Overexpression of the meiotic transcriptional activator IME1 rescued the meiotic entry defect but did not lead to sporulation, implying that Kar4p has more than one meiotic function. Suppression by Ime1p overexpression led to arrest after premeiotic DNA synthesis, but before sporulation. Loss of Kar4s sporulation function can be suppressed by overexpression of a translation regulator, Rim4p. Overexpression of both IME1 and RIM4 allowed sporulation in kar4{Delta}/{Delta} cells.",

    "abstract": "Kar4p, the yeast homolog of the mammalian methyltransferase subunit METTL14, is required for the initiation of meiosis and has at least two distinct functions in regulating the meiotic program. Cells lacking Kar4p can be driven to sporulate by co-overexpressing the master meiotic transcription factor, IME1, and the translational regulator, RIM4, suggesting that Kar4p functions at both the transcriptional and translational level to regulate meiosis. Using microarray analysis and RNA sequencing, we found that kar4{Delta}/{Delta} mutants have a largely wild type transcriptional profile with the exception of two groups of genes that show delayed and reduced expression: (1) a set of Ime1p-dependent early genes as well as IME1, and (2) a set of late genes dependent on the mid-meiotic transcription factor, Ndt80p. The early gene expression defect is rescued by overexpressing IME1, but the late defect is only suppressed by overexpression of both IME1 and RIM4. Mass spectrometry analysis identified several genes involved in meiotic recombination with strongly reduced protein levels, but with little to no reduction in transcript levels in kar4{Delta}/{Delta} after IME1 overexpression. The low levels of these proteins were rescued by overexpression of RIM4 and IME1, but not by the overexpression of IME1 alone. These data expand our understanding of the role of Kar4p in regulating meiosis and provide key insights into a potential mechanism of Kar4ps later meiotic function that is independent of mRNA methylation.\n\nAuthor SummaryKar4p is required at two stages during meiosis. Cells lacking Kar4p have a severe loss of mRNA methylation and arrest early in the meiotic program, failing to undergo either pre-meiotic DNA synthesis or meiotic recombination. The early block is rescued by overexpression of the meiotic transcription factor, IME1. The kar4{Delta}/{Delta} cells show delayed and reduced expression of a set of Ime1p-dependent genes expressed early in meiosis as well as a set of later genes that are largely Ndt80p-dependent. Overexpression of IME1 rescues the expression defect of these early genes and expedites the meiotic program in the wild type S288C strain background. However, IME1 overexpression is not sufficient to facilitate sporulation in kar4{Delta}/{Delta}. Completion of meiosis and sporulation requires the additional overexpression of a translational regulator, RIM4.\n\nAnalysis of kar4{Delta}/{Delta}s proteome during meiosis with IME1 overexpression revealed that proteins important for meiotic recombination have reduced levels that cannot be explained by equivalent reductions in transcript abundance. IME1 overexpression by itself rescues the defect associated with a catalytic mutant of Ime4p, implying that the early defect reflects mRNA methylation. The residual defects in protein levels likely reflect the loss of a non-catalytic function of Kar4p, and the methylation complex, which requires overexpression of RIM4 to suppress.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Matrix (NuMat) is the fraction of the eukaryotic nucleus insoluble to detergents and high-salt extractions that manifests as a pan-nuclear fiber-granule network. NuMat consists of ribonucleoprotein complexes, members of crucial nuclear functional modules, and DNA fragments. Although NuMat captures the organization of non-chromatin nuclear space, very little is known about component organization within NuMat. To understand the organization of NuMat components, we subfractionated it with increasing concentrations of the chaotrope Guanidinium Hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and analyzed the proteomic makeup of the fractions. We observe that the solubilization of proteins at different concentrations of GdnHCl is finite and independent of the broad biophysical properties of the protein sequences. Looking at the extraction pattern of the Nuclear Envelope and Nuclear Pore Complex, we surmise that this fractionation represents easily-solubilized/loosely-bound and difficultly-solubilized/tightly-bound components of NuMat. Microscopic analyses of the localization of key NuMat proteins across sequential GdnHCl extractions of in situ NuMat further elaborate on the divergent extraction patterns. Furthermore, we solubilized NuMat in 8M GdnHCl and upon removal of GdnHCl through dialysis, en masse renaturation leads to RNA-dependent self-assembly of fibrous structures. The major proteome component of the self-assembled fibers comes from the difficultly-solubilized, tightly-bound component. This fractionation of the NuMat reveals different organizational levels within it which may reflect the structural and functional organization of nuclear architecture.",

    "abstract": "Microbes able to convert gaseous one-carbon (C1) waste feedstocks are of growing importance in transitioning to the biosustainable production of renewable chemicals and fuels. Acetogens are particularly interesting biocatalysts since gas fermentation using Clostridium autoethanogenum has already been commercialised. Most non-commercial acetogen strains, however, need complex nutrients, display slow growth, and are not sufficiently robust for routine bioreactor fermentations. In this work, we used three adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) strategies to evolve the wild-type model-acetogen C. autoethanogenum to grow faster, without complex nutrients and to be robust in operation of continuous bioreactor cultures. Seven evolved strains with improved phenotypes were isolated on minimal medium with one strain, named \"LAbrini\" (LT1), exhibiting superior performance in terms of the maximum specific growth rate, product profile, and robustness in continuous cultures. Differing performance of the strains between bottle batch and continuous cultures shows the importance of testing novel strains in industrially relevant continuous fermentation conditions. Interestingly, a very distinct transcriptome profile linked to a potential CO toxicity phenotype was observed in bioreactor cultures for one evolved strain. Whole-genome sequencing of the seven evolved strains identified 25 mutations with two genomic regions under stronger evolutionary pressure. Our analysis also suggests that the genotypic changes that are potentially responsible for the improved phenotypes may serve as useful candidates for metabolic engineering of cell factories. This work provides the robust C. autoethanogenum strain LAbrini to the academic community to speed up phenotyping and genetic engineering, improve quantitative characterisation of acetogen metabolism, and facilitate the generation of high-quality steady-state datasets.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDroplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used in biomedical research to interrogate the transcriptomes of single cells on a large scale. Pooling and processing cells from different samples together can reduce costs and batch effects. In order to pool cells, cells are often first labeled with hashtag oligonucleotides (HTOs). These HTOs are sequenced along with the cells RNA in the droplets and are subsequently used to computationally assign each droplet to its sample of origin, which is referred to as demultiplexing. Accurate demultiplexing is crucial and can be challenging due to background HTOs, low-quality cells/cell debris, and multiplets.\n\nResultsA new demultiplexing method, demuxmix, based on negative binomial regression mixture models is introduced. The method implements two significant improvements. First, demuxmixs probabilistic classification framework provides error probabilities for droplet assignments that can be used to discard uncertain droplets and inform about the quality of the HTO data and the demultiplexing success. Second, demuxmix utilizes the positive association between detected genes in the RNA library and HTO counts to explain parts of the variance in the HTO data resulting in improved droplet assignments. The improved performance of demuxmix compared to existing demultiplexing methods is assessed on real and simulated data. Finally, the feasibility of accurately demultiplexing experimental designs where non-labeled cells are pooled with labeled cells is demonstrated.\n\nAvailabilityR/Bioconductor package demuxmix (https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.demuxmix)",

    "abstract": "RationaleMissense variants in calmodulin (CaM) predispose patients to arrhythmias associated with high mortality rates. As CaM regulates several key cardiac ion channels, a mechanistic understanding of CaM variant-associated arrhythmias requires elucidating individual CaM variant effect on distinct channels. One key CaM regulatory target is the KCNQ1 (KV7.1) voltage-gated potassium channel that underlie the IKs current. Yet, relatively little is known as to how CaM variants interact with KCNQ1 or affect its function.\n\nObjectiveTo observe how arrhythmia-associated CaM variants affect binding to KCNQ1, channel membrane trafficking, and KCNQ1 function.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe combine a live-cell FRET binding assay, fluorescence trafficking assay, and functional electrophysiology to characterize >10 arrhythmia-associated CaM variants effect on KCNQ1. We identify one variant (G114W) that exhibits severely weakened binding to KCNQ1 but find that most other CaM variants interact with similar binding affinity to KCNQ1 when compared to CaM wild-type over physiological Ca2+ ranges. We further identify several CaM variants that affect KCNQ1 and IKs membrane trafficking and/or baseline current activation kinetics, thereby contextualizing KCNQ1 dysfunction in calmodulinopathy. Lastly, we delineate CaM variants with no effect on KCNQ1 function.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides comprehensive functional data that reveal how CaM variants contribute to creating a pro-arrhythmic substrate by causing abnormal KCNQ1 membrane trafficking and current conduction. We find that CaM variant regulation of KCNQ1 is not uniform with effects varying from benign to significant loss of function. This study provides a new approach to collecting details of CaM binding that are key for understanding how CaM variants predispose patients to arrhythmia via the dysregulation of multiple cardiac ion channels.",

Here, we studied the MBC response up to 6 months after Omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection in individuals previously vaccinated with three doses of mRNA vaccine. Longitudinal analysis, using single-cell multi-omics and functional analysis of monoclonal antibodies from RBD-specific MBCs, revealed that a BA.1 breakthrough infection mostly recruited pre-existing cross-reactive MBCs with limited de novo response against BA.1-restricted epitopes. Reorganization of clonal hierarchy and new rounds of germinal center reaction, however, combined to maintain diversity and induce progressive maturation of the MBC repertoire against common Hu-1 and BA.1, but not BA.5-restricted, SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD epitopes. Such remodeling was further associated with marked improvement in overall neutralizing breadth and potency. These findings have fundamental implications for the design of future vaccination booster strategies.",

    "abstract": "Coinfection with two notorious opportunistic pathogens, the Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, dominates chronic pulmonary infections. While coinfection is associated with poor patient outcomes, the interspecies interactions responsible for such decline remain unknown. Here, we dissected molecular mechanisms of interspecies sensing between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. We discovered that P. aeruginosa senses S. aureus secreted peptides and, counterintuitively, moves towards these toxins. P. aeruginosa tolerates such a strategy through \"competition sensing\", whereby it preempts imminent danger/competition by arming cells with type six secretion (T6S) and iron acquisition systems. Intriguingly, while T6S is predominantly described as weaponry targeting Gram-negative and eukaryotic cells, we find that T6S is essential for full P. aeruginosa competition with S. aureus, a previously undescribed role for T6S. Importantly, competition sensing was activated during coinfection of bronchial epithelia, including T6S islands targeting human cells. This study reveals critical insight into both interspecies competition and how antagonism may cause collateral damage to the host environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBovine brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes substantial economic losses and strongly impacts public health. Though it has been eradicated in many developed countries, it is still endemic in developing countries like Ethiopia.\n\nMethodology/principal findingsLare and Jikawo were the two districts of the Gambella Region selected purposively. Kebeles, study animals and peasant associations were randomly chosen. A total of 384 serum samples from 70 herds were collected and screened using Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and confirmed using Complement Fixation Test (CFT). A semi-structured questionnaire survey was used. The seroprevalence of brucellosis was summarized using descriptive statistics, and the association between risk factors, and seroprevalence of brucellosis was evaluated using logistic regression. The principal findings of the current study showed that individual and herd level seroprevalence of brucellosis using RBPT was 6.77% (26/384) and 24.29% (17/70), respectively, and the respective confirmation by CFT 3.13% (12/384) and 12.85% (9/70). Among the risk factors, herd size and the presence of other species had statistically significant associations (p<0.05) with Brucella seropositivity. Although the overall respondents knowledge, attitude, and practice were 66.4%, most were unaware that the disease was zoonotic, the ability of the disease to cause abortion, and the mode of the diseases transmission. Most respondents also had a poor attitude toward the mode of disease transmission, and they have been practicing risky practices that predisposed them to brucellosis.\n\nConclusionThe overall seroprevalence of brucellosis and cattle owners knowledge, attitude, and practice in the current study were low. However, being a contagious disease, brucellosis can easily spread among cattle herds, and poses a public health risk., Therefore, improvement of cattle owners knowledge, attitude, and practice and characterization of circulating Brucella species in the study areas are needed to design evidence-based disease control measures.\n\nAuthor SummaryBovine brucellosis, is a bacterial disease caused by Brucella abortus, which primarily affect cattle. Although bovine brucellosis has been eradicated in many developed countries, it is endemic in Ethiopia. It is one of the most serious zoonotic diseases widely distributed and resulted in serious economic losses and public health impacts. Particularly in pastoral parts of Ethiopia, like the current study areas, factor such as limited veterinary services and education services, frequent movement of farmers from one place to another in search of feed and water for their animals facilitates disease transmission between animals and to human. Thus, it is necessary to assess the prevalence of the disease and awareness of the farmers about the disease in order to reinforce the existing disease control attempts in the country and reduce public risk. Serum from blood samples of cattle were tested using Rose Bengal Plate Test and Complement Fixation Test to detect the presence of Brucella antibody, which indicates the presence of bovine brucellosis in the areas. Moreover, farmers knowledge and practice regarding the disease information was assessed. The current study showed the presence of brucellosis and farmers had low knowledge, attitude and practice risky activities that predispose them to the disease.",

    "abstract": "Error-prone replication of RNA viruses generates the genetic diversity required for adaptation within rapidly changing environments. Thus, arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) populations exist in nature as mutant swarms that are maintained between arthropods and vertebrates. Previous studies have demonstrated that West Nile virus (WNV) population dynamics are host dependent: In American crows, which experience extremely high viremia, purifying selection is weak and population diversity is high compared to American robins, which have 100 to 1000-fold lower viremia. WNV passed in robins experiences fitness gains, whereas that passed in crows does not. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that high crow viremia allows higher genetic diversity within individual avian peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), reasoning that this could have produced the previously observed host-specific differences in genetic diversity and fitness. Specifically, we infected cells and birds with a novel, barcoded version of WNV and sequenced viral RNA from single cells to quantify the number of WNV barcodes that each contained. Our results demonstrate that the richness of WNV populations within crows far exceeds that in robins. Similarly, rare WNV variants were maintained by crows more frequently than by robins. Our results suggest that increased viremia in crows relative to robins leads to maintenance of defective genomes and less prevalent variants, presumably through complementation. Our findings further suggest that weaker purifying selection in highly susceptible crows is attributable to this higher viremia, polyinfections and complementation. These studies further document the role of particular, ecologically relevant hosts in shaping virus population structure.\n\nAuthor SummaryWNV mutational diversity in vertebrates is species-dependent. In crows, low frequency variants are common, and viral populations are more diverse. In robins, fewer mutations become permanent fixtures of the overall viral population. We infected crows, robins and a chicken cell line with a genetically marked (barcoded) WNV. Higher levels of virus led to multiple unique WNV genomes infecting individual cells, even when a genotype was present at low levels in the input viral stock. Our findings suggest that higher levels of circulating virus in natural hosts allow less fit viruses to survive in RNA virus populations through complementation by more fit viruses. This is significant as it allows less represented and less fit viruses to be maintained at low levels until they potentially emerge when virus environments change. Overall our data reveal new insights on the relationships between host susceptibility to high viremia and virus evolution.",

Reduced vaginal glycogen is associated with lower levels of Lactobacillus crispatus, overgrowth of fastidious anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis and increased risk of adverse reproductive and sexual health outcomes. Here we show that Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus crispatus can autonomously utilize glycogen as a source for growth. Using an ungelatinized and labeled form of raw amylose, a more degradation-resistant -1,4-glucan, we were able to discriminate between the alpha-glucosidase activities of common vaginal bacterial species. The bacteria Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella piotii as well as several other common vaginal species were not capable of raw amylose degradation, while Gardnerella vaginalis, Gardnerella swidsinskii and Gardnerella leopoldii were, with the latter two having the highest degradation rates. In contrast to the glycogen-degrading activity we previously identified in Lactobacillus crispatus, this Gardnerella alpha-glucosidase activity was not cell-bound and not repressed in the presence of glucose. Raw amylose degradation activity in vaginal swabs was strongly associated with bacterial vaginosis as assessed by Nugent scoring. Overall, our results show that the dysbiotic microbiota of bacterial vaginosis is associated with increased amylolytic activity, which is also found in pure cultures of Gardnerella species, but not in other common vaginal bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reinforced efforts for developing effective vaccination strategy for existing and emerging viruses. Currently there are various vaccine technology available for treating viral diseases, however it is imperative to develop and investigate second-generation vaccines such as chimeric virus-like particles (chi-VLPs) vaccine for increased immunogenicity, ease of production and scalability to supplement the worldwide vaccine supply. Intriguingly, chi-VLPs expresses more than one antigenic epitope on its surface, hence it is expected to be a more effective vaccine candidate. Hereby, this study reports, a novel bivalent vaccine design of chimeric alphavirus coronavirus virus-like particles (ChAC-VLPs), displaying fusion glycoproteins of CHIKV and receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on its surface. Uniqueness and versatility of ChAC-VLPs has been demonstrated via a various techniques including Western blot, Immunofluorescence, cryoEM, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The multimeric epitope display of immunogenic antigens, i.e CHIKV envelop glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 RBD was validated by cell-based assays. ChAC-VLP immunized mice has shown substantial neutralization titres for CHIKV (PRNT50 of 1:25) from the serum collected after 2nd booster doses. Similarly, serum antibodies were detected for SARS-CoV2 RBD as observed by antigen specific ELISA and validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR binding response was detected to be >200 RU for anti-RBD antibody in post-immunized mice sera. In conclusion, present study proposes ChAC-VLPs as a potential hybrid vaccine candidate for CHIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes valuable insights in chi-VLPs domain.",

    "abstract": "Amomi Fructus (Sharen, AF) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) from three source species (or subspecies) including Wurfbainia villosa var. villosa (WVV), W. villosa var. xanthioides (WVX) or W. longiligularis (WL). Among them, WVV has been transplanted from its top-geoherb region Guangdong to its current main production area Yunnan for more than 50 years in China. However, the genetic and transcriptomic differentiation among multiple AF source (sub)species and between the origin and transplanted populations of WVV is unknown. In our study, the observed overall higher expression of terpenoid biosynthesis genes in WVV than that of WVX supplied possible evidence for the better pharmacological effect of WVV. We also screened ten candidate borneol dehydrogenase (BDH) genes that potentially catalyzed borneol into camphor in WVV. The BDH genes may experience independent evolution after acquiring the ancestral copies and the followed tandem duplications might account for the abundant camphor content in WVV. Furthermore, four populations of WVV, WVX and WL are genetically differentiated and the gene flow from WVX to WVV in Yunnan contributed to the increased genetic diversity in the introduced population (WVV-JH) compared to its top-geoherb region (WVV-YC), which showed the lowest genetic diversity and might undergo genetic degradation. In addition, TPS and BDH genes were selected among populations of multiple AF source (sub)species and between the top-geoherb and non-top-geoherb regions, which might explain the metabolite difference of these populations. Our findings provide important guidance for the conservation, genetic improvement, industrial development of the three source (sub)species, and identifying top-geoherbalism with molecular markers and proper clinical application of AF.",

    "abstract": "Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America often relies on the application of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide mixtures to kill larval sea lamprey. Selectivity of TFM against lampreys appears to be due to differential detoxification ability in these jawless fishes compared to bony fishes, particularly teleosts. However, the proximate mechanisms of tolerance to the TFM and niclosamide mixture and the mechanisms of niclosamide toxicity on its own are poorly understood, especially among non-target fishes. Here, we used RNA sequencing to identify specific mRNA transcripts and functional processes that responded to niclosamide or a TFM:niclosamide mixture in bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Bluegill were exposed to niclosamide or TFM:niclosamide mixture, along with a time-matched control group, and gill and liver tissues were sampled at 6, 12, and 24 h. We summarized the whole-transcriptome patterns through gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and through differential expression of detoxification genes. The niclosamide treatment resulted in an upregulation of several transcripts associated with detoxification (cyp, ugt, sult, gst), which may help explain the relatively high detoxification capacity in bluegill. Conversely, the TFM:niclosamide mixture resulted in an enrichment of processes related to arrested cell cycle and growth, and cell death alongside a diverse detoxification gene response. Detoxification of both lampricides likely involves the use of phase I and II biotransformation genes. Our findings strongly suggest that the unusually high tolerance of bluegill to lampricides is due to these animals having an inherently high capacity and flexible detoxification response to such compounds.",

These clusters form by a phase-separation mechanism, and their size and shape are controlled via an amphiphilic effect of transcribed genes. Here, we construct amphiphile-nanomotifs purely from DNA, and achieve similar size and shape control for phase-separated droplets formed from fully synthetic, self-interacting DNA-nanomotifs. Low amphiphile concentrations induce rounding of droplets, followed by splitting and, ultimately, full dispersal at higher concentrations. Super-resolution microscopy data obtained from zebrafish embryo stem cells reveal a comparable transition for transcriptional clusters with increasing transcription levels. Brownian dynamics and lattice simulations further confirm that addition of amphiphilic particles is sufficient to explain the observed changes in shape and size.

    "abstract": "Faithful chromosome segregation of 8 duplicated haploid genomes into 8 daughter male gametes is essential for male gametogenesis and mosquito transmission of Plasmodium. Plasmodium evolves the endomitosis for this multinucleated cell division. However, the mechanism underlying the spindle-kinetochore attachment remains elusive. End-binding proteins (EBs) are the conserved microtubule (MT) plus-end binding proteins and play an important role in regulating MT plus-end dynamics. Here we report that Plasmodium EB1 is a unique orthologue distinct from the canonical eukaryotic EB1. Both in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that Plasmodium EB1 lost MT plus-end tracking but gained MT-lattice affinity. This MT-binding feature of EB1 is contributed by both the CH domain and the linker region. EB1-deficient parasites produce male gametocytes that develop to the anucleated male gametes, leading to defective mosquito transmission of parasite. EB1 is localized at the nucleoplasm of male gametocytes. Upon gametogenesis, EB1 decorates the full-length of spindle MTs and regulates spindle structure. The kinetochores attach to spindle MTs laterally throughout three rounds of endomitosis and this attachment is EB1-dependent. Consequently, impaired spindle-kinetochore attachment was observed in EB1-deficient parasites. These results indicate that a parasite-specific EB1 with MT-lattice affinity has evolved to fulfill the spindle-kinetochore lateral attachment in male gametogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe skin microbiome is increasingly recognised as a critical component of the innate skin immune response and is central to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory skin disorders including atopic dermatitis. Previous studies have not looked in detail at the impact of changing both sampling methodology and hypervariable region sequencing for skin microbiome analysis.\n\nObjectivesWe set out to undertake a detailed analysis comparing microbe population diversity and resolution at the single species level by swab, tape, scrape and scrape then swab sampling assayed by hypervariable region sequencing.\n\nMethodsIn triplicate samples from the antecubital fossa were taken from healthy volunteers for 16s RNA analysis by primer amplification for hypervariable regions 1-3, and 3-4.\n\nResultsAlpha (phylogenetic) diversity was the greatest with tape sampling and V1-3 analysis, whereas for V4, tape and swab were equivalent. Scrape sampling showed lower alpha diversity at both V1-3 and V4. All measures of beta diversity showed the scrape methodology yielded a lesser diversity than the others. Phyla composition was similar across all sampling methodologies. Minor differences in composition were noted between V1-3 and V4 sequencing, but V1-3 was optimal for identification of firmicutes (including staphylococci).\n\nConclusionsIn the methodological planning of skin microbiome analysis skin scientists need to consider the microbes of interest to choose the optimal hypervariable region to sequence, and harmonisation of methodological approaches would be beneficial to the field. For detection of staphylococci on flexural skin, we would recommend tape sampling with analysis of V1-3.\n\nWhats already known about this topic?O_LIPrevious microbiome studies have utilised many different methodologies, but a detailed comparison of their utility in skin research has not been undertaken\nC_LIO_LIMethodological choices in skin microbiome analysis affect both sensitivity to detect diversity and sensitivity to identify at a species level\nC_LIO_LIOptimisation to detect diversity and species identification can require different approaches\nC_LI\n\nWhat does this study add?O_LIOur study compared a matrix the four most widely utilised skin sampling methodologies and the two principle means for hypervariable gene analysis.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that alpha diversity is optimal with tape sampling\nC_LIO_LIAdditionally, in contrast to gut microbiome analyses, in the skin hypervariable region V1-3 analysis is superior to V4 when the species of interest are staphylococci.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "mRNAs produced in a cell are almost always translated within the same cell. Some mRNAs are transported to other cells of the organism through processes involving membrane nanotubes or extracellular vesicles. A recent report describes a surprising new phenomenon of encapsulating mRNAs inside virus-like particles (VLPs) to deliver them to other cells in a process that was named SEND (Selective Endogenous eNcapsidation for cellular Delivery). Although the seminal work demonstrates the SEND process in cultured cells, it is unknown whether this phenomenon occurs in vivo. Here, we demonstrate the SEND process in living organisms using specially designed genetically engineered mouse models. Our proof of principle study lays a foundation for the SEND-VLP system to potentially be used as a gene therapy tool to deliver therapeutically important mRNAs to tissues.",

    "abstract": "Bamboos (Poaceae: Bambuseae) are a unique and diverse group of plants (> 1500 species) that are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Various birds, mammals, and insects use bamboo either directly or indirectly, and some species are obligate bamboo specialists. For instance, several species of Neotropical birds are found in bamboo alone. However, the mechanisms underlying dependence on/associations with bamboo are almost entirely unknown. We studied bird communities in bamboo and rainforest across two seasons in the Eastern Himalaya, where we explored a possible mechanism for bird associations with bamboo - dietary resource specialization. We calculated use of bamboo versus rainforest by bird species and described the structure and composition of the bird and arthropod communities in both habitats and seasons. We provide the first systematic evidence of bamboo specialist bird species from the Eastern Himalaya. Although the species richness of birds and arthropods in both habitats and seasons did not vary starkly, we found that the composition of bird and arthropod communities in both habitats and both seasons to be distinct. Interestingly, we found arthropod communities in different substrates of bamboo to also be distinct. Bird specialization in bamboo in the Eastern Himalaya could be because of their dietary specialization to the unique arthropods found in bamboo. The results from this study emphasise the importance of bamboo in the Eastern Himalaya and provide baseline information that might aid in conservation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPredicting the regulatory function of non-coding DNA using only the DNA sequence continues to be a major challenge in genomics. With the advent of improved optimization algorithms, faster GPU speeds, and more intricate machine learning libraries, hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures can be constructed and applied to extract crucial information from non-coding DNA.\n\nResultsUsing a comparative analysis of the performance of thousands of Deep Learning (DL) architectures, we developed ChromDL, a neural network architecture combining bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and bidirectional long short-term memory units (BiLSTM), which significantly improves upon a range of prediction metrics compared to its predecessors in transcription factor binding site (TFBS), histone modification (HM), and DNase-I hypersensitive site (DHS) detection. Combined with a secondary model, it can be utilized for accurate classification of gene regulatory elements. The model can also detect weak transcription factor (TF) binding with higher accuracy as compared to previously developed methods and has the potential to accurately delineate TF binding motif specificities.\n\nAvailabilityThe ChromDL source code can be found at https://github.com/chrishil1/ChromDL.",

    "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme peroxidase that is mainly expressed and secreted by neutrophils. MPOs role in inflammatory diseases has been highlighted in recent years, but its role in tumor development remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the role of MPO in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In silico analysis revealed a survival benefit in patients with NSCLC and low MPO expression. Furthermore, a syngeneic tumor model using MPO knockout (KO) mice revealed that mice lacking MPO had lower tumor growth than controls. The reduction in tumor size was accompanied by an increase in lymphoid populations, including natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, suggesting a shift to a more anti-tumorigenic immune environment in MPO-KO mouse tumors. The T cell induced interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) expression was increased in MPO-KO tumors, indicating increased tumoricidal activity. CD8 depletion abolished the previously observed reduction in tumor size in MPO-KO mice, indicating that CD8+ T cells play an important role. In vitro, T cells treated with MPO showed reduced proliferation and IFN-{gamma} expression. Furthermore, MPO could be internalized into T cells. Heparin pretreatment of T cells blocked MPO binding and internalization into T cells and reversed MPO-induced proliferation reduction. Interestingly, MPO+ lymphocytes were found in tumor samples from patients with NSCLC. Our findings suggest that MPO plays an immunosuppressive role in NSCLC.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHigh myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in non-small cell lung cancer patients is a predictor for adverse outcome and mice lacking MPO showed enhanced anti-tumorigenic leukocyte infiltration, suggesting a pro-tumorigenic role of MPO.",

    "abstract": "Humans produce two primary forms of vocal communication: speaking and singing. What is the basis for these two categories? Is the distinction between them based primarily on culturally specific, learned features, or do consistent acoustical cues exist that reliably distinguish speech and song worldwide? Some studies have suggested that important aspects of music can be distinguished from speech based on spectro-temporal modulation patterns, but this conclusion is based on Western music, leaving open the question of whether such a principle may apply more globally. Here, we studied the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of vocalizations produced by 369 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies distributed across six continents. We show that specific ranges of spectral and temporal modulations differentiate speech from song in a consistent fashion, and that those ranges overlap within categories and across societies. Machine-learning analyses confirmed that this effect was cross-culturally robust, with vocalizations reliably classified solely from their spectro-temporal modulation patterns across all 21 societies. Listeners unfamiliar with most of the cultures could also classify the vocalizations, with similar accuracy patterns as the machine learning algorithm, indicating that the spectro-temporal cues used by the classifier are similar to those used by human listeners. Thus, the two most basic forms of human vocalization appear to exploit opposite extremes of the spectro-temporal continuum in a consistent fashion across societies. The findings support the idea that the human nervous system is specialized to produce and perceive two distinct ranges of spectro-temporal modulation in the service of the two distinct modes of human vocal communication.",

    "abstract": "Association fibers connect different areas of the cerebral cortex over long distances and integrate information to achieve higher brain functions, particularly in humans. Prototyped association fibers are developed to the respective tangential direction throughout the cerebral hemispheres in the subplate layer during the fetal period. However, the directional guidance principle for forming association fibers is unknown. Because the subplate is located below the cortical surface, the tangential direction of the fibers may be biased by the curved surface geometry due to Sylvian fissure and cortical poles. The fiber length can be minimized if the tracts follow the shortest paths (geodesics) of the curved cortical surface. Here, we propose and examine a theory that geodesics guide the tangential direction of long association fibers by analyzing how geodesics are spatially distributed on the fetal human brains. Unlike the homogeneous distribution on spherical surfaces, we found that the geodesics were dense on the saddle-shaped surface of the perisylvian region and sparse on the dome-shaped cortical poles. The geodesics corresponded with the positions of five typical association fibers, supporting the geodesic theory. Thus, the geodesic theory provides directional guidance and suggests that long association fibers emerge from minimizing their tangential length on fetal brains.",
