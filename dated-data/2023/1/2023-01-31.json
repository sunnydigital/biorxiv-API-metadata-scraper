    "abstract": "Bei Mu Gua Lou San (BMGLS) is an ancient formulation known for its moisturizing and expectorant properties, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We investigated dose-dependent effects of BMGLS on its rehydrating and mucus-modulating properties using an air-liquid-interface (ALI) cell culture model of the Calu-3 human bronchial epithelial cell line and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), and specifically focused on quantity and composition of the two major mucosal proteins MUC5AC and MUC5B.\n\nALI cultures were treated with BMGLS at different concentrations over three weeks and evaluated by means of histology, immunostaining and electron microscopy. MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA levels were assessed and quantified on protein level using an automated image-based approach. Additionally, expression levels of the major mucus-stimulating enzyme 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) were evaluated. BMGLS induced dose-dependent morphological changes in NHBE but not Calu-3 ALI cultures that resulted in increased surface area via the formation of herein termed intra-epithelial structures (IES). While cellular rates of proliferation, apoptosis or degeneration remained unaffected, BMGLS caused swelling of mucosal granules, increased the area of secreted mucus, decreased muco-glycoprotein density, and dispensed MUC5AC. Additionally, BMGLS reduced expression levels of MUC5AC, MUC5B and the mucus-stimulating enzyme 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15).\n\nOur studies suggest that BMGLS rehydrates airway mucus while stimulating mucus secretion by increasing surface areas and regulating goblet cell differentiation through modulating major mucus-stimulating pathways.",

    "abstract": "During anaphase, antiparallel overlapping midzone microtubules elongate and form bundles, contributing to chromosome segregation and the location of contractile ring formation. Midzone microtubules are dynamic in early but not late anaphase; however, the kinetics and mechanisms of stabilization are incompletely understood. Using photoactivation of cells expressing PA-EGF--tubulin we find that immediately after anaphase onset, a single highly dynamic population of midzone microtubules is present; as anaphase progresses, both dynamic and stable populations of midzone microtubules coexist. By midcytokinesis, only static, non-dynamic microtubules are detected. The velocity of microtubule sliding also decreases as anaphase progresses, becoming undetectable by late anaphase. Following depletion of PRC1, midzone microtubules remain highly dynamic in anaphase and fail to form static arrays in telophase despite furrowing. Cells depleted of Kif4a contain elongated zones of PRC1 and fail to form static arrays in telophase. Cells blocked in cytokinesis form short PRC1 overlap zones that do not coalesce laterally; these cells also fail to form static arrays in telophase. Together, our results demonstrate that dynamic turnover and sliding of midzone microtubules is gradually reduced during anaphase and that the final transition to a static array in telophase requires both lateral and longitudinal compaction of PRC1 containing overlap zones.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDietary fiber is important for a healthy diet, but intake is low in CKD patients and the impact this has on the manifestations of CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder (MBD) is unknown.\n\nMethodsThe Cy/+ rat with progressive CKD was fed a casein-based diet of 0.7% phosphate with 10% inulin (fermentable fiber) or cellulose (non-fermentable fiber) from 22 weeks to either 30 or 32 weeks of age (~30 and ~15 % of normal kidney function). We assessed CKD-MBD, cecal microbiota, and serum gut-derived uremic toxins. Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of age and inulin diet, and their interaction.\n\nResultsIn CKD animals, dietary inulin led to changes in microbiota alpha and beta diversity at 30 and 32 weeks, with higher relative abundance of several taxa, including Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, and lower Lactobacillus. Inulin reduced serum levels of gut-derived uremic toxins, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone, but not fibroblast growth factor-23. Dietary inulin decreased aorta and cardiac calcification and reduced left ventricular mass index and cardiac fibrosis. Bone turnover and cortical bone parameters were improved with inulin; however, bone mechanical properties were not altered.\n\nConclusionsThe addition of the fermentable fiber inulin to the diet of CKD rats led to changes in the gut microbiota composition, lowered gut-derived uremic toxins, and improved most parameters of CKD-MBD. Future studies should assess this fiber as an additive therapy to other pharmacologic and diet interventions in CKD.\n\nSignificance StatementDietary fiber has well established beneficial health effects. However, the impact of fermentable dietary fiber on the intestinal microbiome and CKD-MBD is poorly understood. We used an animal model of progressive CKD and demonstrated that the addition of 10% of the fermentable fiber inulin to the diet altered the intestinal microbiota and lowered circulating gut-derived uremic toxins, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone. These changes were associated with improved cortical bone parameters, lower vascular calcification, and reduced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and calcification. Taken together, dietary fermentable fiber may be a novel additive intervention to traditional therapies of CKD-MBD.",

    "abstract": "Mangroves are subject to rapid and large-scale habitat changes which threaten their unique genetic diversity and provision of critically important ecosystem services. Habitat fragmentation reduces connectivity which can impair dispersal and lead to genetic isolation. However, it is unclear whether fragmentation could impact mangrove genetic isolation, as mangrove propagules can disperse long distances. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting a correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance in mangrove plants. From the 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria, we found a significant isolation-by-distance effect; geographic distance was significantly associated with Neis genetic distance and FST. Our results show that mangrove propagules may be limited in their capacity to disperse across long distances, which highlights the importance of maintaining close proximity between habitat patches and reducing habitat fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Exonic variants present some of the strongest links between genotype and phenotype. However, these variants can have significant inter-individual pathogenicity differences, known as variable penetrance. In this study, we propose a model where genetically controlled mRNA splicing modulates the pathogenicity of exonic variants. By first cataloging exonic inclusion from RNA-seq data in GTEx v8, we find that pathogenic alleles are depleted on highly included exons. Using a large-scale phased WGS data from the TOPMed consortium, we observe that this effect may be driven by common splice-regulatory genetic variants, and that natural selection acts on haplotype configurations that reduce the transcript inclusion of putatively pathogenic variants, especially when limiting to haploinsufficient genes. Finally, we test if this effect may be relevant for autism risk using families from the Simons Simplex Collection, but find that splicing of pathogenic alleles has a penetrance reducing effect here as well. Overall, our results indicate that common splice-regulatory variants may play a role in reducing the damaging effects of rare exonic variants.",

    "abstract": "Pig husbandry is the most valued and economically sustainable husbandry in the livestock farming system. The performance and productivity of the pig are chiefly dependent on the nutritional factor steered by gut beneficial bacteria. The swine gut microbiome has a direct relationship with feed efficiency. As a consequence, identifying microbial taxonomy and functional capacity is critical for proper nutrient digestion. In the present investigation, eighteen grower pigs aged 3 months and weighing 30{+/-}0.55 kg were allocated into three different groups using a randomized block layout and supplemented with QPM maize fodder of 0, 5, and 10% to the basal diet by substituting (wt/wt on DM) the maize grains, and named as T0, T1, and T2 to probe the increase in gut beneficial bacteria found in the faecal contents. For comparison with T0, T1, and T2, a random faecal sample designated R was collected from six grower pigs of the same age group and bodyweight fed a maize-soya bean-based diet. The experiment is being carried out to investigate the effect of various maize fodder levels on the metagenomic profiles of pig gut microbiota using the 16S rRNA gene. All of the experimental diets were iso-nitrogenous, with protein content ranging from 18.37 to 18.63 per cent. The data generated by 16S rRNA amplicon analysis was 68, 56, 61, and 39 Mb in R, T0, T1, and T2 samples, respectively. From taxonomic distribution, bacterial phyla namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochetes are found in descending order of relative abundance in the R, T0, and T1 groups, respectively, while Spirochaetes, Proteobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutesare found in descending order of relative abundance in the T2 group. The relative profusion of Fibrobacter succinogenes is 0.89% and 16.84% in the T1 and T2 groups. According to the findings, a higher level of maize fodder in the diet of grower pigs promotes the growth of fibre-degrading bacteria in the gut microbiota, particularly Fibrobacter succinogenes. Moreover, feeding green maize has decreased the population of methanobacteria in the gut of pigs, which in turn has limited the production of methane.",

Not only can MS determine glycan compositions, but also position the glycan at specific sites via glycoproteomics. However, glycans are complex branching structures with monosaccharides interconnected in a variety of biologically relevant linkages - isomeric properties which are invisible when the readout is mass alone.\n\nHere, we developed an LC-MS/MS-based workflow for determining glycopeptide isomer ratios. Making use of isomerically-defined glyco(peptide) standards, we observed marked differences in fragmentation behavior between isomer pairs when subjected to collision energy gradients, specifically in terms of galactosylation/sialylation branching and linkage. These behaviors were developed into component variables that allowed relative quantification of isomerism within mixtures. Importantly, at least for small peptides, the isomer quantification appeared largely independent from the peptide portion of the conjugate, allowing broad application of the method.",

Tubular metabolism changes markedly following acute kidney injury (AKI), but which changes are adaptive versus maladaptive remain poorly understood. In publicly available data sets, we noticed a consistent downregulation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) after AKI, which we experimentally confirmed. To test the functional consequences of MPC downregulation, we generated novel tubular epithelial cell-specific Mpc1 knockout (MPC TubKO) mice. 13C-glucose tracing, steady-state metabolomic profiling, and enzymatic activity assays revealed that MPC TubKO coordinately increased activities of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutathione and thioredoxin oxidant defense systems. Following rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI, MPC TubKO decreased markers of kidney injury and oxidative damage and strikingly increased survival. Our findings suggest that decreased mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is a central adaptive response following AKI and raise the possibility of therapeutically modulating the MPC to attenuate AKI severity.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of RNA oligonucleotides (oligos) plays an increasingly important role in the development of RNA therapeutics and in epitranscriptomic studies. However, MS fragmentation behaviors of RNA oligos are understood insufficiently. In this study, we characterized the negative-ion-mode fragmentation behaviors of 26 synthetic RNA oligos of four to eight nucleotides (nt) in length by collision-induced dissociation (CID) using a high-resolution, accurate-mass instrument. We find that in the CID spectra acquired under the normalized collisional energy of 35%, [~]70% of the total peak intensity belonged to sequencing ions (a-B, a, b, c, d, w, x, y, z), [~]25% belonged to precursor ions with either complete or partial loss of a nucleobase in the form of a neutral or an anion, and the remainder were internal ions and anionic nucleobases. Of the sequencing ions, the most abundant species were y, c, w, a-B, and a ions. The charge state of the RNA precursor ions strongly affected their fragmentation behaviors. As the precursor charge increased from -1 to -5, the fractional intensity of sequencing ions in the CID spectra decreased, whereas the fractional intensity of precursor ions with neutral and/or charged losses of a nucleobase increased. Moreover, RNA oligos containing U, especially at the 3' terminus, tended to produce precursors that lost HNCO and/or NCO-, which presumably corresponded to isocyanic acid and cyanate anion, respectively. These findings build a strong foundation for mechanistic understanding of RNA fragmentation by MS/MS, contributing to future automated identification of RNA oligos from their CID spectra in a more efficient way.",

In this work, we introduce a generalization of McCaskills algorithm that is well-defined over continuous inputs and is differentiable. This allows us to tackle the inverse folding problem--designing a sequence with desired equilibrium thermodynamic properties--directly using gradient optimization. This has applications to creating RNA-based drugs such as mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, it allows McCaskills foundational algorithm to be incorporated into machine learning pipelines directly since we have made it end-to-end differentiable. This work highlights how principles from differentiable programming can be translated to existing physical models to develop powerful tools for machine learning.

Based on the research status of RAD51 at home and abroad and the analysis of online databases, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between RAD51 expression and clinical patient survival and prognosis. It is expected to provide a new theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of lung cancer patients, help identify new molecular markers, and provide new targets for the biological therapy of lung cancer patients.\n\nMethodsthe RNA Seq data of NSCLC in TCGA database were downloaded, and the expression of RAD51 gene in NSCLC and normal tissues were analyzed by R studio software. Clinical correlation analysis revealed its correlation with the clinicopathological characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer. Survival analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the expression level and the prognosis of patients. CIBERSORT and TIMER were used to evaluate the correlation between the expression level of CIBERSORT and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. The protein expression level of RAD51 in non-small cell lung cancer was evaluated by HPA.\n\nResultsRAD51 was highly expressed in lung cancer (p<0.05), which was significantly associated with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients (p=0.0026), but not with lung squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.76). The expression level of RAD51 mRNA was associated with different pathological stages of lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.000528), but not with different pathological stages of lung squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.326). RAD51 was positively correlated with the expression of TP53, BRAF, EGFR, MYC, PD-L1, and KRAS (p<0.001). In lung adenocarcinoma, lung cancer cells were positively correlated with CD4+memory T cells, CD8+T cells, and M1 macrophages (p<0.001). In lung squamous cell carcinoma, tumor cells were positively correlated with M1 macrophages (p<0.05), but not with CD4+T memory cells, CD8+T cells, M2 macrophages, and Tregs cells (p>0.05). The HPA database indicated that RAD51 protein was positive in non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nConclusionRAD51 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. RAD51 can be used as a biomarker related to the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and is expected to become a target for the diagnosis and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.",

To address this challenge, we have developed a tool with a wide range of applicability to call CNV and LOH in the MHC region.\n\nResultsTo address the challenge mentioned above, we have developed MHCnvex, an algorithm that accurately calls haplotype level CNVs for the genes in the MHC class I and II locus. MHCnvex presents a novel approach based on likelihood models for detecting CNVs at haplotype level. Additionally, this method integrates the MHC locus with other adjacent loci from the short arm of chromosome 6 to enhance the accuracy of the calls. The incorporation of a statistical approach and the examination of the broader chromosome 6 region, rather than just the MHC locus alone, make MHCnvex less vulnerable to local coverage biases (commonly associated with MHC locus). The performance of MHCnvex has been evaluated according to different measures including concordance with MHC flanking regions and changes in the allelic expression of MHC genes due to alteration. MHCnvex has also shown to significantly reduce the variability of calculated coverage for CNV analysis.\n\nAvailabilityImplementation of MHCnvex algorithm is available as an R package at: https://github.com/NoshadHo/MHCnvex",

    "abstract": "Despite millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes being sequenced and shared globally, manipulating such data sets is still challenging, especially selecting sequences for focused phylogenetic analysis. We present a novel method, uvaia, which is based on partial and exact sequence similarity for quickly extracting database sequences similar to query sequences of interest. Many SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analyses rely on very low numbers of ambiguous sites as a measure of quality since ambiguous sites do not contribute to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences, which uvaia alleviates by using measures of sequence similarity that consider partially ambiguous sites. Such fine-grained definition of similarity allows not only for better phylogenetic analyses, but also for improved classification and biogeographical inferences. Uvaia works natively with compressed files, can use multiple cores and efficiently utilises memory, being able to analyse large data sets on a standard desktop.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) are a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species (ROS)- mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD.\n\nObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function.\n\nMethodsWe used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene (DS) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation.\n\nResultsDS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient {beta}-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function.\n\nConclusionInhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby increasing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.",

    "abstract": "RationaleSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and heart failure (HF) are leading causes of death. The underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, limiting the design of effective therapies. Whereas most autonomic modulation therapies have failed to show benefit in HF patients, a growing body of clinical evidence over the past 50 years suggests cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) confers cardioprotection. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unexplored.\n\nObjectiveBased on the hypothesis that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) drive the pathogenesis of HF and SCA, we investigate whether CSD prevents SCA and HF by improving mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and redox balance, to correct impaired Ca2+ handling and repolarization reserve.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe interrogated CSD-specific responses in pressure-overload HF models with spontaneous SCA using in vivo echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, biochemical (e.g., mitochondrial antioxidant and NADPH producing enzymes) and in vitro studies, including dynamic measures of ratiometric mROS, Ca2+ and sarcomere length in left ventricular myocytes. Hemodynamic compromise in HF increased mROS levels, which impaired {beta}-adrenergic signaling and increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak, thereby reducing sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load, increasing diastolic Ca2+, impairing myofilament contraction and further increasing the sympathetic stress response. Importantly, diastolic Ca2+ levels were more important than sarcoplasmic Ca2+ for driving the beat-to-beat variability of Ca2+ transients and triggering arrhythmogenic activity. Surgical CSD protected against HF progression by upregulating mROS antioxidant and NADPH producing enzymes that, in turn, mitigated diastolic Ca2+ overload, triggered activity and dispersion of repolarization.\n\nConclusionsOur findings support a fundamental role of sympathetic stress-induced downregulation of mROS scavenging enzymes and RyR-leak mediated diastolic Ca2+ overload in the pathogenesis of HF and SCA that is abolished by CSD. This first report on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of CSD therapy supports the evaluation of its utility in a broader group of high risk patients. Our findings may be generalizable to other forms of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Further studies on targets engaged by CSD may advance the design of new, more effective therapies for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARYClinical evidence suggests cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) confers cardioprotective effects, such as preventing heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are unknown, limiting optimal clinical application. We hypothesized that CSD prevents SCA and HF by improving mitochondrial antioxidant capacity, autonomic and redox balance, Ca2+ handling and repolarization reserve. In a guinea pig model that uniquely mimics human HF with spontaneous SCA, we interrogated CSD-specific responses using echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, biochemical, and dynamic ratiometric measures of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), Ca2+ and sarcomere length in cardiomyocytes. Surgical CSD rescued cardioprotection by upregulating mROS antioxidant and NADPH producing enzymes, which mitigated mROS-induced diastolic Ca2+ overload, triggered activity, repolarization lability, HF and SCA. Our findings show a critical mechanistic role of diastolic Ca2+ that may be broadly applicable to other cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias, and provide the first molecular and cellular mechanistic basis to support CSD therapy more broadly in high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Plants possess well-developed light sensing mechanisms and signal transduction systems for regulating photomorphogenesis. ELONGATED HYOCOTYL 5 (HY5), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, has been extensively characterized in dicot plants. In this study, we have shown that OsbZIP1 is a functional homolog of Arabidopsis HY5 (AtHY5) and is important for light-mediated regulation of seedling and mature plant development in rice. Ectopic expression of OsbZIP1 in rice reduces plant height and leaf length without affecting plant fertility, which is in contrast to OsbZIP48, another HY5 homolog we characterised earlier. OsbZIP1 is alternatively spliced and the isoform OsbZIP1.2 lacking COP1 binding domain regulates seedling development in dark; this is unique since AtHY5 lacking COP1 binding domain does not display such a phenotype. Rice seedlings overexpressing OsbZIP1 were found to be shorter than vector control under white and monochromatic light conditions whereas RNAi seedlings displayed completely opposite phenotype. While OsbZIP1.1 is light regulated, OsbZIP1.2 shows similar protein profile in both light and dark conditions. Due to its interaction with OsCOP1, OsbZIP1.1 undergoes degradation via 26S proteasome under dark conditions. Also, OsbZIP1.1 interacts with CASEIN KINASE 2 (OsCK2[a]3) and consequently undergoes phosphorylation. In comparison, OsbZIP1.2 did not show any interaction with COP1 and OsCK2[a]3. We propose that OsbZIP1.1 most likely works under low fluence of blue light (15 mol/m{superscript 2}/s) while OsbZIP1.2 becomes dominant as the fluence is increased to 30 mol/m{superscript 2}/s. Data presented in this study reveal that AtHY5 homologs in rice have undergone neofunctionalization and alternative splicing (AS) of OsbZIP1 has increased the repertoire of its functions.\n\nOne sentence summaryAlternative spliced forms of OsbZIP1, an AtHY5 homolog in rice, regulate seedling development in response to light and dark",

Here, we applied, and generated new parts for, a modular plasmid toolkit to study marine bacteria in the context of symbioses and host-microbe interactions. To demonstrate the utility of this plasmid system, we genetically manipulated the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea, which stimulates the metamorphosis of the model tubeworm, Hydroides elegans. Using these tools, we quantified constitutive and native promoter expression, developed reporter strains that enable the imaging of host-bacteria interactions, and used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to knock down a secondary metabolite and a host-associated gene. We demonstrate the broader utility of this modular system for rapidly creating and iteratively testing genetic tractability by modifying marine bacteria that are known to be associated with diverse host-microbe symbioses. These efforts enabled the successful transformation of twelve marine strains across two Proteobacteria classes, four orders and ten genera. Altogether, the present study demonstrates how synthetic biology strategies enable the investigation of marine microbes and marine host-microbe symbioses with broader implications for environmental restoration and biotechnology.",

Both mutations impacted the proteomes of cells grown in both rich and minimal media, including the abundance of the cell envelope and transmembrane transport-associated proteins. Furthermore, features essential for the ecological success of these mutants in a plant environment, including their ability to use various carbon and nitrogen sources, produce plant cell wall degrading enzymes, ability to form biofilms, siderophore production, swimming and swarming motility and virulence in planta were assessed.

Methanosarcina acetivorans is extensively studied as a model methanogen due to the availability of genetic tools and its versatile substrate range. Although genome editing in M. acetivorans via CRISPR/Cas9 has already been demonstrated, we now describe a user-friendly CRISPR/Cas12a toolbox that recognizes a T-rich (5'-TTTV) PAM sequence. This new system can manage deletions of 3500 bp (i.e., knockout of the entire frhADGB operon) and heterologous gene insertions with 80% efficiency observed in ten PurR transformants. Our CRISPR/Cas12a system also enables multiplex genome editing at high efficiency, which helps speed up genetic engineering. Deletions of 100 bp generated on two separate sites of the genome yielded 8/8 correctly edited transformants. Simultaneous gene deletion (100 bp) and replacement (100-bp region replaced by the 2400-bp uidA expression cassette) at a separate site was achieved, with 3/6 of transformants being edited correctly. In combination with the Cas9-based system, our CRISPR/Cas12a toolbox enables targeted genome editing at two sites (guanine-rich and thymine-rich, respectively) and, in so doing, hastens the overall genetic engineering of the Methanosarcinales species.",

This process is directed by a complex of viral transcriptional activator proteins that hijack cellular RNA polymerase II and an unknown set of additional factors. We employed proximity labeling coupled with mass spectrometry, followed by CRISPR and siRNA screening to identify proteins functionally associated with the Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) late gene transcriptional complex. These data revealed that the catalytic subunit of the viral DNA packaging motor, ORF29, is both dynamically associated with the viral transcriptional activator complex and potentiates late gene expression. Through genetic mutation and deletion of ORF29, we establish that its catalytic activity potentiates viral transcription and is required for robust accumulation of essential late proteins during infection.

A specialized complex of viral transcriptional activator proteins drives expression of these late genes in a manner dependent on viral genome replication, although the mechanisms and regulation of this process are largely unknown. Here, we identified factors that physically and functionally associate with the late gene transcription complex and unexpectedly found that the viral DNA packaging motor in Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) contributes to late gene expression.

ALS is characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with multiple roles in post-transcriptional RNA processing. Recent studies have identified genetic interactions between TDP-43 and Ataxin-2, a polyglutamine (polyQ) RBP in which intermediate length polyQ expansions confer increased ALS risk. Here, we used live-cell confocal imaging, photobleaching and translation reporter assays to study the localization, transport dynamics and mRNA regulatory functions of TDP-43/Ataxin-2 in rodent primary cortical neurons. We show that Ataxin-2 polyQ expansions aberrantly sequester TDP-43 within ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates, and disrupt both its motility along the axon and liquid-like properties. Our data suggest that Ataxin-2 governs motility and translation of neuronal RNP condensates and that Ataxin-2 polyQ expansions fundamentally perturb spatial localization of mRNA and suppress local translation. Overall, these results indicate Ataxin-2 polyQ expansions have detrimental effects on stability, localization, and translation of transcripts critical for axonal and cytoskeletal integrity, particularly important for motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria must include elimination of quiescent  hypnozoite forms in the liver; however, the only FDA-approved treatments are contraindicated in many vulnerable populations. To identify new drugs and drug targets, we screened the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem library against P. vivax liver stages and identified the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors hydralazine and cadralazine as active against hypnozoites. We then used bisulfite sequencing and immunostaining to identify cytosine modifications in the infectious stage (sporozoites) and liver stages, respectively. A subsequent screen of epigenetic inhibitors revealed hypnozoites are broadly sensitive to histone acetyltransferase and methyltransferase inhibitors, indicating that several epigenetic mechanisms are likely modulating hypnozoite persistence. Our data present an avenue for the discovery and development of improved radical cure antimalarials.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA drug repurposing screen reveals antihypertension drugs are active against P. vivax hypnozoites and epigenetic mechanisms play a role in hypnozoite quiescence.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy plays a critical role in the physiology and pathophysiology of hepatocytes. High levels of homocysteine (Hcy) promote autophagy in hepatocytes, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Here, we investigated the relation between Hcy increased autophagy levels and the expression of nuclear transcription factor EB (TFEB). We demonstrate that Hcy increased autophagy levels is mediated by upregulation of TFEB. Silencing TFEB decreases the autophagy-related protein LC3BII/I and increases p62 expression levels in hepatocytes after exposure to Hcy. Moreover, the effect of Hcy on the expression of TFEB is regulated by hypomethylation of TFEB promoter catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b). In summary, this study shows that Hcy can activate autophagy by inhibiting DNMT3b-mediated DNA methylation and upregulating TFEB expression. These findings provide another new mechanism for Hcy-induced autophagy in hepatocytes.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics target key biological processes that include protein synthesis. Bacteria respond by developing resistance, which increases rapidly due to antibiotics overuse. Mupirocin, a clinically used natural antibiotic, inhibits isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), an enzyme that links isoleucine to its tRNAIle for protein synthesis. Two IleRSs, mupirocin-sensitive IleRS1 and resistant IleRS2, coexist in bacteria. The latter may also be found in resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates. Here, we describe the structural basis of mupirocin resistance and unravel a mechanism of hyper-resistance evolved by some IleRS2 proteins. We surprisingly find that an up to 103-fold increase in resistance originates from alteration of the HIGH motif, a signature motif of the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to which IleRSs belong. The structural analysis demonstrates how an altered HIGH motif could be adopted in IleRS2 but not IleRS1, providing insight into an elegant mechanism for coevolution of the key catalytic motif and associated antibiotic resistance.",

Fluorogenic dyes are crucial to reach intracellular targets and label them with high specificity. Excellent fluorogenic rhodamine dyes have been reported, but they often require a long and low-yielding synthesis and are spectrally limited to the visible range. Here, we present a general strategy to transform polymethine compounds into fluorogenic dyes using an intramolecular ring closure approach. We illustrate the generality of this method by creating both spontaneously blinking and no-wash, turn-on polymethine dyes with emissions across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. These probes are compatible with self-labeling proteins and small-molecule targeting ligands and can be combined with rhodamine-based dyes for multicolor and fluorescence lifetime multiplexing imaging. This strategy provides access to bright, fluorogenic dyes that emit at wavelengths that are significantly more red-shifted than those of existing rhodamine-based dyes.",

    "abstract": "Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is an essential process for gene expression in eukaryotes catalyzed by the spliceosome in two transesterification steps. The spliceosome is a large, highly dynamic complex composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs and dozens of proteins, some of which are needed throughout the splicing reaction while others only act during specific stages. The human protein FAM192A was recently proposed to be a splicing factor that functions during the second transesterification step, exon ligation, based on analysis of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density. It was also proposed that Fyv6 might be the functional S. cerevisiae homolog of FAM192A; however, no biochemical or genetic data has been reported to support this hypothesis. Herein, we show that Fyv6 is a splicing factor and acts during exon ligation. Deletion of FYV6 results in genetic interactions with the essential splicing factors Prp8, Prp16, and Prp22; decreases splicing in vivo of reporter genes harboring intron substitutions that limit the rate of exon ligation; and changes 3 splice site (SS) selection. Together, these data suggest that Fyv6 is a component of the spliceosome and the potential functional and structural homolog of human FAM192A.",

Axon growth, glial bridging and adult neurogenesis are hallmarks of cellular regeneration during spinal cord repair. However, the correlation between these cellular regenerative processes and functional recovery remains to be elucidated. Whereas the majority of established functional regeneration metrics measure swim capacity, we hypothesize that gait quality is more directly related to neurological health. Here, we performed a longitudinal swim tracking study for sixty individual zebrafish spanning eight weeks of spinal cord regeneration. Multiple swim parameters as well as axonal and glial bridging were integrated. We established rostral compensation as a new gait quality metric that highly correlates with functional recovery. Tensor component analysis of longitudinal data supports a correspondence between functional recovery trajectories and neurological outcomes. Moreover, our studies predicted and validated that a subset of functional regeneration parameters measured 1 to 2 weeks post-injury is sufficient to predict the regenerative outcomes of individual animals at 8 weeks post-injury. Our findings established new functional regeneration parameters and generated a comprehensive correlative database between various functional and cellular regeneration outputs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOpioid use disorder is associated with enduring psychological withdrawal symptoms believed to contribute to drug abuse. Amongst these are shifts in motivational states, wherein pursuit of drug consumption exceeds that of non-drug rewards, reinforcing escalated opioid use and relapse vulnerability. A critical regulator of behavioral reinforcement, the mesoaccumbal dopamine (DA) system is thought to be both necessary and sufficient for opioid motivation. However, previous research into its involvement in opioid withdrawal has been limited to acute vs protracted timepoints, global neuroadaptations vs those in subcircuits, and overwhelmingly focused on males vs females.\n\nMethodsEvaluations of effort-based motivated behavior for both sucrose and morphine reward were combined with patch clamp electrophysiological assessments of synaptic plasticity within lateral vs medial DA neurons projecting to the lateral vs medial nucleus accumbens shell during protracted morphine withdrawal in male and female mice. Further effects of mesoaccumbal subcircuit inhibition on motivated behavior for sucrose were also measured.\n\nResultsProtracted morphine withdrawal was found to be associated with elevations in morphine seeking, intake, and motivation compared to saline controls in both sexes. Escalation of intake was paralleled by a male-exclusive reduction in motivation for the non-drug reward, sucrose. Male-exclusive neuroadaptations during protracted withdrawal were also found, with reductions in neuronal excitability and increased inhibitory (GABAAR-dependent) synaptic transmission found in lateral ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons projecting to the lateral nucleus accumbens shell, though not in medial DA projections to the medial shell. Finally, chemogenetic inhibition of the lateral but not medial subcircuit was found to significantly reduce motivated responding for sucrose in male morphine-naive mice.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that protracted opioid withdrawal is associated with a sex-independent increase in opioid consumption and motivation. They also suggest that male-specific reductions in motivation for non-drug reward during protracted withdrawal may be driven by a hypoactive state in a lateral mesoaccumbal DA subcircuit driven in part by increased inhibition of DA cells. These insights may be useful in development of therapies that temper withdrawal-associated psychological states predisposed towards prolonged and escalated opioid intake, a major treatment goal for OUD patients.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic virus infections are estimated to cause [~]15% of all cancers. Two prevalent human oncogenic viruses are members of the gammaherpesvirus family: Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and Kaposis Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). We use murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), which shares significant homology with KSHV and EBV, as a model system to study gammaherpesvirus lytic replication. Viruses implement distinct metabolic programs to support their life cycle, such as increasing the supply of lipids, amino acids, and nucleotide materials necessary to replicate. Our data define the global changes in the host cell metabolome and lipidome during gammaherpesvirus lytic replication. Our metabolomics analysis found that MHV-68 lytic infection induces glycolysis, glutaminolysis, lipid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. We additionally observed an increase in glutamine consumption and glutamine dehydrogenase protein expression. While both glucose and glutamine starvation of host cells decreased viral titers, glutamine starvation led to a greater loss in virion production. Our lipidomics analysis revealed a peak in triacylglycerides early during infection and an increase in free fatty acids and diacylglyceride later in the viral life cycle. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the protein expression of multiple lipogenic enzymes during infection. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibitors of glycolysis or lipogenesis resulted in decreased infectious virus production. Taken together, these results illustrate the global alterations in host cell metabolism during lytic gammaherpesvirus infection, establish essential pathways for viral production, and recommend targeted mechanisms to block viral spread and treat viral induced tumors.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses are intracellular parasites which lack their own metabolism, so they must hijack host cell metabolic machinery in order to increase the production of energy, proteins, fats, and genetic material necessary to replicate. Using murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) as a model system to understand how similar human gammaherpesviruses cause cancer, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur during lytic MHV-68 infection and replication. We found MHV-68 infection of host cells increases glucose, glutamine, lipid, and nucleotide metabolic pathways. We also showed inhibition or starvation of glucose, glutamine or lipid metabolic pathways results in an inhibition of virus production. Ultimately, targeting changes in host cell metabolism due to viral infection can be used to treat gammaherpesvirus induced cancers and infections in humans.",

Here, we report on cross-domain interactions in biofilms of streams draining proglacial floodplains in the Swiss Alps. These streams, as a consequence of the retreat of glaciers, are characterized by multiple environmental gradients and stability that depend on the time since deglaciation. We estimate co-occurrence of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities along this gradient and show that key community members have disproportionate effects on the stability of co-occurrence networks. The topology of the networks was similar independent of environmental gradients and stability. However, network stability was higher in the streams draining proglacial terrain that was more recently deglaciated. We find that both pro- and eukaryotes are central to the stability of these networks, which fragment upon the removal of both pro- and eukaryotic taxa. These  keyplayers are not always abundant, suggesting an underlying functional component to their contributions. Thus, we show that there is a key role played by individual taxa in determining microbial community stability of glacier-fed streams.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been associated with a variety of cancers. We previously identified miR-151a as a potential cell fitness-regulating microRNA using a miRNA-targeted CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen. In this study, we created mutant cell clones with loss of miR-151a expression and verified miR-151a mutations indeed decreased cell growth. In miR-151a mutant cells, there was an increase in the fraction of cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle. This increase in G1 cells corresponded to an increase in p53 (TP53) and p21 (CDKN1A) protein levels. Both strands of miR-151a could suppress p53; miR-151a-3p was able to directly suppress p53 expression, but the miR-151a-5p suppression of p53 apparently was indirect. Re-expression of miR-151a-5p in the mutant cells significantly decreased the p53 and p21 protein levels as well as the percentage of cells in G1, while re-expression of miR-151a-3p ironically had a modest effect. These results suggest that both the 5p and 3p strands as well as additional factors are involved in the regulation of p53/p21 and the cell cycle by miR-151a. We also analyzed the TCGA database and discovered that increased miR-151a expression occurs in many tumor types; furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between miR-151a and p21 expression, and high miR-151a expression was often associated with poor overall survival. Taken together, results from this study identify a previously underappreciated role of miR-151a in cancer through regulation of the cell cycle, and they also suggest inhibiting the less abundant 5p may be more important than inhibiting the more abundant 3p of miR-151a for therapeutic considerations.",

We exposed the orange-fleshed cultivar  Beauregard to 24 and 48 hours of heat and salt stresses to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leaves. Analysis revealed both shared and unique sets of up-regulated (650 for heat; 287 for salt) and down-regulated (1,249 for heat; 793 for salt) DEGs suggesting common, yet stress-specific transcriptional responses to these two abiotic stressors.

To identify shared and unique gene coexpression networks under multiple abiotic stress conditions, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed using gene expression profiles from heat, salt, and drought stress treated  Beauregard leaves yielding 18 coexpression modules.

    "abstract": "Microscopic filaments of the siphonous green algae Ostreobium (Ulvophyceae, Bryopsidales) colonize and dissolve the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral colonies, in shallow-water reef environments of contrasted salinities. Their bacterial composition and plasticity in response to salinity remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the bacteria associated with coral-isolated Ostreobium strains from two distinct rbcL lineages, representative of IndoPacific environmental phylotypes, that had been pre-acclimatized (>9months) to three ecologically-relevant reef salinities: 32.9, 35.1 and 40.2 psu. Bacterial phylotypes were visualized at filament scale by CARD-FISH in algal tissue sections, localized to the surface, within filaments or in the algal mucilage. Ostreobium-associated communities, characterized by bacterial 16S rRNA metabarcoding of cultured thalli and corresponding supernatants, were structured by host genotype more than salinity and partly overlapped with those of environmental (Ostreobium-colonized) coral skeletons. Alphaproteobacteria dominated the thalli communities, enriched in Kiloniellaceae or Rhodospirillaceae depending on algal genotype. A small core microbiota composed of 7 ASVs ([~]1.5% of thalli ASVs, 19%-36% cumulated proportions), shared by multiple cultures of both Ostreobium genotypes and persistent across 3 salinities, included putative intracellular Amoebophilus and Rickettsiales bacteria. This novel knowledge on the taxonomic diversity of Ostreobium bacterial associates paves the way to functional interaction studies within the coral holobiont.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative diseases that exist on a clinico-pathogenetic spectrum, designated ALS/FTD. The most common genetic cause of ALS/FTD is the expansion of the intronic hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC)n in C9orf72. Here, we investigated the formation of nucleic-acid secondary structures in these expansion repeats, and their role in generating condensates characteristic of the diseases. We observed significant aggregation of the hexanucleotide sequence (GGGGCC)n, which we associated to the formation of multimolecular G-quadruplexes (mG4s), using a range of biophysical techniques. Exposing the condensates to G4-unfolding conditions led to prompt disassembly, highlighting the key role of mG4-formation in the condensation process. We further validated the biological relevance of our findings by demonstrating the ability of a G4-selective fluorescent probe to penetrate C9orf72 mutant human motor neurons derived from ALS patients, which revealed clear fluorescent signal in putative condensates. Our findings strongly suggest that RNA G-rich repetitive sequences can form protein-free condensates sustained by multimolecular G-quadruplexes, highlighting their potential relevance as therapeutic targets for C9orf72 mutation related ALS and FTD.",

    "abstract": "Statistical analyses in high-dimensional omics data are often hampered by the presence of batch effects (BEs) and missing values (MVs), but the interaction between these two issues is not well-studied nor understood. MVs may manifest as a BE when their proportions differ across batches. These are termed as Batch-Effect Associated Missing values (BEAMs). We hypothesized that BEAMs in data may introduce bias which can impede the performance of missing value imputation (MVI). To test this, we simulated data with two batches, then introduced over 100 iterations, either 20% and 40% MVs in each batch (BEAMs) or 30% in both (control). K-nearest neighbours (KNN) was then used to perform MVI, in a typical global approach (M1) and a supposed superior batch-sensitized approach (M2). BEs were then corrected using ComBat. The effectiveness of the MVI was evaluated by its imputation accuracy and true and false positive rates. Notably, when BEAMs existed, M2 was generally undesirable as the differing application of MV filtering in M1 and M2 strategies resulted in an overall coverage deficiency. Additionally, both M1 and M2 strategies suffered in the presence of BEAMs, highlighting the need for a novel approach to handle MVI in data with BEAMs.\n\nAuthor summaryData in high-throughput omics data are often combined from different sources (batches), which creates batch effects in the data. Missing values are a common occurrence in these data, and their proportions are assumed to be equal across batches. However, instances exist when these proportions vary between batches, such as one batch having more missing values than another, resulting in batch effect associated missing values. Missing values are often dealt with through missing value imputation, but whether the variation in missing value proportions across batches affects imputation outcomes is unknown. In this paper, we investigate the consequence of performing imputation when this issue persists. We simulated data with equal and unequal missing value proportions, then assessed the performance of k-nearest neighbours imputation by its imputation accuracy and downstream analysis outcomes. This revealed that unequal missing value proportions worsens imputation and establishes the need for smarter imputation strategies to handle this complication.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of aneuploidy have traditionally been studied in cell and animal models in which the extrachromosomal DNA is from the same species. Here, we explore a fundamental question concerning the impact of aneuploidy on systemic metabolism using a non-mosaic transchromosomic mouse model (TcMAC21) carrying a near complete human chromosome 21. Independent of diets and housing temperatures, TcMAC21 mice consume more calories, are hyperactive and hypermetabolic, remain consistently lean and profoundly insulin sensitive, and have a higher body temperature. The hypermetabolism and elevated thermogenesis are due to sarcolipin overexpression in the skeletal muscle, resulting in futile sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) activity and energy dissipation. Mitochondrial respiration is also markedly increased in skeletal muscle to meet the high ATP demand created by the futile cycle. This serendipitous discovery provides proof-of-concept that sarcolipin-mediated thermogenesis via uncoupling of the SERCA pump can be harnessed to promote energy expenditure and metabolic health.",

Organisms across the tree of life evolved a variety of natural sunscreens to prevent UVR-induced cellular damage and stress. However, in vertebrates, only melanin is known to act as a sunscreen. Here we demonstrate that gadusol, a transparent compound discovered over 40 years ago in fish eggs, is a maternally provided sunscreen required for survival of embryonic and larval zebrafish exposed to UVR. Mutating an enzyme involved in gadusol biosynthesis increases the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, a hallmark of UVB-induced DNA damage. Compared to the contributions of melanin and the chorion, gadusol is the primary sunscreening mechanism in embryonic and larval fish. The gadusol biosynthetic pathway is retained in the vast majority of teleost genomes but is repeatedly lost in species whose young are no longer exposed to UVR. Our data demonstrate that gadusol is a maternally provided sunscreen that is critical for early-life survival in the most species-rich branch of the vertebrate phylogeny.",

Despite the potential consequences for metapopulation persistence, we still largely lack understanding of what makes one species more likely to be synchronized than another given the same environmental conditions.\nC_LIO_LIGenerally, environmental conditions on a shared environment or a species sensitivity to the environment can explain the extent of synchrony. Populations that are closer together experience more similar fluctuations in their environments than those populations that are further apart and are therefore more synchronized. The relative importance of environmental and demographic stochasticity for population dynamics is strongly linked to species life history traits, such as pace of life, why may impact population synchrony. For populations that migrate, there may be multiple environmental conditions at different locations driving synchrony. However, the importance of life history and migration strategies in determining patterns of spatial population synchrony have rarely been explored empirically. We therefore hypothesize that generation time, a proxy for pace of life, and migration play an important role in determining spatial population synchrony.\nC_LIO_LIWe used population abundance data on breeding birds from four countries to investigate patterns of spatial population synchrony in growth rate and abundance. We investigated differences in synchrony across a gradient of generation times in resident, short-distance migrant, and long-distance migrant bird species.\nC_LIO_LISpecies with shorter generation times were more synchronized than species with longer generation times. Short-distance migrants were more synchronized than long-distance migrants and resident birds.\nC_LIO_LIOur results provide novel empirical links between spatial population synchrony and species traits known to be of key importance for population dynamics, generation time and migration characteristics. We show how these different mechanisms can be combined to understand species-specific causes of spatial population synchrony. Understanding these specific drivers of spatial population synchrony is important in the face of increasingly severe threats to biodiversity and could be key for successful future conservation outcomes.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Since the pioneering work of Dobzhansky in the 1930s and 1940s, many chromosomal inversions have been identified but how they contribute to adaptation remains poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, the widespread inversion polymorphism In(3R)Payne underpins latitudinal clines in fitness traits on multiple continents. Here, we use single-individual whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics and published sequencing data to study the population genomics of this inversion on four continents: in its ancestral African range and in derived populations in Europe, North America, and Australia. Our results confirm that this inversion originated in sub-Saharan Africa and subsequently became cosmopolitan; we observe marked monophyletic divergence of inverted and non-inverted karyotypes, with some substructure among inverted chromosomes between continents. Despite divergent evolution of this inversion since its out-of-Africa migration, derived non-African populations exhibit similar patterns of long-range linkage disequilibrium between the inversion breakpoints and major peaks of divergence in its center, consistent with balancing selection and suggesting that the inversion harbors alleles that are maintained by selection on several continents. Using RNA-seq we identify overlap between inversion-linked SNPs and loci that are differentially expressed between inverted and non-inverted chromosomes. Expression levels are higher for inverted chromosomes at low temperature, suggesting loss of buffering or compensatory plasticity and consistent with higher inversion frequency in warm climates. Our results suggest that this ancestrally tropical balanced polymorphism spread around the world and became latitudinally assorted along similar but independent climatic gradients, always being frequent in subtropical/tropical areas but rare or absent in temperate climates.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the population genetic processes driving the evolution of plant pathogens is of central interest to plant pathologists and evolutionary biologists alike. However, most studies focus on host-pathogen associations in agricultural systems of high genetic and environmental homogeneity and less is known about the genetic structure of pathogen populations infecting wild plants in natural ecosystems. We performed parallel population sampling of two pathogenic Epichloe species occurring sympatrically on different host grasses in natural and seminatural grasslands in Europe: E. typhina infecting Dactylis glomerata and E. clarkii infecting Holcus lanatus. We sequenced 422 haploid isolates and generated genome-wide SNP datasets to investigate genetic diversity and population structure. In both species geographically separated populations formed genetically distinct groups, however population separation was less distinct in E. typhina compared to E. clarkii. The patterns of among population admixture also differed between species across the same geographic range: we found higher levels of population genetic differentiation and a stronger effect of isolation by distance in E. clarkii compared to E. typhina, consistent with lower levels of gene flow in the former. This pattern may be explained by the different dispersal abilities of the two pathogens and is expected to be influenced by the genetic structure of host populations. In addition, genetic diversity was higher in E. typhina populations compared to E. clarkii, indicative of higher effective population size in E. typhina. These results suggest that the effect of genetic drift and the efficacy of selection may differ in the two species. Our study provides evidence of how ecologically similar species occupying the same geographical space can experience different evolutionary contexts, which could influence local adaptation and coevolutionary dynamics of these fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Fins are major functional appendages of fish that have been repeatedly modified in different lineages. To search for genomic changes underlying natural fin diversity, we compared the genomes of 36 wild fish species that either have complete or reduced pelvic and caudal fins. We identify 1,614 genomic regions that are well-conserved in fin-complete species but missing from multiple fin-reduced lineages. Recurrent deletions of conserved sequences (CONDELs) in wild fin-reduced species are enriched for functions related to appendage development, suggesting that convergent fin reduction at the organismal level is associated with repeated genomic deletions near fin-appendage development genes. We used sequencing and functional enhancer assays to confirm that PelA, a Pitx1 enhancer previously linked to recurrent pelvic loss in sticklebacks, has also been independently deleted and may have contributed to the fin morphology in distantly related pelvic-reduced species. We also identify a novel enhancer that is conserved in the majority of percomorphs, drives caudal fin expression in transgenic stickleback, is missing in tetraodontiform, syngnathid, and synbranchid species with caudal fin reduction, and which alters caudal fin development when targeted by genome editing. Our study illustrates a general strategy for mapping phenotypes to genotypes across a tree of vertebrate species, and highlights notable new examples of regulatory genomic hotspots that have been used to evolve recurrent phenotypes during 100 million years of fish evolution.",

Here we provide evidence of pitch-size correspondence in a reptile, the tortoise Testudo hermanni. Tortoises showed a spontaneous preference to associate a small disc (i.e., visual information about size) to a high pitch sound (i.e., auditory information), and a larger disc to a low pitch sound.

    "abstract": "BackgroundFighting disease while fighting rivals exposes males to constraints and tradeoffs during male-male competition. We here tested how both the stage and intensity of infection with the fungal pathogen Metarhizium robertsii interfered with fighting success in Cardiocondyla obscurior ant males. Males of this species have evolved long lifespans during which they can gain many matings with the young queens of the colony, if successful in male-male competition. Since male fights occur inside the colony, the outcome of male-male competition can further be biased by interference of the colonys worker force.\n\nResultsWe found that severe, but not yet mild, infection strongly impaired male fighting success. In late-stage infection, this could be attributed to worker aggression directed towards the infected rather than the healthy male and an already very high male morbidity even in the absence of fighting. Shortly after pathogen exposure, however, male mortality was particularly increased during combat. Since these males mounted a strong immune response, their reduced fighting success suggests a trade-off between immune investment and competitive ability already early in the infection. Even if the males themselves showed no difference in the number of attacks they raised against their healthy rivals across infection stages and levels, severely infected males were thus losing in male-male competition from an early stage of infection on.\n\nConclusionsMales of the ant C. obscurior have evolved high immune investment, triggering an effective immune response very fast after fungal exposure. This allows them to cope with mild pathogen exposures without cost to their success in male-male competition, and hence to gain multiple mating opportunities with the emerging virgin queens of the colony. Under severe infection, however, they are weak fighters and rarely survive a combat already at early infection when raising an immune response, as well as at progressed infection, when they are morbid and preferentially targeted by worker aggression. Workers thereby remove males that pose a future disease threat by biasing male-male competition. Our study thus revealed a novel social immunity mechanism how social insect workers protect the colony against disease risk.",
