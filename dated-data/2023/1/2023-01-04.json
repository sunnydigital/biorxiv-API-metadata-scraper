    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models are successfully used to address massive text-related tasks. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism and its analysis provides valuable insights into gene regulation and biomarker identification. Several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to identify DNA methylation and each seeks to strike a balance between computational effort and accuracy. Here, we introduce MuLan-Methyl, a deep-learning framework for predicting DNA methylation sites, which is based on five popular transformer-based language models. The framework identifies methylation sites for three different types of DNA methylation, namely N6-adenine, N4-cytosine, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Each of the employed language models is adapted to the task using the \"pre-train and fine-tune\" paradigm. Pre-training is performed on a custom corpus of DNA fragments and taxonomy lineages using self-supervised learning. Fine-tuning aims at predicting the DNA-methylation status of each type. The five models are used to collectively predict the DNA methylation status. We report excellent performance of MuLan-Methyl on a benchmark dataset. Moreover, we argue that the model captures characteristic differences between different species that are relevant for methylation. This work demonstrates that language models can be successfully adapted to applications in biological sequence analysis and that joint utilization of different language models improves model performance. Mulan-Methyl is open source and we provide a web server that implements the approach.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMuLan-Methyl aims at identifying three types of DNA-methylation sites.\nC_LIO_LIIt uses an ensemble of five transformer-based language models, which were pre-trained and fine-tuned on a custom corpus.\nC_LIO_LIThe self-attention mechanism of transformers give rise to importance scores, which can be used to extract motifs.\nC_LIO_LIThe method performs favorably in comparison to existing methods.\nC_LIO_LIThe implementation can be applied to chromosomal sequences to predict methylation sites.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have allowed for the mapping of tissue heterogeneity, but this technique lacks the resolution to investigate gene expression patterns, cell-cell communications and tissue organization at the single-cell resolution. ST data contains a mixed transcriptome from multiple heterogeneous cells, and current methods predict two-dimensional (2D) coordinates for individual cells within a predetermined space, making it difficult to reconstruct and study three-dimensional (3D) tissue organization. Here we present a new computational method called scHolography that uses deep learning to map single-cell transcriptome data to 3D space. Unlike existing methods, which generate a projection between transcriptome data and 2D spatial coordinates, scHolography uses neural networks to create a high-dimensional transcriptome-to-space map that preserves the distance information between cells, allowing for the construction of a cell-cell proximity matrix beyond the 2D ST scaffold. Furthermore, the neighboring cell profile of a given cell type can be extracted to study spatial cell heterogeneity. We apply scHolography to human skin, human skin cancer and mouse brain datasets, providing new insights into gene expression patterns, cell-cell interactions and spatial microenvironment. Together, scHolography offers a computational solution for digitizing transcriptome and spatial information into high-dimensional data for neural network-based mapping and the reconstruction of 3D tissue organization at the single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "The advance of science rests on a robust peer review process. However whether or not a paper is accepted can depend on random external factors--e.g. the timing of the submission, the matching of editors and reviewers--that are beyond the quality of the work. This article systematically investigates the impact of these random factors independent of the papers quality on peer review outcomes in a major biomedical journal, eLife. We analyzed all of the submissions to eLife between 2016 to 2018, with 23,190 total submissions. We examined the effects of random factors at each decision point in the review process, from the gatekeeping senior editors who may desk-reject papers to review editors and reviewers who recommend the final outcome. Our results suggest that the peer-review process in eLife is robust overall and that random external factors have relatively little quantifiable bias.",

    "abstract": "Caspases are evolutionarily conserved cysteinyl proteases that are integral in cell development and apoptosis. All apoptotic caspases evolved from a common ancestor into two distinct subfamilies with either monomeric (initiators) or dimeric (effectors) oligomeric states. The regulation of apoptosis is influenced by the activation mechanism of the two subfamilies, but the evolution of the well-conserved caspase-hemoglobinase fold into the two subfamilies is not well understood. We examined the folding landscape of monomeric caspases from two coral species over a broad pH range of 3 to 10.5. On an evolutionary timescale, the two coral caspases diverged from each other approximately 300 million years ago, and they diverged from human caspases about 600 million years ago. Our results indicate that both proteins have overall high stability, [~] 15 kcal mol-1 near the physiological pH range (pH 6 to pH 8), and unfold via two partially folded intermediates, I1 and I2, that are in equilibrium with the native and the unfolded state. Like the dimeric caspases, the monomeric coral caspases undergo a pH-dependent conformational change resulting from the titration of an evolutionarily conserved site. Data from molecular dynamics simulations paired with limited proteolysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry show that the small subunit of the monomeric caspases is unstable and unfolds prior to the large subunit. Overall, the data suggest that all caspases share a conserved folding landscape, that a conserved allosteric site can be fine-tuned for species-specific regulation, and that the subfamily of stable dimers may have evolved to stabilize the small subunit.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation-associated protein (Aap) is the primary determinant of Staphylococcus epidermidis device-related infections. The B-repeat superdomain is responsible for intercellular adhesion that leads to the development of biofilms occurring in such infections. It was recently demonstrated that Zn-induced B-repeat assembly leads to formation of functional amyloid fibrils, which offer strength and stability to the biofilm. Rigorous biophysical studies of Aap B-repeats from S. epidermidis strain RP62A revealed Zn-induced assembly into a stable, reversible dimer and tetramer, prior to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Genetic manipulation is not tractable for many S. epidermidis strains, including RP62A; instead, many genetic studies have used strain 1457. Therefore, to better connect findings from biophysical and structural studies of B-repeats to in vivo studies, the B-repeat superdomain from strain 1457 was examined. Differences between the B-repeats from strain RP62A and 1457 include the number of B-repeats, which has been shown to play a critical role in assembly into amyloid fibrils, as well as the distribution of consensus and variant B-repeat subtypes, which differ in assembly competency and thermal stability. Detailed investigation of the Zn-induced assembly of the full B-repeat supderdomain from strain 1457 was conducted using analytical ultracentrifugation. Whereas the previous construct from RP62A (Brpt5.5) formed a stable tetramer prior to aggregation, Brpt6.5 from 1457 forms extremely large stable species on the order of 28- and 32-mers, prior to aggregation into similar amyloid fibrils. Importantly, both assembly pathways proceed through the same mechanism of dimerization and tetramerization, and both conclude with the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. Theoretical discussions of the energy landscape of B-repeats from different strains and of different length are provided with considerations of biological implications.\n\nStatement of SignificanceStaphylococcus epidermidis is a major pathogen responsible for device-related infections. The primary factor responsible for such infections is the accumulation-associated protein, Aap, through its ability to mediate formation of dense surface-adherent communities of bacteria known as biofilms. Our lab recently demonstrated that the B-repeat superdomain of Aap from strain RP62A undergoes Zn-dependent assembly to form functional amyloid fibrils that improve the strength and resilience of biofilms in vitro. These amyloid fibrils may be responsible for the difficulty in treating device-related infections. However, strain 1457 is commonly used for genetic manipulation. In this manuscript, the Zn-dependent assembly of B-repeats from strain 1457 is shown to lead to the same outcome of amyloidogenesis, although it occurs through different intermediate oligomeric states.",

    "abstract": "Membrane wetting by biomolecular condensates recently emerged as a key phenomenon in cell biology, playing an important role in a diverse range of processes across different organisms. However, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind condensate formation and interaction with lipid membranes is still missing. To study this, we exploited the properties of the dyes ACDAN and LAURDAN as nano-environmental sensors in combination with phasor analysis of hyperspectral and lifetime imaging microscopy. Using glycinin as a model condensate-forming protein and giant vesicles as model membranes, we obtained vital information on the process of condensate formation and membrane wetting. Our results reveal that glycinin condensates display differences in water dynamics when changing the salinity of the medium as a consequence of rearrangements in the secondary structure of the protein. Remarkably, analysis of membrane-condensates interaction with protein as well as polymer condensates indicated a correlation between increased wetting affinity and enhanced lipid packing. This is demonstrated by a decrease in the dipolar relaxation of water across all membrane-condensate systems, suggesting a general mechanism to tune membrane packing by condensate wetting.",

It may present little or no symptoms at the early stages, and typically unspecific symptoms at later stages. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the subtype responsible for most ovarian cancer deaths. However, very little is known about the metabolic course of this disease, particularly in its early stages. In this longitudinal study, we examined the temporal course of serum lipidome changes using a robust HGSC mouse model and machine learning data analysis. Early progression of HGSC was marked by increased levels of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines. In contrast, later stages featured more diverse lipids alterations, including fatty acids and their derivatives, triglycerides, ceramides, hexosylceramides, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylinositols. These alterations underscored unique perturbations in cell membrane stability, proliferation, and survival during cancer development and progression, offering potential targets for early detection and prognosis of human ovarian cancer.\n\nTeaserTime-resolved lipidome remodeling in an ovarian cancer model is studied through lipidomics and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Low temperatures associated with winter can limit the survival of organisms, especially ectotherms whose body temperature is similar to their environment. Important adaptations for overwintering such as cold hardiness and diapause have been well-explored in many insect taxa. However, there is a gap in understanding how overwintering may vary among groups of species that interact closely, such as multiple parasitoid species that attack the same host insect. Our study investigated cold tolerance and diapause phenotypes in three endoparasitoid wasps of the apple maggot fly Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae): Utetes canaliculatus, Diachasma alloeum, and Diachasmimorpha mellea (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Using a combination of respirometry and eclosion tracking, we detected diapause phenotypes in all three wasp species, remarkably similar to the fly host. Weak diapause was rare (< 5%) in all three wasp species, and while most D. mellea (93%) entered prolonged diapause under warm conditions, the majority of U. canaliculatus (92%) and D. alloeum (72%) averted diapause (non-diapause). There was limited interspecific variation in acute cold tolerance among the three wasp species: wasps and flies had similarly high survival (>87%) following exposure to extreme low temperatures (- 20{degrees}C) as long as their body fluids did not freeze. The wasp species showed little interspecific variation in survival following prolonged exposure to mild chilling of 8 or more weeks at 4{degrees}C. This study shows remarkable conservation of cold tolerance and diapause phenotypes within and across trophic levels. The interaction between diapause phenotype and cold hardiness in these parasitoids is an interesting direction for future research.\n\nGraphical Abstract and Highlights\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522725v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@826a3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c3963org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8baa33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1530d03_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG O_LIThe apple maggot fly and its parasitoids exhibit the same three diapause phenotypes\nC_LIO_LIEach parasitoid wasp species exhibits different proportions of these phenotypes\nC_LIO_LIUtetes canaliculatus and Diachasma alloeum are freeze-avoidant, like their host fly\nC_LIO_LIThese wasps and flies survive to similarly extreme low temperatures (c. -20{degrees}C)\nC_LIO_LIEach wasp species survives prolonged exposure to mild chilling (4{degrees}C) similarly well\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin triggers root growth inhibition within seconds via a non-transcriptional pathway. Among members of the TIR1/AFBs auxin receptor family, AFB1 has a primary role in this rapid response. However, the unique features that confer this specific function have not been identified. Here we show that the N-terminal region of AFB1, including the F-box domain and residues that contribute to auxin binding, are essential and sufficient for its specific role in the rapid response. Substitution of the N-terminal region of AFB1 with that of TIR1 disrupts its distinct cytoplasm-enriched localization and activity in rapid root growth inhibition. Importantly, the N-terminal region of AFB1 is indispensable for auxin-triggered calcium influx which is a prerequisite for rapid root growth inhibition. Furthermore, AFB1 negatively regulates lateral root formation and transcription of auxin-induced genes, suggesting that it plays an inhibitory role in canonical auxin signaling. These results suggest that AFB1 may buffer the transcriptional auxin response while it regulates rapid changes in cell growth that contribute to root gravitropism.",

    "abstract": "To survive in a complex environment, animals must respond to external cues, e.g., to escape threats or to navigate towards favorable locations. Navigating requires transition between motor states, e.g. switching from forward to backward movement. Here, we investigated how two classes of interneurons, RIS and RIM, fine-tune this transition in the nematode C. elegans. By Ca2+ imaging in freely moving animals, we found that RIS gets active slightly before RIM and likely biases decision-making towards a reversal. In animals lacking RIS, we observed lowered Ca2+-levels in RIM prior to a reversal. Combined photo-stimulation and voltage imaging revealed that FLP-11, a neuropeptide released by RIS, has an excitatory effect on RIM, while tyramine, released from RIM, inhibits RIS. Voltage imaging of intrinsic activity provided evidence for tight electrical coupling between RIS and RIM via gap junctions harboring UNC-7 innexins. Asymmetric junctional current flow was observed from RIS to RIM, and vice versa. We propose that the interplay of RIS and RIM is based on concerted electrical and chemical signaling, with a fast junctional current exchange early during the transition from forward to backward movement, followed by chemical signaling, likely during reversal execution.",

    "abstract": "T cell activation induces a metabolic switch generating energy required for proliferation, survival, and fueling their functions. Thus, it is essential to monitor metabolism associated to subcellular functional and structural changes. We used non-invasive label-free two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy (2P-FLIM) to map the spatial and temporal dynamics of the metabolic NADH co-enzyme during T lymphocyte activation. 2P-FLIM measurements of the protein-bound and free NADH ratios provides a readout of the redox state (NAD+/ NADH) of the cells, and thus of their OXPHOS and glycolysis rates. Using this method, we followed the dynamics of fraction of bound NADH (fb NADH) in live single cells. Comparing fb NADH between resting and activated T cells, we show that T cell activation induces a rapid switch toward glycolysis. The switch takes only 10 minutes and remains stable for at least one hour. Three-dimensional (3D) analysis revealed that the intracellular distribution of fb NADH is symmetrically distributed in resting cells, whereas increases at the contact zone in activated cells. Finally, we show that fb NADH negatively correlates with spreading of activated T cells, suggesting a link between actin remodeling and metabolic changes. This study shows that 2P-FLIM measurement of fb NADH is well suited to follow a fast metabolic switch in 3D, in single T lymphocytes with subcellular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Drugs that target the innate immune sensor STING are known to be effective in modulating the immune infiltrate of the tumour microenvironment. STING agonists have potential to enhance responses to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, however, their ability to influence and shape adaptive immune responses is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of a range of synthetic STING agonists on antigen specific CD8+ T-cell responses to soluble antigen using the murine OT-1 adoptive transfer model with Ovalbumin as the antigen to monitor T cell responses. Our data demonstrate that synthetic STING agonists are able to stimulate antigen specific T-cell expansion in response to challenge in mice. This effect required expression of STING, an intact myeloid compartment and Type-I IFN and TNF signalling. Expanded T-cells post treatment differed from those induced by the established immune adjuvant, anti-CD40 antibody through lower induction of the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1. Furthermore, our data revealed a marked increase in the induction and persistence of CD8+ central memory cells after STING agonist and antigen challenge. Finally, we demonstrate that following rechallenge, STING agonism produced larger secondary responses that could be translated into enhanced tumour protection and survival. Therefore, synthetic STING agonists are capable of acting as potent immune adjuvants and can induce robust memory formation leading to better recall and tumour control. Critically, these benefits along with the lower expression of PD-1, have implications for their use as adjuvants for multiple immunotherapy and vaccine applications.",

    "abstract": "The effect of plasma activated water (PAW) generated with a dielectric barrier discharge diffusor (DBDD) system on microbial load and organoleptic quality of cucamelons was investigated and compared to the established sanitizer, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Pathogenic serotypes of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes were inoculated onto the surface of cucamelons (6.5 log CFU g-1) and into the wash water (6 log CFU mL-1). PAW treatment involved 2 minutes in situ with water activated at 1500 Hz and 120 V, and air as the feed gas; NaOCl treatment was a wash with 100 ppm total chlorine; and the control treatment was a wash with tap water. PAW treatment produced a 3 log CFU g-1 reduction of pathogens on the cucamelon surface without negatively impacting quality or shelf life. NaOCl treatment reduced the pathogenic bacteria on the cucamelon surface by 3-4 log CFU g-1, however, this treatment also reduced fruit shelf life and quality. Both systems reduced 6 log CFU ml-1 pathogens in the wash water to below detectable limits. The critical role of superoxide anion radical ({middle dot}O2-) in the antimicrobial power of DBDD-PAW was demonstrated through a scavenger assay, and chemistry modelling confirmed that {middle dot}O2- generation readily occurs in DBDD-PAW generated with the employed settings. Modelling of the physical forces produced during plasma treatment showed that bacteria likely experience strong local electric fields and polarization. We hypothesize that these physical effects synergise with reactive chemical species to produce the acute antimicrobial activity seen with the in situ PAW system.\n\nImportancePlasma activated water (PAW) is an emerging sanitizer in the fresh food industry, where food safety must be achieved without a thermal kill step. Here we demonstrate PAW generated in situ to be a competitive sanitizer technology, providing a significant reduction of pathogenic and spoilage micro-organisms while maintaining the quality and shelf life of the produce item. Our experimental results are supported by modelling of the plasma chemistry and applied physical forces, which show that the system can generate highly reactive superoxide radicals and strong electric fields that combine to produce potent antimicrobial power. In situ PAW has promise in industrial applications as it only requires low power (12 W), tap water and air. Moreover, it does not produce toxic by-products or hazardous effluent waste, making it a sustainable solution for fresh food safety.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStreptococcus pneumoniae, a capsulated lancet gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity among children globally and is the primary cause of pneumonia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and the leading cause of nosocomial infections, among patients who are admitted to intensive care units. With the increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics, there is a shift of choice from allopathy to naturopathy, where herbs are common ingredients of medicines and components of treatment protocols. It is against this background that this study aimed to investigate the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae to ethanolic and aqueous extracts of ginger using the agar well diffusion technique.\n\nMethodologyAbsolute (95%) Ethanol and distilled water were used as solvents to make extracts from the ginger powder. The filtrate was dried, and the resulting substance was used to conduct antimicrobial tests on Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates using the agar well diffusion technique. The diameters of inhibition zones were measured, and statistical analysis was done by one-way ANOVA. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were determined by serial dilution.\n\nFreshly prepared sterile distilled water was used as negative control and ciprofloxacin (5 g/disk), an antibiotic was used as positive control.\n\nResultsThe test organisms were sensitive to both ethanolic and aqueous extracts of ginger. However, this was highly dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. The ethanolic extract had lower Minimum Inhibitory and Bactericidal Concentrations than aqueous extract on both bacterial species and at a concentration of 2g/ml, the ethanolic extract was 2-fold and 1.6-fold more effective in inhibiting the growth of P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae respectively than aqueous extract.\n\nConclusionWith the high susceptibility of the tested bacterial isolates to the ginger extracts used in this study, it is evident that ginger extracts can serve as a suitable antibiotic. However, further studies need to be conducted on the antimicrobial effects of ginger extracts on other bacterial species.",

The colony forming unit (CFU) assay has remained the gold standard to measure viability across disciplines; however, it is time-intensive and resource-consuming. Herein, we describe the Geometric Viability Assay (GVA) that replicates CFU measurements over 6-orders of magnitude while reducing over 10-fold the time and consumables. GVA computes a samples viable cell count based on the distribution of embedded colonies growing inside a pipette tip. GVA is compatible with gram-positive and -negative planktonic bacteria, biofilms, and yeast. Laborious CFU experiments such as checkerboard assays, treatment time-courses, and drug screens against slow-growing cells are simplified by GVA. We therefore screened a drug library against exponential and stationary phase E. coli leading to the discovery of the ROS-mediated, bactericidal mechanism of diphenyliodonium. The ease and low cost of GVA evinces it can accelerate existing viability assays and enable measurements at previously impractical scales.",

    "abstract": "Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) is an emerging biomarker of psychobiological stress and disease which predicts mortality and is associated with various disease states. To evaluate the contribution of cf-mtDNA to health and disease states, standardized high-throughput procedures are needed to quantify cf-mtDNA in relevant biofluids. Here, we describe MitoQuicLy: Mitochondrial DNA Quantification in cell-free samples by Lysis. We demonstrate high agreement between MitoQuicLy and the commonly used column-based method, although MitoQuicLy is faster, cheaper, and requires a smaller input sample volume. Using 10 {micro}L of input volume with MitoQuicLy, we quantify cf-mtDNA levels from three commonly used plasma tube types, two serum tube types, and saliva. We detect, as expected, significant inter-individual differences in cf-mtDNA across different biofluids. However, cf-mtDNA levels between concurrently collected plasma, serum, and saliva from the same individual differ on average by up to two orders of magnitude and are poorly correlated with one another, pointing to different cf-mtDNA biology or regulation between commonly used biofluids in clinical and research settings. Moreover, in a small sample of healthy women and men (n=34), we show that blood and saliva cf-mtDNAs correlate with clinical biomarkers differently depending on the sample used. The biological divergences revealed between biofluids, together with the lysis-based, cost-effective, and scalable MitoQuicLy protocol for biofluid cf-mtDNA quantification, provide a foundation to examine the biological origin and significance of cf-mtDNA to human health.",

    "abstract": "The functions of proteins depend on their spatial and temporal distributions, which are not directly measured by static protein abundance. Under protein misfolding stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway remediates proteostasis in part by altering the turnover kinetics and spatial distribution of proteins, yet a global view of these spatiotemporal changes has yet to emerge and it is unknown how they affect different cellular compartments and pathways. Here we describe a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy and data analysis pipeline, named Simultaneous Proteome Localization and Turnover (SPLAT), to measure concurrently the changes in protein turnover and subcellular distribution in the same experiment. Investigating two common UPR models of thapsigargin and tunicamycin challenge, we find that the global suppression of protein synthesis during UPR is dependent on subcellular localization, with more severe slowdown in lysosome vs. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein turnover. Most candidate translocation events affect pre-existing proteins and likely involve vesicular transport across endomembrane fractions including an expansion of an ER-derived vesicle (ERV) compartment containing RNA binding proteins and stress response proteins. In parallel, we observed specific translocations involving only newly synthesized protein pools that are indicative of endomembrane stalling. The translocation of a subclass of cell surface proteins to the endomembrane including EGFR and ITGAV upon UPR affects only heavy labeled proteins, which suggest their internalization is driven by nascent protein trafficking rather than ligand dependent endocytosis. The approach described here may be broadly useful for inferring the coordinations between spatial and temporal proteome regulations in normal and stressed cells.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility plays an important role in shaping gene expression patterns across development and evolution; however, little is known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that influence chromatin configuration itself. Because cis and trans influences can both theoretically influence the accessibility of the epigenome, we sought to better characterize the role that both of these mechanisms play in altering chromatin accessibility in two closely related sea urchin species. Using hybrids of the two species, and adapting a statistical framework previously developed for the analysis of cis and trans influences on the transcriptome, we examined how these mechanisms shape the regulatory landscape at three important developmental stages, and compared our results to similar patterns in the transcriptome. We found extensive cis- and trans-based influences on evolutionary changes in chromatin, with cis effects slightly more numerous and larger in effect. Genetic mechanisms influencing gene expression and chromatin configuration are correlated, but differ in several important ways. Maternal influences also appear to have more of an effect on chromatin accessibility than on gene expression, persisting well past the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Furthermore, chromatin accessibility near GRN genes appears to be regulated differently than the rest of the epigenome, and indicates that trans factors may play an outsized role in the configuration of chromatin near these genes. Together, our results represent the first attempt to quantify cis and trans influences on evolutionary divergence in chromatin configuration in an outbred natural study system, and suggest that the regulation of chromatin is more genetically complex than was previously appreciated.",

Salicaceae (willows), we know little about the sources of differences in species diversity between the genera and of the phylogenetic conflict that often confounds estimating phylogenetic trees. Salix subgenera and sections, in particular, have been difficult to classify, with one recent attempt termed a  spectacular failure due to a speculated radiation of the subgenera Vetrix and Chamaetia. Here we use targeted sequence capture to understand the evolutionary history of this portion of the Salicaceae plant family. Our phylogenetic hypothesis was based on 787 gene regions and identified extensive phylogenetic conflict among genes. Our analysis supported some previously described subgeneric relationships and confirmed polyphyly of others. Using an fbranch analysis we identified several cases of hybridization in deep branches of the phylogeny, which likely contributed to discordance among gene trees. In addition, we identified a rapid increase in diversification rate near the origination of the Vetrix-Chamaetia clade in Salix. This region of the tree coincided with several nodes that lacked strong statistical support, indicating a possible increase in incomplete lineage sorting due to rapid diversification. The extraordinary level of both recent and ancient hybridization in both Populus and Salix have played important roles in the diversification and diversity in these two genera.\n\nSupplementary data files will be provided by request to matt.olson@ttu.edu",

    "abstract": "Nuclear pore proteins (Nups) prominently are among the few genes linked to speciation from hybrid incompatibility in Drosophila. It was previously found that neuronal wiring underlying the female post-mating response induced by male-derived sex-peptide requires channel Nup54 functionality. A hot spot for rapid evolution in the promoter of Nup54 suggests a critical role for regulatory elements at the onset of speciation. Systematic analysis of Nup coding and promoter regions using Drosophila phylogenomics reveals that polymorphism differences between closely related Drosophila species in Nup coding regions do not generally evolve rapidly. Consistent with findings for Nup54, additional channel Nups 58 and 62 promotors are also hotpots for rapid accumulation of insertions/deletions (indels). Examination of Nup upstream regions reveals that core nuclear pore complex gene promoters accumulate indels rapidly. Since changes in promoters can have dominant effects (effects which directly impact gene expression of associated genes), these results indicate an evolutionary mechanism driven by indel accumulation in core Nup promoters. Compensation of such deleterious changes could lead to altered neuronal wiring, rapid fixation of adaptive traits and subsequently the rise of new species. Hence, the nuclear pore complex may act as a nexus for species-specific changes via nucleo-cytoplasmic transport regulated gene expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFlavobacterium columnare is the pathogen agent of columnaris disease, a major emerging disease affecting rainbow trout aquaculture. Selective breeding using genomic selection has potential to achieve cumulative improvement of host resistance. However, genomic selection is expensive partly due to the cost of genotyping high numbers of animals using high-density SNP arrays. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of genomic selection for resistance to F. columnare using in silico low-density (LD) panels combined with imputation. After a natural outbreak of columnaris disease, 2,874 challenged fish and 469 fish from the parental generation (n=81 parents) were genotyped with 27,907 SNPs. The efficiency of genomic prediction using LD-panels was assessed for panels of 10 different densities, created in silico using two sampling methods, random and equally spaced. All LD-panels were also imputed to the full 28K HD-panel using the parental generation as the reference population, and genomic predictions were reevaluated. The potential of prioritizing SNPs showing association with resistance to F. columnare was also tested for the six lower densities.\n\nResultsSimilar results were obtained with random and equally spaced sampling of SNPs for accuracy of both imputation and genomic predictions. Using LD-panels of at least 3,000 makers or lower density panels (as low as 300 markers) combined with imputation resulted in comparable accuracy to the 28K HD-panel and 11% higher accuracy than pedigree-based predictions.\n\nConclusionsCompared to using the commercial HD-panel, LD-panels with imputation may provide a more affordable route to genomic prediction of breeding values, supporting wider adoption of genomic selection in aquaculture breeding programmes.",

    "abstract": "Holliday 4-way junctions are key to important biological DNA processes (insertion, recombination and repair) and are dynamic structures which adopt either open or closed conformations, with the open conformation being the biologically active form. Tetracationic metallo-supramolecular pillarplexes display aryl faces about a cylindrical core giving them an ideal structure to interact with the central cavities of open DNA junctions. Combining experimental studies and MD simulations we show that an Au pillarplex can bind DNA 4-way junctions (Holliday junctions) in their open form, a binding mode not accessed by synthetic agents before. The Au pillarplexes can bind designed 3-way junctions too but their large size leads them to open up and expand that junction, disrupting the base pairing which manifests in an increase in hydrodynamic size and a lower junction thermal stability. At high loading they re-arrange both 4-way and 3-way junctions into Y-shaped DNA forks to increase the available junction-like binding sites. The structurally related Ag pillarplexes show similar DNA junction binding behaviour, but a lower solution stability. This pillarplex binding contrasts with (but complements) that of the metallo-supramolecular cylinders, which prefer 3-way junctions and we show can rearrange 4-way junctions into 3-way junction structures. The pillarplexes ability to bind open 4-way junctions creates exciting possibilities to modulate and switch such structures in biology, as well as in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures where they are key interconnecting components. Studies in human cells, confirm that the pillarplexes do reach the nucleus, with antiproliferative activity at levels similar to those of cisplatin. The findings provide a new roadmap for targeting higher order junction structures using a metallo-supramolecular approach, as well as expanding the toolbox available to design bioactive junction-binders into organometallic chemistry.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=188 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522759v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10fac36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f32f9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb8d72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1433de5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We propose here a generalized tree structure to annotate ions to relationships to the original compound and infer neutral mass. An algorithm is presented to convert mass distance networks to this tree structure with high fidelity. This method is useful for both regular untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing experiments.

Current in vitro condensation studies provide insight into the physical properties of condensates, such as surface tension and diffusion. However, such studies lack the resolution needed for complex kinetic studies of multicomponent condensation. Here, we use a supported lipid bilayer platform in tandem with total internal reflection microscopy to observe the 2-dimensional movement of DNA and nucleosomes at the single-molecule resolution. This dimensional reduction from 3-dimensional studies allows us to observe the initial condensation events and dissolution of these early condensates in the presence of physiological condensing agents. Using polyamines, we observed that the initial condensation happens on a timescale of minutes while dissolution occurs within seconds upon charge inversion. Polyamine valency, DNA length and GC content affect threshold polyamine concentration for condensation. Protein-based nucleosome condensing agents, HP1 and Ki-67, have much lower threshold concentration for condensation than charge-based condensing agents, with Ki-67 being the most effective as low as 100 pM for nucleosome condensation. In addition, we did not observe condensate dissolution even at the highest concentrations of HP1 and Ki-67 tested. We also introduce a two-color imaging scheme where nucleosomes of high density labeled in one color is used to demarcate condensate boundaries and identical nucleosomes of another color at low density can be tracked relative to the boundaries after Ki-67 mediated condensation. Our platform should enable the ultimate resolution of single molecules in condensation dynamics studies of chromatin components under defined physicochemical conditions.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522433v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ed0cc9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e26b5dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f6e73corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7227b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microtubules and molecular motors are essential components of the cellular cytoskeleton, driving fundamental processes in vivo, including chromosome segregation and cargo transport. When reconstituted in vitro, these cytoskeletal proteins serve as energy-consuming building blocks to study the self-organization of active matter. Cytoskeletal active gels display rich emergent dynamics, including extensile flows, locally contractile asters, and bulk contraction. However, how the protein-protein interaction kinetics set their contractile or extensile nature is unclear. Here, we explore the origin of the transition from extensile bundles to contractile asters in a minimal reconstituted system composed of stabilized microtubules, depletant, ATP, and clusters of kinesin-1 motors. We show that the microtubule binding and unbinding kinetics of highly processive motor clusters set their ability to end-accumulate, which can drive polarity sorting of the microtubules and aster formation. We further demonstrate that the microscopic time scale of end-accumulation sets the emergent time scale of aster formation. Finally, we show that biochemical regulation is insufficient to explain fully the transition as generic aligning interactions through depletion, crosslinking, or excluded volume interactions can drive bundle formation, despite the presence of end-accumulating motors. The extensile-to-contractile transition is well captured by a simple self-assembly model where nematic and polar aligning interactions compete to form either bundles or asters. Starting from a five-dimensional organization phase space, we identify a single control parameter given by the ratio of the different component concentrations that dictates the material-scale organization. Overall, this work shows that the interplay of biochemical and mechanical tuning at the microscopic level controls the robust self-organization of active cytoskeletal materials.\n\nSignificance statementSelf-organization in living cells is often driven by energy-consuming motor proteins that push and pull on a network of cytoskeletal filaments. However, it is unclear how to connect the emergent structure and dynamics of reconstituted cytoskeletal materials to the kinetics and mechanics of their microscopic building blocks. Here, we systematically correlate bulk structure with asymmetry of the motor distribution along single filaments to explain the transition from extensile bundles to contractile asters in active networks of stabilized microtubules crosslinked by motor proteins. We combine experiments and scaling arguments to identify a single number that predicts how the system will self-organize. This work shows that biochemical and mechanical interactions compete to set the emergent structure of active biomimetic gels.",

    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing plays a major role in the formation of biological lumens during embryonic development, when the accumulation of pressurized fluid leads to the formation of microlumens that fracture cell-cell contacts and later evolve to form a single large lumen. However, the physical principles underpinning the formation of a pattern of microlumens from a pristine adhesion and their subsequent coarsening are poorly understood. Here, we use giant unilamellar vesicles adhered to a supported lipid bilayer and subjected to osmotic stress to generate and follow the dynamics of hydraulic fracturing akin to those in cells. Using this simplified system together with theoretical modelling and numerical simulations, we provide a mechanistic understanding of the nucleation of hydraulic cracks, their spatial patterns and their coarsening dynamics. Besides coarsening, we show that microlumens can irreversibly bud out of the membrane, reminiscent of endocytic vesicles in cell-cell adhesion. By establishing the physics of patterning and dynamics of hydraulic cracks, our work unveils the mechanical constraints for the biological regulation of hydraulically-driven adhesion remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Blood glucose and HbA1c, intermediate glycation products of hemoglobin, remain the two clinical biomarkers for monitoring disease progression in diabetics. However, the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) has been implicated in diabetic pathogenesis and the use of AGEs in tissues as long-term glycemic markers may be of value in the clinical setting. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how different tissue constituents respond to dietary monosaccharides. In this study, we studied the in vitro rate of fluorescent AGEs (fAGEs) formation with multiphoton microscopy in different porcine tissues (aorta, cornea, kidney, dermis, and tendon). These tissues were treated with D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose, three primary monosaccharides found in human diets. We found that the use of D-fructose resulted in the highest glycation rate, followed by D-galactose and then D-glucose. Moreover, compared to non-collagen tissue constituents such as elastic fibers and cells, the rate of tissue glycation was consistently higher in collagen, suggesting that collagen is a more sensitive target for fAGE formation. However, we also found that collagen in different tissues exhibits different rates of fAGE formation, with slower rates observed in tightly packed tissues such as cornea and tendon. Our study suggests that for fAGE to be developed into a long-term glycemic biomarker, loosely organized collagen tissues located in the proximity of vasculature may be the best targets.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) perform several important functions in cells including cis-regulation of transcription. Barring a few specific cases, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation by lncRNAs remain poorly understood. Transcriptional proteins can form condensates via phase separation at protein-binding loci (BL) on the genome (e.g., enhancers and promoters). lncRNA-coding genes are present at loci in close genomic proximity of these BL and these RNAs can interact with transcriptional proteins via attractive heterotypic interactions mediated by their net charge. Motivated by these observations, we propose that lncRNAs can dynamically regulate transcription in cis via charge-based heterotypic interactions with transcriptional proteins in condensates. To study the consequences of this mechanism, we developed and studied a dynamical phase-field model. We find that proximal lncRNAs can promote condensate formation at the BL. Vicinally localized lncRNA can migrate to the BL to attract more protein because of favorable interaction free energies. However, increasing the distance beyond a threshold leads to a sharp decrease in protein recruitment to the BL. This finding could potentially explain why genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes and protein-coding genes are conserved across metazoans. Finally, our model predicts that lncRNA transcription can fine-tune transcription from neighboring condensate-controlled genes, repressing transcription from highly expressed genes and enhancing transcription of genes expressed at a low level. This non-equilibrium effect can reconcile conflicting reports that lncRNAs can enhance or repress transcription from proximal genes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCELong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) form a significant part of the human genome but do not code for any proteins. They have many hypothesized functions in the cell, including the regulation of transcription. Transcriptional condensates are assemblies of transcriptional proteins that concentrate at specific genomic sites through phase separation and can regulate transcription. In this study, we propose that lncRNAs can regulate transcription by interacting with proteins in transcriptional condensates to modulate condensate formation. We find that this model can explain some puzzling observations such as conflicting reports of gene activation and repression by lncRNAs, and conservation of genomic distances between lncRNA-coding genes relative to protein-coding genes in metazoans. Experimentally testable predictions that can further explore our model are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcomas are immune-resistant and metastatic as a result of elevated nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although vitamin D has anti-cancer effects, its effectiveness and mechanism of action against osteosarcomas are poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the impact of vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) on the NMD-ROS-EMT signaling axis in in vitro and in vivo osteosarcoma animal models. Initiation of VDR signaling facilitated the enrichment of EMT pathway genes, after which 1,25(OH)2D, the active vitamin D derivative, inhibited the EMT pathway in osteosarcoma subtypes. The ligand-bound VDR directly downregulated the EMT inducer SNAI2, differentiating highly metastatic from low metastatic subtypes and 1,25(OH)2D sensitivity. Moreover, epigenome-wide motif and putative target gene analysis revealed the VDRs integration with NMD tumorigenic and immunogenic pathways. In an autoregulatory manner, 1,25(OH)2D inhibited NMD machinery genes and upregulated NMD target genes implicated in anti-oncogenic activity, immunorecognition, and cell-to-cell adhesion. Dicer substrate siRNA knockdown of SNAI2 revealed superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated antioxidative responses and 1,25(OH)2D sensitization via non-canonical SOD2 nuclear-to-mitochondrial translocalization leading to overall ROS suppression. In a mouse xenograft metastasis model, the therapeutically relevant vitamin D derivative calcipotriol inhibited osteosarcoma metastasis and tumor growth shown for the first time. Our results uncover novel osteosarcoma-inhibiting mechanisms for vitamin D and calcipotriol that may be translated to human patients.",

    "abstract": "Tree diseases constitute a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide. Pathogen discovery in natural habitats is of vital importance to understanding current and future threats and prioritising efforts towards developing disease management strategies. Ash dieback is a fungal disease of major conservational concern that is infecting common ash trees, Fraxinus excelsior, in Europe. The disease is caused by a non-native fungal pathogen, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. Other dieback causing-species have not previously been identified in the genus Hymenoscyphus. Here, we discover the pathogenicity potential of two newly identified related species of Asian origin, H. koreanus and H. occultus, and one Europe-native related species, H. albidus. We sequence the genomes of all three Hymenoscyphus species and compare them to that of H. fraxineus. Phylogenetic analysis of core eukaryotic genes identified H. albidus and H. koreanus as sister species, whilst H. occultus diverged prior these and H. fraxineus. All four Hymenoscyphus genomes are of comparable sizes (55-62 Mbp) and GC contents (42-44%) and encode for polymorphic secretomes. Surprisingly, 1,133 predicted secreted proteins are shared between the ash dieback pathogen H. fraxineus and the three related Hymenoscyphus endophytes. Amongst shared secreted proteins are cell death-inducing effector candidates, such as necrosis, and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins, NLPs, that are upregulated during in planta growth of all Hymenoscyphus species. Indeed, pathogenicity tests showed that all four related Hymenoscyphus species develop pathogenic growth on European ash stems, with native H. albidus being the least virulent. Our results identify the threat Hymenoscypohus species pose to the survival of European ash trees, and highlight the importance of promoting pathogen surveillance in environmental landscapes. Identifying new pathogens and including them in the screening for durable immunity of common ash trees is key to the long-term survival of ash.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of preclinical and clinical studies are exploring the use of receptor-engineered cells that can respond to disease states for the treatment of cancer, infectious disease, autoimmunity, and regeneration. However, receptor-based cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), face many critical issues including target recognition escape, adverse side effects, and lack of in vivo control. Drug-controllable receptors offer a promising solution to overcome these issues through precise in vivo tuning of cells via enhanced sensing and therapeutic efficacy. Here we develop a novel class of modular and tunable receptors, termed valency-controlled receptors (VCRs), which can leverage customized small molecules to mediate cell signaling strength via controlled spatial clustering. We first develop DNA origami activated VCRs to demonstrate that receptor valency is a core mechanism that modulates immune cell activation. We design a series of customized valency-control ligands (VCLs) by transforming small molecule drugs into a multivalency format and modularly fusing VCR onto the CAR architecture. We demonstrate that VCL induction allows enhanced target sensitivity of engineered cells. Using medicinal chemistry, we develop programmable bioavailable VCL drugs to demonstrate that the VCR system enables drug-induced highly potent responses towards low antigen cancers in vitro and in vivo. Valency controlled receptors and customizable drug ligands provide a new synthetic biology platform to precisely tune engineered cell therapeutic potency, which can address existing safety and efficacy barriers in cell therapy.",

These kinases are downstream targets for mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular activity regulated protein kinase (ERK) and p38. MNKs have been implicated in the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion (DRG and TG) using transgenic mouse lines and through the use of specific inhibitors of MNK1 and MNK2. While specific knockout of the Mknk1 gene suggests that it is the key isoform for regulation of nociceptor excitability and nociceptive behaviors in mice, both MKNK1 and MKNK2 genes are expressed in the DRG and TG of mice and humans based on RNA sequencing experiments. Single cell sequencing in mice suggests that Mknk1 and Mknk2 may be expressed in different populations of nociceptors. We sought to characterize mRNA expression in human DRG and TG for both MNK1 and MNK2. Our results show that both genes are expressed by nearly all neurons in both human ganglia with expression in other cell types as well. Our findings provide evidence that MNK1 and MNK2 are expressed by human nociceptors and suggest that efforts to pharmacologically target MNKs for pain would likely be translatable due its conserved expression in both species.",

Recently, the dysfunction of different synaptic circuits in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been shown. Previous studies have attributed the pathophysiological mechanism of ADHD to disturbances in the dopaminergic system. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which are considered a validated animal model of ADHD, have altered dopaminergic innervation and increased locomotor activity. Here, we performed immunohistochemical tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) staining. The mesocortical dopaminergic system appears to be normal in juvenile SHR, as suggested by (i) no alteration in the area density of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, (ii) no alterations in the volume density of TH-ir fibers in layer I of the PrL subregion of mPFC, (iii) no alteration in the percentage of TH-ir dopaminergic fibers in layer I of the PrL subregion of mPFC as revealed by TH and/or DBH immunoreactivity. Furthermore, the SHR showed increased locomotor activity than WKY in the open field test.\n\nThe demonstration of no alteration in mesocortical dopaminergic neurons and fiber in SHR raises some concern about the position of SHR as an animal model of the inattentive subtype of ADHD. However, these results strengthen this strain as an animal model of hyperactive/impulsive subtype ADHD for future studies that may elucidate the underlying mechanism mediating hyperactivity and test various treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that results in an attack by bodys immune system of its own tissues, causing chronic inflammation and tissue damage. T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of SLE, as they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as mediate direct effects on target tissues. Recently, CD4-positive T cells with cytotoxic potential were showed to be involved in autoimmune disease progression and tissue damage. However, whether this cell type expands and plays effector functions in SLE patients remain to be elucidated. Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data and flow cytometry data, we find that cytotoxic CD4+CD28- T cells are present in SLE patients. We also show that these cells expand most prominently in patients affected by lupus nephritis, and they exhibit cytotoxic activity against human renal glomerular endothelial cells in vitro. In addition, our study suggests that Interleukin-15 (IL-15) promotes the expansion, proliferation and cytotoxic function of CD4+CD28- T cells in SLE patients. Tofacitinib, a selective JAK3 inhibitor, inhibits the effect of IL-15 on CD4+CD28- T cells. Together, our study clearly demonstrated that CD4+ CD28- T cells characterized by proinflammatory properties and cytolytic function expand in SLE patients. The pathogenic potential of these CD4+ CD28- T cells is driven by IL-15/IL-15R/JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway, which may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention to prevent progression of SLE patients.",

In total 126 samples of natural and cultural heritage objects were taken with sterile nylon flocked swabs and subsequently subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. By comparing the microbial composition of touched and untouched mollusc and fossil natural heritage objects we derived a robust microbial touch signature characterized by increased abundance of microbes known to be present in human skin. Application of this touch signature to cultural heritage objects from the Pergamonmuseum revealed areas of differential exposure to human contact on the Ishtar gate and Samal gate lions. Moreover, we were able to distinguish museum objects and personal office items touched by two different individuals with high sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the microbial composition of museum objects gives insight into the degree of exposure to human contact, which is an important parameter for conservation and heritage science, and possibly provenance research.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus is highly organized such that factors involved in transcription and processing of distinct classes of RNA are organized within specific nuclear bodies. One such nuclear body is the nuclear speckle, which is defined by high concentrations of protein and non-coding RNA regulators of pre-mRNA splicing. What functional role, if any, speckles might play in the process of mRNA splicing remains unknown. Here we show that genes localized near nuclear speckles display higher spliceosome concentrations, increased spliceosome binding to their pre-mRNAs, and higher co-transcriptional splicing levels relative to genes that are located farther from nuclear speckles. We show that directed recruitment of a pre-mRNA to nuclear speckles is sufficient to drive increased mRNA splicing levels. Finally, we show that gene organization around nuclear speckles is highly dynamic with differential localization between cell types corresponding to differences in Pol II occupancy. Together, our results integrate the longstanding observations of nuclear speckles with the biochemistry of mRNA splicing and demonstrate a critical role for dynamic 3D spatial organization of genomic DNA in driving spliceosome concentrations and controlling the efficiency of mRNA splicing",

    "abstract": "The islets of Langerhans are complex micro-organs comprised of multiple cell types essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. The endocrine cell types of the islets engage in intimate, intercellular communication that is necessary for normal secretory activity. Disruption of this intercellular communication, which is at least partially dependent on the spatial organization of individual islets, leads to secretory dysfunction and exacerbation of the symptomology of disease states such as type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular determinants of the mechanisms underlying disrupted intercellular communication remain incompletely understood. Herein we describe the utilization of CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging (SMI) to interrogate transcriptomic changes associated with the transition from the obese, prediabetic state to overt type 2 diabetes. Using SMI, we verified previously reported findings regarding islet composition in the obese and type 2 diabetic states, including loss of beta cells and expansion of alpha cell mass. In addition, we identified changes in the islet neighborhood that have implications for the function of islet endocrine cells. In particular, we identified a subset of alpha cells oriented in the periphery of the islets that appear to exhibit a transcriptomic profile suggestive of de-differentiation toward a beta cell-like transcriptome-type. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing spatial molecular imaging to investigate single-cell transcriptomes of individual islets. Further exploration of the intersection of islet architecture and gene expression using spatial technologies is expected to yield novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate depends on genetic, epigenetic and environmental inputs that are interconnected, making it difficult to disentangle their respective contributions to cell fate decisions1-3, and epigenetic reprogramming is a major contributor to tumor plasticity and adaptation4-6. Although cancer initiation and progression are generally associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations7,8, substantial epigenomic alterations underlie many aspects of tumorigenesis and cancer susceptibility9-18, suggesting that genetic mechanisms alone may not be sufficient to drive malignant transformations19-23. However, whether purely non-genetic reprogramming mechanisms are sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis irrespective of mutations is unknown. Here, we show that a transient perturbation of transcriptional silencing mediated by Polycomb-Group proteins is sufficient to induce an irreversible switch to a cancer cell fate in Drosophila. This is linked to the irreversible derepression of genes that can drive tumorigenesis, including JNK and JAK-STAT signalling pathways and zfh1, the fly homolog of the ZEB1 oncogene, which we show to be a necessary driver of the cancer fate. These data show that a reversible perturbation of Polycomb-Group protein levels can induce cancer in the absence of driver mutations and suggest that this is achieved through epigenetic inheritance of altered cell fates.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial colonization dynamics of plants can differ between phylogenetically similar bacterial strains as well as in the context of complex bacterial communities. Quantitative studies that can resolve closely related bacteria within complex communities can lead to a better understanding of plant-microbe interactions. However, current methods lack the specificity to differentiate phylogenetically similar bacterial strains. In this study, we describe molecular strategies to study specific duckweed-bacteria interactions. We first systematically optimized a bead-beating protocol to co-isolate nucleic acids simultaneously from duckweed and bacteria. We then developed a generic fingerprinting assay to detect bacteria present in duckweed samples. To detect specific duckweed-bacteria interactions, we developed a genomics-based computational pipeline to generate bacterial strain-specific primers. These strain-specific primers differentiated bacterial strains from the same genus and enabled the detection of specific duckweed-bacteria interactions present in a community context. Moreover, we used these strain-specific primers to quantify the bacterial colonization of duckweed by normalization to a plant reference gene and revealed differences in colonization levels between strains from the same genus. Lastly, confocal microscopy of inoculated duckweed further supported our PCR results and showed bacterial colonization of the duckweed root-frond interface and root interior. The molecular methods introduced in this work should enable the tracking and quantification of specific plant-microbe interactions within plant-microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSome poison arrow frogs sequester the toxin epibatidine as a defense against predators. We previously identified a single amino acid substitution (S108C) at a highly conserved site in a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) {beta}2 subunit that prevents epibatidine from binding to this receptor. When placed in a homologous mammalian nAChR this substitution minimized epibatidine binding but also perturbed acetylcholine binding, a clear cost. However, in the nAChRs of poison arrow frogs, this substitution appeared to have no detrimental effect on acetylcholine binding and, thus, appeared cost-free.\n\nResultsThe introduction of S108C into the 4{beta}2 nAChRs of non-dendrobatid frogs also does not affect ACh sensitivity, when these receptors are expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. However, 4{beta}2 nAChRs with C108 had a decreased magnitude of neurotransmitter-induced currents in all species tested (Epipedobates anthonyi, non-dendrobatid frogs, as well as human), compared with 4{beta}2 nAChRs with the conserved S108. Immunolabeling of frog or human 4{beta}2 nAChRs in the plasma membrane using radiolabeled antibody against the {beta}2 nAChR subunit shows that C108 significantly decreased the number of cell-surface 4{beta}2 nAChRs, compared with S108.\n\nConclusionsWhile S108C protects these species against sequestered epibatidine, it incurs a potential physiological cost of disrupted 4{beta}2 nAChR function. These results may explain the high conservation of a serine at this site in vertebrates, as well as provide an example of a tradeoff between beneficial and deleterious effects of an evolutionary change. They also provide important clues for future work on assembly and trafficking of this important neurotransmitter receptor.",

We find that the core clock transcription factor Clock is crucial for a robust longevity and fecundity response to DR in Drosophila. To identify clock-controlled mediators, we performed RNA-sequencing from abdominal fat bodies across the 24 h day after just 5 days under control or DR diets. In contrast to more chronic DR regimens, we did not detect significant changes in the rhythmic expression of core clock genes. Yet we discovered that DR induced de novo rhythmicity or increased expression of rhythmic clock output genes. Network analysis revealed that DR increased network connectivity in one module comprised of genes encoding proteasome subunits. Adult, fat body specific RNAi knockdown demonstrated that proteasome subunits contribute to DR-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, clock control of output links DR-mediated changes in rhythmic transcription to lifespan extension.",

    "abstract": "Segregation of chromosomes depends on the centromere. Most species are monocentric, with the centromere restricted to a single region per chromosome. In some organisms, monocentric organization changed to holocentric, in which the centromere activity is distributed over the entire chromosome length. However, the causes and consequences of this transition are poorly understood. Here, we show that the transition in the genus Cuscuta was associated with dramatic changes in the kinetochore, a protein complex that mediates the attachment of chromosomes to microtubules. We found that in holocentric Cuscuta species the KNL2 genes were lost; the CENP-C, KNL1, and ZWINT1 genes were truncated; the centromeric localization of CENH3, CENP-C, KNL1, MIS12, and NDC80 proteins was disrupted; and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) was degenerated. Our results demonstrate that holocentric Cuscuta species lost the ability to form a standard kinetochore and do not employ SAC to control the attachment of microtubules to chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerases (RNAPs) must transit through protein roadblocks to produce full-length RNAs. Here we report real-time measurements of Escherichia coli (E. coli) RNAP passage through different barriers. As intuitively expected, assisting forces facilitated, and opposing forces hindered, RNAP passage through LacI bound to natural operator sites. Force-dependent differences were significant at magnitudes as low as 0.2 pN and were abolished in the presence of GreA, which rescues backtracked RNAP. In stark contrast, opposing forces promoted passage when the rate of backtracking was comparable to, or faster than the rate of dissociation of the roadblock, particularly in the presence of GreA. Our experiments and simulations indicate that RNAP may transit after roadblocks dissociate, or undergo cycles of backtracking, recovery, and ramming into roadblocks to pass through. We propose that such reciprocating motion also enables RNAP to break protein-DNA contacts holding RNAP back during promoter escape and RNA chain elongation, facilitating productive transcription in vivo.",

Distinguishing resident-tissue from monocyte-derived macrophages, we discovered a resident-tissue-like subpopulation within monocyte-derived macrophages. Additionally, hypoxia-driven macrophages emerged as a prominent TME component. Deconvolution of these profiles revealed five subpopulations as independent prognostic markers across various cancer types. Validation in large cohorts confirmed the FOLR2-expressing macrophage association with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian and triple-negative breast cancer. Moreover, the marker TREM2, commonly used to define immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, cannot solely predict cancer prognosis, as different polarization states of macrophages express this marker in a context-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "The apoptotic caspase subfamily evolved into two subfamilies - monomeric initiators and dimeric effectors. Sequence variations in the conserved caspase-hemoglobinase fold resulted in changes in oligomerization, enzyme specificity, and regulation, making caspases an excellent model for examining the mechanisms of molecular evolution in fine-tuning structure, function, and allosteric regulation. We examined the urea-induced equilibrium folding/unfolding of two initiator caspases, monomeric caspase-8 and cFLIPL, over a broad pH range. Both proteins unfold by a three-state equilibrium mechanism that includes a partially folded intermediate. In addition, both proteins undergo a conserved pH-dependent conformational change that is controlled by an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. We show that the conformational free energy landscape of the caspase monomer is conserved in the monomeric and dimeric subfamilies. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence or absence of urea, coupled with limited trypsin proteolysis and mass spectrometry, show that the small subunit is unstable in the protomer and unfolds prior to the large subunit. In addition, the unfolding of helix 2 in the large subunit results in disruption of a conserved allosteric site. Because the small subunit forms the interface for dimerization, our results highlight an important driving force for the evolution of the dimeric caspase subfamily through stabilizing the small subunit.",

To understand these similarities, we have generated single cell atlases for marine larvae from two animal phyla and have compared their cell types. We found clear similarities among ciliary band cells and neurons of the apical organ in the two larvae pointing to possible homology of these structures suggesting a single origin of larvae within the clade analysed here (Lophotrochozoa).
