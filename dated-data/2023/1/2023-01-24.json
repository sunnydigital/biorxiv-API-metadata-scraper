    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) indicates the interdependencies between brain signals recorded from spatially distinct locations in different frequency bands, which is modulated by cognitive tasks and is known to change with aging and cognitive disorders. Recently, the power of narrow-band gamma oscillations induced by visual gratings has been shown to reduce with both healthy aging and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the impact of aging/MCI on stimulus-induced gamma FC has not been well studied. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from a large cohort (N=229) of elderly subjects (>49 years) while they viewed large cartesian gratings to induce gamma oscillations and studied changes in alpha and gamma FC with healthy aging (N=218) and MCI (N=11). Surprisingly, we found that aging and disease changed power and FC in different ways. With healthy aging, alpha power did not change but FC decreased significantly. MCI reduced gamma but not alpha FC significantly compared with age and gender matched controls, even when power was matched between the two groups. Overall, our results show distinct effects of aging and disease on EEG power and FC, suggesting different mechanisms and the potential to use EEG stimulus-induced FC along with power for early diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory neurons are essential for nervous system function. GABA is the most important neurotransmitter for fast neuronal inhibition in vertebrates and invertebrates. GABAergic signaling in sex specific, fruitless expressing neuronal circuits of Drosophila is required for multiple aspects of male courtship behavior. RNAi mediated knockdown of the GABA producing enzyme Gad1 and the ionotropic receptor Rdl in the ventral nerve cord causes uncoordinated and futile copulation attempts, defects in wing extension choice and severe alterations of courtship song. Altered song of GABA depleted males fails to stimulate female receptivity, but rescue of song patterning alone is not sufficient to rescue male mating success. Knockdown of Gad1 and Rdl in brain circuits abolishes courtship conditioning. We characterize the around 220 neurons coexpressing Gad1 and Fruitless in the Drosophila male nervous system and propose inhibitory circuit motifs underlying key features of courtship behavior based on the observed phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cortex features a large diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties. Synaptic connectivity rules powerfully shape how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but comprehensively mapping connectivity at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here, we used millimeter-scale volumetric electron microscopy to investigate the connectivity of inhibitory neurons across a dense neuronal population spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex with synaptic resolution. We classified all 1183 excitatory neurons within a 100 micron column into anatomical subclasses using quantitative morphological and synapse features based on full dendritic reconstructions, finding both familiar subclasses corresponding to axonal projections and novel intralaminar distinctions based on synaptic properties. To relate these subclasses to single-cell connectivity, we reconstructed all 164 inhibitory interneurons in the same column, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. We found widespread cell-type-specific inhibition, including interneurons selectively targeting certain excitatory subpopulations among spatially intermingled neurons in layer 2/3, layer 5, and layer 6. Globally, inhibitory connectivity was organized into \"motif groups,\" heterogeneous collections of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same combinations of excitatory subtypes. We also discovered a novel category of disinhibitory-specialist interneuron that preferentially targets basket cells. Collectively, our analysis revealed new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a powerful foundation for linking modern multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.",

These findings are based on experimental paradigms that require using a joystick or keyboard to navigate a virtual desktop environment. In the present study, cognitively normal young and older adults navigated in each of two virtual reality (VR) conditions: a desktop VR condition which required using a mouse and keyboard to navigate and an immersive and ambulatory VR condition which permitted unrestricted locomotion. Consistent with past studies, older adults navigated to target locations less precisely than did younger individuals in the desktop condition. These age differences were significantly attenuated when tested in the immersive environment. Additional analyses indicated that older adults showed a preference for route-based search strategies compared to young adults, regardless of condition. These findings suggest that certain aspects of navigation performance in older adults are improved in paradigms that offer a fuller range of enriched and naturalistic cues.",

    "abstract": "Childhood traumatic stress profoundly affects prefrontal cortical networks regulating top-down control of eating and body weight. However, the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to trauma-induced aberrant eating behaviors remain largely unknown. Traumatic stress influences brain immune responses, which may, in turn, disrupt prefrontal cortical networks and behaviors. The tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme / a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (TACE/ADAM17) is a sheddase with essential functions in brain maturation, behavior, and neuroinflammation. This study aimed to determine the role of TACE/ADAM17 on traumatic stress-induced disruption of eating patterns. We demonstrate a novel mechanistic connection between prefrontal cortical TACE/ADAM17 and trauma-induced eating behaviors. Fifty-two (52) adolescent Lewis rats (postnatal day, PND, 15) were injected intracerebrally either with a novel Accell SMARTpool ADAM17 siRNA or a corresponding siRNA vehicle. The RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 Assay was used to visualize mRNA expression. Observation cages were used to monitor ethological behaviors in a more naturalistic environment over long periods. We found that traumatic stress blunts startle reactivity and alter eating behaviors (increased intake and disrupted eating patterns). We also found that the rats that received prefrontal cortical TACE/ADAM17 siRNA administration exhibited decreased eating and increased grooming behaviors compared to controls. These changes were associated with decreased AIF-1 expression (a typical marker of microglia and neuroinflammation). This study demonstrates that prefrontal cortical TACE/ADAM17 is involved in neuroinflammation and may play essential roles in regulating feeding patterns under stress conditions. TACE/ADAM17 represents a promising target to ameliorate inflammation-induced brain and behavior alterations.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms on how the gut microbe metabolite, indoles, regulate host organ growth and function, germ-free male mice were mono-colonized with indole-producing wildtype Escherichia coli or tryptophanase-encoding tnaA knockout mutant indole-non-producing E. coli. The indole mutant E. coli recipient mice exhibited significant multiorgan decline and growth retardation combined with catabolism and energy deficiency despite increased food intake compared to control mice. In addition, indole mutant mice displayed malfunctional intestine, enlarged caecum, reduced numbers of colonic enterochromaffin cells and reduced circulating serotonin levels, resulting in reduced gut motility, diminished digestion, and lower energy harvest. Furthermore, indole mutant mice also displayed decreased expression of Kcnj12 gene, suggesting reduced excitability of enteric neurons thus adding to intestinal dysfunctional phenotype. In conclusion, indoles are necessary to maintain adult metabolic homeostasis across multiple organs in vivo. Impairment of indole levels results in multiorgan functional decline suggesting a mechanism whereby gut microbe metabolites may regulate biological ageing and thus increase the risk for disease.\n\nGraphical summary\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/525337v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@182875dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8525e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c24e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@159dff4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "During viral infection, cells can deploy immune strategies that deprive viruses of molecules essential for their replication. In this study, we report a family of immune effectors in bacteria which, in response to phage infection, degrade cellular ATP and dATP by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between the adenine and sugar moieties. These ATP nucleosidase effectors are widely distributed within multiple bacterial defense systems including CBASS, prokaryotic argonautes and NLR-like proteins, and we show that degradation of (d)ATP during infection halts phage propagation and aborts infection. By analyzing homologs of the immune ATP nucleosidase domain, we discover and characterize Detocs, a new family of bacterial defense systems with a two-component phosphotransfer signaling architecture. The immune ATP nucleosidase domain is also encoded within a diverse set of eukaryotic proteins that have immune-like architectures, and we show biochemically that these eukaryotic homologs preserve the ATP nucleosidase activity. Our findings suggest that ATP and dATP degradation is a cell-autonomous innate immune strategy conserved across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Although sexual reproduction is widespread in eukaryotes, some fungal species can only reproduce asexually. Therefore, loss of sexual reproduction may confer survival advantages under certain conditions in certain species. In the rice blast fungus Pyricularia (Magnaporthe) oryzae, several isolates from the region of origin retain mating ability (female fertility), but most isolates are female sterile. Therefore, it is hypothesized that female fertility was lost during its spread from the origin to the rest of the world, and P. oryzae is an ideal biological model for studying the cause of the evolutionary shift in the reproductive mode. Here, we show that functional mutations of Pro1, a global transcriptional regulator of mating-related genes in filamentous fungi, is one cause of loss of female fertility in this fungus. Employing backcrossing between female-fertile and female-sterile field isolates, we identified the putative genomic region involved in female sterility by comparative genomics between the genomes of F4 female-fertile and -sterile progenies. Further genotyping, linkage, and functional analyses revealed that the functional mutation of Pro1 causes the loss of female fertility. RNA sequencing analysis showed that Pro1 regulates global gene expression, including that of several mating-related genes. The dysfunctional Pro1 did not affect the infection processes, such as conidial germination, appressorium formation, and penetration, but conidial release from conidiophores was increased. Furthermore, various types of mutations in Pro1 were detected in geographically distant P. oryzae, including pandemic isolates of wheat blast fungus. These results provide the first evidence that loss of female fertility may be advantageous to the life cycle of some plant pathogenic fungi.\n\nSignificanceMany pathogenic and industrial fungi are thought to have abdicated sexual reproduction, but the mechanisms and biological importance have been a long-standing mystery. Discovering why such fungi lost fertility is important to understand their survival strategies. Here, we revealed the genetic basis of how the rice blast fungus lost female fertility in nature and how this affects the life cycle. This has important implications for understanding evolution of blast pathogens and for developing an effective management strategy to control blast disease before a pandemic. Our findings also provide an additional perspective on advantages of asexual reproduction in some eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Although the gut and the brain vastly differ in physiological function, they have been interlinked in a variety of different neurological and behavioral disorders. The bacteria that comprise the gut microbiome communicate and influence the function of various physiological processes within the body including nervous system function. However, the effects of social experience in the context of dominance and chronic stress on gut microbiome remain poorly understood. Here, we examined whether social experience impacts the host zebrafish (Danio rerio) gut microbiome. We studied how social dominance during the first two weeks of social interactions changed the composition of zebrafish gut microbiome by comparing gut bacterial composition, diversity and relative abundance among socially dominant, submissive, social isolates, and control group-housed communal fish. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we report that social dominance significantly affects host gut bacterial community composition but not bacterial diversity. At the genus-level, Aeromonas and unclassified Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance decreased in dominant individuals while commensal bacteria (e.g., Exiguobacterium and Cetobacterium) increased in relative abundance. Conversely, the relative abundance of Psychrobacter and Acinetobacter was increased in subordinates, isolates, and communal fish compared to dominant fish. The shift in commensal and pathogenic bacteria highlights the impact of social experience and the accompanying stress on gut microbiome with potentially similar effects in other social organisms.\n\nIMPORTANCEDisruptions in the gut microbiome negatively impact various systems in the body. Recently, the gut microbiome has been associated with neurological deficits in both behavioral and neurodegenerative disorders. Given the increasing prevalence in diagnosis of both neurological disease and behavioral disorders, researching the link between social behaviors and the gut microbiome is critical to better understand how the gut and the brain communicate during healthy and diseased states. Our research findings demonstrate the effects of social dominance and chronic stress on host gut microbiome composition. By identifying variations in bacterial relative abundance based on social experience and associated stress, a broader understanding of pathogenic (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas) versus commensal communities (e.g., Exiguobacterium, Cetobacterium) and related host physiology can be inferred.",

However, only a few host factors have been shown to regulate -1 PRF. Through a reporter-based genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, we identified several host factors that either suppressed or enhanced -1 PRF of SARS-CoV-2. One of these factors is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A (eIF2A), which specifically and directly enhanced -1 PRF in vitro and in cells. Consistent with the crucial role of efficient -1 PRF in transcriptase/replicase expression, loss of eIF2A reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Transcriptome-wide analysis of eIF2A-interacting RNAs showed that eIF2A primarily interacted with 18S ribosomal RNA near the contacts between the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift-stimulatory element (FSE) and the ribosome. Thus, our results revealed an unexpected role for eIF2A in modulating the translation of specific RNAs independent of its previously described role during initiation.",

To understand how they work to promote fork remodeling, reconstituted branched replication intermediates were used. We show that RadA/Sms (or its variant RadA/Sms C13A) binds to the 5'-tail of a reversed fork with longer nascent lagging-strand and unwinds it in the 5'[-&gt;]3' direction, but RecA and its mediators limit unwinding. RadA/Sms cannot unwind a reversed fork with a longer nascent leading-strand, or a gapped stalled fork, but RecA interacts with and activates unwinding. Here, the molecular mechanism by which RadA/Sms, in concert with RecA, in a two-step reaction, unwinds the nascent lagging-strand of reversed or stalled forks is unveiled. First, RadA/Sms, as a mediator, contributes to SsbA displacement from the forks, and nucleates RecA onto single-stranded DNA. Then, RecA, as a loader, interacts with and recruits RadA/Sms onto the nascent lagging strand of these DNA substrates to unwind them. Within this process, RecA limits RadA/Sms self-assembly to control fork processing, and RadA/Sms prevents RecA from provoking unnecessary recombination.",

To suppress the unwanted effects of inflammation and preserve its beneficial outcomes, the mechanisms by which inflammation affects hematopoiesis need to be fully elucidated. Rather than focusing on specific inflammatory stimuli, we here investigated the role of transcription factor Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which receives input from several inflammatory signaling pathways. We identify IRF1 as a master HSC regulator. IRF1 loss impairs HSC self-renewal, increases stress-induced cell cycle activation, and confers apoptosis resistance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an aged, inflammatory signature devoid of IFN signaling with reduced megakaryocytic/erythroid priming and antigen presentation in IRF1-deficient HSCs. Finally, we conducted IRF1-based AML patient stratification to identify groups with distinct proliferative, survival and differentiation features, overlapping with our murine HSC results.

    "abstract": "Competitive interaction is important in structuring species composition of a habitat. Several studies have been conducted on intraspecific competition but little is known in the context of the goal-oriented task of colony relocation. Current study examines how relocating colonies respond when the new nest is a limiting resource. Examining this competition across equal sized colonies (n=17) and unequal sized colonies (n=14), we found that most trails had a clear outcome with one of the colonys occupying the new nest, while 25% of colonies merged. Larger colonies had a significantly higher chance of occupying the new nest and outcompeted the smaller colonies in most of the cases. Colonies that had lower latency to discover and more explorers had a significantly higher chance of gaining control of the new nest and interesting the level of aggression shown by both the competing colonies was comparable. Spatio-temporal analysis of the aggression revealed that the area surrounding the old, new nest and the time at which transportation occurs has higher levels of aggression. While both the competing colonies stole pupa from each other, the mean number of successful stealing by the larger colonies was 8 times larger than smaller colonies while stealing was comparable between similar sized colonies. Relocating colonies experienced significantly more mortality as compared to controls and competition for the new nest imposed additional mortality on losing colonies over the short time. Due to the potential merging of colonies, incorporation of stolen brood and increased mortality, the overall fitness of the colonies is likely to be negatively impacted due to intraspecific competition for a new nest.",

    "abstract": "In Ethiopia the facts of farmers indigenous knowledge based cropping system has been rarely investigated through research. A field experiment was conducted during 2021/2022 main cropping season at Fogera plain with the objective of examining the effect of additive series relay intercropping of grass pea with lowland rice on the grain yield of the component crops and production efficiency of the cropping system. The experiment consisted of a factorial combination of four seed proportion of grass pea (SPGP) (25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the recommended seed rate of sole grass pea) relay intercropped with full seed rate of rice in four Rice: Grass pea spatial arrangements (SA) (1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and their mixed relay intercropping system). The treatments were arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. Data on grain yield of the component crops were collected and analyzed using SAS-JMP-16 software. Results revealed that SPGP and SA had no significant effect on rice. The highest grain yield of grass pea was obtained when 25% SPGP was relay intercropped with rice in 1:3 SA (5.10 t ha-1). Maximum production efficiency in terms of total land output yield (9. 89 t ha-1) and land use efficiency (ATER =1.33), net benefit (33, 5176.79 Birr ha-1), marginal rate of return (21,428%) and positive monetary advantage index with lower competitive ratio was obtained when 50% SPGP was relay intercropped with rice in 1:3 SA. Thus, this mixture seems contributing in the development of sustainable crop production with a limited use of external inputs. Rice intercropping with other staple legume crops under residual soil moisture needs to be tested across locations and years to intensify the production efficiency and profitability of the cropping system.",

    "abstract": "Mpox is often described as being endemic in West and Central Africa as a zoonotic disease that transmits through contact with the reservoir rodent host, likely a species of African squirrel. In May 2022, human cases of Mpox were detected spreading internationally beyond countries with known endemic reservoirs. At time of writing, 84,700 confirmed cases have been reported in 110 countries. When the first cases from 2022 were sequenced, it was seen that they shared 42 single nucleotide differences from the closest mpox virus (MPXV) genome sampled in 2018. This number of changes within 3-4 years is unexpectedly large and points to a much greater evolutionary rate than expected for a poxvirus. Strikingly, most nucleotide changes are of a specific type - a dinucleotide change from TC->TT or its reverse complement GA->AA. This mutation type is characteristic of the action of APOBEC3 deaminases; host-enzymes with reported antiviral function. Analysis of MPXV genomes sampled from 2017 to 2022 showed further evidence of TC->TT mutation pattern enrichment, with 93% of transmitted single nucleotide mutations since 2017 consistent with APOBEC3 editing. Assuming APOBEC-editing is characteristic of MPXV infection in human hosts, we propose an APOBEC clock that - at a rate of ~6 APOBEC3 mutations per year - estimates MPXV has been circulating in humans since 2016. This evolutionary pattern of host-enzyme editing has implications for the longer-term fitness of the virus in this epidemic as such mechanisms are primarily antiviral in function, but in the context of a poxvirus also provide a source of variation that may conceivably facilitate adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Chytridiomycosis, a highly significant global wildlife disease, has caused unprecedented amphibian population declines and species extinctions worldwide. In contrast, mass die-offs due to chytridiomycosis have not been observed in Asia, which is thought to be the ancestral region of origin and a hyper-diversity hotspot of the known causal pathogens, Batrachochytrium dendrobtidis (Bd) and B. salamndrivorans (Bsal). It has been hypothesized that Asian amphibians may have evolved immunity to clinical Batrachochytrium infection. However, limited knowledge of endemic lineages, evolutionary history, and climate-related infection patterns limits our ability to explore this hypothesis. Here, we investigated the genetic diversity and infection patterns of the frog-infecting species, Bd, in Chinas poorly-explored Guangxi region. We used the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) marker and the nested PCR method to survey prevalence and haplotype diversity of Bd across 17 forest sites. A generalized linear model was used to evaluate associations between numerous variables and Bd prevalence within native amphibians. Our results identified seven new haplotypes, four of which are closely related to the early-emerging BdASIA-1 lineage recovered from South Korea. We also identified a unique Asian haplotype, close to the BdASIA-3 lineage, as the most prevalent (64.6% of Bd-infected adult individuals) in 11 out of 15 infected species. This haplotype was also detected in a salamander individual, which exhibited non-lethal skin lesions on the abdomen. The infection of Bd within amphibians was found to be positively associated with temperature and elevation. Our findings suggest that there is significant undiscovered genetic diversity of Asian Bd lineages in this region. Longer-term studies are required to further investigate Bd diversity, prevalence, seasonality and impact on native species and populations in Southern China and across the region of origin in Asia.\n\nAuthor SummaryChytridiomycosis is a disease which is responsible for the sharp decline of amphibian populations and species extinctions around the world. Surprisingly, it has not yet been well-studied in Asia, the region where the two causal pathogens of the disease, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal) originated. In order to better understand the lack of mass die-offs in Asia, we recently conducted a study in south Chinas Guangxi region to investigate the genetic diversity and infection patterns of Bd. Through the use of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) markers and nested PCR, we discovered seven new types of Bd, four of which were closely related to the early-emerging BdASIA-1 lineage from South Korea. The highest prevalence of Bd infection was observed in 11 species of amphibians, including a salamander which had non-lethal skin lesions. It was also noted that infection of Bd in amphibians was associated with temperature and elevation. This study has provided important information on Bd diversity and prevalence in the region, and further research is needed to explore Asia as the putative region of origin for this disease.",

    "abstract": "The risk of dying tends to increase with age, but this trend is far from universal. For humans, mortality is high during infancy, declines during juvenile development, and increases during adulthood. For other species, mortality never increases, or even continuously declines with age, which has been interpreted as absent- or reverse-aging. We developed a mathematical model that suggests an alternative interpretation. The model describes the age-dependence of mortality as the sum of two opposite processes. The mortality risk due to physiological decline increases monotonously with age. But old individuals gain survival benefits through processes like growth and learning. This simple model fits mortality dynamics for all human age classes and for species across the tree of life. Simulations revealed an unexpected complexity by which learning impacts the evolution of aging. An ability to learn initially accelerated the evolution of slower aging but constrained the slowest possible rate of aging that can evolve. This constraint occurs when learning reduces mortality during the reproductive period to near negligible levels and thereby eliminates selection for a further slow-down of aging. In conclusion, learning accelerates the evolution of slower aging, but obstructs the evolution of negligible senescence for species with strong learning-associated survival benefits.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer is one of the most important drivers of bacterial evolution. Transformation by uptake of extracellular DNA is traditionally not considered to be an effective mode of gene acquisition, simply because extracellular DNA is degraded in a matter of days when it is suspended in e.g. seawater. Mineral surfaces are, however, known to preserve DNA in the environment, and sedimentary ancient DNA studies have solidified that there are considerable amounts of fragmented DNA stored in sediments world-wide. Recently the age span of stored DNA was increased to at least 2 Ma. Here, we highlight that fragmented ancient DNA can be fueling the evolution of contemporary bacteria and advocate to consider this route for genetic variation in evolutionary history. We show that Acinetobacter baylyi can incorporate 60 bp DNA fragments adsorbed to a wide range of common sedimentary minerals and that the transformation frequencies scale with the mineral surface properties. Further, our results point to interfacial geochemical and sedimentologic processes as facilitators of evolutionary innovation where DNA-molecules are specific to the environment and the processes providing new DNA molecules may also provide the need to evolve. In contrast to heritable stochastic mutations as proposed by Darwin, the access by which bacteria acquire new genomic material at times with increased stress and also needs, would indicate a non-random mechanism that may propel evolution in a non-stochastic manner.",

    "abstract": "Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is an important DNA repair mechanism that protects against the negative effects of transcription-blocking DNA lesions. Hereditary TC-NER deficiency causes pleiotropic and often severe neurodegenerative and progeroid symptoms. Multiple assays have been developed for the clinic and for research to measure TC-NER activity, which is hampered by the relatively low abundance of repair events taking place in transcribed DNA.  Recovery of RNA Synthesis is widely used as indirect TC-NER assay based on the notion that lesion-blocked transcription only resumes after successful TC-NER. Here, we show that measuring novel synthesis of a protein that has been degraded prior to DNA damage induction is an equally effective but more versatile manner to indirectly monitor TC-NER. This  Recovery of Protein Synthesis (RPS) assay is readily adaptable for use with different degradable proteins and readouts, including fluorescence imaging and immunoblot. Moreover, with the RPS assay TC-NER activity can be measured in real-time, in various living cells types and even in differentiated tissues of living organisms. As example, we show that TC-NER capacity declines in aging muscle tissue of C. elegans. Therefore, the RPS assay constitutes an important novel clinical and research tool to investigate transcription-coupled DNA repair.",

    "abstract": "Color polymorphism is a classic study system for evolutionary genetics. One of the most color-polymorphic animal taxa is mollusks, but the investigation for the genetic basis of color determination is often hindered by their life history and limited availability of genetic resources. Here we report on the discovery of shell color polymorphism in a much-used model species, the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. While their shell is usually beige, some individuals from a Greek population show a distinct red shell color, which we nicknamed Ginger. Moreover, we found that the inheritance fits simple, single-locus Mendelian inheritance with dominance of the Ginger allele. We also compared crucial life history traits between Ginger and wild type individuals, and found no differences between morphs. We conclude that the relative simplicity of this polymorphism will provide new opportunities for a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of shell color polymorphism and its evolutionary origin.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium that affects both humans and wildlife. The fitness consequences of infections by avian malaria are well known in birds, however, little information exists on its impact on mosquitoes. Here we study how Culex pipiens mosquitoes transcriptionally respond to infection by two different Plasmodium species, P. relictum and P. cathemerium, differing in their virulence (mortality rate) and transmissibility (parasite presence in exposed mosquitoes saliva). We study the mosquito response to the infection at three critical stages of parasite development: formation of ookinetes at 24 hours post-infection (hpi), the release of sporozoites into the hemocoel at 10 days post-infection (dpi), and storage of sporozoites in the salivary glands at 21dpi. For each time point, we characterized the gene expression of mosquitoes infected with each P. relictum and P. cathemerium and mosquitoes fed on an uninfected bird and, subsequently, compared their transcriptomic responses. Differential gene expression analysis showed most of the transcriptomic changes occurred during the early infection stage (24 hpi), especially when comparing P. relictum and P. cathemerium infected mosquitoes. Differentially expressed genes in mosquitoes infected with each species were related mainly to the immune response, trypsin, and other serine-proteases metabolism. We conclude that these differences in response may partly play a role in the differential virulence and transmissibility previously observed in P. relictum and P. cathemerium in Cx. pipiens.",

To identify and quantify important variants, all genes within a population must be predicted, functionally annotated and clustered, representing the  pangenome. Despite the volume of genome data available, gene prediction and annotation are currently conducted in isolation on individual genomes, which is computationally inefficient and frequently inconsistent across genomes. Here, we introduce the open-source software graph-gene-caller (ggCaller; https://github.com/samhorsfield96/ggCaller). ggCaller combines gene prediction, functional annotation and clustering into a single step using population-wide de Bruijn Graphs, removing redundancy in gene annotation, and resulting in more accurate gene predictions and orthologue clustering. We applied ggCaller to simulated and real-world bacterial genome datasets, comparing it to current state-of-the-art tools. ggCaller is ~50x faster with equivalent or greater accuracy, particularly in datasets with complex sources of error, such as assembly contamination or fragmentation. ggCaller is also an important extension to bacterial genome-wide association studies, enabling querying of annotated graphs for functional analyses. We highlight this application by functionally annotating DNA sequences with significant associations to tetracycline and macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, identifying key resistance determinants that were missed when using only a single reference genome. ggCaller is a novel bacterial genome analysis tool with applications in bacterial epidemiology and evolutionary study.",

Subsequently, we identify the parameters for the ten weeks (weeks 40-50, 2014) of process data from North Water WWTP with prior parameters from the recommended ones from IWA. We further established a subset of parameters that are correlated to NGS data. Based on this relationship, a parameter-varying mod-ASM1 is obtained where the parameter variation is directly linked to the NGS data. We validate the NGS-enriched mod-ASM1 in the prediction of process data in the subsequent three weeks (weeks 50-53, 2014). While the enriched mod-ASM1 gives a good estimation of the COD effluent data, it cannot capture the production of nitrogen, which is often missed when the static model is deployed.",

    "abstract": "Plants produce ethyl vinyl ketone (evk) in response to biotic stress, but the evks identification and downstream defense response remain unclear. In this paper, it is predicted by docking for the first time that evk can be recognized by RBOH protein and assist the electron transfer of RBOHD/RBOHF by binding to its FAD or NADPH binding site. Here, we show that evk treatment increased H2O2 and intracellular calcium concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cells, as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and non-invasive micro-test technology, and that H2O2 signaling functioned upstream of Ca2+ signaling. Yeast two-hybrid, firefly luciferase complementation imaging, and in vitro pull-down assays demonstrated that the ACA8 (AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+-ATPASE, ISOFORM 8)-CML8 (CALMODULIN-LIKE 8) interaction promoted Ca2+ efflux to return Ca2+ levels to the resting state. Evk treatment led to the antagonism of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). CALMODULIN 5 (CAM5) positively regulates WRKY53 expression, and CAM5 and WRKY53 positively regulate SA-related gene expression. These proteins physically interact and form a complex that is unlocked by Ca2+ to release WRKY53. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that WRKY53 and TGA5 cooperate to enhance the expression of the defense gene PATHOGENESIS-REALTED 1 (PR1) and that WRKY53 enhances the binding of TGA5 to the PR1 promoter. This paper proposes a framework that evk, as a RES substance, can achieve plants  REScue through complete defense response.",

    "abstract": "Phosphate is vital for plant and algae growth, yield, and survival, but in most environments, it is poorly available. To cope with phosphate starvation, photosynthetic organisms used their phospholipids as a phosphate reserve. In microalgae, betaine lipids replace phospholipids whereas, in higher plants, betaine lipid synthesis is lost, driving plants to other strategies. The aim of this work was to evaluate to what extent betaine lipids and PC lipids share physicochemical properties and could thus substitute each other. Using neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations of two synthetic lipids, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoyl-diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DP-DGTS), we show that DP-DGTS bilayers are thicker, more rigid, and mutually more repulsive than DPPC bilayers. The different properties and hydration response of PC and DGTS provide an explanation for the diversity of betaine lipids observed in marine organisms and for their disappearance in seed plants.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that sub-stantially deteriorates patients safety and quality of life. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the golden-standard technique for diagnosing this brain disorder and has played an essential role in epilepsy monitoring and disease management. It is extremely laborious and challenging, if not practical, for physicians and expert humans to annotate all recorded signals, particularly in long-term monitoring. The annotation process often involves identifying signal segments with suspected epileptic seizure features or other abnormalities and/or known healthy features. Therefore, automated epilepsy detection becomes a key clinical need because it can greatly improve clinical practices efficiency and free up human expert time to attend to other important tasks. Current automated seizure detection algorithms generally face two challenges: (1) models trained for specific patients, but such models are patient-specific, hence fail to generalize to other patients and real-world situations; (2) seizure detection models trained on large EEG datasets have low sensitivity and/or high false positive rates, often with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) that is not high enough for potential clinical applicability.\n\nThis paper proposes Transformers for Seizure Detection, which we refer to as TSD in this manuscript. A Transformer is a deep learning architecture based on an encoder-decoder structure and on attention mechanisms, which we apply to recorded brain signals. The AUROC of our proposed model has achieved 92.1%, tested with Temple Universitys publically available electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure corpus dataset (TUH). Additionally, we highlight the impact of input domains on the models performance. Specifically, TSD performs best in identifying epileptic seizures when the input domain is a time-frequency. Finally, our proposed model for seizure detection in inference-only mode with EEG recordings shows outstanding performance in classifying seizure types and superior model initialization.",

    "abstract": "In land plants, sexual dimorphism can develop in both diploid sporophytes and haploid gametophytes. While developmental processes of sexual dimorphism have been extensively studied in the sporophytic reproductive organs of model flowering plants such as stamens and carpels of Arabidopsis thaliana, those occurring in gametophyte generation are less well characterized due to the lack of amenable model systems. We here performed three-dimensional morphological analyses of gametophytic sexual branch differentiation in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, using high-depth confocal imaging and a computational cell segmentation technique. Our analysis revealed that specification of germline precursors initiates in a very early stage of sexual branch development where incipient branch primordia are barely recognizable in the apical notch region. Moreover, spatial distribution patterns of germline precursors differ between males and females from the initial stage of primordium development in a manner dependent on the master sexual differentiation regulator MpFGMYB. In later stages, distribution patterns of germline precursors predict the sex-specific gametangia arrangement and receptacle morphologies seen in mature sexual branches. Taken together, our data suggests a tightly coupled progression of germline segregation and sexual dimorphism development in M. polymorpha.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels (mitoKATP) have been recently characterized structurally, and possess a protein through which K+ enters mitochondria (MitoKIR), and a regulatory subunit (mitoSUR). The mitoSUR regulatory subunit is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein isoform 8 (ABCB8). Opening of these channels is known to be cardioprotective, but the molecular and physiological mechanisms that activate them are not fully known. Here, to better understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms of activators (GTP) and inhibitors (ATP) on the activity of mitoKATP, we exposed isolated mitochondria to both nucleotides. We also used molecular docking directed to the nucleotide-binding domain of human ABCB8/mitoSUR to test a comparative model of ATP and GTP effects. As expected, we find that ATP dose-dependently inhibits mitoKATP activity (IC50 = 21.24 {+/-} 1.4 mM). However, simultaneous exposure of mitochondria to GTP dose-dependently (EC50 = 13.19 {+/-} 1.33 mM) reversed ATP inhibition. Pharmacological and computational studies suggest that GTP reverses ATP activity competitively. Docking directed to the site of crystallized ADP reveals that both nucleotides bind to mitoSUR with high affinity, with their phosphates directed to the Mg2+ ion and the walker A motif of the protein (SGGGKTT). These effects, when combined, result in GTP binding, ATP displacement, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ transport, and lower formation of reactive oxygen species. Overall, our findings demonstrate the basis for ATP and GTP binding in mitoSUR using a combination of biochemical, pharmacological, and computational experiments. Future studies may reveal the extent to which the balance between ATP and GTP actions contribute toward cardioprotection against ischemic events.",

    "abstract": "AimsThe behavior of pacemaker cardiomyocytes (PCs) in the sinoatrial node (SAN) is modulated by neurohormonal and paracrine factors, many of which signal through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The aims of the present study are to catalog GPCRs that are differentially expressed in the mammalian SAN and to define the acute physiological consequences of activating the cholecystokinin-A signaling system in isolated PCs.\n\nMethods and ResultsUsing bulk and single cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identify a set of GPCRs that are differentially expressed between SAN and right atrial tissue, including several whose roles in PCs and in the SAN have not been thoroughly characterized. Focusing on one such GPCR, Cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCKAR), we demonstrate expression of Cckar mRNA specifically in mouse PCs, and further demonstrate that subsets of SAN fibroblasts and neurons within the cardiac intrinsic nervous system express cholecystokinin, the ligand for CCKAR. Using mouse models, we find that while baseline SAN function is not dramatically affected by loss of CCKAR, the firing rate of individual PCs is slowed by exposure to sulfated cholecystokinin-8 (sCCK-8), the high affinity ligand for CCKAR. The effect of sCCK-8 on firing rate is mediated by reduction in the rate of spontaneous phase 4 depolarization of PCs and is mitigated by activation of beta-adrenergic signaling.\n\nConclusions(1) PCs express many GPCRs whose specific roles in SAN function have not been characterized, (2) Activation of the the cholecystokinin-A signaling pathway regulates PC automaticity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) represents a growing cause of mortality and morbidity and encompasses a spectrum of liver pathologies. Potential therapeutic targets have been identified and are currently being pre-clinically and clinically tested. However, while dozens of preclinical models have been developed to recapitulate various stages of MAFLD, few achieve fibrosis using an experimental design that mimics human pathogenesis. We sought to clarify whether the combination of thermoneutral (TN) housing and consumption of a classical Western diet (WD) would accelerate the onset of MAFLD and progression in male and female mice.\n\nMethodsMale and female C57Bl/6J mice were fed a nutrient-matched low-fat control or Western diet (41% Kcal from fat, 43% carbohydrate and 0.2% cholesterol; WD) starting at [~]12 wk of age for a further 16 wk. Mice were divided and housed with littermates at either standard temperature (TS; 22{degrees}C) or thermoneutral conditions (TN; [~]29{degrees}C). Mice underwent tests for glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and body composition, as well as intestinal permeability. Following tissue harvest, circulating and liver markers of hepatic disease progression toward steatosis and fibrosis were determined.\n\nResultsWhile male mice housed at TN and fed a WD were significantly heavier than TS -housed control animals, no other differences in body weight or composition were observed. WD-fed females housed under TN conditions had higher circulating LDL-cholesterol; however, there were no other significant differences between TN and TS -housing in circulating or hepatic lipid levels. While WD-fed TN males had higher ALT levels, no other differences in markers of liver injury or disease progression were observed. Moreover, females housed at TN conditions and fed a WD remained significantly protected against the induction of fibrosis compared to male counterparts. Interestingly, sex-specific differences were observed in markers of glucose and insulin tolerance, where TN housing and WD feeding resulted in hyperglycemia and impaired insulin responsiveness in both sexes, but glucose intolerance only in male mice.\n\nConclusionsWhile TN housing has been demonstrated to exacerbate high fat-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in male and female mice, coupling TN housing with a WD for 16 wk was not sufficient to augment fatty liver progression in male or female mice.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThermoneutral housing and Western diet feeding does not progress to NASH\nC_LIO_LIFemale mice are not more susceptible to obesity induced fatty liver under these conditions\nC_LIO_LITemperature and diet had sex-specific effects on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=184 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524609v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b9c5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36fc5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1b244org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eea3df_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, but no disease modifying therapies have been successful in clinical translation presenting a major unmet medical need. A promising target is alpha-synuclein or its aggregated form, which accumulates in the brain of PD patients as Lewy bodies. While it is not entirely clear which alpha-synuclein protein species is disease relevant, mere overexpression of alpha-synuclein in hereditary forms leads to neurodegeneration.\n\nTo specifically address gene regulation of alpha-synuclein, we developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system based on the nuclease dead S. aureus Cas9 (SadCas9) fused with the transcriptional repressor domain Krueppel-associated box to controllably repress alpha-synuclein expression at the transcriptional level. We screened single guide (sg)RNAs across the SNCA promoter and identified several sgRNAs that mediate downregulation of alpha-synuclein at varying levels. CRISPRi downregulation of alpha-synuclein in iPSC-derived neuronal cultures from a patient with an SNCA genomic triplication showed functional recovery by reduction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA damage.\n\nOur results are proof-of-concept in vitro for precision medicine by targeting the SNCA gene promoter. The SNCA CRISPRi approach presents a new model to understand safe levels of alpha-synuclein downregulation and a novel therapeutic strategy for PD and related alpha-synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "The cortical plate is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the latter of which originate in the ganglionic eminences. From their origin in the ventral telencephalon, interneuron precursors migrate during embryonic development over some distance to reach their final destination in the cortical plate. The histone methyltransferase DOT1L is necessary for proper cortical plate development and layer distribution of glutamatergic neurons, however, its specific role on cortical interneuron development has not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate that DOT1L affects interneuron development in a cell-autonomous manner. Deletion of Dot1l in MGE-derived interneuron precursor cells results in an overall reduction and altered distribution of GABAergic interneurons in the cortical plate at postnatal day (P) 0. Furthermore, we observed an altered proportion of GABAergic interneurons in the cortex and striatum at P21 with a significant decrease in Parvalbumin (PVALB)-expressing interneurons. Altogether, our results indicate that reduced numbers of cortical interneurons upon DOT1L deletion results from altered post-mitotic differentiation/maturation.",

Here, we discovered that postoperative pain hypersensitivity correlated with markedly increased local levels of the metabolite BH4. Gene transcription and reporter mouse analyses after skin injury identified neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells as primary postoperative sources of GTP cyclohydrolase-1 (Gch1) expression, the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 production. While specific Gch1 deficiency in neutrophils or macrophages had no effect, mice deficient in mast cells or mast cell-specific Gch1 showed drastically decreased postoperative pain after surgery. Skin injury induced the nociceptive neuropeptide substance P, which directly triggers the release of BH4-dependent serotonin in mouse and human mast cells. Substance P receptor blockade substantially ameliorated postoperative pain. Our findings underline the unique position of mast cells at the neuro-immune interface and highlight substance P-driven mast cell BH4 production as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of postoperative pain.",

    "abstract": "The intestine is critical for not only processing and resorbing nutrients but also protecting the organism from the environment. These functions are mainly carried out by the epithelium, which is constantly being self-renewed. Many genes and pathways can influence intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. Among them is mTORC1, whose activation increases cell proliferation. Here, we report the first intestinal epithelial cell-specific knockout ({Delta}IEC) of an amino acid transporter capable of activating mTORC1. We show that the transporter, SLC7A5, is highly expressed in mouse intestinal crypt and Slc7a5{Delta}IEC reduces mTORC1 signaling. Surprisingly, Slc7a5{Delta}IEC mice have increased cell proliferation but reduced secretory cells, particularly mature Paneth cells. scRNA-seq and electron microscopic analyses revealed dedifferentiation of Paneth cells in Slc7a5{Delta}IEC mice, leading to markedly reduced secretory granules with little effect on Paneth cell number. We further show that Slc7a5{Delta}IEC mice are prone to experimental colitis. Thus, SLC7A5 regulates secretory cell differentiation to affect stem cell niche and/or inflammatory response to regulate cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells of the myeloid lineage distributed in tissues throughout the body. Phenotypically, they are a heterogeneous group characterized by different protease repertoires stored in secretory granules and differential presence of receptors. To adequately address aspects of MC biology either primary MCs isolated from human or mouse tissue or different human MC lines, like HMC-1.1 and -1.2, or rodent MC lines like L138.8A or RBL-2H3 are frequently used. Nevertheless, cellular systems to study MC functions are very limited. We have generated a murine connective tissue-like MC line, termed PMC-306, derived from primary peritoneal MCs (PMCs), which spontaneously transformed. We analyzed PMC-306 cells regarding MC surface receptor expression, effector functions and respective signaling pathways, and found that the cells reacted very similar to primary wildtype (WT) PMCs. In this regard, stimulation with MAS-related G-protein-coupled receptor member B2 (MRGPRB2) ligands induced respective signaling and effector functions. Furthermore, PMC-306 cells revealed significantly accelerated cell cycle progression, which however was still dependent on IL-3 and stem cell factor (SCF). Phenotypically, PMC-306 cells adopted an immature connective tissue-like MCs appearance. The reason for immortalization most likely is the loss of the two critical cell cycle regulators Cdkn2a/INK4A and Arf/p19, respectively. The loss of Cdkn2a and Arf expression could be mimicked in primary bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) by SCF supplementation strongly arguing for an involvement of KIT activation in the transformation process. Hence, this new cell line might be a useful tool to study further aspects of PMC function and to address tumorigenic processes associated with MC leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Immune defense is comprised of 1) resistance: the ability to reduce pathogen load, and 2) tolerance: the ability to limit the disease severity induced by a given pathogen load. The study of tolerance in the field of animal immunity is fairly nascent in comparison to resistance. Consequently, studies which examine immune defense comprehensively (i.e., considering both resistance and tolerance in conjunction) are uncommon, despite their exigency in achieving a thorough understanding of immune defense. Furthermore, understanding tolerance in arthropod disease vectors is uniquely relevant, as tolerance is essential to the cyclical transmission of pathogens by arthropods. Here, we tested the effect(s) of dietary sucrose concentration (high or low) and blood meal (present or absent) on resistance and tolerance to Escherichia coli infection in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Resistance and tolerance were measured concurrently and at multiple timepoints. We found that both blood and sucrose affected resistance. Mosquitoes from the low sugar treatment displayed enhanced resistance at all timepoints post-infection compared to those from the high sugar treatment. Additionally, blood-fed mosquitoes showed enhanced resistance compared to non-blood-fed mosquitoes, but only on day 1 post-infection. Sucrose had no effect on tolerance, but the effect of blood was significant and dynamic across time. Specifically, we show that consuming blood prior to infection ameliorates a temporal decline in tolerance that mosquitoes experience when provided with only sugar meals. Taken together, our findings indicate that different dietary components can have unique and sometimes temporally dynamic impacts on resistance and tolerance. Finally, our findings 1) highlight the value of experimental and analytical frameworks which consider the explicit testing of effects on both resistance and tolerance as separate, but equally important, components of immune defense, and 2) underscore the importance of including a temporal component in studies of immune defense.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is beta herpesvirus that persists indefinitely in the human host through a protracted, latent infection. The polycistronic UL133-UL138 gene locus of HCMV encodes genes regulating latency and reactivation. While UL138 is pro-latency, restricting virus replication in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), UL135 overcomes this restriction for reactivation. By contrast, UL136 is expressed with later kinetics and encodes multiple protein isoforms with differential roles in latency and reactivation. Like UL135, the largest UL136 isoform, UL136p33, is required for reactivation from latency in hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, UL136p33 is unstable, and its instability is important for the establishment of latency and sufficient accumulation of UL136p33 is a checkpoint for reactivation. We hypothesized that stabilizing UL136p33 might overcome the requirement of UL135 for reactivation. To test this, we generated recombinant viruses lacking UL135 that expressed a stabilized variant of UL136p33. Stabilizing UL136p33 did not impact replication of the UL135-mutant virus in fibroblasts. However, in the context of infection in hematopoietic cells, stabilization of UL136p33 strikingly compensated for the loss of UL135, resulting in increased replication in CD34+ HPCs and in humanized NOD-scid IL2R{gamma}cnull (NSG) mice. This finding suggests that while UL135 is essential for reactivation, it functions at steps preceding the accumulation of UL136p33 and that stabilized expression of UL136p33 largely overcomes the requirement for UL135 in reactivation. Taken together, our genetic evidence indicates an epistatic relationship between UL136p33 and UL135 whereby UL135 may initiate events early in reactivation that will result in the accumulation of UL136p33 to a threshold required for productive reactivation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is one of nine human herpesviruses and a significant human pathogen. While HCMV establishes a life-long latent infection that is typically asymptomatic in healthy individuals, its reactivation from latency can have devastating consequences in the immune compromised. Defining virus-host and virus-virus interactions important for HCMV latency, reactivation and replication is critical to defining the molecular basis of latent and replicative states and in controlling infection and CMV disease. Here we define a genetic relationship between two viral genes in controlling virus reactivation from latency using primary human hematopoietic progenitor cell and humanized mouse models.",

The infection process is controlled by over 330 effector proteins delivered through the type IV secretion system. In this study, we report that the Legionella MavH effector harbors a lipid-binding domain that specifically recognizes PI(3)P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) and localizes to endosomes when ectopically expressed. We show that MavH recruits host actin capping proteins (CP) and actin to the endosome via its CP interacting (CPI) motif and WH2-like actin-binding domain, respectively. In vitro assays revealed that MavH stimulates robust actin polymerization only in the presence of PI(3)P-containing liposomes and the recruitment of CP by MavH negatively regulates F-actin density at the membrane. Furthermore, in L. pneumophila-infected cells, MavH can be detected around the LCV at the very early stage of infection. Together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of membrane-dependent actin polymerization catalyzed by MavH that may play a role at the early stage of L. pneumophila infection by regulating host actin dynamics.",

While liver functional zonation and adaptability to fluctuating conditions are known to rely on a sophisticated cellular architecture, a comprehensive knowledge of nuclear receptor functions in the different liver cell types is still lacking. As a first step toward the accurate mapping of nuclear receptor functions in mouse liver, we characterized their levels of expression in whole liver as a function of time and diet, and explored nuclear receptor isoform expression in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and liver sinusoidal cells.

However, very little is known on how this network regulates stress responses in neurodegeneration. Here we describe ischemia induced alterations in the ncRNA network both in vitro and in vivo and in transgenic mice lacking ciRS-7 or miR-7. Our data show that cortical neurons downregulate ciRS-7 and Cyrano and upregulate miR-7 expression upon ischemic insults. Mice lacking ciRS-7 show reduced lesion size and motor impairment, whilst the absence of miR-7 alone leads to an increase in the ischemia induced neuronal death. Moreover, miR-7 levels in pyramidal excitatory neurons regulate dendrite morphology and glutamatergic signaling suggesting a potential molecular link to the in vivo phenotype. Our data reveal a new endogenous mechanism by which ciRS-7 and miR-7 regulate the outcome of ischemic stroke and shed new light into the pathophysiological roles of intracellular networks of non-coding RNAs in the brain.",

    "abstract": "ZMYM2 is a zinc finger transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in promoting and maintaining cell identity. It has been implicated in several diseases such as congenital anomalies of the kidney where its activity is diminished and cancer where it participates in oncogenic fusion protein events. ZMYM2 is thought to function through promoting transcriptional repression and here we provide more evidence to support this designation. Here we studied ZMYM2 function in human cells and demonstrate that ZMYM2 is part of distinct chromatin-bound complexes including the established LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 corepressor complex. We also identify new functional and physical interactions with ADNP and TRIM28/KAP1. The ZMYM2-TRIM28 complex forms in a SUMO-dependent manner and is associated with repressive chromatin. ZMYM2 and TRIM28 show strong functional similarity and co-regulate a large number of genes. However, there are no strong links between ZMYM2-TRIM28 binding events and nearby individual gene regulation. Instead, ZMYM2-TRIM28 appears to regulate genes in a more regionally defined manner within TADs where it can directly regulate co-associated retrotransposon expression. We find that different types of ZMYM2 binding complex associate with and regulate distinct subclasses of retrotransposons, with ZMYM2-ADNP complexes at SINEs and ZMYM2-TRIM28 complexes at LTR elements. We propose a model whereby ZMYM2 acts directly through retrotransposon regulation, which may then potentially affect the local chromatin environment and associated coding gene expression.\n\nGenome browser sessionUCSC browser session containing the peak tracks: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr1:18,078,462-18,084,961&hide=all&hgct_customText=http://bartzabel.ls.manchester.ac.uk/sharrockslab/yaoyong/ZNF198/index_file_hg19_chipSeq_ZMYM2_final.txt\n\nOriginal ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data from U2OS cells can be viewed On ArrayExpress at: E-MTAB-12292 (ADNP and TRIM28 ChIP-seq), E-MTAB-12293 (SUMO ChIP-seq) and E-MTAB-12294 (ATAC-seq)",

Cellular clocks provide circadian rhythms for cellular functions via transcriptional and cytoskeletal regulation. The vast majority of mammalian cells possess a primary cilium, an organelle protruding from the cell surface. Here, we investigated the little-known relationship between circadian rhythm and primary cilia. The length and number of primary cilia showed circadian dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. The circadian rhythm of primary cilia morphology was abolished by SR9011, a clock genes suppressor. A centrosomal protein, pericentrin, transiently accumulates in centriolar satellites, the base of primary cilia at the shortest cilia phase, and induces elongation of primary cilia at the longest cilia phase in the circadian rhythm of primary cilia. In addition, rhythmic cell migration during wound healing depends on the length of primary cilia and affects the rate of wound healing. Our findings demonstrate that the circadian dynamics of primary cilia length by clock genes control fibroblast migration and could provide new insights into chronobiology.",

    "abstract": "From their essential function in building up the nuclear pore complexes, nucleoporins have expanded roles beyond nuclear transport. Hence, their contribution to chromatin organization and gene expression has set them as critical players in development and pathologies. We previously reported that Nup133 and Seh1, two components of the Y-complex subunit of the nuclear pore scaffold, are dispensable for mouse embryonic stem cell viability but required for their survival during neuroectodermal differentiation. Here, a transcriptomic analysis revealed that Nup133 regulates a subset of genes at early stages of neuroectodermal differentiation, including Lhx1 and Nup210L, encoding a newly validated nucleoporin. These genes were also misregulated in Nup133{triangleup}Mid neuronal progenitors, in which NPC basket assembly is impaired, as previously observed in pluripotent cells. However, a four-fold reduction of Nup133, despite affecting basket assembly, is not sufficient to alter Nup210L and Lhx1 regulation. Finally, these two genes are also misregulated in Seh1-deficient neural progenitors that only show a mild decrease in NPC density. Together these data reveal a shared function of Y-complex nucleoporins in gene regulation during neuroectodermal differentiation, which seem independent of nuclear pore basket assembly.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) is conserved in all eukaryotes yet its activity in metazoans is thought divergent from lower eukaryotes like fungi. To address this discrepancy, structure-based sequence alignments revealed a conserved but non-canonical, three-residue insert in a turn of FIS1, suggesting conserved activity. In vertebrate FIS1 this insert is serine (S45), lysine (K46), and tyrosine (Y47). To determine the biological role of this \"SKY insert\", three variants were evaluated for their fold, and tested in HCT116 cells for altered mitochondrial morphology and recruitment of effectors, DRP1 and TBC1D15. Substitution of the SKY insert with three alanine residues (AAA), or deletion of the insert ({Delta}SKY), did not substantially alter the fold or thermal stability of the protein. Replacing SKY with a canonical turn ({Delta}SKYD49G) introduced significant conformational heterogeneity by NMR that was removed upon deletion of a known regulatory region, the FIS1 arm. Expression of AAA fragmented mitochondria into perinuclear clumps associated with increased mitochondrial DRP1 similar to the wild-type protein. In contrast, expression of {Delta}SKY variants elongated mitochondrial networks and reduced mitochondrial DRP1. Co-expression of YFP-TBC1D15 partially rescued mitochondrial morphology and DRP1 recruitment for {Delta}SKY variants, although {Delta}SKY variants were markedly unable to support TBC1D15 assembly into punctate structures found upon co-expression with wildtype FIS1 or the AAA variant. Collectively these results show that FIS1 activity can be modulated by conserved residues supporting a generalized model whereby FIS1 is governed by intramolecular interactions between the regulatory FIS1 arm and SKY insert that may be conserved across species.",

    "abstract": "Adverse maternal environments such as small size, malnutrition and metabolic conditions are known to influence fetal growth outcomes. Similarly, fetal growth and metabolic alterations may alter the intrauterine environment and affect all fetuses in multiple gestations/litter bearing species. The placenta is the site of convergence between signals derived from the mother and the developing fetus/es. Its functions are fuelled by energy generated by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The aim of this study was to delineate the role of an altered maternal and/or fetal/intrauterine environment in feto-placental growth and placental mitochondrial energetic capacity. To address this, in mice we used disruptions of the gene encoding phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p110, a growth and metabolic regulator to perturb the maternal and/or fetal/intrauterine environment and study the impact on wildtype conceptuses. We found that feto-placental growth was modified by a perturbed maternal and intrauterine environment, and effects were most evident for wildtype males compared to females. However, placental mitochondrial complex I+II OXPHOS and total electron transport system (ETS) capacity were similarly reduced for both fetal sexes, yet reserve capacity was additionally decreased in males in response to the maternal and intrauterine perturbations. These were also sex-dependant differences in the placental abundance of mitochondrial-related proteins (e.g. citrate synthase, ETS complexes), and activity of growth/metabolic signalling pathways (AKT and MAPK) with maternal and intrauterine alterations. Our findings thus identify that the mother and intrauterine environment provided by littermates, modulate feto-placental growth, and placental bioenergetics and metabolic signalling in a manner dependent on fetal sex. This may have relevance for understanding the pathways leading to reduced fetal growth, particularly in the context of suboptimal maternal environments and multiple gestations/litter bearing species.",

Here, we establish a quantitative morphomap of pre-implantation embryogenesis in mouse, rabbit and monkey embryos, which reveals that although blastomere divisions desynchronise passively without compensation, 8-cell embryos still display robust 3D structure. Using topological analysis and genetic perturbations in mouse, we show that embryos progressively change their cellular connectivity to a preferred topology, which can be predicted by a simple physical model where noise and actomyosin-driven compaction facilitate topological transitions lowering surface energy. This favours the most compact embryo packing at the 8- and 16-cell stage, thus promoting higher number of inner cells. Impairing mitotic desynchronisation reduces embryo packing compactness and generates significantly more cell mis-allocation and a lower proportion of inner-cell-mass-fated cells, suggesting that stochasticity in division timing contributes to achieving robust patterning and morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Major traits defining the life history of organisms are often not independent from each other, with most of their variation aligning along key axes such as the pace-of-life axis. We can define a pace-of-life axis structuring reproduction and development time as a continuum from less-fecund, longer-developing  slow types to more-fecund, shorter-developing  fast types. Such axes, along with their potential associations or syndromes with other traits such as dispersal, are however not universal; in particular, support for their presence may be taxon and taxonomic scale-dependent. Knowing about such life-history strategies may be especially important for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, as these trait syndromes may constrain trait variation or be correlated with other traits. To understand how life-history traits and effective dispersal covary, we measured these traits in controlled conditions for 28 lines from five species of Trichogramma, which are small endoparasitoid wasps frequently used as a biological model in experimental evolution but also in biocontrol against Lepidoptera pests. We found partial evidence of a pace-of-life axis at the interspecific level: species with higher fecundity also had faster development time. However, faster-developing species also were more likely to delay egg-laying, a trait that is usually interpreted as \"slow\". There was no support for similar covariation patterns at the within-species line level. There was limited variation in effective dispersal between species and lines, and accordingly, we did not detect any correlation between effective dispersal probability and life-history traits. We discuss how expanding our experimental design by accounting for the density-dependence of both the pace of life and dispersal might improve our understanding of those traits and how they interact with each other. Overall, our results highlight the importance of exploring covariation at the \"right\" taxonomic scale, or multiple taxonomic scales, to understand the (co)evolution of life-history traits. They also suggest that optimizing both reproductive and development traits to maximize the efficiency of biocontrol may be difficult in programs using only one species.",

    "abstract": "The human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 antigen after infection or vaccination is defined by the durable production of antibodies and T cells. Population-based monitoring typically focuses on antibody titer, but there is a need for improved characterization and quantification of T cell responses. Here, we utilize multimodal sequencing technologies to perform a longitudinal analysis of circulating human leukocytes collected before and after BNT162b2 immunization. Our data reveal distinct subpopulations of CD8+ T cells which reliably appear 28 days after prime vaccination (7 days post boost). Using a suite of cross-modality integration tools, we define their transcriptome, accessible chromatin landscape, and immunophenotype, and identify unique biomarkers within each modality. By leveraging DNA-oligo-tagged peptide-MHC multimers and T cell receptor sequencing, we demonstrate that this vaccine-induced population is SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific and capable of rapid clonal expansion. Moreover, we also identify these CD8+ populations in scRNA-seq datasets from COVID-19 patients and find that their relative frequency and differentiation outcomes are predictive of subsequent clinical outcomes. Our work contributes to our understanding of T cell immunity, and highlights the potential for integrative and multimodal analysis to characterize rare cell populations.",

They are found abundantly in soil-dwelling microbes and bacteria which thrive in the stomachs of ruminant mammals. Two protein domains, cohesins and dockerins, characterise cellulosomes. These domains interact with each other to form enormous complexes with as many as 130 individual proteins. Annotation of the genome of Cellulosilyticum lenotcellum DSM 5427 revealed one single cohesin and one single dockerin domain. This pales in comparison to most cellulosomal organisms. We have recombinantly produced the proteins which bear these domains and demonstrated cellulase activity, which is enhanced by interaction between the two proteins. Moreover we have identified additional novel interacting partners for this unique cellulosome complex. This broadens the repertoire and definitions of cellulosomes overall.",

    "abstract": "Late-stage prostate cancer often acquires resistance to conventional chemotherapies and transforms into a hormone-refractory, drug-resistant, and non-curative disease. Developing non-invasive tools to detect the biochemical changes that correlate with drug efficacy and reveal the onset of drug resistance would have important ramifications in managing the treatment regimen for individual patients. Here, we report the selection of new Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) that show high affinity toward prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker used in clinical monitoring of prostate cancer. Ribosome display and in vitro screening tools were used to select PSA-binding DARPins based on their binding affinity, selectivity, and chemical constitution. Surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrated that the four lead candidates bind to PSA with nanomolar affinity. DARPins were site-specifically functionalised at a unique C-terminal cysteine with the hexadentate aza-nonamacrocyclic chelate (NODAGA) for subsequent radiolabelling with the positron-emitting radionuclide 68Ga. [68Ga]GaNODAGA-DARPins showed high stability toward transchelation and were stable in human serum for >2 h. Radioactive binding assays using streptavidin-loaded magnetic beads confirmed that the functionalisation and radiolabelling did not compromise the specificity of [68Ga]GaNODAGA-DARPins toward PSA. Biodistribution experiments in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts derived from the LNCaP cell line revealed that three of the four [68Ga]GaNODAGA-DARPins displayed specific tumour-binding in vivo. For DARPin-6, tumour-uptake in the normal group reached 4.16 {+/-} 0.58 %ID g-1 (n = 3; 2 h post-administration) and was reduced by [~]50% in the blocking group (2.47 {+/-} 0.42 %ID g-1; n = 3; P-value = 0.018). Collectively, the experimental results support the future development of new PSA-specific imaging agents for potential use in monitoring the efficacy of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is characterized by its highly desmoplastic stroma. Myofibroblasts (MFs) are present both within the tumor mass (intratumoral MFs, iMFs) and at the tumor border (peritumoral MFs, pMFs). Using a spheroid-based coculture system, we show that the initial iCCA-pMF contact is growth suppressive to the tumor cells. However, prolonged iCCA-pMF interaction elicits significant tumor cell invasion and dissemination. We find that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (Vcam1) level is elevated in tumor cells in contact with pMFs but low in disseminated tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. A gene regulatory network analysis of mouse and patient iCCA tumors and Vcam1 knockout (Vcam1KO) demonstrate a heavy involvement of Vcam1 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While Vcam1KO has only a limited impact on tumor cell growth in their monoculture, Vcam1KO spheroids exhibit instant dissemination and a severe growth defect when cocultured with pMFs. When transplanted into the liver, Vcam1KO iCCA cells show a similar increase in dissemination but a significant defect in establishing primary and metastatic tumors. Incomplete blocking of Vcam1 in vivo reduces the size but increase the number of metastatic lesions. Overall, our study shows a spatiotemporal regulation of iCCA growth and dissemination by pMFs in a Vcam1-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models involve the engraftment of tumour tissue in immunocompromised mice and represent an important pre-clinixtcal oncology research. A limitation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) PDX model derivation in NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice is that a subset of initial engraftments are of lymphocytic, rather than tumour origin. In the lung TRACERx PDX pipeline, lymphoproliferations occurred in 17.8% of lung adenocarcinoma and 10% of lung squamous cell carcinoma transplantations, despite none of these patients having a prior or subsequent clinical history of lymphoproliferative disease. Lymphoproliferations were predominantly human CD20+ B cells and had the immunophenotype expected for post-transplantation diffuse large B cell lymphoma. All lymphoproliferations expressed Epstein-Barr-encoded RNAs (EBER). Analysis of immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangements in three tumours where multiple tumour regions had resulted in lymphoproliferations suggested that each had independent clonal origins. Overall, these data suggest the presence of B cell clones with lymphoproliferative potential within primary NSCLC tumours that are under continuous immune surveillance. Since these cells can be expanded following transplantation into NSG mice, our data highlight the value of quality control measures to identify lymphoproliferations within xenograft pipelines and support the incorporation of strategies to minimise lymphoproliferations during the early stages of xenograft establishment pipelines. To present the histology data herein, we developed a Python-based tool for generating patient-level pathology overview figures from whole-slide image files; PATHOverview is available on GitHub (https://github.com/EpiCENTR-Lab/PATHOverview).",

    "abstract": "Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) are malignancies with ill-defined hereditary predisposition. Some germline variants influencing the risk of DTCs localize in disrupted in renal carcinoma 3 (DIRC3), a poorly characterized long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene. Here, we characterized the function of DIRC3 in DTCs. We established that DIRC3 is downregulated in DTCs, and its high expression may reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in patients. DIRC3 transcripts were enriched in cell nuclei in vitro, where they upregulated insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), a gene known to modulate the cellular response to insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Silencing of DIRC3 in thyroid cancer cell lines produced a phenotypic dichotomy: it augmented cell migration and invasiveness, reduced apoptosis, but abrogated the MTT reduction rate. We demonstrated that the pro-migratory phenotype was produced by the downregulation of IGFBP5. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed a functional redundancy in the activities of DIRC3 and IGFBP5. Moreover, downregulation of DIRC3 enhanced the susceptibility of cancer cells to IGF-1 stimulation and promoted Akt signaling. In conclusion, DIRC3 expression alters the phenotype of thyroid cancer cells and modulates the activity of IGFBP5/IGF-1/Akt axis. We propose an interplay between DIRC3 and IGF signaling as a mechanism that promotes thyroid carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene are the paradigm of a cross-cancer alteration in a non-coding region. TERT promoter mutations (TPMs) are biomarkers of poor prognosis in several tumors, including thyroid cancers. TPMs enhance TERT transcription, which is otherwise silenced in adult tissues, thus reactivating a bona fide oncoprotein. To study TERT deregulation and its downstream consequences, we generated a Tert mutant promoter mouse model via CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of the murine equivalent locus (Tert-123C>T) and crossed it with thyroid-specific BrafV600E-mutant mice. We also employed an alternative model of Tert overexpression (K5-Tert). Whereas all BrafV600E animals developed well-differentiated papillary thyroid tumors, 29% and 36% of BrafV600E+Tert-123C>T and BrafV600E+K5-Tert mice progressed to poorly differentiated thyroid cancers at week 20, respectively. Braf+Tert tumors showed increased mitosis and necrosis in areas of solid growth, and older animals from these cohorts displayed anaplastic-like features, i.e., spindle cells and macrophage infiltration. Murine Tert promoter mutation increased Tert transcription in vitro and in vivo, but temporal and intra-tumoral heterogeneity was observed. RNA-sequencing of thyroid tumor cells showed that processes other than the canonical Tert-mediated telomere maintenance role operate in these specimens. Pathway analysis showed that MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, as well as processes not previously associated with this tumor etiology, involving cytokine and chemokine signaling, were overactivated. Braf+Tert animals remained responsive to MAPK pathway inhibitors. These models constitute useful pre-clinical tools to understand the cell-autonomous and microenvironment-related consequences of Tert-mediated progression in advanced thyroid cancers and other aggressive tumors carrying TPMs.",

In this study, we found ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunit M2 (RRM2) was one of the key genes supporting cell proliferation in high-risk HB. While standard chemotherapies could effectively suppress RRM2 in HB cells, they induced a significant upregulation of the other RNR M2 subunit, RRM2B. Computational analysis revealed distinct signaling networks RRM2 and RRM2B were involved in HB patient tumors, with RRM2 supporting cell proliferation and RRM2B participating heavily in stress response pathways. Indeed, RRM2B upregulation in chemotherapy-treated HB cells promoted cell survival and subsequent relapse, during which RRM2B was gradually replaced back by RRM2. Combining an RRM2 inhibitor with chemotherapy showed an effective delaying of HB tumor relapse in vivo. Overall, our study revealed the distinct roles of the two RNR M2 subunits and their dynamic switching during HB cell proliferation and stress response.",

Soil was incubated with cefotaxime, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim in 18O-water. Metagenomes and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the labelled \"heavy\" and the unlabelled \"light\" SIP fractions were sequenced.\n\nResultsAfter incubations, an increase of the 16S rRNA copy numbers in the \"heavy\" fractions of the treatments with 18O-water compared with their controls was detected. The treatments resulted in differences in the community composition of bacteria. Members of the phyla Acidobacteriota (formally Acidobacteria) are highly abundant after two days of incubation with antibiotics. Several Pseudomonadota (formally Proteobacteria) including Stenotrophomonas were prominent after four days of incubation. Furthermore, a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG-1) from the genus Stenotrophomonas (90.7% complete) was retrieved from the heavy fraction. Finally, 11 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were identified in the unbinned-assembled heavy fractions, and 10 ARGs were identified in MAG-1. On the other hand, only two ARGs from the unbinned-assembled light fractions were identified.\n\nConclusionsThe results indicate that both non-pathogenic soil-dwelling bacteria as well as potential clinical pathogens are present in this agricultural soil, and several ARGs were identified from the labelled communities, but it is still unclear if horizontal gene transfer between these groups can occur.",

    "abstract": "Ewing Sarcoma (EwS) is an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor driven by the fusion oncoprotein EWSR1-FLI1. This aberrant transcription factor binds to GGAA microsatellites, causing epigenetic reprogramming through the formation of active neo-enhancers in a permissive cellular context. Inhibition of the oncogene remains challenging and current efforts instead seek to exploit emergent epigenetic treatments targeting EWSR1-FLI1 cofactors. Here, stemming from the genome-wide redistribution of H3K27me3 upon expression of EWSR1-FLI1 in pediatric hMSC, we unravel the contribution of the H3K27me3 demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B in transcriptional activation at EWSR1-FLI1 enhancers. We found that KDM6A has a demethylase-independent role in recruiting the SWI/SNF member BRG1 at EWSR1-FLI1-primed enhancers containing single GGAA motif, which is critical for EwS tumor growth. Conversely, KDM6B demethylates H3K27me3 at EWSR1-FLI1-active enhancers containing multimeric GGAA repeats and its deletion synergizes with EZH2 inhibitors. Our results highlight KDM6 demethylases as EWSR1-FLI1 cofactors with potential for future targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Following infection, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) support immunity by increasing the rate of innate immune cell production but the metabolic cues that guide this process are unknown. To address this question, we developed MetaFate, a method to trace the metabolic expression state and developmental fate of single cells in vivo. Using MetaFate we identified a gene expression program of metabolic enzymes and transporters that confers differences in myeloid differentiation potential in a subset of HSPCs that express CD62L. Using single-cell metabolic profiling, we confirmed that CD62Lhigh myeloid-biased HSPCs have an increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylation and glucose metabolism. Importantly, metabolism actively regulates immune-cell production, with overexpression of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway skewing MPP output from B-lymphocytes towards the myeloid lineages, and expansion of CD62Lhigh HSPCs occurring to support emergency myelopoiesis. Collectively, our data reveal the metabolic cues that instruct innate immune cell development, highlighting a key role for the pentose phosphate pathway. More broadly, our results show that HSPC metabolism can be manipulated to alter the cellular composition of the immune system.",
