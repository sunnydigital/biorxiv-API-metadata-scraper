    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators that activate silencing mechanisms by annealing to mRNA transcripts. While plant miRNAs match their targets with nearly-full complementarity leading to mRNA cleavage, miRNAs in most animals require only a short sequence called  seed to inhibit target translation. Recent findings showed that miRNAs in cnidarians, early branching metazoans, act similarly to plant miRNAs, by exhibiting full complementarity and target cleavage; however, it remained unknown if seed-based regulation was possible in cnidarians. Here, we investigate the miRNA-target complementarity requirements for miRNA activity in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. We show that bilaterian-like complementarity of seed match or seed and supplementary 3 matches are insufficient for miRNA-mediated knockdown. Furthermore, mismatches in the cleavage site, positions 10-11 of the miRNA, decrease knockdown efficiency. Finally, we assayed miRNA silencing of a target with three seed binding sites in the 3 untranslated region to mimic typical miRNA targeting and observed no repression. Altogether, these results unravel striking similarities between plant and cnidarian miRNAs consolidating the evidence for common evolutionary origin of miRNAs in plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMembers of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex are co-opted in viral infection, leading to susceptibility in many crop species, including stone fruit trees (Prunus spp). Therefore, modification of one of those eukaryotic translation initiation factors or changes in their gene expression may result in resistance.\n\nObjectiveWe searched the crop and wild Prunus germplasm from the Armeniaca and Amygdalus taxonomic sections for allelic variants in the eIF4E and eIFiso4E genes, to identify alleles potentially linked to resistance to the Plum Pox Virus (PPV).\n\nMethodology and resultsOver one thousand stone fruit accessions (1,397) were screened for variation in eIF4E and eIFiso4E transcript sequences which are in single copy within the diploid Prunus genome. We identified new alleles for both genes that are not evident in haplotypes associated with PPV susceptible individuals. Overall, analyses showed that eIFiso4E is genetically more constrained since it displayed less polymorphism than eIF4E. We also demonstrated more variation at both loci in the related wild species than in crop species. As the eIFiso4E translation initiation factor was identified as indispensable for PPV infection in Prunus species, a selection of ten different eIFiso4E haplotypes along 13 individuals were tested by infection with PPV and eight of them displayed a range of reduced susceptibility to resistance, indicating new potential sources of resistance to sharka.",

    "abstract": "Macroalgae biomass production models that capture nutrient dynamics, temperature, light, and salinity are important for the design and operation of large-scale farms. The goal of this study is to understand how the nitrogen fertilizing regime, relating to fertilizing dose (M N week-1), amplitude (M N), and duration (hours), affects the dynamics of nitrogen content and biomass production of the Ulva sp. macroalgae. We hypothesize that the nitrogen fertilizing regime controls the Ulva Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), defined here as the fraction of fertilizer nitrogen that is utilized and allocated to yield N, and, accordingly, also nitrogen assimilation in the biomass and the growth rate. We test this hypothesis by measuring internal nitrogen and biomass weight and by calculating NUE under various fertilization regimes in controlled photobioreactors. Based on this experimental data, we developed a biomass productivity model that predicts nitrogen and biomass dynamics in time over three weeks of cultivation. This study points out efficient fertilizing regimes and enables the development of a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic relationship between external N, internal N, and biomass production of the Ulva sp. macroalgae under varying external N levels, which is important for real-world agricultural applications. This study provides a better understanding of the external N-internal N-biomass triangle followed by an improved dynamic cultivation model, enabling better control of nutrient application and biomass production in macroalgae farming for a sustainable marine bioeconomy.",

    "abstract": "Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies measure mRNA expression at thousands of locations in a tissue slice. However, nearly all SRT technologies measure expression in two dimensional slices extracted from a three-dimensional tissue, thus losing information that is shared across multiple slices from the same tissue. Integrating SRT data across multiple slices can help recover this information and improve downstream expression analyses, but multi-slice alignment and integration remains a challenging task. Existing methods for integrating SRT data either do not use spatial information or assume that the morphology of the tissue is largely preserved across slices, an assumption that is often violated due to biological or technical reasons. We introduce PASTE2, a method for partial alignment and 3D reconstruction of multi-slice SRT datasets, allowing only partial overlap between aligned slices and/or slice-specific cell types. PASTE2 formulates a novel partial Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport problem, which we solve using a conditional gradient algorithm. PASTE2 includes a model selection procedure to estimate the fraction of overlap between slices, and optionally uses information from histological images that accompany some SRT experiments. We show on both simulated and real data that PASTE2 obtains more accurate alignments than existing methods. We further use PASTE2 to reconstruct a 3D map of gene expression in a Drosophila embryo from a 16 slice Stereo-seq dataset. PASTE2 produces accurate alignments of multi-slice datasets from multiple SRT technologies, enabling detailed studies of spatial gene expression across a wide range of biological applications.\n\nCode availabilitySoftware is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/paste2",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy affects millions of people worldwide every year and remains an open subject for research. Current development on this field has focused on obtaining computational models to better understand its triggering mechanisms, attain realistic descriptions and study seizure suppression. Controllers have been successfully applied to mitigate epileptiform activity in dynamic models written in state-space notation, whose applicability is, however, restricted to signatures that are accurately described by them. Alternatively, autoregressive modeling (AR), a typical data-driven tool related to system identification (SI), can be directly applied to signals to generate more realistic models, and since it is inherently convertible into state-space, it can thus be used for the artificial reconstruction and attenuation of seizures as well. Considering this, the first objective of this work is to propose an SI approach using AR models to describe real epileptiform activity. The second objective is to provide a strategy for reconstructing and mitigating such activity artificially, considering non-hybrid and hybrid controllers - designed from ictal and interictal events, respectively. The results show that AR models of relatively low order represent epileptiform activities fairly well and both controllers are effective in attenuating the undesired activity while simultaneously driving the signal to an interictal stage. These findings may lead to customized models based on each signal, brain region or patient, from which it is possible to better define shape, frequency and duration of external stimuli that are necessary to attenuate seizures.\n\nAuthor summaryEpilepsy is perhaps one of the most studied brain disorders and it is still not sufficiently well understood. The use of computational models is useful in this case since several simulations can be run using them, such that experience and insight about seizures can be gained without necessarily carrying out experiments. These models are usually designed with or without some knowledge about the brain region or phenomenon. Seizure attenuation approaches have been proposed for the first case, but they are limited to the type of seizure correctly described by the model. The present work proposes a similar procedure for the second one (where only the data are available and nothing else is assumed), which is regarded as more realistic due to its direct application on the signals and can lead to customized models for each activity, brain region or patient, defining important information such as the shape, frequency and duration of the external stimuli that must be applied to mitigate a seizure.",

We further devised a Metabolic Flexibility Factor (MFF) to quantitate metabolic flexibility, with higher MFF indicating higher metabolic flexibility. The collective results indicated that a diet high in slowly digestible starch exhibited higher metabolic flexibility (MFF) than diets high in resistant starch, sucrose, or fat. These findings show a new-found benefit of consuming slowly digestible carbohydrates for improved metabolic health.",

Here, we used a novel knockdown approach to selectively reduce astrocyte N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). We found that these ionotropic receptors contribute to astrocyte Ca2+ transients encoding sensory information. This was essential for the optimal processing of sensory information in nearby neurons, since a reduction in astrocyte NMDARs caused circuit dysfunction and impaired neuronal responses to stimulation. This led to sensory discrimination deficits in the animal. Overall, our findings show that astrocytes can rapidly respond to glutamatergic transmission via their NMDAR and these receptors are an important component for astrocyte-neuron interactions that regulate cortical sensory discrimination in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Past work has shown that chronic exposure of Drosophila to intense monomolecular odors in early life leads to homeostatic adaptation of olfactory neural responses and behavioral habituation to the familiar odor. Here, we found that, in contrast, persistent exposure to natural odors in early life increases behavioral attraction selectively to familiar odors. Odor experience increases the attractiveness of natural odors that are innately attractive and decreases the aversiveness of natural odors that are innately aversive. These changes in olfactory behavior are unlikely to arise from changes in the sensitivity of olfactory neurons at the first stages of olfactory processing: odor-evoked output from antennal lobe projection neurons was unchanged by chronic exposure to natural odors in terms of olfactory sensitivity, relational distances between odors, or response dynamics. We reveal a requirement for additional features of the environment beyond the odor in establishing odor experience-dependent behavioral plasticity. Passive odor exposure in a featureless environment lacking strong reinforcing cues was insufficient to elicit changes in olfactory preference; however, the same odor exposure resulted in behavioral plasticity when food was present in the environment. Together, these results indicate that behavioral plasticity elicited by persistent exposure to natural odors in early life is mediated by an associative process. In addition, they highlight the importance of using naturalistic odor stimuli for investigating olfactory function.",

    "abstract": "Microbial overproduction of aromatic chemicals has gained considerable industrial interest and various metabolic engineering approaches have been employed in recent years to address the associated challenges. So far, most studies have used sugars (mostly glucose) or glycerol as the primary carbon source. In this study, we used ethylene glycol (EG) as the main carbon substrate. EG could be obtained from the degradation of plastic and cellulosic wastes. As a proof of concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to transform EG into L-tyrosine, a valuable aromatic amino acid. Under the best fermentation condition, the strain produced 2 g/L L-tyrosine from 10 g/L EG at approximately 50% of the theoretical yield, outperforming glucose (the most common sugar feedstock) in the same experimental conditions. To prove the concept that EG can be converted into different aromatic chemicals, E. coli was further engineered with a similar approach to synthesize other valuable aromatic chemicals, L-phenylalanine and p-coumaric acid. Finally, waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were degraded using acid hydrolysis and the resulting monomer EG was transformed into L-tyrosine using the engineered E. coli, yielding a comparable titer to that obtained using commercial EG. The strains developed in this study should be valuable to the community for producing valuable aromatics from EG.",

    "abstract": "Cell dynamics and biological function are governed by changing patterns of gene expression. Intricate gene interaction networks orchestrate these changes. Inferring these interactions from data is a notoriously difficult inverse problem. The majority of existing network inference methods work at the population level. They construct static representations of gene regulatory networks, and they do not naturally allow us to infer differences in gene regulation across heterogeneous cell populations. Here we build upon recent dynamical inference methods that model single cell dynamics using Markov processes, which leads to an information-theoretic approach, locaTE, which employs the localised transfer entropy to infer cell-specific, causal gene regulatory networks. LocaTE uses high-resolution estimates of dynamics and geometry of the cellular gene expression manifold to inform inference of regulatory interactions. We find that this approach is superior to static inference methods, often by a significant margin. We demonstrate that factor analysis can give detailed insights into the inferred cell-specific GRNs. In application to three experimental datasets, we demonstrate superior performance and additional insights compared to stancard static GRN inference methods. For example, we recover key transcription factors and regulatory interactions driving mouse primitive endoderm formation, pancreatic development, and haematopoiesis. For both simulated and experimental data, we find that locaTE provides a powerful, efficient and scalable network inference method that allows us to distil cell-specific networks from single cell data.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal bioelectric states regulate multiple aspects of embryogenesis. A key open question concerns how specific multicellular voltage potential patterns differentially activate distinct downstream genes required for organogenesis. To understand the information processing mechanisms underlying the relationship between spatial bioelectric patterns, genetics, and morphology, we focused on a specific spatiotemporal bioelectric pattern in the Xenopus ectoderm that regulates embryonic brain patterning. We used machine learning to design a minimal but scalable bioelectric-genetic dynamical network model of embryonic brain morphogenesis that qualitatively recapitulated previous experimental observations. A causal integration analysis of the model revealed a simple higher-order spatiotemporal information integration mechanism relating the spatial bioelectric and gene activity patterns, where the latter is expressed as a function of the causal influence of the voltages of groups of cells. Specific aspects of this mechanism include causal apportioning (certain cell positions are more important for collective decision making), informational asymmetry (depolarized cells are more influential than hyperpolarized cells), long distance influence (genes in a cell are variably sensitive to voltage of faraway cells), and division of labor (different genes are sensitive to different aspects of voltage pattern). The asymmetric information-processing character of the mechanism led the model to predict an unexpected degree of plasticity and robustness in the bioelectric prepattern that regulates normal embryonic brain development. Our in vivo experiments verified these predictions via molecular manipulations in Xenopus embryos. This work shows the power of using a minimal in silico approach to drastically reduce the parameter space in vivo, making hard biological questions tractable. These results provide insight into the collective decision-making process of cells in interpreting bioelectric pattens that guide large-scale morphogenesis, suggesting novel applications for biomedical interventions and new tools for synthetic bioengineering.",
