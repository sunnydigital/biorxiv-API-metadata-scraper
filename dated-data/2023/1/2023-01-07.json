    "abstract": "1Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) provides plant-based protein for global food production and is extensively bred to create cultivars with greater productivity in distinct environments. Plant breeders evaluate new soybean genotypes using multi-environment trials (MET). The application of MET assumes that trial locations provide representative environmental conditions that cultivars are likely to encounter when grown by farmers. In addition, MET are important to depict the patterns of genotype by environment interactions (GEI). To evaluate GEI for soybean seed yield and identify mega-environments (ME), a retrospective analysis of 39,006 data points from experimental soybean genotypes evaluated in preliminary and uniform field trials conducted by public plant breeders from 1989-2019 was considered. ME were identified from phenotypic information from the annual trials, geographic, soil, and meteorological records at the trial locations. Results indicate that yield variation was mostly explained by location and location by year interactions. The static portion of the GEI represented 26.30% of the total yield variance. Estimates of variance components derived from linear mixed models demonstrated that the phenotypic variation due to genotype by location interaction effects was greater than genotype by year interaction effects. A trend analysis indicated a two-fold increase in the genotypic variance between 1989-1995 and 1996-2019. Furthermore, the heterogeneous estimates of genotypic, genotype by location, genotype by year, and genotype by location by year variances, were encapsulated by distinct probability distributions. The observed target population of environments can be divided into at least two and at most three ME, thereby suggesting improvements in the response to selection can be achieved when selecting directly for clustered (i.e., regions, ME) versus selecting across regions. Clusters obtained using phenotypic data, latitude, and soil variables plus elevation, were the most effective. In addition, we published the R package SoyURT which contains the data sets used in this work.\n\n2 HighlightsO_LIMega-environments can be identified with phenotypic, geographic, and meteorological data.\nC_LIO_LIReliable estimates of variances can be obtained with proper analyses of historical data.\nC_LIO_LIGenotype by location was more important than genotype by year variation for seed yield.\nC_LIO_LIThe trend in genotype by environment variances was captured in probability distributions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Many studies have found that sequence in the 5 untranslated regions (UTRs) impacts the translation rate of an mRNA, but the regulatory grammar that underpins this translation regulation remains elusive. Deep learning methods deployed to analyse massive sequencing datasets offer new solutions to motif discovery. However, existing works focused on extracting sequence motifs in individual datasets, which may not be generalisable to other datasets from the same cell type. We hypothesise that motifs that are genuinely involved in controlling translation rate are the ones that can be extracted from diverse datasets generated by different experimental techniques. In order to reveal more generalised cis-regulatory motifs for RNA translation, we develop a multi-task translation rate predictor, MTtrans, to integrate information from multiple datasets. Compared to single-task models, MTtrans reaches a higher prediction accuracy in all the benchmarked datasets generated by various experimental techniques. We show that features learnt in human samples are directly transferable to another dataset in yeast systems, demonstrating its robustness in identifying evolutionarily conserved sequence motifs. Furthermore, our newly generated experimental data corroborated the effect of most of the identified motifs based on MTtrans trained using multiple public datasets, further demonstrating the utility of MTtrans for discovering generalisable motifs. MTtrans effectively integrates biological insights from diverse experiments and allows robust extraction of translation-associated sequence motifs in 5UTR.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been well described in the central nervous system; however, studies in the peripheral nervous system have largely focused on EVs derived from supporting cell types such as endothelial cells or glia. Here we isolate EVs derived from sympathetic neurons and characterize them using immunoblot assays, nanoparticle tracking analysis and cryo-electron microscopy. Sizing of sympathetic EVs reveal a predominant peak between 45-75 nm as well as a range of larger sizes (90 nm to >350 nm), possibly due to multiple biogenic origins. We identified TrkA, a receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), as a cargo for sympathetic EVs. Furthermore, TrkA on EVs was phosphorylated, indicating activated TrkA receptor. TrkA binds NGF at the axonal tip and is endocytosed and transported to the soma in signaling endosomes. We therefore examined if TrkA originating in the axon tip was subsequently able to be packaged into EVs and secreted by the somatodendritic domain of neurons. Using a compartmentalized culture system, we found that TrkA derived from endosomes originating in the distal axon can be detected on EVs secreted from the somatodendritic domain. In addition, inhibition of classic TrkA downstream pathways, specifically in somatodendritic compartments greatly decreases TrkA packaging into EVs. Our results suggest a novel trafficking route for TrkA: it can travel long distances to the cell body, be packaged into EVs and secreted. Secretion of TrkA via EVs appears to be regulated by its own downstream effector cascades, raising intriguing future questions about novel functionalities associated with TrkApositive EVs.",

    "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC), a conserved midbrain-node with extensive long-range connectivity throughout the brain, is a key structure for innate behaviors. Descending cortical pathways are increasingly recognized as central control points for SC-mediated behaviors, but how cortico-collicular pathways coordinate SC activity at the cellular level is poorly understood. Moreover, despite the known role of the SC as a multisensory integrator, the involvement of the SC in the somatosensory system is largely unexplored in comparison to its involvement in the visual and auditory systems. Here, we mapped the connectivity of the whisker-sensitive region of the SC in mice with trans-synaptic and intersectional tracing tools and in vivo electrophysiology. The results reveal a novel trans-collicular connectivity motif in which neurons in motor- and somatosensory cortices impinge onto the brainstem-SC-brainstem sensory-motor arc and onto SC-midbrain output pathways via only one synapse in the SC. Intersectional approaches and optogenetically assisted connectivity quantifications in vivo reveal convergence of motor and somatosensory cortical input on individual SC neurons, providing a new framework for sensory-motor integration in the SC. More than a third of the cortical recipient neurons in the whisker SC are GABAergic neurons, which include a hitherto unknown population of GABAergic projection neurons targeting thalamic nuclei and the zona incerta. These results pinpoint a whisker region in the SC of mice as a node for the integration of somatosensory and motor cortical signals via parallel excitatory and inhibitory trans-collicular pathways which link cortical and subcortical whisker circuits for somato-motor integration.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in vitro connect to each other and form neural networks that display emergent electrophysiological activity. This activity begins as spontaneous uncorrelated firing in the early phase of development, and as functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses mature, the activity typically emerges as spontaneous network bursts. Network bursts are events of coordinated global activation among many neurons interspersed with periods of silencing and are important for synaptic plasticity, neural information processing, and network computation. While bursting is the consequence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) interactions, the functional mechanisms underlying their evolution from physiological to potentially pathophysiological states, such as decreasing or increasing in synchrony, are still poorly understood. Synaptic activity, especially that related to maturity of E/I synaptic transmission, is known to strongly influence these processes. In this study, we used selective chemogenetic inhibition to target and disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission in in vitro neural networks to study functional response and recovery of spontaneous network bursts over time. We found that over time, inhibition resulted in increases in both network burstiness and synchrony. Our results indicate that the disruption in excitatory synaptic transmission during early network development likely affected inhibitory synaptic maturity which resulted in an overall decrease in network inhibition at later stages. These findings lend support to the importance of E/I balance in maintaining physiological bursting dynamics and, conceivably, information processing capacity in neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Minimizers are ubiquitously used in data structures and algorithms for efficient searching, mapping, and indexing of high-throughput DNA sequencing data. Minimizer schemes select a minimum k-mer in every L-long sub-sequence of the target sequence, where minimality is with respect to a predefined k-mer order. Commonly used minimizer orders select more k-mers than necessary and therefore provide limited improvement in runtime and memory usage of downstream analysis tasks. The recently introduced universal k-mer hitting sets produce minimizer orders with fewer selected k-mers. Unfortunately, generating compact universal k-mer hitting sets is currently infeasible for k > 13, and thus cannot help in the many applications that require minimizer orders for larger k.\n\nHere, we close the gap of efficient minimizer orders for large values of k by introducing decycling-set-based minimizer orders, new orders based on minimum decycling sets. We show that in practice these new minimizer orders select a number of k-mers comparable to that of minimizer orders based on universal k-mer hitting sets, and can also scale up to larger k. Furthermore, we developed a method that computes the minimizers in a sequence on the fly without keeping the k-mers of a decycling set in memory. This enables the use of these minimizer orders for any value of k. We expect the new orders to improve the runtime and memory usage of algorithms and data structures in high-throughput DNA sequencing analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use Quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate gene expression in dense cell populations. Here, we show that eukaryote S. Cerevisiae uses an alternative strategy, the quorum mechano-sensing (QMS), to resolve growth conflicts in the fungal consortia. QMS connects the biomechanical signal perception through adhesin FLO11 and transmembrane histidine kinase SLN1, triggering an intracellular signaling cascade for the cell density-dependent regulation of gene expression. Both cis and trans interactions of FLO11 are required for the inhibition of SLN1 and involve the extracellular fibronectin type III-like domain of FLO11. Genetic deletion of FLO11 removes inhibition of SLN1, associated with the spontaneous activation of gene expression whereas overproduction of FLO11 strengthens the inhibitory effect of FLO11 on SLN1. Therefore, adjusting the amount of FLO11 directly scales with the level of SLN1 inhibition, forecasting the outcome of growth competition at the macroscopic scale. Furthermore, the integration of an orthogonal synthetic circuit downstream of SLN1 allows for QMS-controlled regulation of gene expression in cell populations. Our study reveals a molecular pathway connecting FLO11 adhesion to SLN1-dependent intracellular regulation of gene expression in fungi. FLO11 and SLN1 coordinate kin recognition and growth conflict resolution through gene expression in dense fungal populations. This study challenges the classical view of chemically-driven QS and provides new strategies for controlling population growth through quorum mechano-sensing.",

    "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been suggested to be associated with impairment of model-based behavioral control. Meanwhile, recent work suggested shorter memory trace for negative than positive prediction errors (PEs) in OCD. We explored relations between these two suggestions through computational modeling. Based on the properties of cortico-basal ganglia pathways, we modeled human as an agent having a combination of successor representation (SR)-based system that enables model-based-like control and individual representation (IR)-based system that only hosts model-free control, with the two systems potentially learning from positive and negative PEs in different rates. We simulated the agents behavior in the environmental model used in the recent work that describes potential development of obsession-compulsion cycle. We found that the dual-system agent could develop enhanced obsession-compulsion cycle, similarly to the agent having memory trace imbalance in the recent work, if the SR- and IR-based systems learned mainly from positive and negative PEs, respectively. We then simulated the behavior of such an opponent SR+IR agent in the two-stage decision task, in comparison with the agent having only SR-based control. Fitting of the agents behavior by the model weighing model-based and model-free control developed in the original two-stage task study resulted in smaller weights of model-based control for the opponent SR+IR agent than for the SR-only agent. These results reconcile the previous suggestions about OCD, i.e., impaired model-based control and memory trace imbalance, raising a novel possibility that opponent learning in model(SR)-based and model-free controllers underlies obsession-compulsion. Our model cannot explain the behavior of OCD patients in punishment, rather than reward, contexts, but it could be resolved if opponent SR+IR learning operates also in the recently revealed non-canonical cortico-basal ganglia-dopamine circuit for threat/aversiveness, rather than reward, reinforcement learning, and the aversive SR + appetitive IR agent could actually develop obsession-compulsion if the environment is modeled differently.\n\nAuthor summaryObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the major psychiatric disorders diagnosed in 2.5%-3% of the population, and is characterized as an enhanced cycle of obsessive thought, e.g., whether the door was locked, and compulsive action, e.g., checking door lock. It remains elusive why such an apparently maladaptive behavior could be enhanced. A prevailing theory proposes that humans use two control systems, flexible yet costly goal-directed system and inflexible yet costless habitual system, and impairment of the goal-directed system leads to OCD. On the other hand, recent work proposed a new theory that shorter memory trace for credit-assignment of negative, than positive, prediction errors can induce OCD. Relation between these two theories remains unclear. We show that opponent learning of particular type of goal-directed(-like) system, suggested to be implemented in the brain, and habitual system from positive versus negative prediction errors could exhibit an (apparent) overall decrease in goal-directed control and also develop enhanced obsession-compulsion cycle similar to the one developed by memory-trace imbalance, thereby bridging the two theories. Such an opponent learning of the two systems was actually suggested to be advantageous in certain dynamic environments, and could thus be evolutionarily selected at the cost of possible development of OCD.",

Here through time-resolved scRNA-Seq, matched in vivo functional analysis and the use of a reversible in vitro system of early G1 arrest, we define the sequence of transcriptional and functional events occurring during the first ex vivo division of human LT-HSCs. We demonstrate that contrary to current assumptions, loss of long-term repopulation capacity during culture is independent of cell cycle progression. Instead it is a rapid event that follows an early period of adaptation to culture, characterised by transient gene expression dynamics and constrained global variability in gene expression. Cell cycle progression however contributes to the establishment of differentiation programmes in culture.

    "abstract": "One prominent feature of the infraslow BOLD signal during rest or task is quasi-periodic spatiotemporal pattern (QPP) of signal changes that involves an alternation of activity in key functional networks and propagation of activity across brain areas, and that is known to tie to the infraslow neural activity involved in attention and arousal fluctuations. This ongoing whole-brain pattern of activity might potentially modify the response to incoming stimuli or be modified itself by the induced neural activity. To investigate this, we presented checkerboard sequences flashing at 6Hz to subjects. This is a salient visual stimulus that is known to produce a strong response in visual processing regions. Two different visual stimulation sequences were employed, a systematic stimulation sequence in which the visual stimulus appeared every 20.3 secs and a random stimulation sequence in which the visual stimulus occurred randomly every 14~62.3 secs. Three central observations emerged. First, the two different stimulation conditions affect the QPP waveform in different aspects, i.e., systematic stimulation has greater effects on its phase and random stimulation has greater effects on its magnitude. Second, the QPP was more frequent in the systematic condition with significantly shorter intervals between consecutive QPPs compared to the random condition. Third, the BOLD signal response to the visual stimulus across both conditions was swamped by the QPP at the stimulus onset. These results provide novel insights into the relationship between intrinsic patterns and stimulated brain activity.",

We observed that the LIM-homeobox gene, Lhx2 is expressed in the germ cells of the developing testis between E12.5-E15.5. In Lhx2 knockout-fetal testis there was altered expression of several genes not just in germ cells but also in the supporting (Sertoli) cells, endothelial cells, and interstitial cells. Further, loss of Lhx2 led to disrupted endothelial cell migration and expansion of interstitial cells in the XY gonads.

Ablation of Nr5a1 impairs the expression of genes characteristic of SC identity (e.g., Sox9, Amh), makes SC to progressively die from E14.5 by a Trp53-independent mechanism, and induces disorganization of the testis cords, which, together, yields germ cells (GC) to prematurely enter meiosis and die, instead of becoming quiescent. Single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments revealed that Nr5a1-deficient SC acquire a pre-granulosa cell-like identity, and profoundly modify the landscape of the adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix they express. We propose therefore that SC lacking NR5A1 transdifferentiate and die by anoikis. Fetal LC do not display major changes in their transcriptome, indicating that SC are not required beyond E14.5 for their emergence or maintenance. In contrast, adult LC were missing in Nr5a1SC-/- postnatal testes. In addition, adult males display Mullerian duct derivatives (i.e., uterus, vagina), as well as a decreased anogenital distance and a shorter penis that can be explained by loss of AMH production and defective HSD17B1- and HSD17B3-mediated synthesis of testosterone in SC during fetal life. Together, our findings indicate that Nr5a1 expressed in SC after the period of sex determination safeguards SC identity, which maintains proper seminiferous cord organization and prevents GC to enter meiosis.",

    "abstract": "Rhythms are a common feature of brain activity. Across different types of rhythms, the phase has been proposed to have functional consequences, thus requiring its accurate specification from noisy data. Phase is conventionally specified using techniques that presume a frequency band-limited rhythm. However, in practice, observed brain rhythms are typically non-sinusoidal and amplitude modulated. How these features impact methods to estimate phase remains unclear. To address this, we consider three phase estimation methods, each with different underlying assumptions about the rhythm. We apply these methods to rhythms simulated with different generative mechanisms and demonstrate inconsistency in phase estimates across the different methods. We propose two improvements to the practice of phase estimation: (1) estimating confidence in the phase estimate, and (2) examining the consistency of phase estimates between two (or more) methods.\n\nSignificant StatementRhythms in the brain can coordinate the activity of individual neurons and communication within brain networks, making these rhythms a target for therapeutic interventions. Brain rhythms manifest in diverse ways, appearing with sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal waveforms, multiple peak frequencies, and variable durations. Across this diversity of rhythms, an important feature to characterize is the rhythms phase. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the ambiguity inherent in estimating phase from neural data. We propose estimating uncertainty in the phase and comparing multiple phase estimators improves phase estimation in practice.",

    "abstract": "Adipose thermogenesis involves specialized mitochondrial function that counteracts metabolic disease through dissipation of chemical energy as heat. However, inflammation present in obese adipose tissue can impair oxidative metabolism. Here, we show that PGC1, a key governor of mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis, is negatively regulated at the level of mRNA translation by the little-known RNA-binding protein RBM43. Rbm43 is expressed selectively in white adipose depots that have low thermogenic potential, and is induced by inflammatory cytokines. RBM43 suppresses mitochondrial and thermogenic gene expression in a PGC1-dependent manner and its loss protects cells from cytokine-induced mitochondrial impairment. In mice, adipocyte-selective Rbm43 disruption increases PGC1 translation, resulting in mitochondrial biogenesis and adipose thermogenesis. These changes are accompanied by improvements in glucose homeostasis during diet-induced obesity that are independent of body weight. The action of RBM43 suggests a translational mechanism by which inflammatory signals associated with metabolic disease dampen mitochondrial function and thermogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Microbial rhodopsins are often found more than once in a single genome (paralogs) that often have different functions. We screened a large dataset of open ocean single-amplified genomes (SAGs) for co-occurrences of multiple rhodopsin genes. Many such cases were found among Pelagibacterales (SAR11), HIMB59 and the Gammaproteobacteria Pseudothioglobus SAGs. These genomes always had a bona fide proteorhodopsin and a separate cluster of genes containing a second rhodopsin associated with a predicted flotillin coding gene and have thus been named flotillin-associated rhodopsins (FArhodopsins). They are quite divergent from the other proteorhodopsin paralog and contain either DTT, DTL or DNI motives in their key functional amino acids. FArhodopsins are mainly associated with the lower layers of the epipelagic zone. All marine FArhodopsins had the retinal binding lysine, but we found their relatives in freshwater metagenomes that lack this key amino acid. Alfa-fold predictions of marine FArhodopsins indicate that their retinal pocket might be very reduced or absent, hinting that they are retinal-less (blind). Freshwater FArhodopsins were more diverse than marine FArhodopsins, but we could not determine if they are present as paralogs of other rhodopsins, due to the lack of SAGs or isolates. Although the function of FArhodopsins could not be established, their conserved genomic context indicated involvement in the formation of membrane microdomains. The conservation of FArhodopsins in diverse and globally abundant microorganisms suggests that they may be important in the adaptation to the twilight zone of aquatic environments.\n\nIMPORTANCERhodopsins have been shown to play a key role in the ecology of aquatic microbes. Here we describe a group of widespread rhodopsins in aquatic microbes associated with dim light conditions. Their characteristic genomic context found in both marine and freshwater environments indicates a novel potential involvement in membrane microstructure that could be important for the function of the co-existing proteorhodopsin proton pumps. The absence or reduction of the retinal binding pocket points to drastically different physiology. In addition to their ecological importance, novel rhodopsins have biotechnological potential in the nascent field of optogenetics.",

    "abstract": "In skeletal muscle, muscle stem cells (MuSC) are the main cells responsible for regeneration upon injury. In diseased skeletal muscle, it would be therapeutically advantageous to replace defective MuSCs, or rejuvenate them with drugs to enhance their self-renewal and ensure long-term regenerative potential. One limitation of the replacement approach has been the inability to efficiently expand MuSCs ex vivo, while maintaining their stemness and engraftment abilities. Herein, we show that inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with MS023 increases the proliferative capacity of ex vivo cultured MuSCs. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ex vivo cultured MuSCs revealed the emergence of subpopulations in MS023-treated cells which are defined by elevated Pax7 expression and markers of MuSC quiescence, both features of enhanced self-renewal. Furthermore, the scRNAseq identified MS023-specific subpopulations to be metabolically altered with upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Transplantation of MuSCs treated with MS023 had a better ability to repopulate the MuSC niche and contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration following injury. Interestingly, the preclinical mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy had increased grip strength with MS023 treatment. Our findings show that inhibition of type I PRMTs increased the proliferation capabilities of MuSCs with altered cellular metabolism, while maintaining their stem-like properties such as self-renewal and engraftment potential.",

Here, we described that the persistent migration through physical barriers was sufficient to promote permanent modifications in migratory-altered cells. We found that lamin B1 altered its localization, concomitant with morphological and transcriptional changes. Migratory-altered cells showed alterations in cellular functions such as DNA repair and cell migration. We applied biochemical and biophysical approaches to identify that confined conditions altered the biomechanical response of the nucleus. Mechanistically, we determined that actin dynamics controlled the redistribution of lamin, and the basal levels of DNA damage in migratory-altered cells.

    "abstract": "No report exists on the role of Mastoparan B (MP-B) as an RND efflux pump inhibitor in multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. Here, we performed a series of in-silico experiments to predict the inhibition of the AdeB efflux pump by MP-B as a drug target agent. For this reason, an MDR strain of A. baumannii was subjected to MICs against 12 antibiotics as well as MP-B. Expression of the adeB gene in the presence and absence of sub-MIC of MP-B was studied by qRT-PCR. It was found that MP-B had potent antimicrobial activity (MIC=1 g/ml) associated with a 20-fold decrease in the adeB gene expression at the sub-MIC level. The stereochemical analysis using several automated servers confirmed that the AdeB protein is an inner membrane of the RND tripartite complex system with helix-turn-helix conformation and a pore rich in Phe, Ala, and Lys residue. Furthermore, 20 ligands were generated from the initial docked poses to create the correct protein-peptide complexes using the BioLiP pipeline. The pose showed high Z=1.2, C=1.41, TM=0.99, and RMSD=4.4 scores was selected for docking purposes. The molecular docking via AutoDock/Vina revealed that MP-B form H-bound with Val 499, Phe 454, Thr 474, Ser 461, Gly 465, and Tyr 468 residues of the AdeB helix-5 and caused a shift in the dihedral angle ({Phi}/{Psi}) by distances of 9.0 [A], 9.3 [A], and 9.6 [A], respectively. This shift in folding was detected by AlphaFold 2 and influenced the overall druggability of the protein. From the above results, we concluded that MP-B can be a good candidate for bacterial efflux pump inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Wounds are healed by crawling migration of the epidermal cells around the injured area. Fish epidermal keratocytes that rapidly repair wounds comprise a frontal crescent-shaped lamellipodium and a rear rugby ball-shaped cell body. The cell body rotates like a wheel during migration. Stress fibers, which are bundles of contractile actomyosin filaments, are arranged along the seams of the rugby ball. Here we show the linear contraction of stress fibers to be the driving force for rotation. We constructed a mechanical model of the cell body that consisted of a soft cylinder with a contractile coil. From the motion of the model, it was predicted that contraction of the stress fibers would deform the soft cell body, as a result of which the deformed cell body would push against the substrate to generate torque. This prediction was confirmed by the observation of stress fiber dynamics in migrating cells. Linear-to-rotation conversion in migrating keratocytes is realized by simple soft-body mechanics. Conversion from linear motion to rotation is widely used in machines with moving parts, but requires somewhat complicated mechanics. An understanding of linear-to-rotation conversion in keratocytes has potential for use in the design of biomimetic soft robots.",

To elucidate the underlying mechanism, commonly used ccRCC cell lines were quantitatively analyzed but unfortunately did not show detectable CEs. To overcome this problem, primary cancer cells were isolated from human tissues to retain the CE-rich phenotype. Our results further revealed that CE accumulation in ccRCC was induced by the mutation of tumor suppressor VHL and subsequent upregulation of the HIF/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/SREBP pathway. Inspiringly, inhibition of cholesterol esterification remarkably suppressed ccRCC aggressiveness through the reduced membrane cholesterol-mediated downregulations of the integrin and MAPK signaling pathways.

The role of APLN in LD was confirmed in APLN-knockout mice, in which LD is increased and associated with fibrosis and dermal backflow. This was reversed by intradermal injection of APLN-lentivectors.

The currently-accepted hypothesis peak power holds a near perfect relationship with sprint performance, and thus a near 1:1 slope with power at sprint durations up to 30-s, is tested. The equally well-accepted and complementary hypothesis there is no strong association with power over longer durations is also tested. 56 data sets from 27 cyclists (21 male, 6 female) provided maximal power for durations from 1-s to 20-min. Peak power values are compared to assess strength of correlation (R2), and any relationship (slope) across every level. R2 between 15-s - 30-s power and durations from 1-s to 20-min remained high (R2 [&ge;] 0.83). Despite current assumptions around 1-s power, our data shows this relationship is stronger around competition durations, and 1-s power also still shared strong relationships with longer durations out to 20-min. Slopes for relationships shorter durations were closer to a 1:1 relationship than longer durations, but closer to long- duration slopes than to a 1:1 line. The present analyses contradicts both well-accepted hypotheses, and the concept of peak power being a primary metric for sprint cycling, based on very strong relationships to power from durations commonly associated with oxidative energetic pathways, as well as short durations. This study shows the importance and potential of training durations from 1-s to 20-min over a preparation period to improve competition sprint cycling performance.",

    "abstract": "Modifications of mRNA, especially methylation of adenosine, have recently drawn much attention. The much rarer modification, 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC), is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Vertebrate Tet proteins are 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases and catalyze the transition of 5mC to 5hmC in DNA. These enzymes have recently been shown to have the same function in messenger RNAs in both vertebrates and in Drosophila. The Tet gene is essential in Drosophila as Tet knock-out animals do not reach adulthood. We describe the identification of Tet-target genes in the embryo and larval brain by mapping one, Tet DNA-binding sites throughout the genome and two, the Tet-dependent 5hmrC modifications transcriptome-wide. 5hmrC modifications are distributed along the entire transcript, while Tet DNA-binding sites are preferentially located at the promoter where they overlap with histone H3K4me3 peaks. The identified mRNAs are preferentially involved in neuron and axon development and Tet knock-out led to a reduction of 5hmrC marks on specific mRNAs. Among the Tet-target genes were the robo2 receptor and its slit ligand that function in axon guidance in Drosophila and in vertebrates. Tet knock-out embryos show overlapping phenotypes with robo2 and both Robo2 and Slit protein levels were markedly reduced in Tet KO larval brains. Our results establish a role for Tet-dependent 5hmrC in facilitating the translation of modified mRNAs primarily in cells of the nervous system.",

Subjects walked on an instrumented treadmill at a self-determined pace under four conditions in randomized order: (1) walking in usual lighting (1000 lumens); (2) walking in near-darkness (5 lumens); (3) walking in usual lighting with a serial-7 subtraction dual-task; and (4) walking in near-darkness with a serial-7 subtraction dual-task. Variability in stride time and variability in the trajectory of the center of pressure in the sagittal and frontal planes (anterior/posterior and lateral variability) were measured. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc analysis were used to determine the effects of age, lighting conditions, and cognitive task on each gait outcome.\n\nResultsUnder usual lighting, stride time variability and anterior/posterior variability of the middle-aged subjects were similar to those of the young and lower than those of the old. The lateral variability of the middle-aged subjects was higher than that of young adults under both lighting conditions. Similar to the older adults, the middle-aged participants increased their stride time variability and anterior/posterior variability when walking in near-darkness, but they were the only ones to exhibit increased lateral variability in near-darkness. Young adult gait was not affected by lighting, and concurrent performance of a cognitive task while walking did not affect gait stability in all groups under any of the lighting conditions.\n\nConclusionsGait stability decreases in middle age when walking in the dark. Recognition of functional deficits in middle age could promote appropriate interventions to optimize aging and reduce fall risk.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy dysfunction has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma, characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). However, the mechanisms by which autophagy dysfunction promotes RGC damage remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that perturbation of the autophagy pathway results in increased autophagic demand, thereby downregulating signaling through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a negative regulator of autophagy, contributing to the degeneration of RGCs. We identified an impairment of autophagic-lysosomal degradation and decreased mTORC1 signaling via activation of the stress sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), along with subsequent neurodegeneration in RGCs differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with a glaucoma-associated variant of Optineurin (OPTN-E50K). Similarly, the microbead occlusion model of glaucoma resulting in ocular hypertension also exhibited autophagy disruption and mTORC1 downregulation. Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 in hPSC-derived RGCs recapitulated disease-related neurodegenerative phenotypes in otherwise healthy RGCs, while the mTOR-independent induction of autophagy reduced protein accumulation and restored neurite outgrowth in diseased OPTN-E50K RGCs. Taken together, these results highlight an important balance between autophagy and mTORC1 signaling essential for RGC homeostasis, while disruption to these pathways contributes to neurodegenerative features in glaucoma, providing a potential therapeutic target to prevent neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Binding to the host cell receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4, triggers large-scale conformational changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer [(gp120/gp41)3] that promote virus entry into the cell. CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) comprise small organic molecules that bind in the highly conserved CD4-binding site of gp120 and prematurely induce inactivating Env conformational changes, including shedding of gp120 from the Env trimer. By inducing more \"open,\" antibody-susceptible Env conformations, CD4mcs also sensitize HIV-1 virions to neutralization by antibodies and infected cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Here, we report the design, synthesis and evaluation of novel CD4mcs based on an indoline scaffold. Compared with our current lead indane scaffold CD4mc, BNM-III-170, several indoline CD4mcs exhibit increased potency and breadth against HIV-1 variants from different geographic clades. Viruses that were selected for resistance to the lead indane CD4mc, BNM-III-170, are susceptible to inhibition by the indoline CD4mcs. The indoline CD4mcs also potently sensitize HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. Crystal structures indicate that the indoline CD4mcs gain potency compared to the indane CD4mcs through more favorable {pi}-{pi} overlap from the indoline pose and by making favorable contacts with the vestibule of the CD4-binding pocket on gp120. The rational design of indoline CD4mcs thus holds promise for further improvements in antiviral activity, potentially contributing to efforts to treat and prevent HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "On May 6, 2022, a powerful outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV) had been reported outside of Africa, with many continuing new cases being reported around the world. Analysis of mutations among the two different lineages present in the 2021 and 2022 outbreaks revealed the presence of G->A mutations occurring in the 5GpA context, indicative of APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity. By using a sensitive PCR (3D-PCR) method allowing differential amplification of AT-rich DNA, we demonstrate that G->A hypermutated MPXV genomes can be recovered experimentally from APOBEC3 transfection followed by MPXV infection. Here, among the 7 human APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases (A3A-A3C, A3DE, A3F-A3H), only APOBEC3F was capable of extensively deaminating cytidine residues in MPXV genomes. Hyperedited genomes were also recovered in ~42% of analyzed patients, indicating that editing is part of the natural cycle of MPXV infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that substantial repair of these mutations occurs. Upon selection, corrected G->A mutations escaping drift loss contribute to the MPXV evolution observed in the current epidemics. Thus, stochastic or transient overexpression of APOBEC3F gene exposes the MPXV genome to a broad spectrum of mutations that may be modeling the mutational landscape after multiple cycles of viral replication.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that seaweed farming contributes to carbon burial below the farms was tested by quantifying burial rates in 20 seaweed farms distributed globally, ranging from 2 to 300 years in operation and from 1 ha to 15,000 ha in size. This involved combining analyses of organic carbon density with sediment accumulation rate in sediments below seaweed farms relative to reference sediments beyond the farm and/or prior to the farm operation. One in every four farms sampled was set over environments that export, rather than retain materials. For the farms that were placed over depositional environments, where sediment accumulation could be quantified, the thickness of sediment layers and stocks of carbon accumulated below the farms increased with farm age, reaching 140 ton C ha-1 for the oldest farm, and tended to exceed those in reference sediments beyond the farm and/or prior to the operation of the farms. Organic carbon burial rates in the farm sediments averaged ({+/-} SE) 1.87 {+/-} 0.73 ton CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) ha-1 year-1 (median 0.83, range 0.10 - 8.99 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1), twice the average ({+/-} SE) burial rate in reference sediments (0.90 {+/-} 0.27, median 0.64, range 0.10-3.00 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1), so that the excess organic carbon burial attributable to the seaweed farms averaged 1.06 {+/-} 0.74 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1 (median 0.09, range -0.13-8.10 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1). This first direct quantification of carbon burial in sediments below seaweed farms confirms that, when placed over depositional environments, seaweed farming tend to sequester carbon in the underlying sediments, but do so at widely variable rates, increasing with farm yield.",

    "abstract": "Survival of living organisms is fully dependent on their maintenance of genome integrity, being permanently threatened by replication stress in proliferating cells. Although the plant DNA damage response (DDR) regulator SOG1 has been demonstrated to cope with replicative defects, accumulating evidence points to other pathways functioning independently of SOG1. Here, we have studied the role of the Arabidopsis E2FA and EF2B transcription factors, two well-characterized regulators of DNA replication, in the response to replication stress. Through a combination of reverse genetics and chromatin-immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that E2FA and E2FB share many target genes with SOG1, providing evidence for their involvement in the DDR. Analysis of double and triple mutant combinations revealed that E2FB, rather than E2FA, plays the most prominent role in sustaining growth in the presence of replicative defects, either operating antagonistically or synergistically with SOG1. Reversely, SOG1 aids in overcoming the replication defects of E2FA/E2FB-deficient plants. Our data reveal a complex transcriptional network controlling the replication stress response, in which both E2Fs and SOG1 act as key regulatory factors.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYThe Arabidopsis E2FA and EF2B transcription factors differently contribute to the plants response to DNA replication defects in a cooperative way with the DNA damage response regulator SOG1.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor MYC is overexpressed in most cancers, where it drives multiple hallmarks of cancer progression. MYC is known to promote oncogenic transcription by binding to active promoters. In addition, MYC has also been shown to invade distal enhancers when expressed at oncogenic levels, but this enhancer binding has been proposed to have low gene-regulatory potential. Here, we demonstrate that MYC enhancer binding directly promotes cancer type-specific gene programs predictive of poor patient prognosis. MYC induces transcription of enhancer RNA through recruitment of RNAPII, rather than regulating RNAPII pause-release as is the case at promoters. This is mediated by MYC-induced H3K9 demethylation by KDM3A and acetylation by GCN5, leading to enhancer-specific BRD4 recruitment through its bromodomains, which facilitates RNAPII recruitment. Thus, we propose that MYC drives prognostic cancer type-specific gene programs by promoting RNAPII recruitment to enhancers through induction of an epigenetic switch.",

    "abstract": "Stilbenes are developmentally induced metabolites in Scots pine heartwood where they have important role in protecting wood from decaying fungi. The stilbene pathway is also stress inducible, and ultraviolet (UV)-C radiation was among the first discovered artificial stress activators of the pathway. Many conditions that activate the pathway are known, but the specific transcriptional regulators and the biosynthetic enzyme responsible for activating the stilbene precursor cinnamate in the pathway are unknown.\n\nHere we describe the first large-scale transcriptomic analysis of pine needles in response to UV-C exposure and treatment with translational inhibitor cycloheximide, both activating the transcription of stilbene pathway genes, to uncover the candidates for the transcriptional regulation of the pathway and the cinnamate activating CoA ligase. We show that the regulation of pine stilbene pathway has shared features with grapevine stilbene pathway. In both species, the stilbene pathway was transcriptionally activated after UV-C treatment, protein phosphatase inhibitors and plant hormones ethylene and jasmonate.\n\nThe pine stilbene synthase promoter retains its inducibility when transformed in plants that normally do not synthesize stilbenes. Pine stilbene synthase promoter was able to activate the expression of a reporter gene in Arabidopsis in response to UV-C exposure and phosphatase inhibitors, but not as response to plant hormone treatment. This indicates that stilbene synthase gene regulation occurs both via ancient stress-response pathway(s) but also via species specific regulators. With transcriptomic approach we identified candidate enzymes for cinnamate acting CoA ligase and transcription factors regulating the pathway.",

This is an important but hard problem in neuroscience, complicated by the non-stationarity of the recordings and the dense overlap in electrical fields between nearby neurons. To solve the spike sorting problem, we have continuously developed over the past eight years a framework known as Kilosort. This paper describes the various algorithmic steps introduced in different versions of Kilosort. We also report the development of Kilosort4, a new version with substantially improved performance due to new clustering algorithms inspired by graph-based approaches. To test the performance of Kilosort, we developed a realistic simulation framework which uses densely sampled electrical fields from real experiments to generate non-stationary spike waveforms and realistic noise. We find that nearly all versions of Kilosort outperform other algorithms on a variety of simulated conditions, and Kilosort4 performs best in all cases, correctly identifying even neurons with low amplitudes and small spatial extents in high drift conditions.",

    "abstract": "Comparing expectation with experience is an important neural computation performed throughout the brain and is a hallmark of predictive processing. Experiments that alter the sensory outcome of an animals behavior reveal enhanced neural responses to unexpected self-generated stimuli, indicating that populations of neurons in sensory cortex may reflect prediction errors - mismatches between expectation and experience. However, enhanced neural responses to self-generated stimuli could also arise through non-predictive mechanisms, such as the movement-based facilitation of a neurons inherent sound responses. If sensory prediction error neurons exist in sensory cortex, it is unknown whether they manifest as general error responses, or respond with specificity to errors in distinct stimulus dimensions. To answer these questions, we trained mice to expect the outcome of a simple sound-generating behavior and recorded auditory cortex activity as mice heard either the expected sound or sounds that deviated from expectation in one of multiple distinct dimensions. Our data reveal that the auditory cortex learns to suppress responses to self-generated sounds along multiple acoustic dimensions simultaneously. We identify a distinct population of auditory cortex neurons that are not responsive to passive sounds or to the expected sound but that explicitly encode prediction errors. These prediction error neurons are abundant only in animals with a learned motor-sensory expectation, and encode one or two specific violations rather than a generic error signal.",

    "abstract": "Locomotor movements cause visual images to be displaced across the eye, a retinal slip that is counteracted by stabilizing reflexes in many animals. In insects, optomotor turning causes the animal to turn in the direction of rotating visual stimuli, thereby reducing retinal slip and stabilizing trajectories through the world. This behavior has formed the basis for extensive dissections of motion vision. Here, we report that under certain stimulus conditions, two Drosophila species, including the widely studied D. melanogaster, can suppress and even reverse the optomotor turning response over several seconds. Such  anti-directional turning is most strongly evoked by long-lasting, high-contrast, slow-moving visual stimuli that are distinct from those that promote syn-directional optomotor turning. Anti-directional turning, like the syn-directional optomotor response, requires the local motion detecting neurons T4 and T5. A subset of lobula plate tangential cells, CH cells, show involvement in these responses. Imaging from a variety of direction-selective cells in the lobula plate shows no evidence of dynamics that match the behavior, suggesting that the observed inversion in turning direction emerges downstream of the lobula plate. Further, anti-directional turning declines with age and exposure to light. These results show that Drosophila optomotor turning behaviors contain rich, stimulus-dependent dynamics that are inconsistent with simple reflexive stabilization responses.",

    "abstract": "Only a few benzene-mineralizing anaerobes have been isolated to date. In an attempt using classical isolation techniques to isolate benzene-mineralizing pure cultures from a benzene-mineralizing nitrate-reducing microbial community, two putative isolates were gained under nitrate-reducing conditions spiked separately with acetate and benzene as sole sources of carbon and energy with media containing ammonium or without ammonium. Both putative isolates; Bz4 (with ammonium) and Bz7 (without ammonium) - mineralized 13C-labelled acetate under anoxic conditions at 3.3 and 2.7 M day-1, respectively, revealed by analysis of evolved 13CO2. However, only Bz4 mineralized [13C6]-labelled benzene (0.298 M benzene mineralized day-1) generated up to 960.2 {+/-} 0.3 {per thousand} {delta}13C-CO2 during 184 days while producing only slight amounts of nitrite (4.60 {+/-} 0.004 M); no benzene was mineralized by Bz7 during 184 d, and no nitrite was detected. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the acetate-grown bacteria revealed consortia enriched in Nocardioides (8.9%), Pseudomonas (18.2%), Rhizobiaceae (21.0%), Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium (51.4%) for Bz4 and Simplicispira (96.7%) for Bz7. The gained Bz4 consortium that mineralized benzene under anoxic condition can be further purified and explored for their metabolic potentials.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) functions as a second messenger to signal metabolic distress through highly compartmentalized production in mitochondria. The dynamics of ROS generation and diffusion between mitochondrial compartments and into the cytosol govern oxidative stress responses and pathology, though our understanding of these processes remains limited. Here, we couple the H2O2 biosensor, HyPer7, with optogenetic stimulation of the ROS-generating protein KillerRed targeted into multiple mitochondrial microdomains. Single mitochondrial photogeneration of H2O2 demonstrates the spatiotemporal dynamics of ROS diffusion and transient hyperfusion of mitochondria due to ROS. Measurement of microdomain-specific H2O2 diffusion kinetics reveals directionally selective diffusion through mitochondrial microdomains. All-optical generation and detection of physiologically-relevant concentrations of H2O2 between mitochondrial compartments provide a map of mitochondrial H2O2 diffusion dynamics in situ. These kinetic details of spatiotemporal ROS dynamics and inter-mitochondrial spreading forms a framework to understand the role of ROS in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that microRNA (miR)23a and miR30b are selectively sorted into rickettsia-infected, endothelial cell-derived exosomes (R-ECExos). Yet, the mechanism remains unknown. The number of cases of spotted fever rickettsioses has been increasing in recent years, and infections with these bacteria cause life-threatening diseases by targeting brain and lung tissues. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to continue to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying R-ECExos-induced barrier dysfunction of normal recipient microvascular endothelial cells (MECs), depending on their exosomal RNA cargos. Rickettsiae are transmitted to human hosts by the bite of an infected tick into the skin. In the present study we demonstrate that treatment with R-ECExos, which were derived from spotted fever group R parkeri infected human dermal MECs, induced disruptions of the paracellular adherens junctional protein VE-cadherin and breached the paracellular barrier function in recipient pulmonary MECs (PMECs) in an exosomal RNA-dependent manner. Similarly, we did not detect different levels of miRs in parent dermal MECs following rickettsial infections. However, we demonstrated that the microvasculopathy-relevant miR23a-27a-24 cluster and miR30b are selectively enriched in R-ECExos. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that common sequence motifs are shared exclusively among the exosomal, selectively-enriched miR23a cluster and miR30b at different levels. Taken together, these data warrant further functional identification and characterization of a single, bipartition, or tripartition among ACA, UCA, and CAG motifs that guide recognition of microvasculopathy-relevant miR23a-27a-24 and miR30b, and subsequently results in their selective enrichments in R-ECExos.",

    "abstract": "The highly prevalent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes keratoconjunctivitis and encephalitis. Viral DNA polymerase-inhibiting nucleoside analogs (such as acyclovir) are standard treatment agents against HSV infections but are limited by severe drug resistance issues. Thus, new antiviral agents with novel targets are urgently needed. Earlier, we investigated the anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial bioactivities of Garcinia sp. Here, we report that non-cytotoxic concentrations (< 500 nM) of Gaudichaudione H (GH, isolated from Garcinia oligantha Merr.) potently inhibits HSV-1 replication in vitro without affecting viral entry or attachment. GH inhibits the expression of the viral proteins ICP0, ICP4, and ICP27 without affecting their mRNA levels. In Vero cells, GH enhanced STAT1 and 3 phosphorylation, which occurs downstream to interferon (IFN)-{gamma} activation during viral infections. However, pharmacological/genetic inhibition of IFN-{gamma} failed to suppress the GH-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 replication, indicating that GH exerts antiviral effects independent of IFN. Further mechanistic studies suggest that GH inhibits HSV-1 replication, at least partially by inhibiting cellular NF-{kappa}B activation. Moreover, GH prolonged the survival rate of KOS-infected mice by 25% (n = 5). In conclusion, GH treatment inhibits HSV-1 replication both in vitro and in vivo; therefore, it can be developed as an antiviral.\n\nImportanceVery few therapeutic drug options are available to treat herpes simplex virus-1/2 which cause myriad debilitating diseases. We screened eight Garcinia compounds and found Gaudichaudione H was the most effective compound at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Further mechanism study illustrates that GH inhibits HSV-1 replication, at least partially by inhibiting cellular NF-{kappa}B activation. Natural compound is a promising resource of new antiviral agents with different targets that has ability to treat resistant viral strains.",

In field surveys, the natural occurrence of E. tabacivora was confirmed in the Canete valley of Peru. Its biology and development was studied under laboratory conditions at 20{degrees}C and 70-75% RH. The results showed that fertilized females lay their eggs inside nymphs of the 3rd and early 4th instar of B. tabaci MEAN 1. The stages of development are egg, three larval instars, prepupa and pupa. Development from egg to adult lasted 19.3 (SE{+/-}0.17) days for females. No males were produced, which indicates that E. tabacivora exhibits thelytokous parthenogenesis. Parasitized host nymphs exhibited multiple oviposition punctures and several L1-instar wasps were observed in individual host nymphs, indicating superparasitism. However, from the L2-instar onwards only one individual developed to adult stage. E. tabacivora might be a prospective biological control agent for B. tabaci in sweet potato also for minimizing the spread of whitefly-induced plant viruses in Peru and other regions of the world. The knowledge gained might be helpful in establishing mass rearing protocols of E. tabacivora for inoculative releases.",

    "abstract": "The Streptococcus mutans genetic system offers a variety of strategies to rapidly engineer targeted chromosomal mutations. Previously, we reported the first S. mutans negative selection system that functions in a wild-type background. This system utilizes induced sensitivity to the toxic amino acid analog p-chlorophenylalanine (4-CP) as a negative selection mechanism, and was developed for counterselection-based cloning-independent markerless mutagenesis (CIMM). While we have employed this system extensively for our ongoing genetic studies, we have encountered a couple limitations with the system, mainly its narrow host range and the requirement for selection on a toxic substrate. Here, we report the development of a new negative selection system that addresses both limitations, while still retaining the utility of the previous 4-CP-based markerless mutagenesis system. We placed a variety of toxin-encoding genes under the control of the xylose-inducible Xyl-S expression cassette and found the Fst-sm and ParE toxins to be suitable candidates for inducible negative selection. We combined the inducible toxins with an antibiotic resistance gene to create several different counterselection cassettes. The most broadly useful of these contained a wild-type fst-sm open reading frame transcriptionally fused to a point mutant form of the Xyl-S expression system, which we subsequently named as IFDC4. IFDC4 was shown to exhibit exceptionally low background resistance, with 3 - 4 log reductions in cell number observed when plating on xylose-supplemented media. IFDC4 also functioned similarly in multiple strains of S. mutans as well as with S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. We performed CIMM with IFDC4 and successfully engineered a variety of different types of markerless mutations in all three species. The counterselection strategy described here provides a template approach that should be adaptable for the creation of similar counterselection systems in many other bacteria.",

Effectors are engaged in a molecular arms race with the host resulting in conflicting evolutionary constraints to manipulate host cells without triggering immune responses. The molecular mechanisms allowing effectors to be at the same time robust and evolvable remain largely enigmatic. Here, we show that 62 conserved structure-related families encompass the majority of fungal orphan effector candidates at the subphylum level. These effectors diversified through changes in patterns of thermodynamic frustration at surface residues. The underlying mutations tended to increase the robustness of the overall effector protein structure while switching potential binding interfaces. This mechanism could explain how conserved effector families maintained biological activity over long evolutionary timespans in different host environments and provides a model for the emergence of sequence-unrelated effector families with conserved structures.",

Its plant growth promoting activity was measured by comparing the growth of winter wheat berry (Triticum aestivum) grown in frass treated soil relative to that measured in untreated (control) soil. Its N:P205:K2O, biogenic amine and phytohormone composition were determined by standard soil analysis, HPLC and HPLC/GC-MS methodologies, respectively, and found to be too low to account for its plant growth promoting activity which induced a 11% increase in arial mass and shoot length in treated plants over controls. Colonies of Enterococci grew out on streaking frass collected directly from larvae on standard bile-esculin azide agar culture plates, confirming the hypothesis that viable Enteroccoci are excreted in their frass. Since Enterococci are capable of colonizing the rhizosphere and boosting the growth of plants on amendment into soil, these findings lend further insight into the underlying mechanism(s) accounting for the increased growth of plants growing in frass treated soils.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus are highly problematic bacteria in hospital settings. This stems, at least in part, from strong abilities to form biofilms on abiotic or biotic surfaces. Biofilms are well-organized multicellular aggregates of bacteria, which, when formed on indwelling medical devices, lead to infections that are difficult to treat. Cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins are known to be important players in biofilm formation and infection. Many of these proteins have putative stalk-like regions or regions of low complexity near the cell wall-anchoring motif. Recent work demonstrated the strong propensity of the stalk region of the S. epidermidis accumulation-associated protein (Aap) to remain highly extended under solution conditions that typically induce compaction or other significant conformational changes. This behavior is consistent with the expected function of a stalk-like region that is covalently attached to the cell wall peptidoglycan and projects the adhesive domains of Aap away from the cell surface. In this study, we evaluate whether the ability to resist compaction is a common theme among stalk regions from various staphylococcal CWA proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine secondary structure changes as a function of temperature and cosolvents along with sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation and SAXS to characterize structural characteristics in solution. All stalk regions tested are intrinsically disordered, lacking secondary structure beyond random coil and polyproline type II helix, and they all sample highly extended conformations. Remarkably, the Ser-Asp dipeptide repeat region of SdrC exhibited nearly identical behavior in solution when compared to the Aap Pro/Gly-rich region, despite highly divergent sequence patterns, indicating conservation of function by various distinct staphylococcal CWA protein stalk regions.",

While specialized membrane transporters in cells can import otherwise impermeable nutrients, the earliest cells would have lacked a mechanism to import nutrients rapidly under nutrient-rich circumstances. Using both experiments and simulations, we find that a process akin to passive endocytosis can be recreated in model primitive cells. Molecules that are too impermeable to be absorbed can be taken up in a matter of seconds in an endocytic vesicle. The internalized cargo can then be slowly released over hours, into the main lumen or putative cytoplasm. This work demonstrates a way by which primitive life could have broken the symmetry of passive permeation prior to the evolution of protein transporters.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapeutic responses are hampered by limited T cell trafficking, persistence, and durable anti-tumor activity in solid tumor microenvironments. However, these challenges can be largely overcome by relatively unconstrained synthetic engineering strategies, which are being harnessed to improve solid tumor CAR T cell therapies. Here, we describe fully optimized CAR T cells targeting tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG72) for the treatment of solid tumors, identifying the CD28 transmembrane domain upstream of the 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain as a driver of potent anti-tumor activity and IFN{gamma} secretion. These findings have culminated into a phase 1 trial evaluating safety, feasibility, and bioactivity of TAG72-CAR T cells for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer (NCT05225363). Preclinically, we found that CAR T cell-mediated IFN{gamma} production facilitated by IL-12 signaling was required for tumor cell killing, which was recapitulated by expressing an optimized membrane-bound IL-12 (mbIL12) molecule on CAR T cells. Critically, mbIL12 cell surface expression and downstream signaling was induced and sustained only following CAR T cell activation. CAR T cells with mbIL12 demonstrated improved antigen-dependent T cell proliferation and potent cytotoxicity in recursive tumor cell killing assays in vitro and showed robust in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in human xenograft models of ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis. Further, locoregional administration of TAG72-CAR T cells with antigen-dependent IL-12 signaling promoted durable anti-tumor responses against both regional and systemic disease in mice and was associated with improved systemic T cell persistence. Our study features a clinically-applicable strategy to improve the overall efficacy of locoregionally-delivered CAR T cells engineered with antigen-dependent immune-modulating cytokines in targeting both regional and systemic disease.",

    "abstract": "Canine soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogenous group of malignant tumors arising from mesenchymal cells of soft tissues. This simplified collective of tumors most commonly arise from subcutaneous tissues, are treated similar clinically, and conventionally exclude other sarcomas with more definitive anatomical, histological, or biological features. Histologically, canine STS sub-types are difficult to discern at the light microscopic level due to their overlapping features. Thus, genomic, and transcriptomic profiling of canine STS may prove valuable in differentiating the diverse sub-types of mesenchymal neoplasms within this group. To this purpose we sought to characterize the transcript expression and genomic mutation profiles of canine STS. To delineate transcriptomic sub-types, hierarchical clustering was used to identify 4 groups with district expression profiles. Using the RNAseq data, we identified three samples carrying driver fusions of platelet derived growth factor B (PDGFB) and collagen genes. Sensitivity to imatinib was evaluated in a canine STS cell line also bearing a PDGFB fusion. Using whole exome sequencing, recurrent driver variants were identified in the cancer genes KMT2D (21% of the samples) and TP53 (21%) along with copy number losses of RB1 and CDKN2A. Gene amplifications and resulting transcript increases were identified in genes on chromosomes 13, 14, and 36. A subset of STS was identified with high T-cell infiltration. This multi-omics approach has defined canine STS sub-types at a molecular level for comparison to their human counterparts, to improve diagnosis, and may provide additional targets for therapy.",

    "abstract": "RationaleAcute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is a promising strategy to induce functional motor recovery following chronic spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Although significant results are obtained, human AIH trials report considerable inter-individual response variability.\n\nObjectivesIdentify individual factors (e.g., genetics, age, and sex) that determine response magnitude of healthy adults to an optimized AIH protocol, acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (AIHH).\n\nMethodsAssociations of individual factors with the magnitude of AIHH (15, 1-min O2=9.5%, CO2=5% episodes) induced changes in diaphragm motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) and inspiratory mouth occlusion pressures (P0.1) were evaluated in 17 healthy individuals (age=27{+/-}5 years) compared to Sham. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes linked with mechanisms of AIH induced phrenic motor plasticity (BDNF, HTR2A, TPH2, MAOA, NTRK2) and neuronal plasticity (apolipoprotein E, APOE) were tested. Variations in AIHH induced plasticity with age and sex were also analyzed. Additional experiments in humanized (h)ApoE knock-in rats were performed to test causality.\n\nResultsAIHH-induced changes in diaphragm MEP amplitudes were lower in individuals heterozygous for APOE4 (i.e., APOE3/4) allele versus other APOE genotypes (p=0.048). No significant differences were observed between any other SNPs investigated, notably BDNFval/met (all p>0.05). Males exhibited a greater diaphragm MEP enhancement versus females, regardless of age (p=0.004). Age was inversely related with change in P0.1 within the limited age range studied (p=0.007). In hApoE4 knock-in rats, AIHH-induced phrenic motor plasticity was significantly lower than hApoE3 controls (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionsAPOE4 genotype, sex and age are important biological determinants of AIHH-induced respiratory motor plasticity in healthy adults.\n\nADDITION TO KNOWLEDGE BASEAcute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) is a novel rehabilitation strategy to induce functional recovery of respiratory and non-respiratory motor systems in people with chronic spinal cord injury and/or neurodegenerative diseases. Since most AIH trials report considerable inter-individual variability in AIH outcomes, we investigated factors that potentially undermine the response to an optimized AIH protocol, acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (AIHH), in healthy humans. We demonstrate that genetics (particularly the lipid transporter, APOE), age and sex are important biological determinants of AIHH-induced respiratory motor plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsons disease (PD) and Alzheimers disease-associated dementia (ADAD), are linked with dopaminergic (DA) neuron death and a resulting reduction in dopamine levels in the brain. DA neuron degeneration and the risk of developing PD is connected to genetic mutations affiliated with lysosomal function and protein degradation. Accessible human cellular models for PD-relevant genetic mutations are needed to investigate mechanisms of DA cell death and define points of therapeutic intervention. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain DA neurons offer a developmentally and physiologically relevant in vitro model for investigating PD pathogenic mechanisms across genetic backgrounds. In this study, we generated DA neurons using iPSCs from two clinically diagnosed PD patients, one harboring an inherited GBAN370S mutation and the other a mutation in LRRK2G2019S and compared pathophysiology against DA neurons from genetically engineered SNCAA53T iPSCs and its isogenic apparently healthy normal (AHN) iPSCs. Our results present a novel phenotype for GBAN370S and LRRK2G2019S derived DA neurons, showing that they produced and released significantly more dopamine compared to the AHN and SNCAA53T mutant DA neurons. All mutant DA neurons developed deficient glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, increased mitochondrial stress, aberrant neuronal activity patterns, and increased -synuclein accumulation. Together these data suggest potentially divergent origins of PD pathogenesis in GBAN370S and LRRK2G2019S DA neurons. In addition, compound screening confirmed that GCase modulators can rescue enzyme activity and impact neural activity across all DA mutant neurons, to varying degrees. These data demonstrate unique in vitro phenotypes associated with PD and suggest a diversity of underlying mechanisms across different genetic backgrounds. Together, the cell lines used in this study present a valuable tool for new therapeutic discovery.",

    "abstract": "The major food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni employs chemotactic motility to colonise the avian gut, and also as a virulence mechanism in human diarrhoeal disease.\n\nIn Escherichia coli CheY activity is modulated by CheZ, a phosphatase originally thought to be absent in C. jejuni. The Hp0170 protein of Helicobacter pylori is a distant homologue of CheZ and, as C. jejuni Cj0700 is homologous to HP0170, Cj0700 could also act as a CheZ orthologue in Campylobacter. Both the C. jejuni CheV and CheA proteins also contain a response regulator (RR) domain that may be phosphorylated. Cj0700 would therefore be predicted to dephosphorylate C. jejuni CheY and possibly also the CheV and CheA RR domains.\n\nA mutant ({Delta}cj0700) and complement ({Delta}cj0700, cj0046::cj0700) were constructed in C.jejuni strains NCTC11168, NCTC11828 and 81-176. On semisolid agar the {Delta}cj0700 mutant strain showed reduced motility relative to wild-type and this phenotype was reversed in the complemented strain. In pull down and bacterial two hybrid assays, expressed Cj0700 was able to interact with CheY, CheA-RR and CheV.\n\nCj0700 is able to dephosphorylate the RR domain of CheY and CheA-RR, but less efficiently, CheV. These findings verify that Cj0700 plays a role in C. jejuni chemotaxis through phosphatase activity with respect to CheY, and is hence likely to be a CheZ orthologue. Cj0700 also partially modulates the phosphorylation level of the RR domain on CheA and CheV, although the functional consequences of this interaction require further investigation.",

MiP-Seq was combined with in vivo Ca2+ imaging and Raman imaging to obtain a spatial multiomics atlas correlated to neuronal activity and cellular biochemical fingerprints. Importantly, we proposed a \"signal dilution strategy\" to resolve the crowded signals that challenge the applicability of in situ sequencing.

    "abstract": "The filarial parasites Mansonella ozzardi and Mansonella perstans, causative agents of mansonellosis, infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, yet remain among the most understudied of the human filarial pathogens. M. ozzardi is highly prevalent in Latin American countries and Caribbean Islands, while M. perstans is predominantly found in sub-Saharan Africa as well as in a few areas in South America. In addition to the differences in their geographical distribution, the two parasites are transmitted by different insect vectors, as well as exhibit differences in their responses to commonly used anthelminthic drugs. The lack of genome information has hindered investigations into the biology and evolution of Mansonella parasites and understanding the molecular basis of the clinical differences between species. In the current study, high quality genomes of two independent clinical isolates of M. perstans from Cameroon and two M. ozzardi isolates one from Brazil and one from Venezuela are reported. The genomes are approximately 76 Mb in size, encode about 10,000 genes each, and are largely complete based on BUSCO scores of about 90%, similar to other completed filarial genomes. These sequences represent the first genomes from Mansonella parasites and enabled a comparative genomic analysis of the similarities and differences between Mansonella and other filarial parasites. Horizontal DNA transfers (HDT) from mitochondria (nuMTs) as well as transfers from genomes of endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria (nuWTs) to the host nuclear genome were identified and analyzed. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis of known targets of anti-filarial drugs diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin and mebendazole revealed that all known target genes were present in both species, except for the DEC target encoded by gon-2 gene, which is fragmented in genome assemblies from both M. ozzardi isolates. These new reference genome sequences will provide a valuable resource for further studies on biology, symbiosis, evolution and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "In case-control single-cell RNA-seq studies, sample-level labels are transferred onto individual cells, labeling all case cells as affected, but only a small fraction of them may actually be perturbed. Here, using simulations, we demonstrate that the standard approach to single cell analysis fails to isolate the subset of affected case cells and their markers when either the affected subset is small, or when the strength of the perturbation is mild. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce HiDDEN, a computational method that refines the case-control labels to accurately reflect the perturbation status of each cell. We show HiDDENs superior ability to recover biological signals missed by the standard analysis workflow in simulated ground truth datasets of cell type mixtures. When applied to a dataset of human multiple myeloma precursor conditions, HiDDEN recapitulates the expert manual annotation and discovers malignancy in previously considered healthy early stage samples. When applied to a mouse model of demyelination, HiDDEN identifies an endothelial subpopulation playing a role in early stage blood-brain barrier dysfunction. We anticipate that HiDDEN should find a wide usage in contexts which require the detection of subtle changes in cell types across conditions.",

    "abstract": "Hetnets, short for \"heterogeneous networks\", contain multiple node and relationship types and offer a way to encode biomedical knowledge. One such example, Hetionet connects 11 types of nodes -- including genes, diseases, drugs, pathways, and anatomical structures -- with over 2 million edges of 24 types. Previous work has demonstrated that supervised machine learning methods applied to such networks can identify drug repurposing opportunities. However, a training set of known relationships does not exist for many types of node pairs, even when it would be useful to examine how nodes of those types are meaningfully connected. For example, users may be curious not only how metformin is related to breast cancer, but also how the GJA1 gene might be involved in insomnia. We developed a new procedure, termed hetnet connectivity search, that proposes important paths between any two nodes without requiring a supervised gold standard. The algorithm behind connectivity search identifies types of paths that occur more frequently than would be expected by chance (based on node degree alone). We find that predictions are broadly similar to those from previously described supervised approaches for certain node type pairs. Scoring of individual paths is based on the most specific paths of a given type. Several optimizations were required to precompute significant instances of node connectivity at the scale of large knowledge graphs. We implemented the method on Hetionet and provide an online interface at https://het.io/search. We provide an open source implementation of these methods in our new Python package named hetmatpy.",

Yet whether inflammation causes or exacerbates neurodegeneration has been challenging to define because the two processes are so closely linked. Here we disentangle inflammation from the axon damage it causes by individually blocking cytotoxic T cell function and axon degeneration. We model inflammatory damage in mouse skin, a barrier tissue that, despite frequent inflammation, must maintain proper functioning of a dense array of axon terminals. We show that sympathetic axons control skin inflammation through release of norepinephrine, which suppresses activation of gamma delta T cells via the {beta}2 adrenergic receptor. Strong inflammatory stimulation in the form of the toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist imiquimod (IMQ) causes progressive gamma delta T cell-mediated, Sarm-1-dependent loss of these immunosuppressive sympathetic axons, a positive feedback loop that removes a physiological brake on T cells, resulting in enhanced inflammation and inflammatory axon damage.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis are common stress responses that worsen organ function, yet the molecular mechanisms governing their crosstalk are poorly understood. In diseased organs, stress-induced changes in gene expression fuel maladaptive cell state transitions and pathological interaction between diverse cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction of lung, liver, kidney, and heart, and exacerbates many cancers, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are not well understood. Here, we show that conditional deletion of the transcription co-activator Brd4 in Cx3cr1-positive myeloid cells ameliorates heart failure and is associated with a dramatic reduction in fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1-positive cells identified a large enhancer proximal to Interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and a series of CRISPR deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controlled expression of Il1b in disease. Secreted IL1B functioned non-cell autonomously to activate a p65/RELA-dependent enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL1B neutralization prevented stress-induced expression of MEOX1, inhibited fibroblast activation, and improved cardiac function in heart failure. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent crosstalk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL1B provides new therapeutic strategies for heart disease and other disorders of chronic inflammation and maladaptive tissue remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal development depends on coordinated angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Bone morphogenetic proteins direct bone development by activating SMAD1/5 signaling in osteoblasts. However, the role of SMAD1/5 in skeletal endothelium is unknown. Here, we found that endothelial cell-conditional SMAD1/5 depletion in juvenile mice caused metaphyseal and diaphyseal hypervascularity, resulting in altered cancellous and cortical bone formation. SMAD1/5 depletion induced excessive sprouting, disrupting the columnar structure of the metaphyseal vessels and impaired anastomotic loop morphogenesis at the chondro-osseous junction. Endothelial SMAD1/5 depletion impaired growth plate resorption and, upon long term depletion, abrogated osteoprogenitor recruitment to the primary spongiosa. Finally, in the diaphysis, endothelial SMAD1/5 activity was necessary to maintain the sinusoidal phenotype, with SMAD1/5 depletion inducing formation of large vascular loops, featuring elevated endomucin expression, ectopic tip cell formation, and hyperpermeability. Together, endothelial SMAD1/5 activity sustains skeletal vascular morphogenesis and function and coordinates growth plate remodeling and osteoprogenitor recruitment dynamics during bone growth.",

    "abstract": "Balance and movement are impaired in a wide variety of neurological disorders. Recent advances in behavioral monitoring provide unprecedented access to posture and loco-motor kinematics, but without the throughput and scalability necessary to screen candidate genes / potential therapeutics. We present a powerful solution: a Scalable Apparatus to Measure Posture and Locomotion (SAMPL). SAMPL includes extensible imaging hardware and low-cost open-source acquisition software with real-time processing. We first demonstrate that SAMPLs hardware and acquisition software can acquire data from D. melanogaster, C.elegans, and D. rerio as they move vertically. Next, we leverage SAMPLs throughput to rapidly (two weeks) gather a new zebrafish dataset. We use SAMPLs analysis and visualization tools to replicate and extend our current understanding of how zebrafish balance as they navigate through a vertical environment. Next, we discover (1) that key kinematic parameters vary systematically with genetic background, and (2) that such background variation is small relative to the changes that accompany early development. Finally, we simulate SAMPLs ability to resolve differences in posture or vertical navigation as a function of effect size and data gathered - key data for screens. Taken together, our apparatus, data, and analysis provide a powerful solution for laboratories using small animals to investigate balance and locomotor disorders at scale. More broadly, SAMPL is both an adaptable resource for laboratories looking process video-graphic measures of behavior in real-time, and an exemplar of how to scale hardware to enable the throughput necessary for screening.",
