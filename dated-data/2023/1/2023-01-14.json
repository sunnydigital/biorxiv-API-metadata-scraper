    "abstract": "The transition between pluripotent and tissue-specific states is a key aspect of development. Understanding the pathways driving these transitions will facilitate the engineering of properly differentiated cells for experimental and therapeutic uses. Here, we showed that during mesoderm differentiation, the transcription factor Oct1 activated developmental lineage-appropriate genes that were silent in pluripotent cells. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with an inducible knockout of Oct1, we showed that Oct1 deficiency resulted in poor induction of mesoderm-specific genes, leading to impaired mesodermal and terminal muscle differentiation. Oct1-deficient cells exhibited poor temporal coordination of the induction of lineage-specific genes and showed inappropriate developmental lineage branching, resulting in poorly differentiated cell states retaining epithelial characteristics. In ESCs, Oct1 localized with the pluripotency factor Oct4 at mesoderm-associated genes and remained bound to those loci during differentiation after the dissociation of Oct4. Binding events for Oct1 overlapped with those for the histone lysine demethylase Utx, and an interaction between Oct1 and Utx suggested that these two proteins cooperate to activate gene expression. The specificity of the ubiquitous Oct1 for the induction of mesodermal genes could be partially explained by the frequent coexistence of Smad and Oct binding sites at mesoderm-specific genes and the cooperative stimulation of mesodermal gene transcription by Oct1 and Smad3. Together, these results identify Oct1 as a key mediator of mesoderm lineage-specific gene induction.",

    "abstract": "K+ channel activity can be limited by C-type inactivation, which is likely initiated in part by dissociation of K+ ions from the selectivity filter, and modulated by side chains surrounding the selectivity filter. Whereas crystallographic and computational studies have linked inactivation to a  collapsed selectivity filter conformation in the KcsA channel, the structural basis for selectivity filter gating in other K+ channels has been less clear. Here, we combined electrophysiological recordings with molecular dynamics based, in silico electrophysiology simulations, to study selectivity filter gating in the model potassium channel MthK and its V55E mutant (analogous to KcsA E71) in the pore-helix. Experimentally, we find that MthK V55E has a lower open probability than the WT channel, due to decreased stability of the open state, as well as a lower unitary conductance. Simulations account for both aspects of these observations on the atomistic scale, showing that ion permeation in V55E is altered by two distinct orientations of the E55 side chain. In the  vertical orientation of E55, in which E55 forms a hydrogen bond with D64 (as observed with KcsA WT channels), the filter displays reduced conductance compared to MthK WT. In contrast, with  horizontal orientation, K+ conductance is closer to MthK WT; however the selectivity filter stability in the conducting conformation is lowered, and the filter more readily transitions to the inactivated conformation. Surprisingly, these transitions of MthK WT and V55E channels to the non-conducting (inactivated) state observed in simulations are associated with a widening selectivity filter, unlike its narrowing seen in KcsA, and reminisce the recent structures of stably-inactivated, voltage-gated potassium channels: Shaker W434F and Kv1.2 W362F mutants, as well as WT Kv1.3 channels.",

    "abstract": "The apical complex is a specialized collection of cytoskeletal and secretory machinery in apicomplexan parasites, which include the pathogens that cause malaria and toxoplasmosis. Its structure and mechanism of motion are poorly understood. We used cryo-FIB-milling and cryo-electron tomography to visualize the 3D-structure of the apical complex in its protruded and retracted states. Averages of conoid-fibers revealed their polarity and unusual nine-protofilament arrangement with associated proteins connecting and likely stabilizing the fibers. Neither the structure of the conoidfibers nor the architecture of the spiral-shaped conoid complex change during protrusion or retraction. Thus, the conoid moves as a rigid body, and is not spring-like and compressible, as previously suggested. Instead, the apical-polar-rings (APR), previously considered rigid, dilate during conoid protrusion. We identified actin-like filaments connecting the conoid and APR during protrusion, suggesting a role during conoid movements. Furthermore, our data capture the parasites in the act of secretion during conoid protrusion.",

    "abstract": "We shift our gaze even when we orient attention internally to visual representations in working memory. Here, we show the bodily orienting response associated with internal selective attention is widespread as it also includes the head. In three virtual reality (VR) experiments, participants remembered two visual items. After a working memory delay, a central colour cue indicated which item needed to be reproduced from memory. After the cue, head movements became biased in the direction of the memorised location of the cued memory item - despite there being no items to orient towards in the external environment. The heading-direction bias had a distinct temporal profile from the gaze bias. Our findings reveal that directing attention within the spatial layout of visual working memory bears a strong relation to the overt head orienting response we engage when directing attention to sensory information in the external environment. The heading-direction bias further demonstrates common neural circuitry is engaged during external and internal orienting of attention.",

    "abstract": "Moving effectively is essential for any animal. Thats why many different kinds of brain processes likely contribute to learning and adapting movement. How these contributions are combined to shape behavior is unknown. Nevertheless, the field of motor adaptation has been working under the assumption that measures of explicit and implicit motor adaptation can simply be added in total adaptation - without testing this assumption. Here we put this additivity assumption to the test in various ways, but we find that measures of implicit and explicit adaptation are not additive. This means that future studies should measure both implicit and explicit adaptation directly. It also challenges us to disentangle how various motor adaptation processes combine when producing movements, and may have implications for our understanding of other kinds of learning as well.(data and code: https://osf.io/kr5eh)",

    "abstract": "Changing movement patterns in response to environmental perturbations is a critical aspect of gait and is related to reducing the energetic cost of the movement. Exercise improves energetic capacity for submaximal exercise and may affect how people adapt movement to reach an energetic minimum. The purpose of this study was to determine whether self-reported exercise behavior influences gait adaptation in young adults. Young adults who met the optimal volume of exercise according to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (MOVE; n=19) and young adults who did not meet the optimal volume of exercise (notMOVE; n=13) walked on a split-belt treadmill with one belt moving twice the speed of the other belt for 10 minutes. Step length asymmetry (SLA) and mechanical work done by each leg were measured. Nonlinear mixed effects models compared the time course of adaptation between MOVE and notMOVE, and t-tests compared net work at the end of adaptation between MOVE and notMOVE. Compared to notMOVE, MOVE had a faster initial response to the split belt treadmill, and continued to adapt over the duration of split-belt treadmill walking. Young adults who engage in sufficient amounts of exercise responded more quickly to the onset of a perturbation, and throughout the perturbation they continued to explore movement strategies, which might be related to reduction of energetic cost. Our findings provide insights into the multisystem positive effects of exercise, including walking adaptation.",

    "abstract": "The precise role of cognitive control on optic flow processing during locomotion has rarely been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether coping with unreliable visual inputs during walking requires attentional resources. Twenty-four healthy young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill in a virtual environment under two optic flow conditions: normal (NOF) and perturbed (POF, continuous mediolateral pseudo-random oscillations). Each condition was performed under single-task and dual-task conditions of increasing difficulty (1-, 2-, 3-back). In all conditions, subjective mental workload was estimated (raw NASA-TLX). For kinematic variables, mean, standard deviation, statistical persistence and step-to-step error correction were computed from gait time series in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. For EMG variables of soleus and gluteus medius, the full width at half maximum and the variance ratio were calculated. Performance on N-back tasks was assessed using mean reaction time and d-prime. Cognitive performance was not affected by simultaneous walking in any optic flow condition. Gait variability was altered under POF compared to NOF, so that young adults sought to counteract those perturbations by adopting an effortful gait control strategy, independently of concurrent working memory (WM) load. Increasing WM load led changes first at the neuromuscular level, then at the behavioral level, with a prioritization of gait control in the mediolateral direction. Interestingly, dual-tasking lowered the effects of POF but in the anteroposterior direction only. These findings and their theoretical implications provide valuable insight into the complex interaction effects of cognitive and visual constraints on gait control during treadmill walking.\n\nHighlights- Cognitive performance was preserved during DTW regardless of optic flow condition.\n- ML POF under DTW increased subjective mental workload.\n- Young adults counteracted ML POF by adopting an effortful gait control strategy.\n- DTW led them to prioritize gait control in the ML direction over AP direction.\n- Concurrent WM load attenuated ML POF effect on step velocity variability.",

We investigated the maternal gut microbiome longitudinally over the course of pregnancy and the impact of pre-pregnancy BMI (pBMI) and GWG. We also determined whether parity modulated observed associations. We show that the gut microbiota of participants with higher pBMI changed less over the course of pregnancy in primiparous, but not multiparous participants. This suggests that previous pregnancies may have persistent impacts on maternal adaptations to pregnancy. This ecological memory appears to be passed to the next generation, as parity modulated the impact of maternal GWG on the infant gut microbiome. This work supports a role for the gut microbiome in maternal adaptations to pregnancy and highlights the need for longitudinal sampling and accounting for parity as key considerations for studies of the microbiome in pregnancy and infants.",

    "abstract": "With the coexistence of multiple lineages and increased international travel, recombination and gene flow are likely to become increasingly important in the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This could result in the incipient parallel evolution of multiple recombinant lineages. However, identifying recombinant lineages is challenging, and the true extent of recombinant evolution in SARS-CoV-2 may be underestimated. This study describes the first SARS-CoV-2 Deltacron recombinant case identified in Brazil. We demonstrate that the recombination breakpoint is at the beginning of Spike gene (S). The 5' genome portion (circa 22 kb) resembles the AY.101 lineage (VOC Delta), and the 3' genome portion (circa 8 kb nucleotides) is most similar to the BA.1.1 lineage (VOC Omicron). Furthermore, evolutionary genomic analyses indicate that the new strain emerged after a single recombination event between lineages of diverse geographical locations in December 2021 in South Brazil. This Deltacron, named AYBA-RS, is one out of almost 30 recombinants described this year. The submission of only four sequences in the GISAID database suggests that this Brazilian lineage had a minor epidemiological impact. On the other hand, the recent emergence of this and various other Deltacron recombinant lineages (i.e., XD, XF, and XS) suggests that gene flow and recombination may play an increasingly important role in the COVID-19 pandemic. We explain the evolutionary and population genetic theory that support this assertion, and we conclude that this stresses the need for continued genomic and epidemiological surveillance. This is particularly important for countries where multiple variants are present, as well as for countries that receive significant inbound international travel.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. are associated with bacterial vaginosis, in which normally dominant lactobacilli are replaced with facultative and anaerobic bacteria including Gardnerella spp. Co-occurrence of multiple species of Gardnerella is common in the vagina and competition for nutrients such as glycogen likely contributes to the differential abundances of Gardnerella spp. Glycogen must be digested into smaller components for uptake; a process that depends on the combined action of glycogen degrading enzymes. In this study, the ability of culture supernatants of 15 isolates of Gardnerella spp. to produce glucose, maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose from glycogen was demonstrated. Carbohydrate active enzymes were identified bioinformatically in Gardnerella proteomes using dbCAN2. Identified proteins included a single domain -amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) (encoded by all 15 isolates) and an -amylase-pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41) containing amylase, carbohydrate binding modules and pullulanase domains (14/15 isolates). To verify the sequence-based functional predictions, the amylase and pullulanase domains of the -amylase-pullulanase, and the single domain -amylase were each produced in E. coli. The -amylase domain from the -amylase-pullulanase released maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose from glycogen, and the pullulanase domain released maltotriose from pullulan and maltose from glycogen, demonstrating that the Gardnerella -amylase-pullulanase is capable of hydrolyzing -1,4 and -1,6 glycosidic bonds. Similarly, the single domain -amylase protein also produced maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose from glycogen. Our findings show that Gardnerella spp. produce extracellular amylase enzymes as  public goods that can digest glycogen into maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose that can be used by the vaginal microbiota.\n\nImportanceIncreased abundance of Gardnerella spp. is a diagnostic characteristic of bacterial vaginosis, an imbalance in the human vaginal microbiome associated with troubling symptoms, and negative reproductive health outcomes, including increased transmission of sexually transmitted infections and preterm birth. Competition for nutrients is likely an important factor in causing dramatic shifts in the vaginal microbial community but little is known about the contribution of bacterial enzymes to the metabolism of glycogen, a major food source available to vaginal bacteria. The significance of our research is characterizing the activity of enzymes conserved in Gardnerella species that contribute to the ability of these bacteria to utilize glycogen.",

    "abstract": "The LIN28B RNA binding protein exhibits a ontogenically restricted expression pattern and is a key molecular regulator of fetal and neonatal B lymphopoiesis. It enhances the positive selection of CD5+ immature B cells early in life through amplifying the CD19/PI3K/c-MYC pathway and is sufficient to reinitiate self-reactive B-1a cell output when ectopically expressed in the adult. In this study, interactome analysis in primary B cell precursors showed direct binding by LIN28B to numerous ribosomal protein transcripts, consistent with a regulatory role in cellular protein synthesis. Induction of LIN28B expression in the adult setting is sufficient to promote enhanced protein synthesis during the small Pre-B and immature B cell stages, but not during the Pro-B cell stage. This stage dependent effect was dictated by IL-7 mediated signaling, which masked the impact of LIN28B through an overpowering stimulation on the c-MYC / protein synthesis axis in Pro-B cells. Importantly, elevated protein synthesis was a distinguishing feature between neonatal and adult B cell development that was critically supported by endogenous Lin28b expression early in life. Finally, we used a ribosomal hypomorphic mouse model to demonstrate that subdued protein synthesis is specifically detrimental for neonatal B lymphopoiesis and the output of B-1a cells, without affecting B cell development in the adult. Taken together, we identify elevated protein synthesis as a defining requirement for early-life B cell development that critically depends on Lin28b. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into the layered formation of the complex adult B cell repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Enzymatic pockets such as those of histone deacetylases (HDACs) are among the most favored targets for drug development. However, enzymatic inhibitors often exhibit low selectivity and high toxicity due to targeting multiple enzyme paralogs, which are often involved in distinct multisubunit complexes. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a non-enzymatic small molecule inhibitor of HDAC transcriptional repression functions with comparable anti-tumor activity to the enzymatic HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, and anti-psychedelic activity of an HDAC2 knockout in vivo. We highlight that these phenotypes are achieved while modulating the expression of 20- and 80-fold fewer genes than enzymatic and genetic inhibition in the respective models. Thus, by achieving the same biological outcomes as established therapeutics while impacting a dramatically smaller number of genes, inhibitors of protein-protein interactions can offer important advantages in improving the selectivity of epigenetic modulators.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/519454v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (96K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3a4e68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1be2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc5e94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a54790_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the substantial roles of the Ambra1 mutation in neurons are still unknown. We find that Ambra1 heterozygotes display a moderate decrease in excitatory synaptic release in-vitro and ex-vivo exclusively in females without autophagy activity, resulting in significant alterations in {gamma}-oscillation power and seizure susceptibility by excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. Specifically, Ambra1 deficiency has no effect on neurogenesis and morphogenesis, but selectively decreases excitatory synaptic activity without changes in synapse number, quantal size, synaptic release probability, and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the limited excitatory synaptopathy by Ambra1 expression levels ultimately determines E/I imbalance in global neural networks leading to the female-specific ASD.",

    "abstract": "Due to climate change, drought frequencies and severities are predicted to increase across the United States. Plant responses and adaptation to stresses depend on plant genetic and environmental factors. Understanding the effect of those factors on plant performance is required to predict the species responses to environmental change. We used reciprocal gardens planted with distinct regional Andropogon gerardii ecotypes adapted to dry, mesic, and wet environments to characterize their rhizosphere communities using 16S rRNA metabarcode sequencing. Even though the local microbial pool was the main driver of these rhizosphere communities, the significant plant ecotype effect highlighted active microbial recruitment in the rhizosphere driven by ecotype or plant genetic background. Our data also suggest that ecotypes were more successful in recruiting rhizosphere community members unique to their local homesites, supporting the \"home field advantage\" hypothesis. These unique homesite microbes may represent microbial specialists that are linked to plant stress responses. Further, our data support ecotypic variation in the recruitment of congeneric but distinct bacterial variants, highlighting the nuanced effects of plant ecotypes on the rhizosphere microbiome recruitment. Our results should facilitate expanded studies on understanding the complexity of plant host interactions with local soil microbes and identification of functional potential of recruited microbes. Our study has the potential to aid in predicting ecosystem responses to climate change and the impact of management on restoration practices.\n\nImportanceIn this study, we used reciprocal gardens located across a sharp precipitation gradient to characterize rhizosphere communities of distinct dry, mesic, and wet regional Andropogon gerardii ecotypes. We used16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and focused oligotyping analysis and showed that even though the location was the main driver of the microbial communities, ecotypes could potentially recruit distinct bacterial populations. We showed that different A. gerardii ecotypes were more successful in overall community recruitment and recruitment of microbes unique to the \"home\" environment, when growing at their \"home site\". We found evidence for \"home field advantage\" interactions between the host and associated rhizobiomes, and the capability of ecotypes to recruit specialized microbes that were potentially linked to plant stress responses. Our study provides insights into the understanding of factors effecting the plant adaptation, improving management strategies, and predicting of the future landscape under the changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive and nondestructive root phenotyping techniques under field conditions are sorely needed to advance plant root science. Soil polarization measured by electrical capacitance (ECsoil) has the potential to meet this requirement, but whether it specifically detects root properties remains unexplored. We carried out manipulative experiments where wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) roots were buried in soil or immersed in hydroponic solution combined with pot trials to reveal the mechanism of root trait detection by ECsoil, while a field experiment was conducted to test its feasibility to determine root depth distribution. We found that ECsoil measured at low current frequency (< 1 kHz) was not significantly affected by the addition of roots to the system either by burying roots in soil or immersing them in solution. At frequency greater than10 kHz a shift occurred, and root polarization contributed more to ECsoil which was positively correlated with root volume. When ECsoil was measured at high frequency (30 kHz -100 kHz) it was well correlated with root volume vertical distribution in the field. The measurement error after soil moisture calibration at depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm was 0.4%, 12.0%, 1% and 34%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that ECsoil is a robust method to measure in situ root distribution and we believe the newly available high frequency measurement equipment combined with novel root prediction models will enable ECsoil to be widely used for root phenotyping in the future.",

It is believed that sustained elevation of IL-6 production during cancer progression causes brain dysfunctions, which ultimately result in cachexia16-20. However, how peripheral IL-6 influences the brain remains poorly understood. Here we show that neurons in the area postrema (AP), a circumventricular structure in the hindbrain, mediate the function of IL-6 in cancer-associated cachexia in mice. We found that circulating IL-6 can rapidly enter the AP and activate AP neurons. Peripheral tumor, known to increase circulating IL-61-5,15,18,21-23, leads to elevated IL-6 and neuronal hyperactivity in the AP, and causes potentiated excitatory synaptic transmission onto AP neurons. Remarkably, neutralization of IL-6 in the brain of tumor-bearing mice with an IL-6 antibody prevents cachexia, reduces the hyperactivity in an AP network, and markedly prolongs lifespan. Furthermore, suppression of Il6ra, the gene encoding IL-6 receptor, specifically in AP neurons with CRISPR/dCas9 interference achieves similar effects. Silencing of Gfral-expressing AP neurons also ameliorates the cancer-associated cachectic phenotypes and AP network hyperactivity. Our study identifies a central mechanism underlying the function of peripheral IL-6, which may serve as a target for treating cancer-associated cachexia.",

    "abstract": "The Event-based Vision Sensor (EVS) is a bio-inspired sensor that captures detailed motions of objects, developed with the applicability to become the  eyes of machines and especially self-driving cars. Compared to conventional frame-based image sensors as employed in video cameras, EVS has an extremely fast motion capture equivalent to 10,000-fps even with standard optical settings and additionally has high dynamic ranges for brightness and also lower consumption of memory and energy. These features make the EVS an ideal method to tackle questions in biology, such as the fine-scale behavioural ecology. Here, we developed 22 characteristic features for analysing the motions of aquatic particles from the raw data of the EVS, and deployed the EVS system in both natural environments and laboratory aquariums to test its applicability to filming and analysing plankton behaviour. Our EVS monitoring in turbid water at the bottom of Lake Biwa, Japan identified several particles exhibiting distinct cumulative trajectory with periodicities in their motion (up to 16 Hz), suggesting that they were living organisms with rhythmic behaviour. We also carried out EVS monitoring in the deep sea aided by infrared lighting to minimise influence on behaviour, and observed particles with active motion and periodicities over 40 Hz. Furthermore, we used the EVS to observe laboratory cultures of six species of zooplankton and phytoplankton, confirming that they have species-specific motion periodicities of up to 41 Hz. We applied machine learning to automatically classify particles into five categories (four categories of zooplankton plus passive particles), which achieved an accuracy up to 86%. Our attempts to use the EVS for biological observations, especially focusing on its millisecond-scale temporal resolution and wide dynamic range provide a new avenue to investigate rapid and periodical motion and behaviour in small organisms. Given its compact size with low consumption of battery and memory, the EVS will likely be applicable in the near future for the automated monitoring of the behaviour of plankton by edge computing on autonomous floats, as well as quantifying rapid cellular-level activities under microscopy.",

    "abstract": "ExoY virulence factors are members of a family of bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases (NCs) that are activated by specific eukaryotic cofactors and overproduce cyclic purine and pyrimidine nucleotides in host cells. ExoYs are actin-activated NC toxins. Here, we investigate the Vibrio nigripulchritudo Multifunctional-Autoprocessing Repeats-in-ToXin (MARTX) ExoY effector domain (Vn-ExoY) as a model for ExoY-type members that interact with monomeric (G-actin) rather than filamentous (F-actin) actin. Vn-ExoY binds with only modest affinity to free or profilin-bound G-actin, but can capture the G-actin:profilin complex for its own activation by preventing the spontaneous or VASP- or formin-mediated assembly of G-actin:profilin at the barbed ends of F-actin in vitro. This may prolong the lifetime of the cofactor-bound state of Vn-ExoY at sites of active actin cytoskeleton remodelling. A series of high-resolution crystal structures of nucleotide-free, 3-deoxy-ATP- or 3-deoxy-CTP-bound Vn-ExoY, activated by free or profilin-bound G-actin-ATP/-ADP show that the cofactor only partially stabilises the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP) of all NC toxins. Substrate binding promotes a large, previously-unidentified, closure of their NBP. This confines catalytically important residues of the NC toxins and metal cofactors around the substrate and promotes the recruitment of two metal ions to tightly coordinate the triphosphate moiety of purine or pyrimidine nucleotide substrates. Residues that play an important role in both the purinyl and pyrimidinyl cyclase activity of NC toxins are validated in Vn-ExoY and the distantly-related ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that interact with F-actin. The data conclusively demonstrate that NC toxins employ a similar two-metal-ion mechanism for catalysing the cyclisation reaction of nucleotides of different sizes. These structural insights into the dynamics of the actin-binding interface of actin-activated ExoYs and the multi-step activation of all NC toxins open up new perspectives for identifying ways to specifically inhibit these bacterial NC enzymes.\n\nAuthor SummaryExoY toxins belong to a family of bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases (NCs) that are injected into eukaryotic cells and bind to specific host cofactors to trigger their toxic, potent NC enzymatic activity. They alter host cell signalling by overproducing purine and pyrimidine cyclic nucleotides, which act as canonical and non-canonical intracellular messengers, respectively. The molecular and mechanistic details underlying the activation and catalytic specificities of NC toxins are only partially understood. Here, we investigate ExoY-type members that are unable to interact with actin filaments for their activation. We show in vitro that such ExoYs capture the actin:profilin complex for activation by disrupting its association with the most dynamic ends of actin filaments. We have captured several structural snapshots along the Vn-ExoY activation pathway by G-actin or G-actin-profilin without or with purine or pyrimidine nucleotide analogues. Our structural data reveal unprecedented mechanistic details of how the active site of all NC toxins is sequentially remodelled by cofactor and substrate binding, how they can accommodate nucleotides of different sizes as substrates, and elucidate important features of their catalytic reaction. These structural insights into the multi-step activation of NC toxins provide new perspectives for identifying ways to specifically inhibit this class of NC enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+ is a fundamental determinant of survival in living cells. Excessive intracellular Ca2+ causes cellular toxicity and death but the genetic pathways contributing to Ca2+ induced cell death are incompletely understood. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screening in human cells challenged with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and identified genes and pathways essential for cell death after Ca2+ overload. We discovered 115 protective gene knockouts, 82 of which are non-essential genes and 21 of which belong to the druggable genome. Notably, members of store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), very long-chain fatty acid synthesis, and SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) pathways provided marked protection against Ca2+ toxicity. These results reveal pathways previously unknown to mediate Ca2+-induced cell death and provide a resource for the development of pharmacotherapies against the sequelae of Ca2+ overload in disease.",

    "abstract": "Genetic networks are surprisingly robust to perturbations caused by new mutations. This robustness is conferred in part by compensation for loss of a genes activity by genes with overlapping functions, such as paralogs. Compensation occurs passively when the normal activity of one paralog can compensate for the loss of the other, or actively when a change in one paralogs expression, localization, or activity is required to compensate for loss of the other. The mechanisms of active compensation remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we investigate active compensation for the loss or reduction in expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene TDH3 by its paralogs TDH1 and TDH2. TDH1 and TDH2 are upregulated in a dose-dependent manner in response to reductions in TDH3 by a mechanism requiring the shared transcriptional regulators Gcr1p and Rap1p. Other glycolytic genes regulated by Rap1p and Gcr1p show changes in expression similar to TDH2, suggesting that the active compensation by TDH3 paralogs is part of a broader homeostatic response mediated by shared transcriptional regulators.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploid human eggs (oocytes) are a major cause of infertility, miscarriage and chromosomal disorders. Such aneuploidies increase greatly as women age, originating from defective linkages between sister-chromatids (cohesion) in meiosis. We found evidence that loss of a specific pool of the cohesin protector protein, shugoshin 2 (Sgo2) contributes to this phenomenon. Our data indicate that Sgo2 preserves sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis by protecting a  cohesin bridge between sister chromatids. In human oocytes, Sgo2 localizes to both sub-centromere cups and the pericentromeric bridge which spans the sister chromatid junction. Sgo2 normally colocalizes with cohesin, however, in oocytes from older women, Sgo2 is frequently lost specifically from the pericentromeric bridge and sister chromatid cohesion is weakened. Mps1 and Bub1 kinase activities maintain Sgo2 at sub-centromeres and the pericentromeric bridge. Removal of Sgo2 throughout meiosis I by Mps1 inhibition reduces cohesion protection, increasing the incidence of single chromatids at meiosis II. Therefore, Sgo2 deficiency in human oocytes can exacerbate the effects of maternal age by rendering residual cohesin at pericentromeres vulnerable to loss in anaphase I. Our data show that maternal age-dependent loss of Sgo2 at the pericentromere bridge in human oocytes impairs cohesion integrity and contributes to the increased incidence of aneuploidy observed in human oocytes with advanced maternal age.",

    "abstract": "DNAAF5 is a dynein motor assembly factor associated with the autosomal heterogenic recessive condition of motile cilia, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The effects of allele heterozygosity on motile cilia function are unknown. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in mice to recreate a human missense variant identified in patients with mild PCD and a second, frameshift null deletion in Dnaaf5. Litters with Dnaaf5 heteroallelic variants showed distinct missense and null gene dosage effects. Homozygosity for the null Dnaaf5 alleles was embryonic lethal. Compound heterozygous animals with the missense and null alleles showed severe disease manifesting as hydrocephalus and early lethality. However, animals homozygous for the missense mutation had improved survival, with partial preserved cilia function and motor assembly observed by ultrastructure analysis. Notably, the same variant alleles exhibited divergent cilia function across different multiciliated tissues. Proteomic analysis of isolated airway cilia from mutant mice revealed reduction in some axonemal regulatory and structural proteins not previously reported in DNAAF5 variants. While transcriptional analysis of mouse and human mutant cells showed increased expression of genes coding for axonemal proteins. Together, these findings suggest allele-specific and tissue-specific molecular requirements for cilia motor assembly that may affect disease phenotypes and clinical trajectory in motile ciliopathies.\n\nBrief SummaryA mouse model of human DNAAF5 primary ciliary dyskinesia variants reveals gene dosage effects of mutant alleles and tissue-specific molecular requirements for cilia motor assembly.",

In particular, reduced levels of the RNA helicase EIF4A3 cause Richieri-Costa-Pereira Syndrome (RCPS) and CNVs are linked to intellectual disability. Consistent with this, Eif4a3 haploinsufficient mice are microcephalic. Altogether, this implicates EIF4A3 in cortical development; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we use mouse and human models to demonstrate that EIF4A3 promotes cortical development by controlling progenitor mitosis, cell fate, and survival. Eif4a3 haploinsufficiency in mice causes extensive cell death and impairs neurogenesis. Using Eif4a3;p53 compound mice, we show that apoptosis is most impactful for early neurogenesis, while additional p53-independent mechanisms contribute to later stages. Live imaging of mouse and human neural progenitors reveals Eif4a3 controls mitosis length, which influences progeny fate and viability. These phenotypes are conserved as cortical organoids derived from RCPS iPSCs exhibit aberrant neurogenesis. Finally, using rescue experiments we show that EIF4A3 controls neuron generation via the EJC. Altogether, our study demonstrates that EIF4A3 mediates neurogenesis by controlling mitosis duration and cell survival, implicating new mechanisms underlying EJC-mediated disorders.\n\nSummary statementThis study shows that EIF4A3 mediates neurogenesis by controlling mitosis duration in both mouse and human neural progenitors, implicating new mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is an important biomedical model organism used in many disciplines. The phenomenon of developmental delay in zebrafish embryos has been widely reported as part of a mutant or treatment-induced phenotype. However, the detection and quantification of these delays is often achieved through manual observation with reference to staging guides, which is both time-consuming and subjective. We recently reported a machine learning-based classifier, capable of quantifying the developmental delay between two populations of zebrafish embryos. Here, we build on that work by introducing a deep learning-based model (KimmelNet) that has been trained to predict the age (hours post fertilisation) of populations of zebrafish embryos. We show that when KimmelNet is tested on 2D brightfield images of zebrafish embryos, the predictions generated agree closely with those expected from established approaches to staging. Random sampling of the test data demonstrate that KimmelNet can be used to detect developmental delay between two populations with high confidence based on as few as 100 images of each population. Finally, we show that KimmelNet generalises to previously unseen data, with limited transfer learning improving this performance significantly. With the ability to analyse tens of thousands of standard brightfield microscopy images on a timescale of minutes, we envisage that KimmelNet will be a valuable resource for the developmental biology community. Furthermore, the approach we have used could easily be adapted to generate models for other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration (CCM) plays important roles in development, physiological, and pathological processes. A key feature of CCM is the dynamic mechanical coupling between cells, which enables both long-range coordination and local rearrangements. This coupling requires the ability of cell adhesions to adapt to forces. Recent efforts have identified key proteins and implicated cellular-scale mechanical properties, but how key proteins give rise to these larger-scale mechanical processes is unclear. Using force-sensitive biosensors, cell migration assays, and molecular clutch models, we sought a molecular understanding of adhesion strengthening that could bridge this gap. We found that the mechanical linker protein vinculin bears substantial loads at AJs, FAs, and in the cytoplasm during epithelial sheet migration, and we identified a switch-like residue on vinculin that regulates its conformation and loading at the AJs during CCM. In vinculin KO-rescue, this switch jointly controlled the speed and coupling length-scale of CCM, which suggested changes in adhesion-based friction. To test this, we developed molecularly detailed friction clutch models of the FA and AJ. They show that open, loaded vinculin increases friction in adhesive structures, with larger affects observed in AJs. Thus, this work elucidates how load-bearing linker proteins can be regulated to alter mechanical properties of cells and enable rapid tuning of mechanical coupling in CCM.",

Despite this, there are no medical therapies for intestinal fibrosis. This is in part due to lack of high-fidelity biomimetic models to enhance understanding and drug development. There is a need to develop in vivo models of inflammatory bowel disease-related intestinal fibrosis. We sought to determine if the TNF{Delta}ARE mouse, a model of ileal inflammation, may also develop intestinal fibrosis.\n\nMethodsSeveral clinically relevant outcomes were studied including features of structural fibrosis, histological fibrosis, and gene expression. These include the use of a luminal casting technique we developed, traditional histological outcomes, use of second harmonic imaging, and quantitative PCR. These features were studied in aged TNF{Delta}ARE mice as well as in cohorts of numerous ages.\n\nResultsAt ages of 24+ weeks, TNF{Delta}ARE mice develop structural, histological, and genetic changes of ileal fibrosis. Genetic expression profiles have changes as early as six weeks, followed by histological changes occurring as early as 14-15 weeks, and overt structural fibrosis delayed until after 24 weeks.\n\nDiscussionThe TNF{Delta}ARE mouse is a viable and highly tractable model of intestinal fibrosis. This model and the techniques employed can be leveraged for both mechanistic studies and therapeutic development for the treatment of intestinal fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has implicated impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) clearance as a key factor in fibrotic disease. Despite decades of research elucidating the effectors of ECM clearance, relatively little is understood regarding the upstream regulation of this process. Collagen is the most abundant constituent of normal and fibrotic ECM in mammalian tissues. Its catabolism occurs through extracellular proteolysis and cell-mediated uptake of collagen fragments for intracellular degradation. Given the paucity of information regarding the regulation of this latter process, we executed unbiased genome-wide screens to understand the molecular underpinnings of cell-mediated collagen clearance. Using this approach, we discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism through which collagen biosynthesis is sensed by cells internally and directly regulates clearance of extracellular collagen. The sensing mechanism is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein SEL1L and occurs via a noncanonical function of SEL1L. This pathway functions as a homeostatic negative feedback loop that limits collagen accumulation in tissues. In human fibrotic lung disease, the induction of this collagen clearance pathway by collagen synthesis is impaired, thereby contributing to the pathological accumulation of collagen in lung tissue. Thus cell-autonomous, rheostatic collagen clearance is a previously unidentified pathway of tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Microproteins are small proteins comprising 2 to 200 amino acids, arising from small Open Reading Frames (smORFs). They are found in different parts of the cell and regulate basic molecular processes like DNA replication, repair, transcription and recombination. SMIM or SMall Integral Membrane proteins are novel, largely uncharacterized, members to the class of microproteins defined by the presence of a transmembrane domain. The retinal transcriptome of zebrafish, reported previously by our group, revealed several novel mRNA transcripts that show oscillating expression in a diurnal manner. Here, we show that one of these transcripts encodes the zebrafish homolog of the human SMIM36 protein, which has not been functionally characterised. This highly conserved microprotein is expressed in the human and zebrafish retina, and efficiently translated in cell lines. Using single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we found that it is expressed in the bipolar cells, rods and Muller glia in the human retina. The knockdown of SMIM36 using splice-block morpholino caused microphthalmia and defects in the retinal layers in zebrafish. Therefore, we show the role of a microprotein in the neural retina thus paving the way for future studies on the role of SMIM proteins in retinal disorders.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to insecticides in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens the effectiveness of the most widespread tools currently used to control malaria. The genetic underpinnings of resistance are still only partially understood, with much of the variance in resistance phenotype left unexplained. We performed a multi-country large scale genome-wide association study of resistance to two insecticides widely used in malaria control: deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl. Using a bioassay methodology designed to maximise the phenotypic difference between resistant and susceptible samples, we sequenced 969 phenotyped female An. gambiae and An. coluzzii from ten locations across four countries in West Africa (Benin, Cote dIvoire, Ghana and Togo), identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) segregating in the populations. The patterns of resistance association were highly multiallelic and variable between populations, with different genomic regions contributing to resistance, as well as different mutations within a given region. While the strongest and most consistent association with deltamethrin resistance came from the region around Cyp6aa1, this resistance was based on a combination of several independent CNVs in An. coluzzii, and on a non-CNV bearing haplotype in An. gambiae. Further signals involved a range of cytochrome P450, mitochondrial, and immunity genes. Similarly, for pirimiphos-methyl, while the strongest signal came from the region of Ace1, more widespread signals included cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and a subunit of the nAChR target site of neonicotinoid insecticides. The regions around Cyp9k1 and the Tep family of immune genes were associated with resistance to both insecticide classes, suggesting possible cross-resistance mechanisms. These locally-varying, multigenic and multiallelic patterns highlight the challenges involved in genomic monitoring and surveillance of resistance, and form the basis for improvement of methods used to detect and predict resistance. Based on simulations of resistance variants, we recommend that yet larger scale studies, exceeding 500 phenotyped samples per population, are required to better identify associated genomic regions.",

Here, we performed the first human subjects study using the CandyCollect device, a lollipop inspired saliva collection device.1 We showed the CandyCollect device can be used to collect salivary bacteria from healthy adults using Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus as proof-of-concept commensal bacteria. We enrolled healthy adults in a nationwide (USA) remote study in which participants were sent study packages containing CandyCollect devices and traditional commercially available oral swabs and spit tubes. Participants sampled themselves at home, completed usability and user preference surveys, and mailed the samples back to our laboratory for analysis by qPCR. Our results showed that for participants in which a given bacterium (S. mutans or S. aureus) was detected in one or both of the commercially available methods (oral swab and/or spit tubes), CandyCollect devices had a 100% concordance with the positive result (n=14 participants). Furthermore, the CandyCollect device was ranked the highest preference sampling method among the three sampling methods by 26 participants surveyed (combining survey results across two enrollment groups). We also showed that the CandyCollect device has a shelf life of up to 1 year at room temperature, a storage period that is convenient for clinics or patients to keep the CandyCollect device and use it any time. Taken together, we have demonstrated that the CandyCollect is a user-friendly saliva collection tool that has the potential to be incorporated into diagnostic assays in clinic visits and telemedicine.\n\nFor Table of Contents Only\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524039v6_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1356b32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c737org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1872455org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1625069_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein, the primary retrograde microtubule transport motor within cells, must be activated for processive motility through the regulated assembly of a dynein-dynactin-adapter (DDA) complex. The interaction between dynein and dynactin was initially ascribed to the N-terminus of the dynein intermediate chain (IC) and a coiled-coil of the dynactin subunit p150Glued. However, cryo-EM structures of DDA complexes have not resolve these regions of the IC and p150Glued, raising questions about the importance of this interaction. The IC N-terminus (ICN) also interacts with the dynein regulators Nde1/Ndel1, which compete with p150Glued for binding to ICN. Using a combination of approaches, we reveal that the ICN plays critical, evolutionarily conserved roles in DDA assembly by interacting with dynactin and Ndel1, the latter of which recruits the DDA assembly factor LIS1 to the dynein complex. In contrast to prior models, we find that LIS1 cannot simultaneously bind to Ndel1 and dynein, indicating that LIS1 must be handed off from Ndel1 to dynein in temporally discrete steps. Whereas exogenous Ndel1 or p150Glued disrupts DDA complex assembly in vitro, neither perturbs preassembled DDA complexes, indicating that the IC is stably bound to p150Glued within activated DDA complexes. Our study reveals previously unknown regulatory steps in the dynein activation pathway, and provides a more complete model for how the activities of LIS1/Ndel1 and dynactin/cargo-adapters are integrated to regulate dynein motor activity.",

As the search for new antibiotics motivates attempts to redesign nonribosomal metabolic pathways, more robust and rapid sorting and screening platforms are needed. Here, we establish a microfluidic platform that reliably detects production of the model nonribosomal peptide gramicidin S. The detection is based on calcein-filled sensor liposomes yielding increased fluorescence upon permeabilization. From a library of NRPS mutants, the sorting platform enriches the gramicidin S producer 14.5-fold, decreases the number of stop codons 250-fold, and generates enrichment factors correlating with enzyme activity.

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy still associated with poor survival rates, among others due to frequent occurrence of therapy-resistant relapse after standard-of-care treatment with cytarabine (AraC). AraC triggers apoptotic cell death, a type of cell death to which AML cells often become resistant. Therefore, therapeutic options that trigger an alternate type of cell death are of particular interest. We previously identified that the glycan-binding protein Galectin-9 (Gal-9) has tumor-selective and non-apoptotic cytotoxicity towards various types of cancer, which depended on autophagy inhibition. Thus, Gal-9 could be of therapeutic interest for (AraC-resistant) AML. In the current study, treatment with Gal-9 was cytotoxic for AML cells, including for CD34+ patient-derived AML stem cells, but not for healthy cord blood-derived CD34+ stem cells. This Gal-9-mediated cytotoxicity did not rely on apoptosis but negatively associated with autophagic flux. Importantly, both AraC-sensitive and -resistant AML cell lines as well as AML patient samples were sensitive to single agent treatment with Gal-9. Additionally, Gal-9 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of DNA demethylase inhibitor Azacytidine (Aza), a drug that is clinically used for patients that are not eligible for intensive AraC treatment. Thus, Gal-9 is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AML, including AraC resistant AML, by inducing caspase-independent cell death.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) have enabled great advances in the study of tumor development and therapeutic response, allowing researchers to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the tumor and its microenvironment. However, these models face serious drawbacks in the realm of parameterization - ABM parameters are typically set individually based on various data and literature sources, rather than through a rigorous parameter estimation approach. While ABMs can be fit to time-course data, that type of data loses the spatial information that is a defining feature of ABMs. Tumor images provide spatial information; however, such images only represent individual timepoints, limiting their utility in calibrating the tumor dynamics predicted by ABMs. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to compare tumor images to ABM simulations beyond a qualitative visual comparison. Without a quantitative method of comparing the similarity of tumor images to ABM simulations, a rigorous parameter fitting is not possible. Here, we present a novel approach that applies neural networks to represent both tumor images and ABM simulations as low dimensional points, with the distance between points acting as a quantitative measure of difference between the two. This enables a quantitative comparison of tumor images and ABM simulations, where the distance between simulated and experimental images can be minimized using standard parameter-fitting algorithms. Here, we describe this method and present two examples to demonstrate the application of the approach to estimate parameters for two distinct ABMs. Overall, we provide a novel method to robustly estimate ABM parameters.",

    "abstract": "Enteric pathogens cause widespread foodborne illness and are increasingly found to harbor antimicrobial resistance. The ecological impact of these pathogens on the human gut microbiome and resistome, however, has yet to be fully elucidated. This study applied shotgun metagenome sequencing to stools from 60 patients (cases) with enteric bacterial infections for comparison to stools collected from the same patients post-recovery (follow-ups). Overall, the case samples harbored more antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and had greater resistome diversity than the follow-up samples (p<0.001), while follow-ups had much more diverse microbiomes (p<0.001). Although cases were primarily defined by genera Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shigella along with ARGs for multi-compound and multidrug resistance, follow-ups had a greater abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla and genes for tetracycline, macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins (MLS), and aminoglycoside resistance. A host-tracking analysis revealed that Escherichia was the primary carrier of ARGs in both cases and follow-ups, with a greater abundance occurring during infection. Eleven distinct extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were identified during infection, some of which appear to be lost or transferred to different microbial hosts upon recovery. The increasing incidence of disease caused by foodborne pathogens, coupled with their evolving role in harboring and transferring antimicrobial resistance determinants within communities, justifies further examination of the repercussions of enteric infection on human gut ecology.",

Here, we use thousands of microbial communities cultured in vitro from human feces to uncover simple assembly rules and develop a predictive model of community composition upon addition of single nutrients from central carbon metabolism to a complex medium. Community membership was largely determined by the donor feces, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient, due to the ability of fast-growing organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities. Our study reveals that community assembly follows simple rules of nutrient utilization dynamics and provides a predictive framework for manipulating gut commensal communities through nutritional perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Alpha herpesvirus (-HV) particles enter their hosts from mucosal surfaces and efficiently maintain fast transport in peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons to establish infections in the peripheral ganglia. The path from axons to distant neuronal nuclei is challenging to dissect due to the difficulty of monitoring early events in a dispersed neuron culture model. We have established well-controlled, reproducible, and reactivateable latent infections in compartmented rodent neurons by infecting physically isolated axons with a small number of viral particles. This system not only recapitulates the physiological infection route, but also facilitates independent treatment of isolated cell bodies or axons. Consequently, this system enables study not only of the stimuli that promote reactivation, but also the factors that regulate the initial switch from productive to latent infection. Adeno associated virus (AAV) mediated expression of herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) VP16 alone in neuronal cell bodies enabled the escape from silencing of incoming pseudorabies virus (PRV) genomes. Furthermore, expression of HSV VP16 alone reactivated a latent PRV infection in this system. Surprisingly, expression of PRV VP16 protein supported neither PRV escape from silencing nor reactivation. We compared transcription transactivation activity of both VP16 proteins in primary neurons by RNA sequencing and found that these homolog viral proteins produce different gene expression profiles. AAV transduced HSV VP16 specifically induced expression of proto-oncogenes including Jun and Pim2. In addition, HSV VP16 induces phosphorylation of Jun in neurons, and when this activity is inhibited, escape of PRV silencing is dramatically reduced.",

    "abstract": "Nosema ceranae is an emergent microsporidia parasite of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera), which causes serious nosemosis implicated in honeybee colony losses worldwide. N. ceranae is an obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasite that mainly invades the midgut of honeybees. Recent studies find that bee gut microbiota is potentially involved in protecting against parasitism. Here, using laboratory-generated bees mono-associated with gut members, we find that Snodgrassella alvi inhibited microsporidia proliferation, potentially via the stimulation of host oxidant-mediated immune response. Accordingly, N. ceranae employs the thioredoxin and glutathione systems to defend against oxidative stress and maintain a balanced redox equilibrium, which is essential for the infection process. We knocked down the gene expression using nanoparticle-mediated RNA interference, which targets the {gamma}-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase and thioredoxin reductase genes of microsporidia. It significantly reduces the spore load, confirming the importance of the antioxidant mechanism for the intracellular invasion of the N. ceranae parasite. Finally, we genetically modified the symbiotic S. alvi to deliver dsRNA corresponding to the genes involved in the redox system of the microsporidia. The engineered S. alvi induces RNA interference and represses parasite gene expression, thereby inhibits the parasitism by up to 99.8%. Specifically, N. ceranae was most suppressed by the recombinant strain corresponding to the glutathione synthetase or by a mixture of bacteria expressing variable dsRNA. Our findings extend our previous understanding of the protection of gut symbionts against N. ceranae and provide a symbiont-mediated RNAi system for inhibiting microsporidia infection in honeybees.",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a remarkably well-adapted facultative intracellular pathogen that can thrive in a wide range of ecological niches. L. monocytogenes maximizes its ability to generate energy from diverse carbon sources using a respiro-fermentative metabolism that can function under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Cellular respiration maintains redox homeostasis by regenerating NAD+ while also generating a proton motive force (PMF). The end products of the menaquinone (MK) biosynthesis pathway are essential to drive both aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration. We previously demonstrated that intermediates in the MK biosynthesis pathway, notably 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA), are required for the survival and virulence of L. monocytogenes independent of their role in respiration. Furthermore, we found that restoration of NAD+/NADH ratio through expression of water-forming NADH oxidase (NOX) could rescue phenotypes associated with DHNA deficiency. Here we extend these findings to demonstrate that endogenous production or direct supplementation of DHNA restored both the cellular redox homeostasis and metabolic output of fermentation in L. monocytogenes. Further, exogenous supplementation of DHNA rescues the in vitro growth and ex vivo virulence of L. monocytogenes DHNA-deficient mutants. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenous DHNA restores redox balance in L. monocytogenes specifically through the recently annotated NADH dehydrogenase Ndh2, independent of the extracellular electron transport (EET) pathway. These data suggest that the production of DHNA may represent an additional layer of metabolic adaptability by L. monocytogenes to drive energy metabolism in the absence of respiration-favorable conditions.",

    "abstract": "Empirical description of phenotypic shifts in selection experiments have nourished quantitative genetics models. These models have shown that long-term selection responses depend both on the initial standing variance as well as the flux of incoming mutations, and that quantifying the proportion of genetic variance due to latter is essential to understanding the seeming absence of selection limits. There are however at least two important things to keep in mind when interpreting selection experiments: first correlative responses to selection on non-focal traits can perturb the selection response on the focal trait and second, generations and selection environments are confounded so that genotype by environment interactions are ignored. Here we used the Saclay Divergent Selection Experiments (DSE) on maize flowering time that display striking selection responses over 22 generations and combined yearly measurements of flowering time (DSEYM), measurements of 11 traits on a subset of 308 DSE genotypes measured for two consecutive years in common gardens (DSECG), as well as genotyping data to track the fate of individual mutations in pedigrees, with four main objectives: (1) to quantify the relative contribution of standing variation and de novo mutational variance to the selection response; (2) to approximate the distribution of phenotypic effects of de novo mutations; (3) to study the impact of GxE interactions in the observed selection response; (4) to describe how trait correlations modulate the exploration of the phenotypic space. In agreement with theoretical predictions, we experimentally validated two successive phases in the selection response: one governed by the fixation of standing variants whose contribution quickly reached a plateau, and the second governed by the fixation of de novo mutations sustaining the selection response. The distribution of selected phenotypic effects confirmed the expected enrichment of fixation of beneficial mutations with an average effect of +0.278 and +0.299 days to flowering, depending on the genetic background; but also revealed fixation of unfavorable mutations reaching up to 25% of incoming mutations. Accumulation of genetic load may be due to antagonistic pleiotropy whereby mutations that were fixed in the selection environment (DSEYM) turn to be unfavorable in evaluation environment (DSECG). Finally, we found that global patterns of correlations between-traits are conserved across genetic backgrounds but exhibit a temporal pattern. Traits that are weakly or uncorrelated with flowering time allow stochastic exploration of the phenotypic space, owing to the microenvironment-specific fixation of standing variants and a pleiotropic mutational input.",

    "abstract": "High quality reference genomes are vital to study the impact of sequence variation on genome structure and function. Recent advancements in long-read sequencing have greatly improved the quality of de novo genome assemblies and enhanced the detection of sequence variants at the scale of hundreds or thousands of bases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model system for both genetic and evolutionary studies. Comparisons between two diverged wild isolates, the Bristol and Hawaiian strains, have been widely utilized in the analysis of small genetic structural variations in C. elegans. The reference genomes most widely used for these isolates were assembled using short read sequencing, which makes the detection of large structural variations challenging. To comprehensively detect both large and small structural variations as well as sequence divergence in the Hawaiian and Bristol C. elegans isolates, we generated de novo genome assemblies for each strain using both long- and short-read sequencing. With these assemblies, we annotate over 3.1Mb of sequence divergence between the Bristol and Hawaiian isolates: 337,584 SNPs, 94,503 small insertion-deletions (<50bp), and 4,334 structural variations (>50bp). By comparing our de novo genome assembly of the Bristol isolate to the VC2010 Bristol assembly, we also reveal that lab lineages display 1,162 SNPs, 1,528 indels, as well as 897 structural variations-over 2Mb of total variation. Our work highlights both the importance of using long-read sequencing in de novo genome assembly to identify the total genetic variation between strains and the underappreciated impact of long-term laboratory cultivation on genome structure.",

    "abstract": "Liquid biopsies are enabling minimally invasive monitoring and molecular profiling of diseases across medicine, but their sensitivity remains limited by the scarcity of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood. Here, we report an intravenous priming agent that is given prior to a blood draw to increase the abundance of cfDNA in circulation. Our priming agent consists of nanoparticles that act on the cells responsible for cfDNA clearance to slow down cfDNA uptake. In tumor-bearing mice, this agent increases the recovery of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by up to 60-fold and improves the sensitivity of a ctDNA diagnostic assay from 0% to 75% at low tumor burden. We envision that this priming approach will significantly improve the performance of liquid biopsies across a wide range of clinical applications in oncology and beyond.",

Moreover, implementation of the technology in imaging mode provides a means to spatially map analytes in situ. Recently, a new matrix, DBDA (N1,N4-dibenzylidenebenzene-1,4-diamine) was reported to facilitate the ionization of free fatty acids in the negative ion mode. Building on this finding, we sought to implement DBDA for MALDI mass spectrometry imaging studies in brain tissue and successfully map oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid using mouse brain sections. Moreover, we hypothesized that DBDA would provide superior ionization for sulfatides, a class of sulfolipids, with multiple biological functions. Herein we also demonstrate that DBDA is ideal for MALDI mass spectrometry imaging of fatty acids and sulfatides in brain tissue sections. Additionally, we show enhanced ionization of sulfatides using DBDA compared to three different traditionally used MALDI matrices. Together these results provide new opportunities for studies to measure sulfatides by MALDI-TOF MS including in imaging modes.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods for protein structure prediction have achieved unprecedented accuracy. However, the power of these tools to guide the engineering of protein-based therapeutics remains limited due to a gap between the ability to predict the structures of candidate proteins and the ability to assess which of those proteins are most likely to bind to a target receptor. Here we bridge this gap by introducing Automated Pairwise Peptide-Receptor AnalysIs for Screening Engineered proteins (APPRAISE), a method for predicting the receptor binding propensity of engineered proteins. After generating models of engineered proteins competing for binding to a target using an established structure-prediction tool such as AlphaFold2-multimer or ESMFold, APPRAISE performs a rapid (under 1 CPU second per model) scoring analysis that takes into account biophysical and geometrical constraints. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that APPRAISE can accurately classify receptor-dependent vs. receptor-independent engineered adeno-associated viral vectors, as well as diverse classes of engineered proteins such as miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nanobodies targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor, and peptides that specifically bind to transferrin receptor and PD-L1. With its high accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability, APPRAISE has the potential to expand the utility of current structural prediction and accelerate protein engineering for biomedical applications.",

One variable is the local density near FPs, which can be useful in studying densities within cellular bio-condensates. Here, we show that a reduction in fluorescence lifetimes of common monomeric FPs reports increased levels of local densities. We demonstrate the use of this fluorescence-based variable to report the distribution of local densities within heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), before and after early differentiation. We find that local densities within HP1 condensates in pluripotent ESCs are heterogeneous and cannot be explained by a single liquid phase. Early differentiation, however, induces a change towards a more homogeneous distribution of local densities, which can be explained as a liquid-like phase. In conclusion, we provide a fluorescence-based method to report increased local densities and apply it to distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous local densities within bio-condensates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColon cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Although several biomarkers have been developed, more sensitive and specific methods are needed for its early detection. TKS4 and CD2AP scaffold proteins have been already linked to dynamic actin assembly-related processes, such as colon cancer cell migration, although their co-instructive role during tumour-formation remains unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to validate TKS4-CD2AP interaction and study the interdependent effect of TKS4/CD2AP on oncogenic events.\n\nMethodsCD2AP was identified as a novel TKS4 interacting partner in six cell lines via co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. The interaction was validated via western blot, immunocytochemistry, DuoLink assay and peptide microarray. Gene silencing and overexpressing experiments were performed to uncover the cooperative effects of TKS4 and CD2AP in cell movement and in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The expression levels of TKS4 and CD2AP mRNAs were quantified using a human colon cancer array, and the results were subjected to bioinformatic database analysis.\n\nResultsThe molecular biology analysis revealed that one of the SH3-domain of CD2AP interacts with a proline-rich short linear motif in TKS4. Functional studies showed that TKS4 and CD2AP form a scaffold complex that regulates migration- and EMT-related pathways of colon cancer cells. The relative TKS4 and CD2AP expression level measurements pointed out that CD2AP/TKS4 ratio is a sensitive biomarker for the identification of tumorous colon tissue.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first study demonstrating the TKS4-CD2AP protein-protein interaction in vitro and in vivo and their interdependent regulative effect on mesenchymal transition-like process in colon cancer. Furthermore, the results highlight that the relative expression levels of CD2AP and TKS4 might serve as a biomarker for the diagnosis of early-stage colon cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC), the second most common in developing countries and the third most common in developed nations, is the fourth most common type of cancer in women overall. The HPV16 high-risk genotype of the virus, which is responsible for about 61% of cervical cancer incidences, was found to have higher LCN2 levels in advanced clinical CC stages. In this study, we assessed the impact of suppressing LCN2 activity after treatment with an anti-LCN2 monoclonal antibody (MAb) in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Anti-LCN2 antibody was found to reduce proliferation and invasion of HeLa cells, the first immortal cells from a HPV positive aggressive adenocarcinoma of the cervix. LCN2 and its ligand MMP9 was found to be highly expressed in the cells and abrogated on treatment with anti-LCN2. The five receptors of LCN2 - SLC22A17, MC1R, MC2R, MC4R and LRP2 were barely detected with or without treatment. Anti-LCN2 Mab caused tumors to regress and soften in vivo, in a xenograft mouse model. Analysis of histology images of the treated and untreated tumor established the necrotic capability of the therapeutic molecule explaining the regression and softening of the tumor. Differential gene expression analysis between untreated and treated tumor proved that LCN2 inhibition abolished the migratory, invasive, and hypoxic pathways while significantly increasing the necrosis and cell death pathways in tumor after treatment with the monoclonal antibody. LCN2 inhibition was shown molecularly to lead to tumor regression via a negative feedback loop of LCN2 through the TNF-IL17 axis exponentially increasing the effect of the anti-LCN2 monoclonal antibody. In conclusion, LCN2 appears to be a viable therapeutic target, and the monoclonal antibody used in this study can be further developed for clinical usage in cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "Point mutations within the TERT promoter are the most recurrent somatic non-coding mutations identified across different cancer types, including glioblastoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder cancer. They are most abundant at C146T and C124T and rarer at A57C, with the latter originally described as a familial case but subsequently shown also to occur somatically. All three mutations create de novo ETS (E-twenty-six specific) binding sites and result in the reactivation of the TERT gene, allowing cancer cells to achieve replicative immortality. Here, we employed a systematic proteomics screen to identify transcription factors preferentially binding to the C146T, C124T and A57C mutations. While we confirmed binding of multiple ETS factors to the mutant C146T and C124T sequences, we identified E4F1 as an A57C-specific binder and ZNF148 as a TERT WT binder that is excluded from the TERT promoter by the C124T allele. Both proteins are activating transcription factors that bind specifically to the A57C and wildtype (at position 124) TERT promoter sequence in corresponding cell lines and upregulate TERT transcription and telomerase activity.

Mutation of Insm1 impair the expression of Aire and the generation of normal numbers of Aire-expressing mTECs during development. We detected downregulation of genes that expressed specifically in Aire-expressing mTEC and mimetic cells in Insm1 mutant mTECs. Conversely, when Insm1 was overexpressed in thymic epithelial cells in vivo, the size of the mTECs compartment was enlarged and the expression of Aire and genes expressed specifically in the neuroendocrine mimetic cells were increased. Mechanistically, Insm1 bound DNA in mTECs and the majority of the Insm1 binding sites were co-occupied by Aire. These Insm1 binding sites were enriched on super-enhancer regions and thus may contributed to remoted regulation. Both, mice with a thymus-specific mutation in Insm1 or nude mice transplanted with Insm1 mutant thymus, displayed autoimmune responses in multiple peripheral tissues.

    "abstract": "Following each round of replication, daughter merozoites of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum escape (egress) from the infected host red blood cell (RBC) by rupturing the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and the RBC membrane (RBCM). A proteolytic cascade orchestrated by the parasites serine protease, subtilisin-like protease 1 (SUB1) regulates the membrane breakdown. SUB1 activation involves primary auto-processing of the 82 kDa zymogen to a 54 kDa (p54) intermediate that remains bound to its inhibitory propiece (p31) post cleavage. A second processing step converts p54 to the terminal 47 kDa (p47) form of SUB1. Although the aspartic protease plasmepsin X (PM X) has been implicated in the activation of SUB1, the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that upon knockdown of PM X the inhibitory p31/p54 complex of SUB1 accumulates in the parasites. Using recombinant PM X and SUB1, we show that PM X can directly cleave both p31 and p54. We have mapped the cleavage sites on recombinant p31. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conversion of p54 to p47 can be effected by cleavage at either a SUB1 or PM X cleavage site that are adjacent to one another. Importantly once the p31 is removed, p54 is fully functional inside the parasites suggesting that the conversion to p47 is dispensable for SUB1 activity. Relief of propiece inhibition via a heterologous protease is a novel mechanism for subtilisin activation.\n\nSignificance StatementMalaria parasites replicate inside a parasitophorous vacuole within the host red blood cells. Exit of mature progeny from the infected host cells is essential for further dissemination. Parasite exit is a highly regulated, explosive process that involves membrane breakdown. To do this, the parasite utilizes a serine protease, called the subtilisin-like protease 1 or SUB1 that proteolytically activates various effector proteins. SUB1 activity is dependent on an upstream protease, called plasmepsin X (PM X), although the mechanism was unknown. Here we describe the molecular basis for PM X mediated SUB1 activation. PM X proteolytically degrades the inhibitory segment of SUB1, thereby activating it. Involvement of a heterologous protease is a novel mechanism for subtilisin activation.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses the LasR-I quorum sensing system to increase resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin. Paradoxically, lasR-null mutants are commonly isolated from chronic human infections treated with tobramycin, suggesting there may be a mechanism allowing the lasR-null mutants to persist under tobramycin selection. We hypothesized that the effects of inactivating lasR on tobramycin resistance might be dependent on the presence or absence of other gene mutations in that strain, a phenomenon known as epistasis. To test this hypothesis, we inactivated lasR in several highly tobramycin-resistant isolates from long-term evolution experiments. We show that the effects of {Delta}lasR on tobramycin resistance are strain dependent, which is due to a single mutation in the fusA1 gene encoding the translation elongation factor EF-G1A (G61A nucleotide substitution). The fusA1 G61A mutation confers a strong selective advantage to {Delta}lasR mutants under tobramycin treatment. The effects of fusA1 G61A on {Delta}lasR-dependent tobramycin resistance are dependent on the MexXY efflux pump and the MexXY regulator ArmZ. The fusA1 mutation also modulates {Delta}lasR mutant resistance to two other antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. Our results provide a possible explanation for the emergence of lasR-null mutants in clinical isolates and illustrate the importance of epistatic gene interactions in the evolution of quorum sensing.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying repeat expansion-induced epigenetic silencing remain largely unknown2,3. Using a plant model, we have previously shown that expanded repeats can induce smallRNAs which in turn can lead to epigenetic silencing through the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway4,5. Here, using a genetic suppressor screen, we confirm a key role for the RdDM pathway and identify novel components required for epigenetic silencing caused by expanded repeats. We show that FOURTH ULP LIKE GENE CLASS 1 (FUG1) - a SUMO protease, ALFIN-LIKE 3 - a histone reader and LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN 1 (LHP1) - a component of the PRC1 complex are required for repeat expansion-induced epigenetic silencing. Loss of any of these components suppress repeat expansion-associated phenotypes. SUMO protease FUG1 physically interacts with AL3 and perturbing its potential SUMOylation site disrupts its nuclear localisation. AL3 physically interacts with LHP1 of the PRC1 complex and the FUG1-AL3-LHP1 module is essential to confer repeat expansion-associated epigenetic silencing. Our findings highlight the importance post-translational modifiers and histone readers in epigenetic silencing caused by repeat expansions.",

We report a first-in-class intravenous DNA-binding priming agent given 2 hours prior to a blood draw to recover more cfDNA. The DNA-binding antibody minimizes nuclease digestion and organ uptake of cfDNA, decreasing its clearance at 1 hour by over 150-fold. To improve plasma persistence and limit potential immune interactions, we abrogated its Fc-effector function. We found that it protects GC-rich sequences and DNase-hypersensitive sites, which are ordinarily underrepresented in cfDNA.

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin is characterized by an enrichment of repetitive elements and low gene density and is often maintained in a repressed state across cell division and differentiation. The silencing is mainly regulated by repressive histone marks, such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylated forms and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family. Here, we analyzed in a tissue-specific manner the binding profile of the two HP1 homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans, HPL-1 and HPL-2, at the L4 developmental stage. We identified the genome-wide binding profile of intestinal and hypodermal HPL-2 and intestinal HPL-1 and compared them to heterochromatin marks and other features. HPL-2 associated preferentially to the distal arms of autosomes and correlated positively with methylated forms of H3K9 and H3K27. HPL-1 was also enriched in regions containing H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 but exhibited a more even distribution between autosome arms and centers. HPL-2 showed a differential tissue-specific enrichment for repetitive elements, conversely with HPL-1 that exhibited a poor association. Finally, we found a significant intersection of genomic regions bound by the BLMP-1/PRDM1 transcription factor and intestinal HPL-1, suggesting a co-repression role during cell differentiation. Our study uncovers both shared and singular properties of conserved HP1 proteins, providing information about genomic binding preferences in relation to their role as heterochromatic markers.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for profiling DNA methylation require costly reagents, sequencing, or labor time. We introduce FML-seq, a sequencing library protocol that greatly reduces all these costs. Relative to other techniques tested on the same human cell lines, FML-seq produces similar measurements of absolute and differential cytosine methylation at a fraction of the price. FML-seq enables inexpensive, high-throughput experimental designs for large-scale epigenetics research projects.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the mechanisms of somatic mutations in the brain is important for understanding aging and disease, but little is known about the mutational patterns of different cell types. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 71 oligodendrocytes and 51 neurons from neurotypical individuals (0.4 to 104 years old) and identified >67,000 somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels). While both cell types accumulate mutations with age, oligodendrocytes accumulate sSNVs 69% faster than neurons (27/year versus 16/year) whereas indels accumulate 42% slower (1.8/year versus 3.1/year). Correlation with single-cell RNA and chromatin accessibility from the same brains revealed that oligodendrocyte mutations are enriched in inactive genomic regions and are distributed similarly to mutations in brain cancers. In contrast, neuronal mutations are enriched in open, transcriptionally active chromatin. These patterns highlight differences in the mutagenic processes in glia and neurons and suggest cell type-specific, age-related contributions to neurodegeneration and oncogenesis.",
