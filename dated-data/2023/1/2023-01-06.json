    "abstract": "Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.)) R. Br. syn. Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone) is an important crop in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa which contributes to ensure food security. Its genome has an estimated size of 1.76 Gb and displays a high level of repetitiveness above 80%. A first assembly was previously obtained for the Tift 23D2B1-P1-P5 cultivar genotype using short-read sequencing technologies. This assembly is however incomplete and fragmented with around 200 Mb unplaced on chromosomes. We report here an improved quality assembly of the pearl millet Tift 23D2B1-P1-P5 cultivar genotype obtained with an approach combining Oxford Nanopore long reads and Bionano Genomics optical maps. This strategy allowed us to add around 200 Mb at the chromosome-level assembly. Moreover we strongly improved continuity in the order of the contigs and scaffolds wihtin the chromosomes, particularly in the centromeric regions. Notably, we added more than 100 Mb around the centromeric region on chromosome 7. This new assembly also displayed a higher gene completeness with a complete BUSO score of 98.4% using the Poales database. This more complete and higher quality assembly of the Tift 23D2B1-P1-P5 genotype now available to the community will help in the development of research on the role of structural variants, and more broadly in genomics studies and the breeding of pearl millet.",

    "abstract": "Cys-loop receptors or pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are mediators of electrochemical signaling throughout the animal kingdom. Because of their critical function in neurotransmission and high potential as drug targets, Cys-loop receptors from humans and closely related organisms have been thoroughly investigated, whereas molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission in invertebrates are less understood. When compared with vertebrates, the invertebrate genomes underwent a drastic expansion in the number of the nACh-like genes associated with receptors of unknown function. Understanding this diversity contributes to better insight into the evolution and possible functional divergence of these receptors. In this work, we studied orphan receptor Alpo4 from an extreme thermophile worm Alvinella pompejana. Sequence analysis points towards its remote relation to characterized nACh receptors. We solved the first cryo-EM structure of a lophotrochozoan nACh-like receptor in which a CHAPS molecule is tightly bound to the orthosteric site. We show that the binding of CHAPS leads to extending of the loop C at the orthosteric site and a clockwise quaternary twist between extracellular and transmembrane domains. Both the ligand binding site and the channel pore reveal unique features. These include a conserved Trp residue in loop B of the ligand binding site which is flipped into an apparent self-liganded state in the apo structure. The ion pore of Alpo4 is tightly constricted by a ring of methionines near the extracellular entryway of the channel pore. Our data provide a structural basis for a functional understanding of Alpo4 and hints towards new strategies for designing specific channel modulators.",

    "abstract": "The continuous development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to extensive and frequent use of genomic analysis in cancer research. The associated production of large-scale NGS datasets establishes the need for high-precision somatic variant calling methods that are highly optimized on commonly used hardware platforms. We present RabbitVar (https://github.com/LeiHaoa/RabbitVar), a scalable variant caller that can detect small somatic variants from paired tumor/normal NGS data on modern multi-core CPUs. Our approach combines candidate-finding and machine-learning-based filtering strategies with optimized data structures and multi-threading to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. We have compared the performance of RabbitVar to leading state-of-the-art callers (Strelka2, Mutect2, NeuSomatic, VarDict, VarScan2) on real-world HCC1395 breast cancer datasets under different sequencing conditions and contamination rates. The evaluation results demonstrate that RabbitVar achieves highly competitive F1-scores when calling SNVs. Moreover, when calling the more challenging indel variants, it consistently achieves the highest F1-scores. RabbitVar is able to process a paired tumor and normal whole human genome sequencing datasets with 80x depth in less than 20 minutes on a 48-core workstation outperforming all other tested variant callers in terms of efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of misfolded tau and amyloid-beta (A{beta}). Tramiprosate (TMP) and its metabolite 3-sulfopropanoic acid (SPA) are phase 3 therapeutics believed to target A{beta} oligomers. It is of paramount importance to understand how TMP/SPA modulate the conformations of A{beta}. Here, we studied the A{beta}42 alone and in the presence of TMP or SPA by adaptive sampling molecular dynamics. Next, to quantify the effects of drug candidates on A{beta}42, we developed a novel Comparative Markov State Analysis (CoVAMPnet) approach: ensembles of learned Markov state models were aligned across different systems based on a solution to an optimal transport problem, and the directional importance of inter-residue distances for assignment to the Markov states was assessed by a discriminative analysis of aggregated neural network gradients. TMP/SPA shifted A{beta}42 towards more structured conformations by interacting non-specifically with charged residues and destabilizing salt bridges involved in oligomerization. SPA impacted A{beta}42 the most, preserving -helices and suppressing aggregation-prone {beta}-strands. Experimental biophysical analyses showed mild effects of TMP/SPA on A{beta}42, and activity enhancement by the endogenous metabolization of TMP into SPA. The CoVAMPnet method is broadly applicable to study the effects of drug candidates on conformational behavior of intrinsically disordered biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Animal opsins, light-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), have been utilized for optogenetic tools to control G protein-dependent signaling pathways. Upon G protein activation, the Ga and G{beta}{gamma} subunits drive different intracellular signaling pathways, leading to complex cellular responses. For some purposes, Ga-, G{beta}{gamma}-dependent signaling needs to be separately modulated, but these responses are simultaneously evoked due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of Ga and G{beta}{gamma}. Nevertheless, we show temporal activation of G protein using a self-inactivating invertebrate opsin, Platynereis c-opsin1, drives biased signaling for G{beta}{gamma}-dependent GIRK channel activation in a light-dependent manner by utilizing the kinetic difference between G{beta}{gamma}-dependent and Ga-dependent responses. The opsin-induced transient Gi/o activation preferably causes activation of the kinetically-fast G{beta}{gamma}-dependent GIRK channels rather than slower Gi/o-dependent adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Although similar G{beta}{gamma}-biased signaling properties were observed in a selfinactivating vertebrate visual pigment, Platynereis c-opsin1 needs fewer retinal molecules to evoke cellular responses. Furthermore, the G{beta}{gamma}-biased signaling properties of Platynereis c-opsinl are enhanced by genetically fused with RGS8 protein which accelerates G protein inactivation. The self-inactivating invertebrate opsin and its RGS8-fusion protein can function as optical control tools biased for G{beta}{gamma}-dependent ion channel modulation.",

    "abstract": "Ligand-gated ion channels transduce electrochemical signals in neurons and other excitable cells. Aside from canonical ligands, phospholipids are thought to bind specifically to the transmembrane domain of several ion channels. However, structural details of such lipid contacts remain elusive, partly due to limited resolution of these regions in experimental structures. Here, we discovered multiple lipid interactions in the channel GLIC by integrating cryo-electron microscopy and large-scale molecular simulations. We identified 25 bound lipids in the GLIC closed state, a conformation where none, to our knowledge, were previously known. Three lipids were associated with each subunit in the inner leaflet, including a buried interaction disrupted in mutant simulations. In the outer leaflet, two intrasubunit sites were evident in both closed and open states, while a putative intersubunit site was preferred in open-state simulations. This work offers molecular details of GLIC-lipid contacts particularly in the ill-characterized closed state, testable hypotheses for state-dependent binding, and a multidisciplinary strategy for modeling protein-lipid interactions.",

Development of Zn management protocols in staple food crops using modern scientific tools to enhance Zn concentration in grains along with augmented crop yields became utmost necessary. In this context a 2-year experiment was carried out to assess the effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) vis-a-vis bulk zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) on wheat growth, yield and Zn concentration in plant parts. Four levels of application of ZnO-NPs (0, 20, 25 and 30 mg kg-1) were compared with ZnSO4 (equal to Zinc concentration in ZnO-NPs). Results revealed that seed vigor was significantly (p <0.05) higher under 25 and 30 mg kg-1 soil ZnO-NPs treatments over ZnSO4. Among the crop yield parameters such as tillers (plant-1), grain weight (plant-1), biomass (plant-1) and grain yield were significantly (p <0.05) higher under ZnO-NPs 25 mg kg-1 treated soil as compared to any other treatment. Zinc concentration in grains increased with dose of ZnO-NPs and it was significantly more than ZnSO4 treated soil at each treatment level. ZnO-NPs and ZnSO4 treatments did not affect photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll (SPAD) content significantly.

In multicellular eukaryotes, distinct tissues each execute their own gene expression program for accurate differentiation and subsequent functionality. While the function of TFs in differential gene expression has been studied in detail in many systems, the contribution of CFs has remained less explored. Here we uncovered the contributions of CFs to gene regulation in the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine. We first annotated 366 CFs encoded by the C. elegans genome and assembled a library of 335 RNAi clones. Using this library, we analyzed the effects of individually depleting these CFs on the expression of 19 fluorescent transcriptional reporters in the intestine and identified 216 regulatory interactions. We found that different CFs interact specifically with different promoters, and that both essential and intestinally expressed CFs exhibit the highest proportion of interactions. We did not find all members of CF complexes acting on the same set of reporters but instead found diversity in the promoter targets of each complex component. Finally, we found that previously identified activation mechanisms for the acdh-1 promoter use different CFs and TFs. Overall, we demonstrate that CFs function specifically rather than ubiquitously at intestinal promoters and provide an RNAi resource for reverse genetic screens.",

    "abstract": "A recent hypothesis is that maintaining the brain tissue ratio of O2 to CO2 is critical for preserving the entropy increase available from oxidative metabolism of glucose, with a fall of that available entropy leading to a reduction of the phosphorylation potential and impairment of brain energy metabolism. The hypothesis suggests that physiological responses under different conditions can be understood as preserving tissue O2/CO2. To test this idea, a mathematical model of O2 and CO2 transport was used to calculate how well different physiological responses maintain tissue O2/CO2, showing good agreement with reported experimental measurements for increased neural activity, hypercapnia and hypoxia. The results highlight the importance of thinking about brain blood flow as a way to modulate tissue O2/CO2, rather than simply in terms of O2 delivery to the capillary bed. The hypoxia modeling focused on humans at high altitude, including acclimatized lowlanders and adapted populations, with a primary finding that decreasing CO2 by increasing ventilation rate is much more effective for preserving tissue O2/CO2 than increasing blood hemoglobin content. The modeling provides a new framework and perspective for understanding how blood flow and other physiological factors support energy metabolism in the brain under a wide range of conditions.\n\nKey points summaryO_LIRecent thermodynamic modeling suggests that preserving the O2/CO2 ratio in brain tissue is critical for preserving the entropy change available from the oxidative metabolism of glucose and the phosphorylation potential underlying energy metabolism.\nC_LIO_LIThe hypothesis tested is that normal physiological responses (notably blood flow changes) often act to preserve this ratio under changing conditions.\nC_LIO_LIUsing a detailed model to calculate tissue O2/CO2 we found good agreement with the predictions of the hypothesis and reported experimental results during hypoxia, hypercapnia and increased oxygen metabolic rate in response to increased neural activity.\nC_LIO_LIFor the hypoxia modeling we considered high altitude acclimatization and adaptation in humans, showing the critical role of reducing CO2 in preserving tissue O2/CO2.\nC_LIO_LIThe tissue O2/CO2 hypothesis provides a useful perspective for understanding the function of observed physiological responses under different conditions in terms of preserving brain energy metabolism, although the mechanisms underlying these functions are not well understood.\nC_LI",

Intense feelings of happiness have been reported shortly after enjoying a hot sauna and cold water, what is known in Japan as the \"totonou\" state. However, no research has investigated what occurs in the brain during the \"totonou\" state. In the present study, participants underwent a sauna phase, consisting of three sets of alternating hot sauna, cold water, and rest. We elucidated changes in brain activity and mood in the \"totonou\" state by measuring and comparing brain activity and emotional scales before and after the sauna phase and during the rest phase in each set. We found significant increases in theta and alpha power during rest and after the sauna phase compared to before the sauna phase. Moreover, in an auditory oddball task, the p300 amplitude decreased significantly and MMN amplitude increased significantly after the sauna phase. The increase in MMN indicates higher activation of the pre-attentional auditory process, leading to a decrease in attention-related brain activity P300. Hence, the brain reaches in a more efficient state. Further, the response time in behavioral tasks decreased significantly. In addition, the participants subjective responses to the questionnaire showed significant changes in physical relaxation and other indicators after being in the sauna. Finally, we developed an artificial intelligence classifier, obtaining an average accuracy of brain state classification of 88.34%. The results have potential for future application.",

    "abstract": "In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) motor neuron disease, mutations in proteins that upon stress localize within cytoplasmic protein inclusions called Stress Granules (SGs), are linked to the formation of aberrant inclusions, which are related to neuronal cell death. By combining studies in human cells and C. elegans including the use of Nanobodies, we found that inhibition of NEDP1, the enzyme responsible for the processing and deconjugation of the Ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 from substrates, promotes the elimination both of physiological and pathological SGs. The hyper-NEDDylation of Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 enzyme upon NEDP1 inhibition compromises PAR production and is a key mechanism for the observed SG phenotype. Importantly, the above-described effects are related to improved cell survival in human cells, and in C. elegans, NEDP1 deletion ameliorates ALS-phenotypes related to animal motility. Our studies reveal NEDP1 as potential therapeutic target for ALS, based on the elimination of aberrant SGs.",

    "abstract": "Hostplant location and conspecific aggregation on the hostplant are the key behaviors of several herbivore insect species. The cues used by insects for host identification and aggregation initiation have been researched mainly using a single hostplant species. The chemical repertoire of plants, including volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites, is critical in mediating these processes. In natural ecosystems, often several closely related plant species co-occur. Despite these related plant species similar chemical repertoires, insects proficiently locate their hosts. How they resolve such complex chemical cues is understudied. To study the basis of such resolution, we used five commonly co-occurring Ipomoea spp. as hostplants and four Chiridopsis spp. (beetles) as their herbivores. In this wild sympatric system from the Western Ghats of India, monophagous, biphagous, and oligophagous Chiridopsis spp. are specialist herbivores of different Ipomoea species. We studied the chemistry of these beetles stringent host-specificity by determining the roles of chemical cues in hostplant location and aggregation.\n\nWe analyzed beetles hostplant preferences vis-a-vis hostplant volatile blends. We found plant volatiles as the primary hostplant identification cues. Using GC-MS/-FID and SPME headspace analyses, we characterized odor blends of the five Ipomoea spp. and identified putative attractants and repellents for each Chiridopsis sp. using multivariate statistics. We determined their attractant or deterrent natures using behavioral assays and ascertained their perception by the antennal olfactory receptors using electroantennography. Beetles responded to these compounds only when they were delivered via their hostplant odor blends. Beetles did not respond when these compounds were given singularly or via non-host odor blends. We infer that these semiochemicals attractant, repellent, or neutral characters are associated with the hostplants volatile blend-the matrix. We integrated the multi-source data to visualize this in-flight odor perception by representing odor as color variations or  odor images. Odor imaging revealed beetles differential olfactory perception of different hostplants and indicated how a beetle distinguishes between two closely-related plant species. Additionally, it showed a different olfactory perception of the same hostplant by different closely-related beetle species, suggesting they have evolved to recognize the same odor using different components. Our work demonstrates that the hostplants odor blend matrix is crucial; beetles do not respond to attractants/ repellents without it. Together, the closely-related plant species form an ideal system to understand how insects perceive subtle differences between hosts and non-host cues in nature. This investigation also underlines the relevance of studying entire odor blends over individual compounds.",

    "abstract": "Animals of many different species, trophic levels, and life history strategies migrate, and the improvement of animal tracking technology allows ecologists to collect increasing amounts of detailed data on these movements. Understanding when animals migrate is important for managing their populations, but is still difficult despite modelling advancements. We designed a model that parametrically estimates the timing of migration from animal tracking data. Our model identifies the beginning and end of migratory movements as signaled by changes in step length and turning angle distributions. To this end, we can also use the model to estimate how an animals movement changes when it begins migrating. We tested our model on three datasets: migratory ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) in the Great Plains and barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) in northern Canada, and non-migratory brown bears (Ursus arctos) from the Canadian Arctic. We estimated the beginning and end of migration in caribou and hawks to the nearest day, while confirming a lack of migratory behaviour in the brown bear population. The flexibility of our modelling framework allowed us to assess intricacies associated with each dataset: long-term stopover behaviour in ferruginous hawks and a priori knowledge of caribou calving areas and behaviour. In addition to estimating when caribou and ferruginous hawks migrated, our model also identified differences in how the two populations migrated; ferruginous hawks achieved efficient migrations by increasing their movement rates while caribou migration was achieved through significant increases in directional persistence. Our approach is broadly applicable to many animal movement studies. We anticipate that rigorous assessment of migration metrics will aid understanding of both how and why animals move.",

    "abstract": "Kelp forests are dynamic coastal habitats that generate large amounts of carbon-rich detritus. The fate of this detritus is largely unknown and considered a missing link in global carbon budgets. Kelp detritus can serve as food for benthic invertebrates and pelagic invertebrate larvae, but we know close to nothing about the role of kelp detritus as food source for other zooplankton. Lipid-rich pelagic copepods constitute a key link from primary producers to higher trophic levels in marine boreal and arctic ecosystems, and they transport vast amounts of carbon into the deep sea. We conducted feeding experiments to test if the copepod Calanus finmarchicus can feed on fragments of two dominant kelp species, Saccharina latissima and Laminaria hyperborea. Such feeding would constitute an undescribed pathway from blue forests to pelagic consumers and deep-sea carbon sequestration. The experiment indicated that C. finmarchicus can ingest kelp particles, but the digestion is limited compared to a regular phytoplankton diet. Moreover, the results provide initial evidence that L. hyperborea contains substances that are toxic to copepods, an observation that warrants further research. Using specific qPCR assays to trace the consumption of kelp, we found that kelp DNA amplification signals were stronger for copepods fed with S. latissima than L. hyperborea, but we were not able to conclusively separate consumed kelp from DNA attached to the outside of the copepods.",

This crucial developmental event shows a wide morphological diversity among different chordate lineages and is characterized by ecological, morphological, metabolic and behavioral changes that can be drastic. One of the most studied models is the amphibian Xenopus, whose tadpole metamorphosis includes apoptosis-induced tail regression dependent on the thyroid hormone pathway. In an evolutionary context, we used the ascidian model, the extant closest group to vertebrates, in which the swimming larva transforms to a sessile filter-feeding juvenile during metamorphosis, to study the role of thyroid hormones in this transformation. The ascidian metamorphosis is also characterized by an apoptosis-driven tail regression as in Xenopus. However, whether this apoptosis-driven process is dependent on the thyroid hormone has not yet been elucidated.\n\nIn this study, we interfered with thyroid hormone signaling during tail regression of the ascidian Ciona robusta to investigate whether (i) thyroid hormone is involved in the regulation of developmental apoptosis, and (ii) apoptosis leading to tail regression involves its classical molecular pathways. We described specific gene expression landmarks as well as apoptosis dynamics during larva metamorphosis under thyroid hormone exposure and thyroid hormone inhibition treatments. We provide evidence that Ciona robusta metamorphosis involves thyroid hormone-dependent apoptosis, similar to other studied chordates. However, the mode of action of thyroid hormone shows great variation compared to the classically described scheme in chordates, both in thyroid hormone/TR interactions and in the apoptotic pathway.",

However, beyond conducting expensive in vitro testing, it remains unclear how best to determine whether an existing UCE probe set is likely to suffice for phylogenomic inference, or if tailored probe design will be desirable. Here we investigate the utility of eight different UCE probe sets for the in silico phylogenomic inference of scarabaeoid beetles. Probe sets tested differed in terms of (1) how phylogenetically distant from Scarabaeoidea taxa those used during probe design are, (2) breadth of phylogenetic inference probe set was designed for, and (3) method of probe design. As part of this study, two new UCE probe sets are produced for the beetle family Scarabaeidae and superfamily Hydrophiloidea. We find that, predictably, probe set utility decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance of design taxa from focal taxa, as well as with narrower breadth of phylogenetic inference probes were designed for. We also confirm previous findings regarding ways to optimize UCE probe design. Finally, we make suggestions regarding assessment of need for de novo probe design and reinforce previous proposed methods for maximizing UCE probe design to improve phylogenomic inference.",

    "abstract": "Diseases caused by Leishmania, and Trypanosoma parasites, such as leishmaniasis and African sleeping sickness, are a major health problem in tropical countries. Due to their complex life cycle involving both vertebrate and insect hosts, and > 1 billion years of evolutionarily distance, the cell biology of these trypanosomatid parasites exhibits pronounced differences to animal cells. For example, the actin cytoskeleton of trypanosomatids is highly divergent when compared to the other eukaryotes. To understand how actin dynamics are regulated in trypanosomatid parasites, we focused on a central actin-binding protein profilin. Co-crystal structure of Leishmania major actin in complex with L. major profilin revealed that, although the overall folds of actin and profilin are conserved in eukaryotes, Leishmania profilin contains a unique -helical insertion, which interacts with the target binding cleft of actin monomer. This insertion is conserved across the Trypanosomatidae family, and is strikingly similar to the structure of WH2 domain, a small actin-binding motif found in many other cytoskeletal regulators. We demonstrate that the WH2-like motif contributes to actin monomer-binding and enhances the actin nucleotide exchange activity of Leishmania profilin. Surprisingly, unlike other profilins characterized so far, Leishmania profilin inhibited formin-catalyzed actin filament assembly in a mechanism that is dependent on the presence of the WH2-like motif. By generating profilin knockout and knockin Leishmania mexicana strains, we show that profilin is important for efficient endocytic sorting in parasites, and that the ability to bind actin monomers and proline-rich proteins, as well as the presence of a functional WH2-like motif, are important for the in vivo function of Leishmania profilin. Collectively, this study uncovers the molecular principles by which actin dynamics are regulated by profilin in trypanosomatids. Moreover, the unusual actin-binding mechanism of profilin identified here could be applied for designing inhibitors against pathogenic trypanosomatid parasites.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLeishmania and Trypanosoma parasites are a major health problem as they cause various diseases in humans and other vertebrates. Currently, there are no specific drugs to treat the diseases caused by these trypanosomatid parasites. Similar to all other eukaryotes, trypanosomatid parasites have an actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the viability of parasites. Interestingly, both actin and actin-regulatory machineries of these parasites are highly divergent from the ones of animals, making them possible drug targets to treat diseases caused by these parasites. To uncover how the actin cytoskeleton of trypanosomatid parasites is regulated, we focused on a central actin-binding protein, profilin. Importantly, our experiments revealed that trypanosomatid profilins interact with actin through a different structural mechanism as compared to animal profilins, and have specific effects on the assembly of actin filaments. Our genetic studies demonstrate that these specific features of trypanosomatid profilin are also critical for the proper function on this protein in parasites. Our study provides new insight into the cell biology of trypanosomatid parasites. We also envision that the structural and functional differences between trypanosomatid and human profilins can be applied for developing compounds for selectively neutralizing Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites.",

    "abstract": "Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of cancer, developed through injection of patient tumour cells into immunocompromised mice, have been widely adopted in preclinical studies, as well as in precision oncology approaches. However, the extent to which PDX models represent the underlying genetic diversity of a patients tumour and the extent of on-going genomic evolution in PDX models are incompletely understood, particularly in the context of heterogeneous cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To investigate the depiction of intratumour heterogeneity by PDX models, we derived 47 new subcutaneous multi-region PDX models from 22 patients with primary NSCLC enrolled in the clinical longitudinal cohort study TRACERx. By analysing whole exome sequencing data from primary tumours and PDX models, we find that PDX establishment creates a genomic bottleneck, with 76% of PDX models being derived from a single primary tumour subclone. Despite this, multiple primary tumour subclones were capable of PDX establishment in regional PDX models, indicating that PDX libraries derived from multiple tumour regions can capture intratumour heterogeneity. Acquisition of somatic mutations continued during PDX model expansion, and was associated with APOBEC- or mismatch repair deficiency-induced mutational signatures in a subset of models. Overall, while NSCLC PDX models retain truncal genomic alterations, the absence of subclonal heterogeneity representative of the primary tumour is a major limitation. Our results emphasise the importance of characterising and monitoring intratumour heterogeneity in the context of pre-clinical cancer studies.",

    "abstract": "The value of scientific research can be easier to assess at the collective level than at the level of individual contributions. Several journal-level and article-level metrics aim to measure the importance of journals or individual manuscripts. However, many are citation-based and citation practices vary between fields. To account for these differences, scientists have devised normalization schemes to make metrics more comparable across fields. We use PageRank as an example metric and examine the extent to which field-specific citation norms drive estimated importance differences. In doing so, we recapitulate differences in journal and article PageRanks between fields. We also find that manuscripts shared between fields have different PageRanks depending on which fields citation network the metric is calculated in. We implement a degree-preserving graph shuffling algorithm to generate a null distribution of similar networks and find differences more likely attributed to field-specific preferences than citation norms. Our results suggest that while differences exist between fields metric distributions, applying metrics in a field-aware manner rather than using normalized global metrics avoids losing important information about article preferences. They also imply that assigning a single importance value to a manuscript may not be a useful construct, as the importance of each manuscript varies by the readers field.",

Here, we report that VTA Sst neurons especially from the anterolateral part also project far outside the VTA and innervate several forebrain regions that are mainly involved in the regulation of emotional behaviour. Deletion of these VTA Sst neurons affected several behaviours and drug responses, such as home cage activity, sensitization of locomotor activity to morphine, fear conditioning responses, and reactions to inescapable stress of forced swimming, often in a sex-dependent manner. Together, these data demonstrate that VTA Sst neurons have selective projection targets, which are distinct from the main targets of VTA dopamine neurons and involved in the regulation of a variety of behaviours mostly associated with the stress response. This, makes Sst neurons a meaningful addition to the remote VTA circuit and stress-related neuronal network.",

While spiking of MesV neurons might support the recruitment of coupled cells in rats, this rarely occurs in mice. Using whole-cell recordings, we determined that the higher efficacy in postsynaptic recruitment in rats MesV neurons does not result from coupling strength of larger magnitude, but instead from the higher excitability of coupled neurons. Consistently, MesV neurons from rats present a lower threshold current for activation, more hyperpolarized firing level as well as a higher ability to generate repetitive discharges, in comparison to their counterparts from mice. This difference in neuronal excitability results from a significantly higher magnitude of the D-type K+ current (ID) in MesV neurons from mice, indicating that the expression level of this current gates the recruitment of postsynaptic coupled neurons. Since MesV neurons are primary afferents critically involved in the organization of orofacial behaviors, such mechanism might support lateral excitation, by which activation of single neurons at the periphery can spread to coupled partners. Thus, by amplifying sensory inputs, lateral excitation may significantly contribute to information processing and organization of motor outputs.",

    "abstract": "Language comprehension involves integrating low-level sensory inputs into a hierarchy of in-creasingly high-level features. Prior work studied brain representations of different levels of the language hierarchy, but has not determined whether integration pathways in the brain are shared for written and spoken language. To address this issue, we analyzed fMRI BOLD data recorded while participants read and listened to the same narratives in each modality. Levels of the lan-guage hierarchy were operationalized as timescales, where each timescale refers to a set of spectral components of a language stimulus. Voxelwise encoding models were used to determine where different timescales are represented across the cerebral cortex, for each modality separately. These models reveal that between the two modalities timescale representations are organized similarly across the cortical surface. Our results suggest that, after low-level sensory processing, language integration proceeds similarly regardless of stimulus modality.",
