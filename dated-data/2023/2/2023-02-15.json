    "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common cause of hearing loss and one of the most prevalent conditions affecting the elderly worldwide. Despite evidence from our lab and others about its polygenic nature, little is known about the specific genes, cell types and pathways involved in ARHL, impeding the development of therapeutic interventions. In this manuscript, we describe, for the first time, the complete cell-type specific transcriptome of the aging mouse cochlea using snRNA-seq in an outbred mouse model in relation to auditory threshold variation. Cochlear cell types were identified using unsupervised clustering and annotated via a three-tiered approach - first by linking to expression of known marker genes, then using the NS-Forest algorithm to select minimum cluster-specific marker genes and reduce dimensional feature space for statistical comparison of our clusters with existing publicly-available data sets on the gEAR website (https://umgear.org/), and finally, by validating and refining the annotations using Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) and the cluster-specific marker genes as probes. We report on 60 unique cell-types expanding the number of defined cochlear cell types by more than two times. Importantly, we show significant specific cell type increases and decreases associated with loss of hearing acuity implicating specific subsets of hair cell subtypes, ganglion cell subtypes, and cell subtypes withing the stria vascularis in this model of ARHL. These results provide a view into the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for age-related hearing loss and pathways for therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas-based transcriptional activators have been developed to induce gene expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The main advantages of CRISPR-Cas based systems is that they can achieve high levels of transcriptional activation and are very easy to program via pairing between the guide RNA and the DNA target strand. SunTag is a second-generation system that activates transcription by recruiting multiple copies of an activation domain (AD) to its target promoters. SunTag is a strong activator; however, in some species it is difficult to stably express. To overcome this problem, we designed MoonTag, a new activator that worked on the same basic principle as SunTag, but whose components are better tolerated when stably expressed in transgenic plants. We demonstrate that MoonTag is capable of inducing high levels of transcription in all plants tested. In Setaria, MoonTag is capable of inducing high levels of transcription of reporter genes as well as of endogenous genes. More important, MoonTag components are expressed in transgenic plants to high levels without any deleterious effects. MoonTag is also able to efficiently activate genes in eudicotyledonous species such as Arabidopsis and tomato. Finally, we show that MoonTag activation is functional across a range of temperatures, which is promising for potential field applications.",

    "abstract": "The ventral premotor cortex (PMv) is an important component of cortico-cortical pathways mediating prefrontal control over primary motor cortex (M1) function. Paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) is known to change PMv influence over M1 in humans, which manifests differently depending on the behavioural context. Here we show that these changes in influence are functionally linked to PMv-M1 phase synchrony changes induced by repeated paired stimulation of the two areas. PMv-to-M1 ccPAS leads to increased phase synchrony in alpha and beta bands while reversed order M1-to-PMv ccPAS leads to decreased theta phase synchrony. These changes are visible at rest but they are predictive of changes in oscillatory power in the same frequencies during movement execution and inhibition, respectively. The results unveil a link between the physiology of the motor network and the resonant frequencies mediating its interactions, and provide a putative mechanism underpinning the relationship between synaptic efficacy and brain oscillations.",

Reverse genetics system enables the manipulation of the rotavirus genome and opens the possibility of using rotavirus as an expression vector for heterologous proteins such as vaccine antigens and therapeutic payloads. Here, we identified three positions in rotavirus genome, the C terminus of NSP1, NSP3 and NSP5, for reporter gene insertion. By using rotavirus expressing GFP, we developed a high-throughput neutralization assay and revealed the pre-existing immunity against rotavirus in human and other animal species.

    "abstract": "The mere presence of predators causes prey organisms to enact predation-avoidance strategies. This presence is often reveled through predator-released kairomones. It was previously suggested that in many cases, the predators microbiota composition plays an important role in the release of these kairomones, however this mechanism is still poorly understood. Ovipositing mosquito females of several species are repelled by kairomones released from larvivorous fish. In this study we looked into the effects of the microbiota originated by Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard) on the ovipisition behavior of gravid mosquito females in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. We show that interference with the fish microbiota significantly reduces its repellant effect. We further show that the bacterium Pantoea pleuroti isolated from the skin of the fish repels oviposition of Culex laticinctus (Edwards) and Culiseta longiareolata Macquart mosquitoes similarly to the effect of live fish. These results highlight the importance of bacteria in the interspecies interactions of their hosts and the potential conflict of interests in this system, where bacteria may benefit from the absence of the bacterivore mosquito larvae, but the fish loose access to prey.",

    "abstract": "Treating pregnancy-related disorders is exceptionally challenging because many small molecule drugs on the market may cause maternal and fetal toxicity. This potential danger has hindered the development and clinical evaluation of new drugs for several decades. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based RNA therapies with high delivery efficacy, favorable immune response, and minimal transplacental transport can quell maternal-fetal toxicity concerns and propel the development of pregnancy-safe drugs. To this extent, we report potent LNP structures that robustly deliver mRNA to maternal organs and placenta. Using structure-function analysis, we show that LNP efficacy is influenced by the polyamine headgroup, and toxicity is governed by the acrylate tail. Our lead nanoparticle shows robust protein expression via multiple clinically relevant administration routes in pregnant mice. In the placenta, it transfects trophoblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Further, by varying ionizable lipid structure, we demonstrate that LNP immunogenicity affects organ expression and pup health during pregnancy. Immunogenic LNPs show lower efficacy in lymphoid organs in an IL-1{beta} dependent manner in pregnant mice. Further, pro-inflammatory immune responses provoke the infiltration of adaptive immune cells in the placenta and restrict pup growth after birth. Together, our results provide a mechanistic basis for designing safe and potent LNPs that can be administered during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remain unclear. Herein, we investigate the role of CRACD tumor suppressor in SCLC. We found that CRACD is frequently inactivated in SCLC, and Cracd knockout (KO) significantly accelerates SCLC development driven by loss of Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2. Notably, the Cracd-deficient SCLC tumors display CD8+ T cell depletion and suppression of antigen presentation pathway. Mechanistically, CRACD loss silences the MHC-I pathway through EZH2. EZH2 blockade is sufficient to restore the MHC-I pathway and inhibit CRACD loss-associated SCLC tumorigenesis. Unsupervised single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies SCLC patient tumors with concomitant inactivation of CRACD, impairment of tumor antigen presentation, and downregulation of EZH2 target genes. Our findings define CRACD loss as a new molecular signature associated with immune evasion of SCLC cells and proposed EZH2 blockade as a viable option for CRACD-negative SCLC treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCellular prion protein (PrPC) is a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for Amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}o). In certain overexpression models of Alzheimers Disease (AD), pharmacology and genetics demonstrate its essential role for synaptic plasticity impairment, memory deficits and synapse loss. However, PrPCs role in AD-related phenotypes with endogenous expression levels, its role in tau accumulation and its effect on imaging biomarkers are unknown. The necessity of PrPC for transcriptomic alterations driven by A{beta} across cell types is unexplored.\n\nMethodsThe role of PrPC was examined as a function of age in homozygous AppNL-G-F/hMapt double knock-in mice (DKI). Phenotypes of AppNL-G-F/hMapt mice with a deletion of Prnp expression (DKI; Prnp-/-) were compared with DKI mice with intact Prnp, mice with a targeted deletion of Prnp (Prnp-/-), and mice with intact Prnp (WT). Phenotypes examined included behavioral deficits, synapse loss by PET imaging, synapse loss by immunohistology, tau pathology, gliosis, inflammatory markers, and snRNA-seq transcriptomic profiling.\n\nResultsBy 9 months age, DKI mice showed learning and memory impairment, but DKI; Prnp-/- and Prnp-/- groups were indistinguishable from WT. Synapse loss in DKI brain, measured by [18F]SynVesT-1 SV2A PET or anti-SV2A immunohistology, was prevented by Prnp deletion. Accumulation of Tau phosphorylated at aa 217 and 202/205, C1q tagging of synapses, and dystrophic neurites were all increased in DKI mice but each decreased to WT levels with Prnp deletion. In contrast, astrogliosis, microgliosis and A{beta} levels were unchanged between DKI and DKI; Prnp-/- groups. Single-nuclei transcriptomics revealed differential expression in neurons and glia of DKI mice relative to WT. For DKI; Prnp-/- mice, the majority of neuronal genes differentially expressed in DKI mice were no longer significantly altered relative to WT, but most glial DKI-dependent gene expression changes persisted. The DKI-dependent neuronal genes corrected by Prnp deletion associated bioinformatically with synaptic function. Additional genes were uniquely altered only in the Prnp-/-or the DKI; Prnp-/- groups.\n\nConclusionsA functional Prnp gene is required in AppNL-G-F/hMapt double knock-in mice for synapse loss, phospho-tau accumulation and neuronal gene expression. These data support the efficacy of targeting the A{beta}o-PrPC interaction to prevent A{beta}o-neurotoxicity and pathologic tau accumulation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Material properties like softness or stickiness determine how an object can be used. Based on our real-life experience, we form strong expectations about how objects should behave under force, given their typical material properties. Such expectations have been shown to modulate perceptual processes, but we currently do not know how expectation influences the temporal dynamics of the cortical visual analysis for objects and their materials. Here, we tracked the neural representations of expected and unexpected material behaviors using time-resolved EEG decoding in a violation-of-expectation paradigm, where objects fell to the ground and deformed in expected or unexpected ways. Participants were 25 men and women. Our study yielded three key results: First, both objects and materials were represented rapidly and in a temporally sustained fashion. Second, objects exhibiting unexpected material behaviors were more successfully decoded than objects exhibiting expected behaviors within 190ms after the impact, which might indicate additional processing demands when expectations are unmet. Third, general signals of expectation fulfillment that generalize across specific objects and materials were found within the first 150ms after the impact. Together, our results provide new insights into the temporal neural processing cascade that underlies the analysis of real-world material behaviors. They reveal a sequence of predictions, with cortical signals progressing from a general signature of expectation fulfillment towards increased processing of unexpected material behaviors.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the real world, we can make accurate predictions about how an objects material shapes its behavior: For instance, we know that cups are typically made of porcelain and shatter when we accidentally drop them. Here, we use EEG to experimentally test how expectations about material behaviors impact neural processing. We showed our participants videos of objects that exhibited expected material behaviors (such as a glass shattering when falling to the ground) or unexpected material behaviors (such as a glass melting upon impact). Our results reveal a hierarchy of predictions in cortex: The visual system rapidly generates signals that index whether expectations about material behaviors are met. These signals are followed by increased processing of objects displaying unexpected material behaviors.",

Here we show that the maternal gut microbiota supports placental development in mice. Depletion of the maternal gut microbiota restricts placental growth and impairs feto-placental vascularization. The maternal gut microbiota modulates metabolites in the maternal and fetal circulation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) stimulate angiogenesis-related tube formation by endothelial cells and prevent abnormalities in placental vascularization in microbiota-deficient mice. Furthermore, in a model of maternal malnutrition, gestational supplementation with SCFAs prevents placental growth restriction and vascular insufficiency. These findings highlight the importance of host-microbial symbioses during pregnancy and reveal that the maternal gut microbiome promotes placental growth and vascularization in mice.",

    "abstract": "Functional brain networks are assessed differently early in development than at maturity: infants are almost universally scanned during sleep, whereas adults are typically scanned awake while resting or performing tasks. Observed differences between infant and adult functional networks may thus reflect these differing states of consciousness rather than or in addition to developmental changes. We explore this question by comparing functional networks in fMRI scans acquired from infants during natural sleep and awake movie-watching. As a reference, we also acquired fMRI scans in adults during awake rest and awake movie-watching. Whole-brain functional connectivity was more similar within-state (sleep-sleep, wake-wake) than across-state (sleep-wake) in infants, demonstrating that movies elicit a different network configuration than typical sleep acquisitions. Indeed, a classifier trained on patterns of functional connectivity during infant sleep versus wake robustly decoded the state of additional infants and even generalized to decode rest versus movie in adults; interestingly, a classifier trained on rest versus movie in adults did not generalize nearly as well to sleep versus wake in infants. Moreover, the overall level of similarity between infant and adult functional connectivity was modulated by adult state (stronger for movie than rest) but not infant state (equivalent for sleep and wake). Nevertheless, the network connections that drove similarity between infants and adults, particularly in frontoparietal network, were modulated by infant state. In sum, infant functional connectivity can differ between sleep and wake states, highlighting the potential value of awake data for studying the early development of functional brain networks.\n\nSignificance statementFunctional networks in the infant brain provide a foundation for early cognitive abilities and act as a marker of brain maturation and developmental disorders. What we know about these networks comes from fMRI data acquired during sleep, given the challenges of awake infant fMRI. This contrasts with the dominant approach in older populations of assessing networks during awake rest or tasks. These differing levels of consciousness cloud the interpretation of developmental changes. Here we show that whole-brain functional connectivity differs between sleeping and awake infants, and that the similarity of these infant states to adults loads on dissociable network connections. This research suggests that a full understanding of early functional brain networks will benefit from complementary insights in awake infants.",

    "abstract": "While it has been known for decades that luminal acidification is required for normal traffic along the endocytic pathway, the precise underlying mechanism(s) remain unknown. We found that dissipation of the endomembrane pH gradient resulted in acute formation of large Rab5- or Rab7-positive vacuoles. Vacuole formation was associated with and required hyperactivation of the Rabs, which was attributable to impaired GTPase activity, despite normal recruitment of cognate GAPs. Surprisingly, LRRK2 -a kinase linked to Parkinsons disease-was recruited to endomembranes and markedly activated upon dissipation of luminal acidification. LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab GTPases, rendering them insensitive to deactivation. Importantly, genetic deletion of LRRK2 prevented the {Delta}pH-induced vacuolation, implying that the kinase is required to modulate vesicular traffic. We propose that by dictating the state of activation of LRRK2 and in turn that of Rab GTPases, the development of a progressive luminal acidification serves as a timing device to control endocytic maturation.",

    "abstract": "Waves and oscillations play a key role in the flow and processing of information in the brain. Recent work has demonstrated that in addition to electrical activity, biomechanical signaling can also be excitable and thus capable of self-sustaining oscillations and waves. Here we measured the biomechanical dynamics of actin polymerization in neural precursor cells throughout their differentiation into populations of neurons and astrocytes. Fluorescence-based live-cell imaging allowed us to analyze the dynamics of actin in conjunction with the dynamics of calcium signals. Actin dynamics throughout differentiation showed a rhythmic character, localized mostly in processes, with changes in scale associated with differentiation. Furthermore, actin dynamics impact ionic dynamics, with an increase in the frequency of calcium bursts accompanied by a decrease in cell-cell correlations when actin dynamics is inhibited. This impact of cytoskeletal dynamics on cellcell coupling and ionic neural cell signaling suggests that information flow in the brain may be able to harness both biomechanical and electrical/ionic excitability.",
