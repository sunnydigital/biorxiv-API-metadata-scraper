    "abstract": "Imagine you are focusing on the traffic on a busy street to ride your bike safely when suddenly you hear the siren of an ambulance. This unexpected sound involuntarily captures your attention and interferes with ongoing performance. We tested whether this type of distraction involves a spatial shift of attention. We measured behavioral data and magnetoencephalographic alpha power during a crossmodal paradigm that combined an exogenous cueing task and a distraction task. In each trial, a task-irrelevant sound preceded a visual target (left or right). The sound was usually the same animal sound (i.e., standard sound). Rarely, it was replaced by an unexpected environmental sound (i.e., deviant sound). Fifty percent of the deviants occurred on the same side as the target, and 50% occurred on the opposite side. Participants responded to the location of the target. As expected, responses were slower to targets that followed a deviant compared to a standard. Crucially, this distraction effect was mitigated by the spatial relationship between the targets and the deviants: responses were faster when targets followed deviants on the same versus different side, indexing a spatial shift of attention. This was further corroborated by a posterior alpha power modulation that was higher in the hemisphere ipsilateral (vs. contralateral) to the location of the attention-capturing deviant. We suggest that this alpha power lateralization reflects a spatial attention bias. Overall, our data support the contention that spatial shifts of attention contribute to deviant distraction.",

    "abstract": "Integral to the protein structure/function paradigm, oligomeric state is typically conserved along with function across evolution. However, notable exceptions such as the hemoglobins show how evolution can alter oligomerization to enable new regulatory mechanisms. Here we examine this linkage in histidine kinases (HKs), a large class of widely distributed prokaryotic environmental sensors. While the majority of HKs are transmembrane homodimers, members of the HWE/HisKA2 family can deviate from this architecture as exemplified by our finding of a monomeric soluble HWE/HisKA2 HK (EL346, a photosensing Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV)-HK). To further explore the diversity of oligomerization states and regulation within this family, we biophysically and biochemically characterized multiple EL346 homologs and found a range of HK oligomeric states and functions. Three LOV-HK homologs are primarily dimeric with differing structural and functional responses to light, while two Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS)-HKs interconvert between differentially active monomers and dimers, suggesting dimerization might control enzymatic activity for these proteins. Finally, we examined putative interfaces in a dimeric LOV-HK, finding that multiple regions contribute to dimerization. Our findings suggest the potential for novel regulatory modes and oligomeric states beyond those traditionally defined for this important family of environmental sensors.",

    "abstract": "16S rRNA gene copy number (16S GCN) varies among bacterial species and this variation introduces potential biases to microbial diversity analyses using 16S rRNA read counts. To correct the biases, methods have been developed to predict 16S GCN. A recent study suggests that the prediction uncertainty can be so great that copy number correction is not justified in practice. Here we develop RasperGade16S, a novel method and software to better model and capture the inherent uncertainty in 16S GCN prediction. RasperGade16S implements a maximum likelihood framework of pulsed evolution model and explicitly accounts for intraspecific GCN variation and heterogeneous GCN evolution rates among species. Using cross validation, we show that our method provides robust confidence estimates for the GCN predictions and outperforms other methods in both precision and recall. We have predicted GCN for 592605 OTUs in the SILVA database and tested 113842 bacterial communities that represent an exhaustive and diverse list of engineered and natural environments. We found that the prediction uncertainty is small enough for 99% of the communities that 16S GCN correction should improve their compositional and functional profiles estimated using 16S rRNA reads. On the other hand, we found that GCN variation has limited impacts on beta-diversity analyses such as PCoA, PERMANOVA and random forest test.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic noise is increasing globally and is recognized as a source of environmental pollution in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Sound is an important sensory stimulus for aquatic organisms and it may alter stress-related physiological indices and induce broad behavioural effects in a range of marine and freshwater fishes. Specifically, sound exposure may induce changes in swimming activities, feed efficiency and spatial distribution changes in fish. Here, we experimentally tested sound effects on swimming activities and foraging performance in thirty individually housed, captive adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio). Adult zebrafish and water fleas (Daphnia magna) were used as model predator and prey species, respectively. Acoustic stimuli consisted of four sound treatments with different temporal patterns. All had the same frequency range and were administered on average 121 dB re 1 {micro}Pa2/Hz. Our results constitute strong evidence for sound-related effects on zebrafish behaviour. All sound treatments led to a significant increase in the number of startle responses, and the brief and prolonged swimming speed for zebrafish. We found sound effects on the spatial distribution of zebrafish; Although there were no significant sound-related changes for horizontal spatial displacement in all treatments, zebrafish swam significantly more in the lower layer of the tank except during the irregular intermittent 1:1-7 in brief sound exposure treatment. The results of foraging performance showed that food discrimination error was unaffected by sound treatments and was low for the zebrafish. However, food handling error was affected by sound treatments; all treatments induced a significant rise in handling error. This study highlights the impact of sound on zebrafish swimming activities, and that more feeding bouts are needed to consume the same number of food items increasing energy demand under noisy conditions.",

    "abstract": "An approach relying on nano-cavity confinement is developed in this paper for the sizing of nanoscale particles and single biomolecules in solution. The approach, termed nano-cavity diffusional sizing (NDS), measures particle residence times within fluidic nano-cavities to determine their hydrodynamic radii. Using theoretical modeling and simulation, we show that the residence time of particles within nano-cavities above a critical timescale depends on the diffusion coefficient of the particle, which allows estimation of the particles size. We demonstrate this approach experimentally through measurement of particle residence times within nano-fluidic cavities using single-molecule confocal microscopy. Our data show that the residence times scale linearly with the sizes of nanoscale colloids, protein aggregates and single DNA oligonucleotides. NDS thus constitutes a new single molecule optofluidic approach that allows rapid and quantitative sizing of nanoscale particles for potential application in nanobiotechnology, biophysics, and clinical diagnostics.\n\nTable of content graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/472369v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15abf7eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2180dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1290f57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ae2087_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Nm (2 s-O-methylation) is one of the most abundant modifications of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs occurring when a methyl group (-CH3) is added to the 2 hydroxyl (-OH) of the ribose moiety. This modification can appear on any nucleotide (base) regardless of the type of nitrogenous base, because each ribose sugar has a hydroxyl group and so 2-O-methyl ribose can occur on any base. Nm modification has a great contribution in many biological processes such as the normal functioning of tRNA, the protection of mRNA against degradation by DXO, and the biogenesis and specificity of rRNA. Recently, the single-molecule sequencing techniques for long reads of RNA sequences data offered by Oxford Nanopore technologies have enabled the direct detection of RNA modifications on the molecule that is being sequenced, but to our knowledge there was only one research attempt that applied this technology to predict the stoichiometry of Nm-modified sites in RNA sequence of yeast cells. To this end, in this paper, we extend this research direction by proposing a bio-computational framework, Nm-Nano for predicting Nm sites in Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reads of human cell lines, which are more complex and larger than yeast. Nm-Nano framework integrates two supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting Nm sites in Nanopore sequencing data, namely the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) with k-mers embedding models. The XGBoost is trained with the features extracted from the modified and unmodified Nanopore signals and their corresponding K-mers resulting from the reported underlying RNA sequence obtained by base-calling, while RF model is trained with the same set of features used to train the XGBoost, in addition to a dense vector representation of RNA k-mers generated by word2vec technique. The results on two benchmark data sets generated from RNA Nanopore sequencing data of Hela and Hek293 human cell lines show a great performance of Nm-Nano. In independent validation testing, Nm-Nano has been able to identify Nm sites with a high accuracy of 93% and 88% using XGBoost and RF with k-mers embedding models respectively by training each model on the Hela benchmark dataset and testing it for identifying Nm sites on Hek293 benchmark dataset. Deploying Nm-Nano to predict Nm sites in Hela cell line revealed that a total of 196 genes were identified as the top frequently Nm-modified genes among all other genes that have been modified by Nm sites in this cell line. The functional and gene set enrichment analysis on these identified genes shows a significant enrichment of a wide range of functional processes in Hela cell line like high confidences (adjusted p-val < 0.05) enriched ontologies that were more representative of Nm modification role in immune response and cellular homeostasis. Similarly, deploying Nm-Nano to predict Nm sites in Hek293 cell line revealed that a total of 176 genes were identified as the top frequently Nm-modified genes in this cell line. The functional and gene set enrichment analysis on these identified genes shows a significant enrichment of a wide range of functional processes in Hek293 cell line like \"MHC class 1 protein complex\", \"mitotic spindle assembly\", \"response to glucocorticoid\", and \"nucleocytoplasmic transport\".

CyTOF data are dramatically different from scRNA-seq data in many aspects. This calls for the evaluation and development of computational methods specific for CyTOF data. Dimension reduction (DR) is one of the critical steps of single cell data analysis. Here, we benchmark the performances of 21 DR methods on 110 real and 425 synthetic CyTOF samples. We find that less well-known methods like SAUCIE, SQuaD-MDS, and scvis are the overall best performers. In particular, SAUCIE and scvis are well balanced, SQuaD-MDS excels at structure preservation, whereas UMAP has great downstream analysis performance. We also find that t- SNE (along with SQuad-MDS/t-SNE Hybrid) possesses the best local structure preservation. Nevertheless, there is a high level of complementarity between these tools, so the choice of method should depend on the underlying data structure and the analytical needs.",

    "abstract": "Aberration in heterochromatin and euchromatin states contributes to various disease phenotypes. The transcriptional regulation between these two states is significantly governed by post-translational modifications made by three functional types of chromatin regulators: readers, writers, and erasers. Writers introduce a chemical modification to DNA and histone tails, readers bind the modification to histone tails using specialized domains, and erasers remove the modification introduced by writers. Altered regulation of these chromatin regulators results in complex diseases such as cancer, neurodevelopmental diseases, myocardial diseases, kidney diseases, and embryonic development. Due to the reversible nature of chromatin modifications, we can develop therapeutic approaches targeting these chromatin regulators. However, a limited number of chromatin regulators have been identified thus far, and a subset of them are ambiguously classified as multiple chromatin regulator functional types. Thus, we have developed machine learning-based approaches to predict and classify the functional roles of chromatin regulator proteins, thereby optimizing the accuracy of the first comprehensive database of chromatin regulators known as CREWdb.\n\nGitHub URLCREWdb source code is available at https://github.com/smollahlab/CREWdb\n\nDatabase URLCREWdb webtool is available at http://mollahlab.wustl.edu/crewdb",

Previous work has characterized functional gradients that demonstrate large-scale principles of cortical organization. How these gradients are modulated by rich ecological stimuli remains unknown. Here, we utilize naturalistic stimuli via movie-fMRI to assess macroscale functional organization. We identify principal movie gradients that delineate separate hierarchies anchored in sensorimotor, visual, and auditory/language areas. At the opposite/heteromodal end of these perception-to-cognition axes, we find a more central role for the frontoparietal network along with the default network. Even across different movie stimuli, movie gradients demonstrated good reliability, suggesting that these hierarchies reflect a brain state common across different naturalistic conditions. The relative position of brain areas within movie gradients showed stronger and more numerous correlations with cognitive behavioral scores compared to resting state gradients. Together, these findings provide an ecologically valid representation of the principles underlying cortical organization while the brain is active and engaged in multimodal, dynamic perceptual and cognitive processing.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMovie-fMRI reveals novel, more granular principles of hierarchical cortical organization\nC_LIO_LITop movie gradients delineate three separate perception-to-cognition hierarchies\nC_LIO_LIA distinctive third gradient in movie-watching is anchored by auditory/language regions\nC_LIO_LIGradient scores demonstrate good reliability even across different movie stimuli\nC_LIO_LIMovie gradients yield stronger correlations with behavior relative to resting state gradients\nC_LI",

We asked basketball fans about their most positive and negative autobiographical memories of individual plays, games, and seasons, allowing surprise measurements spanning seconds, hours, and months. We used advanced analytics on National Basketball Association play-by-play data and betting odds spanning 17 seasons, >22K games, >5.6M plays to compute and align the estimated surprise values of each memory. We found that surprising events biased positive memories on the scale of seconds and months and negative memories across all three timescales. Critically, game and season memories could not be explained by surprise at shorter timescales, suggesting that long-term, multi-event surprise influences memory.

Standard performance metrics and graph structural properties suggest that methods inferring co-expression networks should no longer be assessed equally with those inferring regulatory interactions. While methods inferring regulatory interactions perform better in global regulatory network inference than co-expression-based methods, the latter is better suited to infer function-specific regulons and co-regulation networks. When merging expression data, the size increase should outweigh the noise inclusion and graph structure should be considered when integrating the inferences. We conclude with guidelines to take advantage of inference methods and their assessment based on the applications and available expression datasets.",

    "abstract": "Despite much research into the development of attention in adolescence, mixed results and between-task differences have precluded clear conclusions regarding the relative early- or late-maturation of attention abilities. Moreover, although adolescents constantly face the need to pay attention to their lessons at school, it remains unclear whether laboratory measures of attention can predict their ability to sustain attention focus during school lessons. Here we therefore devised a task that was sensitive to measure both sustained and selective attention and tested whether any of our task measures can predict adolescents levels of inattention during their school lessons. 166 adolescents (aged 12-17) and 50 adults performed in our sustained-selective attention task, searching for letter targets, while ignoring salient yet-entirely-irrelevant distractor faces, under different levels of perceptual load-an established determinant of attention in adults. Inattention levels during a just-preceding classroom lesson were measured using our novel self-report classroom-distractibility checklist. The results established that sustained attention (measured with response variability) continued to develop throughout adolescence, across perceptual load levels. In contrast there was an earlier maturation of the effect of perceptual load on selective attention: load modulation of distractor interference was larger in the early adolescence compared to later periods. Both distractor interference and response variability were significant unique predictors of distractibility in the classroom, including when interest in the lesson and cognitive aptitude were controlled for. Overall, the results demonstrate divergence of development of sustained and selective attention in adolescence, and establish both as significant predictors of attention in the important educational setting of school lessons.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in gene expression, is actively involved in a series of cellular and physiological processes, thus controlling cell fate and tissue homeostasis. Defects in NMD cause human diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders, tumorigenesis and autoimmunity. UPF3 (Up- frameshift protein 3), first identified in the bakers yeast, is a core NMD factor. UPF3A and UPF3B, the two UPF3 paralogs emerging in vertebrates, have either activating or suppressing roles in NMD. Previous studies found that UPF3B protein is ubiquitously expressed in almost all mammalian organs, while UPF3A protein is hardly detectable in most of mammalian tissues, except in the testis. One hypothesis explaining this phenomena is the functional antognism between UPF3A and UPF3B in NMD. Thus, UPF3B competitively binds to UPF2 with higher affinity than UPF3A, which finally destabilizes UPF3A protein. In the present study, we quantitatively evaluated the expression of UPF3A and UPF3B in nine major tissues and reproductive organs of wild type male and female mice. Our study confirmed that UPF3A has the highest expression in male germlines. To our surprise, we found in most tissues, including brain and thymus, the protein level of UPF3A is comparable with that of UPF3B. In spleen and lung, UPF3A is higher than UPF3B. These findings are further supported by publicly available gene expression data. Thus, our study demonstrated that UPF3A protein is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues, and may play important roles in the homeostasis of multiple mammalian tissues.",

In this study, we evaluated the neutralization sensitivity of a comprehensive panel of Omicron subvariants to sera from different clinical cohorts, including individuals who received homologous or heterologous booster vaccinations, vaccinated people who had Delta or BA.2 breakthrough infection in previous waves, and patients who had BA.5 or BF.7 breakthrough infection in the current wave in China.

    "abstract": "Metformin is a widely prescribed medication whose mechanism of action is not completely defined and whose role in gestational diabetes management remains controversial. In addition to increasing risks of fetal growth abnormalities and preeclampsia, gestational diabetes is associated with abnormalities in placental development including impairments in trophoblast differentiation. Given that metformin impacts cellular differentiation events in other systems, we assessed metformins impact on trophoblast metabolism and differentiation. Using established cell culture models of trophoblast differentiation, oxygen consumption rates and relative metabolite abundance were determined following 200 M (therapeutic range) and 2000 M (supra-therapeutic range) metformin treatment using Seahorse and mass-spectrometry approaches. While no differences in oxygen consumption rates or relative metabolite abundance were detected between vehicle and 200 M metformin treated cells, 2000 M metformin impaired oxidative metabolism and increased abundance of lactate and TCA cycle intermediates, -ketoglutarate, succinate, and malate. Examining differentiation, treatment with 2000 M, but not 200 M metformin, impaired HCG production and expression of multiple trophoblast differentiation markers. Overall, this work suggests that supra-therapeutic concentrations of metformin impairs trophoblast metabolism and differentiation whereas metformin concentrations in the therapeutic range do not strongly impact these processes.",

To maximize the transfer of peptides from liquid to a gaseous phase to allow molecular ions to enter the mass spectrometer at micro-spray flow rates, an efficient electrospray process is required. Here we describe superior performance of new Vacuum-Insulated-Probe-Heated-ElectroSpray-Ionization source (VIP-HESI) coupled with micro-spray flow rate chromatography and Bruker timsTOF PRO mass spectrometer. VIP-HESI significantly improves chromatography signals in comparison to nano-spray ionization using the CaptiveSpray source and provides increased protein detection with higher quantitative precision, enhancing reproducibility of sample injection amounts. Protein quantitation of human K562 lymphoblast samples displayed excellent chromatographic retention time reproducibility (<10% coefficient-of-variation (CV)) with no signal degradation over extended periods of time, and a mouse plasma proteome analysis identified 12% more plasma protein groups allowing large-scale analysis to proceed with confidence (1,267 proteins at 0.4% CV). We show that Slice-PASEF mode with VIP-HESI setup is sensitive in identifying low amounts of peptide without losing quantitative precision. We demonstrate that VIP-HESI coupled with micro-flow-rate chromatography achieves higher depth of coverage and run-to-run reproducibility for a broad range of proteomic applications.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with mutations in Kras, a known oncogenic driver of PDAC; and the KRASG12D mutation is present in nearly half of PDAC patients. Recently, a non-covalent small molecule inhibitor (MRTX1133) was identified with specificity to the KrasG12D mutant protein. Here we explore the impact of KrasG12D inhibition by MRTX1133 on advanced PDAC and its influence on the tumor microenvironment. Employing different orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic tumor models, eight different PDXs, and two different autochthonous genetic models, we demonstrate that MRTX1133 reverses early PDAC growth, increases intratumoral CD8+ effector T cells, decreases myeloid infiltration, and reprograms cancer associated fibroblasts. Autochthonous genetic mouse models treated with MRTX1133 leads to regression of both established PanINs and advanced PDAC. Regression of advanced PDAC requires CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint blockade therapy (iCBT) synergizes with MRTX1133 to eradicate PDAC and prolong overall survival. Mechanistically, inhibition of mutant Kras in advanced PDAC and human patient derived organoids (PDOs) induces Fas expression in cancer cells and facilitates CD8+T cell mediated death. These results demonstrate the efficacy of MRTX1133 in different mouse models of PDAC associated with reprogramming of stromal fibroblasts and a dependency on CD8+ T cell mediated tumor clearance. Collectively, this study provides a rationale for a synergistic combination of MRTX1133 with iCBT in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The physiological, psychological and behavioural traits of tail biting/bitten pigs have been widely studied, with most research focusing on identifying traits to predict tail biting phenotypes (biters, victims, or uninvolved  neutrals). However, it is not clear if these traits persist once pigs are no longer involved in performing or receiving tail bites. This study investigated whether there was a difference in behavioural responses to a novel object test (NOT) between pigs which were tail biting performers (BITER), recipients (VICTIM), or not involved in the biting events (NEUTRAL). We then investigated whether these differences in responses were still evident six weeks later, when tail biting was less prevalent. We hypothesised that biters would exhibit more behaviours indicative of boldness, but also stress, than victims or neutrals, and that these differences would still be present later. A total of 120 undocked pigs (BITER, n = 48; VICTIM, N = 48; NEUTRAL, n = 24; 60 male, 60 female) were selected for testing. At the time of the first test (one week after pigs were moved into the finisher house at 12 weeks of age; T1), the prevalence of tail biting peaked. The same test was repeated six weeks later (T2) when biting had eased. Each pig was tested separately in a novel arena. After a minute of habituation, a brush head was introduced by dropping it down from above, at which point the 5 min test began. A saliva sample was taken immediately before the habituation (baseline) and after each test to evaluate cortisol concentration. Direct continuous behaviour observation was conducted. Overall, salivary cortisol concentrations were higher after than before the NOT (P < 0.001), although VICTIM pigs had a reduced elevation in cortisol after the test (P = 0.02) compared to BITER and NEUTRAL pigs in T2. Between phenotypes, baseline saliva cortisol concentrations were similar. BITER pigs approached the object quicker than VICTIM pigs (P = 0.01), but also had more high-pitched vocalisations (P < 0.01), but these differences observed in T1 were no longer present in T2. The results suggested that the NOT was sensitive to detect different levels of behavioural response; however, differences in BITER pigs behavioural responses were transient and did not persist once biting behaviour ceased. The long-term consequence of chronic stress caused by being tail bitten was manifested in VICTIM pigs blunted cortisol elevation six weeks later, after severe tail biting events.",

Evidence suggests that spontaneous cortical activity represents such a model, or prior distribution, by cycling through stimulus-evoked activity patterns at frequencies proportional to the probabilities that these stimuli were previously experienced. However, how the brain encodes priors into spontaneous activity and utilizes them for inference tasks remains unclear. Here, we present a synaptic plasticity mechanism to generate cell assemblies encoding the statistical structure of salient sensory events and spontaneously replay these assemblies in spiking recurrent neural networks. The plasticity mechanism installs a Hebbian-like learning rule at excitatory and inhibitory synapses to minimize mismatches in the probability structure between stimulus-evoked and internally driven activities. Our model replicates the behavioral biases of monkeys performing perceptual decision making with surprising accuracy, demonstrating how spontaneous replay of previous experiences biases cognitive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death is a complex and tightly regulated sequence of events that determines cell fate during tissue homeostasis, development, and pathogenesis. The small protein modifier ubiquitin mediates important regulatory functions during cell death by regulating the stability and activity of checkpoint proteins and the assembly of cell death signalling complexes. The caspase family of cysteine aspartases are essential effectors of apoptotic cell death. Components of the ubiquitin system including RING ubiquitin ligases XIAP, MDM2, RBX1; RBR E3 ubiquitin ligases Parkin and LUBAC; and HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases NEDD4 and Itch are also substrates of caspase-mediated cleavage. In the case of NEDD4 and Itch, the single cleavage event occurs outside of the catalytic HECT domain and it remains unclear whether such cleavage events impact on ubiquitin ligase activity and/or function. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1 as the third HECT E3 cleaved by caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptotic cell death, in a manner which does not affect the integrity of the catalytic C-ter HECT domain. We mapped the single cleavage event to DFLD1664{downarrow}S and showed that the cleaved C-ter product, which contains the HECT ligase domain, is as stable as the endogenous full length protein. We also found that HECTD1 transient depletion led to reduced caspase-3 activity, but not caspase 8 nor 9. Furthermore, we also identified caspase-3 as the protease responsible for HECTD1 cleavage at Asp1664 suggesting that HECTD1 and caspase-3 might be part of a novel feedback loop mechanism during apoptotic cell death. This study highlight novel crosstalk between cell death mechanisms and the ubiquitin system and raises important questions on whether proteolytic cleavage of E3 ubiquitin ligases might represent an underappreciated mode of regulation during cell death mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells (SnCs) are typically studied as endpoints of a complex transformational process, owing to their frequent maladaptive effects on surrounding tissue and cells. SnCs accumulate with age, and while they ultimately comprise a small percentage of cells in tissues, they have important roles in age associated pathologies. Several obstacles remain in understanding the heterogeneous nature of senescence, and formulating potent beneficial intervention strategies. One approach targets senescent cells and kills them (\"senolytic\" approach), and is often driven by a low resolution understanding of SnC identity, which risks both incomplete clearance and off-target effects. Cellular senescence is not a singular binary response, but a suite of response trajectories that vary by multiple parameters including inducer and initial cell state. In order to elucidate the developmental trajectories of SnCs, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on IMR90 lung fibroblasts senescencing across a 12 day time period. Our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in gene expression within timepoints and across the full time-course. We uncovered unique markers and differentially regulated pathways in cell populations within each timepoint. Supervised trajectory inference of the time-course data uncovered the root-origin and fates of distinct SnC lineages over 3 stages of senescence induction. Altogether our data provide a novel approach to stud SnC development, identifying cell states of interest, and differentiating between SnCs and quiescent cells. This will aid in identifying key targets for therapeutic intervention in senescence.",

    "abstract": "Cells utilize multiple mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in response to stress. We recently identified a cellular structure, called the mitochondria-derived compartment (MDC), that is generated from mitochondria in response to amino acid overabundance. MDCs selectively sequester proteins from mitochondria for subsequent degradation, and loss of MDCs sensitizes cells to amino acid stress. Here, we conducted a microscopy-based screen in budding yeast to identify factors that regulate MDC formation. We found that levels of two mitochondrial phospholipids, cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), regulate MDC biogenesis in opposing directions. CL depletion impairs MDC biogenesis, whereas PE reduction leads to constitutive MDC formation. Additionally, in response to MDC-inducing agents, cellular and mitochondrial PE declines in an amino acid-dependent manner. Overexpressing mitochondrial PE synthesis pathway components suppresses MDC biogenesis during amino acid stress. Altogether, our data indicate a requirement for CL in MDC biogenesis, and suggest that PE depletion may serve as a regulatory signal for MDC formation downstream of MDC-inducing metabolic stress.\n\nSUMMARYXiao et al. identify distinct roles for the phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine in mitochondria-derived compartment (MDC) biogenesis. They show that cardiolipin is required for MDC formation, whereas a decline in phosphatidylethanolamine in response to amino acid stress triggers MDC biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Different anatomic locations of the body skin dermis come from different origins, and its positional hereditary information can be maintained in adults, while highly resolvable cellular specialization is less well characterized in different anatomical regions. Pig is regarded as excellent model for human research in view of its similar physiology to human. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of six different anatomical skin regions from the Chenghua pig with superior skin thickness trait. We obtained 215,274 cells, representing seven cell types, among which we primarily characterized the heterogeneity of smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. We identified several phenotypes of smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell and presented genes expression of pathways such as the immune response in different skin regions. By comparing differentially expressed fibroblast genes among different skin regions, we considered TNN, COL11A1, and INHBA as candidate genes for facilitating ECM accumulation. These findings of heterogeneity in the main three cell types from different anatomic skin sites will contribute to a better understanding of hereditary information and places the potential focus on skin generation, transmission and transplantation, paving the foundation for human skin priming.",

    "abstract": "Wound repair requires the coordination of multiple cell types including immune cells and tissue resident cells to coordinate healing and return of tissue function. Diabetic foot ulceration is a type of chronic wound that impacts over 4 million patients in the US and over 7 million worldwide (Edmonds et al., 2021). Yet, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that go awry in these wounds are not fully understood. Here, by profiling chronic foot ulcers from non-diabetic (NDFUs) and diabetic (DFUs) patients using single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that DFUs display transcription changes that implicate reduced keratinocyte differentiation, altered fibroblast function and lineages, and defects in macrophage metabolism, inflammation, and ECM production compared to NDFUs. Furthermore, analysis of cellular interactions reveals major alterations in several signaling pathways that are altered in DFUs. These data provide a view of the mechanisms by which diabetes alters healing of foot ulcers and may provide therapeutic avenues for DFU treatments.",

Annotations are based on the CATAMI (Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery) classification scheme and have been reviewed by experts. In addition, because the pixel location of each annotation within each image is available, annotations can be viewed easily and customised to suit individual research priorities.\n\nThis dataset can be used to investigate species distributions, community patterns, it provides a reference to assess change through time, and can be used to train algorithms to automatically detect and annotate marine fauna.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress affects the growth and productivity of plants, where C4 plants can advantageously perceive and respond to the stress for their survival and reproduction. Epigenetic modifications play a prominent role in conferring drought tolerance in C4 plants; however, the molecular links between histone modifiers and their regulation are unclear. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide H3K9ac enrichment in foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and analyzed their role in regulating the expression of drought-responsive genes. The presence of H3K9ac on these genes were identified through the comparative analysis of dehydration tolerant (cv. IC4) and sensitive (IC41) cultivars of foxtail millet. A histone deacetylase, SiHDA9, showed significant upregulation in the sensitive cultivar during dehydration stress. SiHDA9 overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred higher sensitivity to dehydration/drought stress than WT plants. We found that SiHDA9 physically interacts with SiHAT3.1 and SiHDA19. This complex is recruited through the SiHAT3.1 recognition sequence on the upstream of drought-responsive genes (SiRAB18, SiRAP2.4, SiP5CS2, SiRD22, SiPIP1;4, and SiLHCB2.3) to decrease H3K9 acetylation levels. The modulations in H3K9ac levels cause repression of gene expression and induce drought-sensitivity in the sensitive cultivar. Overall, the study provides mechanistic insights into SiHDA9-mediated regulation of drought stress response in foxtail millet.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and nutrient pollution are among the most urgent environmental issues. Enhancing the abundance and/or the activity of beneficial organisms is an attractive strategy to counteract these problems. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which theoretically improves nitrogen retention in soils, has been suggested as a microbial process that may be harnessed, especially since many DNRA-catalyzing organisms have been found to possess clade II nosZ genes and the ability to respire N2O. However, the selective advantages that may favor these nosZ-harboring DNRA-catalyzing organisms is not well understood. Here, the effect of N2O on Nrf-mediated DNRA was examined in a recently isolated soil bacterium, Bacillus sp. DNRA2, possessing both nrfA and nosZ genes. The DNRA metabolism of this bacterium was observed in the presence of C2H2, a NosZ inhibitor, with or without N2O, and the results were compared with C2H2-free controls. Cultures were also exposed to repeated oxic-anoxic transitions in the sustained presence of N2O. The NO2--to-NH4+ reduction following oxic-to-anoxic transition was significantly delayed in NosZ-inhibited C2H2-amended cultures, and the inhibition was more pronounced with repeated oxic-anoxic transitions. The possible involvement of C2H2 was dismissed since the cultures continuously flushed with C2H2/N2 mixed gas after initial oxic incubation did not exhibit a similar delay in DNRA progression as that observed in the culture flushed with N2O-containing gas. The findings provide novel ecological and evolutionary insights into the oft-observed presence of nosZ genes in DNRA-catalyzing microorganisms.\n\nImportanceDissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is a microbial energy-conserving process that reduces NO3- and/or NO2- to NH4+. Interestingly, many DNRA-catalyzing microorganisms possessing nrfA genes harbor nosZ genes encoding nitrous oxide reductases, i.e., the only group of enzymes capable of removing the potent greenhouse gas N2O. Here, through a series of physiological experiments examining DNRA metabolism in one of such microorganisms, Bacillus sp. DNRA2, we have discovered that N2O may delay transition to DNRA upon an oxic-to-anoxic transition, unless timely removed by the nitrous oxide reductases. These observations suggest a novel explanation as to why some nrfA-possessing microorganisms have retained nosZ genes that had probably been acquired via horizontal gene transfers: to remove N2O that may otherwise interfere with the transition from O2 respiration to DNRA.",

Our data demonstrated modifications in various cell clusters of the carious pulp, such as immune cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and fibroblasts, when compared to the healthy dental pulp. These changes include upregulation of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) components and the enrichment of the fibroblast cluster with myofibroblasts. Assessment of the Fibronectin fibres mechanical strain showed a significant tension reduction in the carious human pulp, compared to the healthy one. Collectively, the present data demonstrate molecular, cellular and biomechanical alterations in the carious pulp tissue, indicative of extensive ECM remodelling and reminiscent of fibrosis observed in other organs.",

    "abstract": "Centrioles are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based organelles critical to form centrosomes and cilia, which act as microtubule-organizing, signaling and motility centers. Biogenesis and maintenance of centrioles with proper number, size and architecture are crucial for their functions during development and physiology. Consequently, their deregulation causes developmental disorders and cancer. Although centriole number control has been extensively studied, less is known about how centrioles are maintained as stable structures with conserved size and architecture over successive cell divisions and upon ciliary and flagellar motility. Here, we addressed this question by identifying and characterizing new components of the centriole inner scaffold, a recently discovered centriolar sub-compartment critical for centriole size control and integrity. To this end, we generated proximity interactomes of Centrin-2 and POC5 and used them to define CCDC15 as a new centriolar protein that co-localizes and interacts with known inner scaffold proteins. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy analysis of CCDC15-depleted cells revealed its functions in centriole length control and integrity, resulting in defective ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling. Loss-of-function experiments also defined CCDC15 as a dual regulator for the recruitment of the inner scaffold protein POC1B and the distal SFI1/Centrin complex to the centrioles. Together, our findings uncovered new players and mechanisms of centriole architectural integrity and thereby, provide insights into diseases linked to centriolar defects.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG), an opportunistic gram-positive pathogen responsible for septicemia and endocarditis in the elderly, is often associated with colon cancer (CRC). In this work, we investigated the oncogenic role of SGG strain UCN34 using the azoxymethane (AOM)-induced CRC model in vivo, organoid formation ex vivo and proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses from murine colons. We showed that SGG UCN34 accelerates colon tumor development in the murine CRC model. Full proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of murine colons chronically colonized by SGG UCN34 or the closely related non-pathogenic S. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus (SGM) revealed that 164 proteins and 725 phosphorylation sites were differentially regulated following colonization by SGG UCN34. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicates a pro-tumoral shift specifically induced following colonization by SGG UCN34, as most proteins and phosphoproteins identified were associated with digestive cancer. Comprehensive analysis of the altered phosphoproteins using ROMA software revealed significantly elevated activities in several cancer hallmark pathways affecting tumoral cells and their microenvironment, i.e. MAPK (ERK, JNK and p38), mTOR and integrin/ILK/actin signaling, in SGG UCN34 colonized colon. Importantly, analysis of protein arrays of human colon tumors colonized with SGG showed up-regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways, providing clinical relevance to our findings. To test SGGs capacity to induce pre-cancerous transformation of the murine colonic epithelium, we grew ex vivo organoids which revealed unusual structures with compact morphology following exposure to SGG. Taken together, our results reveal that the oncogenic role of SGG UCN34 is associated with activation of multiple cancer-related signaling pathways.\n\nAuthor SummaryColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The colon is a very singular organ, colonized by a vast and complex community of microorganisms, known as the gut microbiota. Strong evidence supports a role of the microbiota in colon cancer development. Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG), a gut commensal, was one of the first bacteria to be associated with colorectal cancer. A better understanding of the role of SGG in colon cancer development is critical to developing novel strategies to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Here, using a global proteomic analysis of mouse colonic tissue colonized by SGG, we show that over 90% of the proteins with altered levels are involved in cancer. SGG colonization promotes autocrine and paracrine pro-tumor signals contributing to transformation of the colonic epithelium but also modifying the stromal microenvironment, which in turn sustains tumor development. Importantly, two tumor hallmark pathways (PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK) identified in our mouse model were also found in human colon tumor biopsies colonized by SGG, strengthening the clinical relevance to our study.",

Numerous attempts at regenerating functional hair cells (HCs) have been unsuccessful, but little is known about the main barrier that prevents us from achieving it and improving the hearing ability after damage. Here, we developed an in vivo genetic mouse model, by which the inner HCs (IHCs), the primary sound receptors innervated by the auditory neurons, were specifically damaged and the neighboring nonsensory supporting cells (SCs) were transformed into IHCs by ectopic expression of transient Atoh1 and permanent Tbx2. Despite [~]477 new IHCs were regenerated per cochlea and their differentiation status was more advanced than reported previously, no significant hearing improvement was achieved. By taking advantage of this unique model, we further found that the new IHCs expressed the functional marker vGlut3, harbored the similar transcriptomic profiles and electrophysiological properties as the endogenous IHCs. However, the mechanosensory transduction (MET) current could not be recorded in the new IHCs. Thus, our study indicated that the defective MET should be the main barrier that stops us from restoring the hearing capacity in the damaged cochlea and would pave the way for regenerating IHCs in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Some patients with damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) can respond to visual stimuli in their affected visual field, even though they report loss of visual awareness. This phenomenon is termed blindsight. To clarify the visuomotor transformation for hand movement control in the blindsight condition, we conducted multichannel electrocorticographical recordings from the ipsilesional frontal cortex including the frontal eye field, premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory areas during a delayed conditioned two-alternative forced choice manual response task with arbitrary assignment of push-pull manual responses in relation to the visual target cue locations before and after unilateral V1 lesioning in macaque monkeys. Before lesioning, the activity in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) showed short latency task-related {theta} ~  band responses that were significantly higher in the successful trials than in the error/miss trials at approximately 200 ms after target cue onset. At 2-3 months after lesioning, the monkeys regained a >80% success rate in response to appearance of the target cue in the lesion-affected visual field. At this stage, similar task-related {theta} ~  band target cue responses were observed in the PMd. Further, Granger causality from the PMd to the primary motor cortex was enhanced in the {theta} ~ , {gamma}, and high-{gamma} bands during the delay period of the task. These results suggested that the PMd plays a crucial role in mediating the visual signals for execution of hand movements in blindsight monkeys.\n\nSignificant StatementBlindsight is a curious phenomenon in which the patients with damage to the primary visual cortex can still respond to visual stimulus in their blinded visual field despite loss of awareness. Previously we clarified the critical circuits for visually guided saccadic eye movements in blindsight macaques, however, those for the control of hand movements are still unclear. Here, we have recorded the multichannel electrocorticography in the frontal cortices during the conditioned manual response task and found that the dorsal premotor cortex exhibits task-related {theta} ~  band target cue responses at approximately 200 ms after the visual cue onset, similarly to the intact state. This is the first report of electrophysiological recordings in the frontal lobe of the blindsight subjects.",

We found age-associated declines in controllability in control hubs and large-scale networks, particularly within the and frontoparietal control and default mode networks. Redundancy, quantified via the assessment of multi-step paths within networks, mitigated the effects of changes in topology on network controllability. Lastly, network controllability, redundancy, and grey matter volume each played important complementary roles in cognitive function.

    "abstract": "The defining feature of advanced motion processing in the primate dorsal stream is the existence of pattern cells - specialized cortical neurons that integrate local motion signals into pattern-invariant representations of global direction. Pattern cells have also been reported in rodent visual cortex, but it is unknown whether the tuning of these neurons results from truly integrative, nonlinear mechanisms or trivially arises from linear receptive fields (RFs) with a peculiar geometry. Here we show that pattern cells in rat visual cortical areas V1 and LM process motion direction in a way that cannot be explained by the linear spatiotemporal structure of their RFs. Instead, their tuning properties are consistent with those of units in a state-of-the-art neural network model of the dorsal stream. This suggests that similar cortical processes underly motion representation in primates and rodents. The latter could thus serve as powerful model systems to unravel the underlying circuit-level mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress and chronic pain are two major predisposing factors to trigger depression. Enhanced excitatory input to the lateral habenula (LHb) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the contribution of inhibitory transmission remains elusive. Here, we dissect an inhibitory projection from the sensory thalamic reticular nucleus (sTRN) to LHb, which is activated by acute aversive stimuli. However, chronic restraint stress (CRS) weakens sTRN-LHb synaptic strength, and this synaptic attenuation is indispensable for CRS-induced LHb neural hyperactivity and depression onset. Moreover, artificially inhibiting sTRN-LHb circuit induces depressive-like behaviors in healthy mice, while enhancing this circuit relieves depression induced by both chronic stress and chronic pain. Intriguingly, neither neuropathic pain nor comorbid pain in chronic stress is affected by this pathway. Together, our study demonstrates a novel sTRN-LHb circuit in establishing and modulating depression, thus shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for preventing or managing depression.",

    "abstract": "Temperature fluctuations are challenging for ectotherms which are not able to regulate body temperature by physiological means and thus have to adjust their thermal environment via behavior. However, little is yet known about whether microbial symbionts influence thermal preference (Tp) in ectotherms by modulating their physiology. Several recent studies have demonstrated substantial effects of Wolbachia infections on host Tp in different Drosophila species. These data indicate that the direction and strength of thermal preference variation is strongly dependent on host and symbiont genotypes and highly variable among studies. By employing highly controlled experiments, we investigated the impact of several environmental factors including humidity, food quality, light exposure, and experimental setup that may influence Tp measurements in adult Drosophila melanogaster flies. Additionally, we assessed the effects of Wolbachia infection on Tp of Drosophila at different developmental stages, which has not been done before. We find only subtle effects of Wolbachia on host Tp which are strongly affected by experimental variation in adult, but not during juvenile life stages. Our in-depth analyses show that environmental variation has a substantial influence on Tp which demonstrates the necessity of careful experimental design and cautious interpretations of Tp measurements together with a thorough description of the methods and equipment used to conduct behavioral studies.",

In this study, we profiled the serum metabolites and fecal microbiome of redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps) exhibiting diurnal non-migratory (nonM) pre-migratory (preM), migratory (M) and post-migratory (posM) states, when exposed to long days (14L:10D). Using gas chromatography, out of the identified 124 serum analytes, 38 showed significant variations (Fold change, VIP) between states. Out of these, 11 metabolites (short chain fatty acids, SCFAs-butanoate and hexanoate, lactate, pyruvate, ethylene and acetate oxime, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), niacin, L-valine and carboximidic acids viz. phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and diethyl carbamate) involved in energy pathways and enhanced immunity showed higher abundance in M state. While, upsurge of L-valine suggested energy contribution of glucogenic branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in M state, that of leucine metabolite, was related to higher temperature in posM birds. Gut microbiota was analysed using faeces of buntings (n=6 each) during nonM and M states and alteration in bacterial compositions was observed; faeces of nonM birds were enriched in proteobacteria, while those of M were rich in firmicutes. This study reports the migratory state specific changes in the serum metabolome and faecal microbiome of the buntings and highlights the role of short chain fatty acids, SCFAs and branched chain amino acids, BCAAs during hypermetabolic state of migration.",

    "abstract": "Young precocial birds benefit from staying close to both their mother and siblings, while prioritising adults, which provide better care. Which features of the stimuli are used by young birds to prioritise attachment to adults over siblings is unknown. We started to address this question in newly hatched domestic chicks (Gallus gallus), focusing on their spontaneous preferences for visual stimuli that systematically vary between adult and juvenile chickens: size (larger in adults than in juveniles) and colour (darker and redder in adults than in juveniles). Overall, chicks at their first visual experience, that had never seen a conspecific beforehand, were most attracted to the red and large stimuli (two adult features) and interacted with red stimuli more than with yellow stimuli. When tested with red large vs. small objects (Exp. 1), chicks preferred the large shape. When tested with yellow large and small objects (Exp. 2), chicks did not show a preference. These results suggest that the combination of size and colour form the predisposition that helps chicks to spontaneously discriminate between adult and juvenile features from the first stages of life, in the absence of previous experience.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing animal behavior requires methods to distill 3D movements from video data. Though keypoint tracking has emerged as a widely used solution to this problem, it only provides a limited view of pose, reducing the body of an animal to a sparse set of experimenter-defined points. To more completely capture 3D pose, recent studies have fit 3D mesh models to subjects in image and video data. However, despite the importance of mice as a model organism in neuroscience research, these methods have not been applied to the 3D reconstruction of mouse behavior. Here, we present ArMo, an articulated mesh model of the laboratory mouse, and demonstrate its application to multi-camera recordings of head-fixed mice running on a spherical treadmill. Using an end-to-end gradient based optimization procedure, we fit the shape and pose of a dense 3D mouse model to data-derived keypoint and point cloud observations. The resulting reconstructions capture the shape of the animals surface while compactly summarizing its movements as a time series of 3D skeletal joint angles. ArMo therefore provides a novel alternative to the sparse representations of pose more commonly used in neuroscience research.",

    "abstract": "Although it is generally held that gastro-intestinal (GI) signals are related to emotions, direct evidence for such a link is currently lacking. One of the reasons why the internal milieu of the GI system is poorly investigated is because visceral organs are difficult to access and monitor. To directly measure the influence of endoluminal markers of GI activity on the emotional experience, we asked a group of healthy male participants to ingest a pill that measured pH, pressure, and temperature of their GI tract while they watched video-clips that consistently induced disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or a control neutral state. In addition to the objective physiological markers of GI activity, subjective ratings of perceived emotions and visceral (i.e. gastric, respiratory and cardiac) sensations were recorded. We found that when participants observed fearful and disgusting video-clips, they reported to perceive not only cardiac and respiratory sensations but also gastric sensations, such as nausea. Moreover, we found that there was a clear relation between the physiology of the stomach and the perceived emotions. Specifically, when disgusting video-clips were displayed, the more acidic the pH, the more participants reported feelings of disgust and fear; the less acidic the pH, the more they reported happiness. Our findings suggest that gastric signals contribute to unique emotional states and that ingestible pills may open new avenues for exploring the deep-body physiology of emotions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWManual interactions with objects are supported by tactile signals from the hand. This tactile feedback can be restored in brain-controlled bionic hands via intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of somatosensory cortex (S1). In ICMS-based tactile feedback, contact force can be signaled by modulating the stimulation intensity based on the output of force sensors on the bionic hand, which in turn modulates the perceived magnitude of the sensation. In the present study, we gauged the dynamic range and precision of ICMS-based force feedback in three human participants implanted with arrays of microelectrodes in S1. To this end, we measured the increases in sensation magnitude resulting from increases in ICMS amplitude and participants ability to distinguish between different intensity levels. We then assessed whether we could improve the fidelity of this feedback by implementing \"biomimetic\" ICMS-trains, designed to evoke patterns of neuronal activity that more closely mimic those in natural touch, and by delivering ICMS through multiple channels at once. We found that multi-channel biomimetic ICMS gives rise to stronger and more distinguishable sensations than does its single-channel counterpart. Finally, we implemented biomimetic multi-channel feedback in a bionic hand and had the participant perform a compliance discrimination task. We found that biomimetic multi-channel tactile feedback yielded improved discrimination over its single-channel linear counterpart. We conclude that multi-channel biomimetic ICMS conveys finely graded force feedback that more closely approximates the sensitivity conferred by natural touch.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of computational models for unravelling neural mechanisms of brain function. However, for neural control of movement, they currently must be integrated with software simulating biomechanical effectors, leading to limiting impracticalities: (1) researchers must rely on two different platforms and (2) biomechanical effectors are not generally differentiable, constraining researchers to reinforcement learning algorithms despite the existence and potential biological relevance of faster training methods. To address these limitations, we developed MotorNet, an open-source Python toolbox for creating arbitrarily complex, differentiable, and biomechanically realistic effectors that can be trained on user-defined motor tasks using ANNs. MotorNet is designed to meet several goals: ease of installation, ease of use, a high-level user-friendly API, and a modular architecture to allow for flexibility in model building. MotorNet requires no dependencies outside Python, making it easy to get started with. For instance, it allows training ANNs on typically used motor control models such as a two joint, six muscle, planar arm within minutes on a typical desktop computer. MotorNet is built on TensorFlow and therefore can implement any network architecture that is possible using the TensorFlow framework. Consequently, it will immediately benefit from advances in artificial intelligence through TensorFlow updates. Finally, it is open source, enabling users to create and share their own improvements, such as new effector and network architectures or custom task designs. MotorNets focus on higher order model and task design will alleviate overhead cost to initiate computational projects for new researchers by providing a standalone, ready-to-go framework, and speed up efforts of established computational teams by enabling a focus on concepts and ideas over implementation.",

    "abstract": "Astrocyte activation is associated with neuropathology and the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1). TIMP1 is a pleiotropic extracellular protein that functions both as a protease inhibitor and as a growth factor. We have previously demonstrated that murine astrocytes that lack expression of Timp1 do not support rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (rOPC) differentiation, and adult global Timp1 knockout (Timp1KO) mice do not efficiently remyelinate following a demyelinating injury. To better understand the basis of this, we performed unbiased proteomic analyses and identified a fibronectin-derived peptide called anastellin that is unique to the murine Timp1KO astrocyte secretome. Anastellin was found to block rOPC differentiation in vitro and enhanced the inhibitory influence of fibronectin on rOPC differentiation. Anastellin is known to act upon the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), and we determined that anastellin also blocked the pro-myelinating effect of FTY720 (or fingolimod) on rOPC differentiation in vitro. Further, administration of FTY720 to wild-type C57BL/6 mice during MOG35-55-EAE ameliorated clinical disability while FTY720 administered to mice lacking expression of Timp1 in astrocytes (Timp1cKO) had no effect. Analysis of human TIMP1 and fibronectin (FN1) transcripts from healthy and multiple sclerosis (MS) patient brain samples revealed an inverse relationship where lower TIMP1 expression was coincident with elevated FN1 in MS astrocytes. Lastly, we analyzed proteomic databases of MS samples and identified anastellin peptides to be more abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of human MS patients with high versus low disease activity. The prospective role for anastellin generation in association with myelin lesions as a consequence of a lack of astrocytic TIMP-1 production could influence both the efficacy of fingolimod responses and the innate remyelination potential of the the MS brain.\n\nSignificance StatementAstrocytic production of TIMP-1 prevents the protein catabolism of fibronectin. In the absence of TIMP-1, fibronectin is further digested leading to a higher abundance of anastellin peptides that can bind to sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1. The binding of anastellin with the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 impairs the differentiation of oligodendrocytes progenitor cells into myelinating oligodendrocytes in vitro, and negates the astrocyte-mediated therapeutic effects of FTY720 in the EAE model of chronic CNS inflammation. These data indicate that TIMP-1 production by astrocytes is important in coordinating astrocytic functions during inflammation. In the absence of astrocyte produced TIMP-1, elevated expression of anastellin may represent a prospective biomarker for FTY720 therapeutic responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) is a non-invasive technique that is sensitive to microstructural geometry in neural tissue and is useful for the detection of neuropathology in research and clinical settings. Tensor valued diffusion encoding schemes (b-tensor) have been developed to enrich the microstructural data that can be obtained through DW-MRI. These advanced methods have proven to be more specific to microstructural properties than conventional DW-MRI acquisitions. Additionally, machine learning methods are particularly useful for the study of multidimensional data sets. In this work, we have tested the reach of b-tensor encoding data analyses with machine learning in different histopathological scenarios. We achieved this in three steps: 1) We induced different forms of white matter damage in rodent optic nerves. 2) We obtained ex-vivo DW-MRI with b-tensor encoding schemes and calculated quantitative metrics using Q-space Trajectory Imaging. 3) We used a machine learning model to identify the main contributing features and built a voxel-wise probabilistic classification map of histological damage. Our results show that this model is sensitive to characteristics of microstructural damage. In conclusion, b-tensor encoded DW-MRI analyzed with machine learning methods, have the potential to be further developed for the detection of histopathology and neurodegeneration.",

However, currently available tools for data analysis require a significant time investment for training and adaptation to each laboratorys use case, which limits productivity. Here, we present FriendlyClearMap, an integrated toolset that makes ClearMap1 and ClearMap2s CellMap pipeline easier to use, extends its functions, and provides Docker Images from which it can be run with minimal time investment. We also provide detailed tutorials for each step of the pipeline.\n\nFor more precise alignment, we add a landmark-based atlas registration to ClearMaps functions as well as include young mouse reference atlases for developmental studies. We provide alternative cell segmentation method besides ClearMaps threshold-based approach: Ilastiks Pixel Classification, importing segmentations from commercial image analysis packages and even manual annotations. Finally, we integrate BrainRender, a recently released visualization tool for advanced 3D visualization of the annotated cells.\n\nAs a proof-of-principle, we use FriendlyClearMap to quantify the distribution of the three main GABAergic interneuron subclasses (Parvalbumin+, Somatostatin+, and VIP+) in the mouse fore- and midbrain. For PV+ neurons, we provide an additional dataset with adolescent vs. adult PV+ neuron density, showcasing the use for developmental studies.

    "abstract": "Control of movement requires the coordination of multiple brain areas, each containing populations of neurons that receive inputs, process these inputs via recurrent dynamics, and then relay the processed information to downstream populations. Information transmission between neural populations could occur through either coordinated changes in firing rates or the precise transmission of spike timing. We investigate the nature of the code for transmission of signals to downstream areas from a part of the cerebellar cortex that is crucial for the accurate execution of a quantifiable motor behavior. Simultaneous recordings from Purkinje cell pairs in the cerebellar flocculus of rhesus macaques revealed how these cells coordinate their activity to drive smooth pursuit eye movements. Purkinje cells show millisecond-scale coordination of spikes (synchrony), but the level of synchrony is small and likely insufficient to impact the firing of downstream neurons in the vestibular nucleus. Further, analysis of previous metrics for assaying Purkinje cell synchrony demonstrates that these metrics conflate changes in firing rate and neuron-neuron covariance. We conclude that the output of the cerebellar cortex uses primarily a rate code rather than synchrony code to drive activity of downstream neurons and thus control motor behavior.\n\nImpact statementInformation transmission in the brain can occur via changes in firing rate or via the precise timing of spikes. Simultaneous recordings from pairs of Purkinje cells in the floccular complex reveals that information transmission out of the cerebellar cortex relies almost exclusively on changes in firing rates rather than millisecond-scale coordination of spike timing across the Purkinje cell population.",

We take a developmentally-sensitive approach to examine the neurodevelopmental sequelae of early adversity in a preregistered meta-analysis of 27,234 youth (birth to 18-years-old), providing the largest group of adversity-exposed youth to date. Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until ~10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages. These findings advance ongoing debates regarding why, when, and how early-life adversity shapes later neural outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Facial expressions are widely recognized as universal indicators of underlying internal states in most species of animals, thereby presenting as a non-invasive measure for predicting physical and mental conditions. Despite the advancement of artificial intelligence-assisted tools for automated analysis of voluminous facial expression data in human subjects, the corresponding tools for mice still remain limited so far. Considering that mice are the most prevalent model animals for studying human health and diseases, a comprehensive characterization of emotion-dependent patterns of facial expressions in mice could extend our knowledge on the basis of emotions and the related disorders. Here, we present a framework for the development of a deep learning-powered tool for classifying mouse facial expressions. We demonstrate that our machine vision was capable of accurately classifying three different emotional states from mouse facial images. Moreover, we objectively determined how our classifier characterized the differences among the facial images through the use of an interpretation technique called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping. Our approach is likely to facilitate the non-invasive decoding of a variety of emotions from facial images in mice.",

    "abstract": "Learning or relearning of motor skills requires plasticity in relevant neural circuits. Motor recovery following lesions to the corticospinal system can be augmented through neuromodulation techniques targeting the affected or compensatory neural circuits. By repeatedly pairing transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) and motoneuronal electrical stimulation (i.e., paired corticomotoneuronal stimulation, PCMS) timed to arrive at the corticomotoneuronal (CM) synapses in close temporal proximity, spike-timing-dependent bidirectional changes in CM transmission can be induced in humans (Taylor & Martin, 2009). PCMS-induced increases in CM transmission have been demonstrated to transiently improve motor control in patients with spinal cord injury (Bunday & Perez 2012), whereas effects on the malleability of neural circuits are entirely unexplored. We hypothesized that PCMS can prime mechanisms of subsequent motor learning exclusively when directed to the neural circuitry underpinning the motor behavior. In three experiments, we provide the first evidence ( Experiment I) and a double-blinded, sham-controlled replication ( Experiment II) that PCMS targeting the spinal CM synapses can prime subsequent learning of rapid finger movements relying on spinal neuroplasticity. Finally, we demonstrate that the effects of PCMS are circuit-specific and bidirectional. When PCMS was timed to arrive at a facilitatory interval in M1 but an inhibitory interval at the CM synapses subsequent learning was transiently impeded ( Experiment III). Taken together, our results provide proof-of-principle that non-invasively induced plasticity governed by Hebbian learning rules interacts with experience-dependent plasticity in the spinal cord with positive implications for motor learning. Our results offer a mechanistic rationale for priming sensorimotor training with individualized PCMS to enhance the effects of motor practice in neurorehabilitation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPaired corticomotoneuronal stimulations (PCMS) promote ballistic motor learning and facilitate corticospinal excitability compared to rest and sham protocols.\nC_LIO_LIA double-blinded sham experiment replicates priming effects of PCMS on ballistic motor learning and demonstrates long-term benefits of combined PCMS and motor practice.\nC_LIO_LIThe facilitating effect of PCMS on ballistic motor learning is circuit-specific with superior effects on ballistic motor learning after facilitating PCMS compared to control protocols.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the adult sensory cortex, increases in neural activity elicited by sensory stimulation usually drives vasodilation mediated by neurovascular coupling. However, whether neurovascular coupling is the same in neonatal animals as adults is controversial, as both canonical and inverted responses have been observed. We investigated the nature of neurovascular coupling in unanesthetized neonatal mice using optical imaging, electrophysiology, and BOLD fMRI. We find in neonatal (postnatal day 15, P15) mice, sensory stimulation induces a small increase in blood volume/BOLD signal, often followed by a large decrease in blood volume. An examination of arousal state of the mice revealed that neonatal mice were asleep a substantial fraction of the time, and that stimulation caused the animal to awaken. As cortical blood volume is much higher during REM and NREM sleep than the awake state, awakening occludes any sensory-evoked neurovascular coupling. When neonatal mice are stimulated during an awake period, they showed relatively normal (but slowed) neurovascular coupling, showing that that the typically observed constriction is due to arousal state changes. These result show that sleep-related vascular changes dominate over any sensory-evoked changes, and hemodynamic measures need to be considered in the context of arousal state changes.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the adult brain, increases in neural activity are often followed by vasodilation, allowing activity to be monitored using optical or magnetic resonance imaging. However, in neonates, sensory stimulation can drive vasoconstriction, whose origin was not understood. We used optical and magnetic resonance imaging approaches to investigate hemodynamics in neonatal mice. We found that sensory-induced vasoconstriction occurred when the mice were asleep, as sleep is associated with dilation of the vasculature of the brain relative to the awake state. The stimulus awakens the mice, causing a constriction due to the arousal state change. Our study shows the importance of monitoring arousal state, particularly when investigating subjects that may sleep, and the dominance arousal effects on brain hemodynamics.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genetic neuromodulation technology have enabled circuit-specific interventions in nonhuman primates (NHPs), thereby revealing the causal functions of specific neural circuits. Going forward, an important step is to use these findings to better understand neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in humans, in which alterations in functional connectivity between brain regions are demonstrated. We recently identified the causal roles of the pathways from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to the lateral part of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDl) and dorsal caudate nucleus (dCD) in working memory and decision-making, respectively. In the present study, we examined the resting-state functional connectivity of these two prefronto-subcortical circuits in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in humans. We found that the functional connectivity of two pathways, DLPFC-MDl and DLPFC-dCD, was significantly reduced in the SCZ groups compared to HCs; however, this hypoconnectivity was not observed in the ASD or MDD groups, suggesting a disease-specific profile of altered prefronto-subcortical connectivity at rest. These results suggest that causal findings of pathway-specific functions revealed in NHPs can be effectively translated to identify the altered connectivity in neuropsychiatric disorders with related symptoms in humans.",

    "abstract": "The spinal motor neurons are the only neural cells whose individual activity can be non-invasively identified. This is usually done using grids of surface electromyographic (EMG) electrodes and source separation algorithms; an approach called EMG decomposition. In this study, we combined computational and experimental analyses to assess how the design parameters of grids of electrodes influence the number and the properties of the identified motor units. We first computed the percentage of motor units that could be theoretically discriminated within a pool of 200 simulated motor units when decomposing EMG signals recorded with grids of various sizes and interelectrode distances (IED). Increasing the density, the number of electrodes, and the size of the grids, increased the number of motor units that our decomposition algorithm could theoretically discriminate, i.e., up to 83.5% of the simulated pool (range across conditions: 30.5-83.5%). We then identified motor units from experimental EMG signals recorded in six participants with grids of various sizes (range: 2-36 cm2) and IED (range: 4-16 mm). The configuration with the largest number of electrodes and the shortest IED maximized the number of identified motor units (56{+/-}14; range: 39-79) and the percentage of early recruited motor units within these samples (29{+/-}14%). Finally, the number of identified motor units further increased with a prototyped grid of 256 electrodes and an IED of 2 mm. Taken together, our results showed that larger and denser surface grids of electrodes allow to identify a more representative pool of motor units than currently reported in experimental studies.\n\nSignificance statementThe application of source separation methods to multi-channel EMG signals recorded with grids of electrodes enables users to accurately identify the activity of individual motor units. However, the design parameters of these grids have never been discussed. They are usually arbitrarily fixed, often based on commercial availability. Here, we showed that using larger and denser grids of electrodes than conventionally proposed drastically increases the number of identified motor units. The samples of identified units are more balanced between early- and late-recruited motor units. Thus, these grids provide a more representative sampling of the active motor unit population. Gathering large datasets of motor units using large and dense grids will impact the study of motor control, neuromuscular modelling, and human-machine interfacing.",

    "abstract": "The ventral hippocampus is proposed to perform its multitude of roles via segregated populations of neurons identified by either genetic makeup, downstream projection, or their combination. Recently we described two parallel projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex, segregated across the radial axis of the CA1 and subicular areas. These two populations had distinct afferent and efferent connectivity and distinct influence of approach avoidance behaviour. In this study, we extend these data by performing RNA sequencing of each population of neurons. We find that these two populations have multiple genes that are differentially expressed. These genes correspond both to genes classically thought to be distributed across the radial axis such as Calbindin 1 and Pcp4, but also to more unexpected genes including postsynaptic scaffolds and GABA receptor subunits. Notably, a number of genes differentially expressed across the two populations were associated with the development of mental illness, suggesting an imbalance in the function of these two pathways in disease may be an interesting area for future research. Together, these data reinforce the dissociation of function of projections to prefrontal cortex across the radial axis of the ventral hippocampus, and provide multiple targets for both the genetic and functional dissociation of these roles.",

However, in natural environments, microbes experience the effects of multiple pollutants simultaneously, and their responses to these mixtures of chemicals may not be readily predictable based on their responses to each pollutant in isolation. Here we extended the scope and complexity of previous multi-stressor experiments by assaying the growth of model and non-model strains of bacteria in all 255 combinations of 8 chemical stressors. This approach allowed us to identify fitness effects arising from potential high-order interactions among stressor responses. We found that the bacterial strains responded in different ways to stressor mixtures, which could not be predicted simply from their phylogenetic relatedness. Responses to increasingly complex chemical mixtures were more likely to show a significant deviation from a null model based on the responses to each chemical alone. However, these net responses were mainly driven by lower-order interactions among a small number of chemicals, suggesting a limited role for complex high-order interactions. These results simplify the predictability of microbial populations and communities responding to multiple stressors, paving the way for the development of efficient next-generation eco-toxicological assays.",

    "abstract": "Macrocyclic peptides are attractive for chemoproteomic applications due to their modular synthesis and potential for high target selectivity. We describe a solid phase synthesis method for the efficient generation of libraries of small macrocycles that contain an electrophile and alkyne handle. The modular synthesis produces libraries that can be directly screened using simple SDS-PAGE readouts and then optimal lead molecules applied to proteomic analysis. We generated a library of 480 macrocyclic peptides containing the weakly reactive fluorosulfate (OSF) electrophile. Initial screening of a subset of the library containing each of the various diversity elements identified initial molecules of interest. The corresponding positional and confirmational isomers were then screened to select molecules that showed specific protein labeling patterns that were dependent on the probe structure. The most promising hits were applied to standard chemoproteomic workflows to identify protein targets. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid, on-resin synthesis of diverse macrocyclic electrophiles to generate new classes of covalent ligands.",

    "abstract": "Little information exists on the variation of morphological characteristics, nutritional value, ruminal degradability, and molecular structural makeup of diverse whole-plant silage corn (WPSC) cultivars among different growing regions. This study investigated the between-regions discrepancies in five widely used WPSC cultivars in China (FKBN, YQ889, YQ23, DK301 and ZD958) in terms of 1) morphological characteristics; 2) crude protein (CP) chemical profile; 3) Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) CP subfractions; 4) in situ CP degradation kinetics; and 5) CP molecular structures. Our results revealed that significant difference were observed on growing region and WPSC cultivar interaction for all estimated morphological characteristics (P < 0.001), CP chemical profile (P < 0.001), CNCPS subfractions (P < 0.001) and CP molecular structural features (P < 0.05). Except ear weight (P = 0.18), all measured morphological characteristics varied among different growing regions (P < 0.001). Besides, WPSC cultivars planted in different areas had remarkably different (P < 0.01) CP chemical profiles and CNCPS subfractions. All spectral parameters of protein primary structure of WPSC differed (P < 0.05) due to the various growing regions, except amide II area (P = 0.28). Finally, the area ratio of amide I to II was negatively correlated with the contents of soluble CP ({delta} = -0.66; P = 0.002), CP ({delta} = - 0.61; P = 0.006), non-protein N ({delta} = -0.56; P = 0.004) and acid detergent insoluble CP ({delta} = - 0.43; P = 0.008), in conjunction with positively correlated with moderately degradable CP (PB1;{delta} = 0.58; P = 0.01). In conclusion, the current study suggested that even for the same WPSC cultivar, the morphological characteristics, protein nutritional values and rumen degradability significantly varied among different grown regions due to distinguished molecular structures.\n\nAuthor summaryAs the major roughage source, whole plant silage corn plays an essential role in ruminant feed industry. The quality and quantity of it largely influenced by environmental and climate conditions except genetic factors. However, there was limited information to systematically analyze whole plant silage corn from morphological characteristics, nutritional components, rumen degradation to its inherent molecular structures. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the discrepancies of various silage-corn cultivars grown in different regions from internal structure to phenotype based novel technology - fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "The dependency of cancer cells on glucose can be targeted with high-fat low- carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD). However, hepatic ketogenesis is suppressed in IL-6 producing cancers, which prevents the utilization of this nutrient source as energy for the organism. In two IL-6 associated murine models of cancer cachexia we describe delayed tumor growth but accelerated onset of cancer cachexia and shortened survival when mice are fed KD. Mechanistically, we find this uncoupling is a consequence of the biochemical interaction of two simultaneously occurring NADPH-dependent pathways. Within the tumor, increased production of lipid peroxidation products (LPPs) and, consequently, saturation of the glutathione (GSH) system leads to ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Systemically, redox imbalance and NADPH depletion impairs the biosynthesis of corticosterone, the main regulator of metabolic stress, in the adrenal glands. Administration of dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, improves food intake, normalizes glucose homeostasis and utilization of nutritional substrates, delays onset of cancer cachexia and extends survival of tumor-bearing mice fed KD, while preserving reduced tumor growth. Our study highlights that the outcome of systemic interventions cannot necessarily be extrapolated from the effect on the tumor alone, but that they have to be investigated for anti{-}cancer and host effects. These findings may be relevant to clinical research efforts that investigate nutritional interventions such as KD in patients with cancer.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/528937v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@613bb6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19746a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ef652org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3db934_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIKetogenic diet delays tumor growth but accelerates cancer cachexia and shortens survival\nC_LIO_LIIn the tumor, accumulation of lipid peroxidation products results in saturation of the GSH detoxifying pathway and ferroptotic death of cancer cells\nC_LIO_LIIn the host organism, systemic redox state imbalance causes NADPH depletion, GDF-15 elevations, and relative corticosterone deficiency\nC_LIO_LIDexamethasone coadministration with ketogenic diet delays onset of cancer cachexia by improving food intake, glucose homeostasis and utilization of nutritional substrates\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Based on studies of animals and yeasts, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3, for mono-, di-, and tri-methylation, respectively) is regarded as the key epigenetic modification of transcriptionally active genes. In plants, however, H3K4me2 correlates negatively with transcription, and the regulatory mechanisms of this counterintuitive H3K4me2 distribution in plants remain largely unexplored. A previous genetic screen for factors regulating plant regeneration identified Arabidopsis LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 1-LIKE 3 (LDL3), which is a major H3K4me2 demethylase. Here, we show that LDL3-mediated H3K4me2 demethylation depends on the transcription elongation factor Paf1C and phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In addition, LDL3 binds to phosphorylated RNAPII. These results suggest that LDL3 is recruited to transcribed genes by binding to elongating RNAPII and demethylates H3K4me2 cotranscriptionally. Importantly, the negative correlation between H3K4me2 and transcription is disrupted in the ldl3 mutant, demonstrating the genome-wide impacts of the transcription-driven LDL3 pathway to control H3K4me2 in plants. Our findings implicate H3K4me2 in plants as chromatin memory for transcriptionally repressive states, which ensures robust gene control.",

    "abstract": "1.The microbiome is increasingly receiving attention as an important modulator of host health and disease. However, while numerous mechanisms through which the microbiome influences its host have been identified, there is still a lack of approaches that allow to specifically modulate the abundance of individual microbes or microbial functions of interest. Moreover, current approaches for microbiome manipulation such as fecal transfers often entail a non-specific transfer of entire microbial communities with potentially unwanted side effects. To overcome this limitation, we here propose the concept of precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In a first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we present a metabolic modeling network framework that allows us to define precision prebiotics for a two-member C. elegans microbiome model community comprising the immune-protective Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. Thus, we predicted compounds that specifically boost the abundance of the host-beneficial MYb11, four of which were experimentally validated in vitro (L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and {gamma}-aminobutyric acid). L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that constraint-based metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Enzymatic methods to quantify deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates have existed for decades. In contrast, no general enzymatic method to quantify ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs), which drive almost all cellular processes and serve as precursors of RNA, exists to date. ATP can be measured with an enzymatic luminometric method employing the firefly luciferase, but the quantification of the other ribonucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates is still a challenge for a non-specialized laboratory and practically impossible without chromatography equipment. To allow feasible quantification of ribonucleoside phosphates in any laboratory with typical molecular biology and biochemistry tools, we developed a robust microplate assay based on real-time detection of the Broccoli aptamer during in vitro transcription. The assay employs the bacteriophage T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, two oligonucleotide templates encoding the 49-nucleotide Broccoli aptamer, and a high-affinity fluorogenic aptamer-binding dye to quantify each of the four canonical rNTPs. The inclusion of nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinases in the assay reactions enabled the quantification of the mono- and diphosphate counterparts. The assay is inherently specific and tolerates concentrated tissue and cell extracts. In summary, we describe the first chromatography-free method to quantify ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, GMP, UTP, UDP, UMP, CTP, CDP, and CMP in biological samples.",

    "abstract": "Ulva prolifera is the dominant species of \"green tide\", and has higher tolerance to environmental stresses such as temperature. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, transcriptome analysis, Western blot and RT-qPCR analysis of U. prolifera suggested that, under temperature stresses (4{degrees}C, 36{degrees}C), the expression of PCNA and CyclinA was promoted, and the MAPK signaling was activated. Besides, the results showed that PCNA interacted with CyclinA. Interestingly, the expression of miR-2916, which was predicted to bind PCNA at -552[~]-772, was negatively correlated with the expression of PCNA under temperature stresses (4{degrees}C, 36{degrees}C). In addition, the results showed that low temperature (4{degrees}C) had no obvious effect on the survival, the formation of cell walls, and the division of protoplasts. However, high temperature (36{degrees}C) had obvious effect on them. PCNA inhibitors increased the sensitivity of the protoplasts under temperature stresses. Together, our results suggested PCNA regulating the proliferation in response to the temperature stress of U. prolifera was associated with miR-2916/PCNA/CyclinA/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, the study preliminarily illuminates the molecular mechanism in response to temperature stress of U. prolifera, and may provide a new insight for prevention of green tide.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect, which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium (LD). Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, H. argophyllus, and H. petiolaris, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.",

    "abstract": "Studying gene family evolution strongly benefits from insightful visualisations. However, the ever-growing number of sequenced genomes is leading to increasingly larger gene families, which challenges existing gene tree visualisations. Indeed, most of them present users with a dilemma: display complete but intractable gene trees, or collapse subtrees, thereby hiding their childrens information. Here, we introduce Matreex, a new dynamic tool to scale-up the visualisation of gene families. Matreex key idea is to use \"phylogenetic\" profiles, which are dense representations of gene repertoires, to minimise the information loss when collapsing subtrees. We illustrate Matreex usefulness with three biological applications. First, using the textbook example of visual opsins, we show Matreex potential to create easily interpretable figures for teaching and outreach. Secondly, by displaying 22 intraflagellar transport gene families across 622 species cumulating 5500 representatives, we show how Matreex can be used to automate large-scale analyses of gene presence-absence. Notably, we report for the first time the complete loss of intraflagellar transport in the myxozoan Thelohanellus kitauei. Finally, we demonstrate on the MutS family the power of combining gene trees and phylogenetic profiles to delve into precise evolutionary analyses of large multi-copy gene families.

    "abstract": "Spikelet number per spike (SNS) is one of the crucial factors determining wheat yield. Thus, improving our understanding of the genes that regulate SNS could help develop higher-yielding wheat varieties. A genetic linkage map constructed using the GenoBaits Wheat 16K Panel and the 660K SNP array contained 5991 polymorphic SNP markers spanning 2813.26 cM. A total of twelve QTL for SNS were detected in the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population msf x Chuannong 16 (MC), and two of them, i.e., QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 and QSns.sau-MC-7A, were stably expressed. QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 had high LOD values ranging from 4.99 to 11.06 and explained 9.71-16.75% of the phenotypic variation. Comparison of QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 with previously reported SNS QTL suggested that it is likely a novel one. A kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) marker, KASP-10, tightly linked to QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 was developed to successfully validate its effect in three segregated populations and a natural population. Genetic analysis indicated that WHEAT ORTHOLOG OFAPO1 (WAPO1) was a candidate gene for QSns.sau-MC-7A. The combined additive effect of QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 and WAP01 had a great additive effect increasing SNS by 7.10%. In addition, our results suggested that SNS is not affected by 1BL/1RS translocations in the MC RIL population. Correlation analysis between two major QTL and other agronomic traits showed that QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 was likely independent of these agronomic traits. However, the H2 haplotype of WAPO1 may affect effective tiller number and plant height. This indicated that the breeding potential of QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 is better than that of WAPO1. The geographical distribution of QSns.nsau-MC-3D.1 showed that QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 positive allele frequency was dominant in most wheat-producing regions of China and it has been positively selected among modern cultivars released in China since the 1940s. Two genes, TraesCS3D03G0222600 and TraesCS3D03G0216800, associated with SNS development were predicted in the physical interval of QSns.sau-MC-3D.1. qRT-PCR results of the two genes showed that only the expression level of TraesCS3D03G0216800 was significantly different between msf and CN16. These results enrich our understanding of the genetic basis of wheat SNS and will be useful for fine mapping and cloning of genes underlying QSns.sau-MC-3D.1, and provide a basis for marker-assisted selection breeding.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we identified two major QTL (QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 and QSns.sau-MC-7A) in a RIL population. WAPO1 was demonstrated to be the candidate gene for QSns.sau-MC-7A. QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 was a novel and stably expressed QTL, and further confirmed in different genetic backgrounds. Our results further demonstrate that QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 has better breeding potential because of its no adverse effect on other agronomic traits than WAPO1, and it has been positively selected during Chinese breeding programs since the 1940s. Taken together, the identification of QSns.sau-MC-3D.1 offers a promising resource to further increase wheat yields.",

    "abstract": "Fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by a unique genetic mechanism that relies on contraction and hypomethylation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on the chromosome 4q telomere allowing ectopic expression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. Genetic analysis is difficult due to the large size and repetitive nature of the array, a nearly identical array on the 10q telomere, and the presence of divergent D4Z4 arrays scattered throughout the genome. Here, we combine nanopore long-read sequencing with Cas9-targeted enrichment of 4q and 10q D4Z4 arrays for comprehensive genetic analysis including determination of the length of the 4q and 10q D4Z4 arrays with base-pair resolution. In the same assay, we differentiate 4q from 10q telomeric sequences, determine A/B haplotype, identify paralogous D4Z4 sequences elsewhere in the genome, and estimate methylation for all CpGs in the array. Asymmetric, length-dependent methylation gradients were observed in the 4q and 10q D4Z4 arrays that reach a hypermethylation point at approximately 10 D4Z4 repeat units, consistent with the known threshold of pathogenic D4Z4 contractions. High resolution analysis of individual D4Z4 repeat methylation revealed areas of low methylation near the CTCF/insulator region and areas of high methylation immediately preceding the DUX4 transcriptional start site. Within the DUX4 exons, we observed a waxing/waning methylation pattern with a 180-nucleotide periodicity, consistent with phased nucleosomes. Targeted nanopore sequencing complements recently developed molecular combing and optical mapping approaches to genetic analysis for FSHD by adding precision of the length measurement, base-pair resolution sequencing, and quantitative methylation analysis.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, high-throughput spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the spatial distribution of mRNA expression and the effects it may have on cellular function. There is a lack of standardized tools for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data, leading many groups to write their own in-house tools that are often poorly documented and not generalizable to other datasets. Currently, the only publicly available tools for extracting annotated transcript locations from raw multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) images are starfish, which is lacking in key areas, and MERlin, which is restricted to only MERFISH data. To address this, we have expanded and improved the starfish library and used those tools to create PIPEFISH, a semi-automated and generalizable pipeline that performs transcript annotation for FISH-based spatial transcriptomics. PIPEFISH has options for image processing, decoding, and cell segmentation, and calculates quality control metrics on the output to allow the user to assess the pipelines performance on their data. We used this pipeline to annotate transcript locations from three real datasets from three different common types of FISH image-based experiments: MERFISH, seqFISH, and targeted in situ sequencing (ISS), and verified that the results were high quality using the internal quality metrics of the pipeline and also a comparison to a orthogonal method of measuring RNA expression in a similar tissue sample. We have made PIPEFISH publicly available through Github for anyone interested in analyzing data from FISH-based spatial transcriptomic assays.",

We developed and optimised ATAC-seq from O. niloticus gill tissues to identify regulatory regions accounting for gene expression associated with gill adaptations. We find that SNPs from 27 tilapia species are enriched in noncoding regions, with 95% of accessible gene promoter regions being SNP-containing. Regulatory variants of TF binding sites are likely driving gene expression differences associated with tilapia gill adaptations, and differentially segregate in freshwater and euryhaline tilapia species.

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinsons disease. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases, particularly Rab10 and Rab8A, and we showed previously that phosphoRabs play an important role in LRRK2 membrane recruitment and activation (Vides et al., 2022). To learn more about LRRK2 pathway regulation, we carried out an unbiased, CRISPR-based genome-wide screen to identify modifiers of cellular phosphoRab10 levels. A flow cytometry assay was developed to detect changes in phosphoRab10 levels in pools of mouse NIH-3T3 cells harboring unique CRISPR guide sequences. Multiple negative and positive regulators were identified; surprisingly, knockout of the Rab12 gene was especially effective in decreasing phosphoRab10 levels in multiple cell types and knockout mouse tissues. Rab-driven increases in phosphoRab10 were specific for Rab12, LRRK2 dependent and PPM1H phosphatase reversible; they were seen with wild type and pathogenic G2019S and R1441C LRRK2. AlphaFold modeling revealed a novel Rab12 binding site in the LRRK2 Armadillo domain and we show that residues predicted to be essential for Rab12 interaction at this site influence overall phosphoRab levels in a manner distinct from Rab29 activation of LRRK2. Our data support a model in which Rab12 binding to a new site in the LRRK2 Armadillo domain activates LRRK2 kinase for Rab phosphorylation and could serve as a new therapeutic target for a novel class of LRRK2 inhibitors that do not target the kinase domain.",

We find that liver endothelial cells secrete soluble factor(s) to promote mCRC growth in vitro and in vivo. We identify LRG1 in ECs secretome, which promotes growth in tumor cells through binding and activation of HER3. Pharmacological blocking of the LRG1/HER3 axis using LRG1 antibody 15C4 completely attenuated LRG1-induced HER3 activation and in vitro and in vivo growth of the tumor. Moreover, LRG1-/- mice with CRC allografts in the liver had 2 times longer overall survival than tumor-bearing LRG1+/+ mice. Lastly, unbiased -omics analysis and target-specific inhibitors identified eIF4-protein synthesis is significantly activated by the LRG1/HER3/RSK1/2 axis. This work reveals a paracrine mechanism of mCRC growth in liver microenvironment and highlighted the potential of blocking LRG1-HER3 and involved downstream pathways for treating patients with mCRC.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=171 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529070v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a84299org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac6654org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1723260org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4970a8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The liver coordinates the systemic response to nutrient deprivation and availability by producing glucose from gluconeogenesis during fasting and synthesizing lipids via de novo lipogenesis (DNL) when carbohydrates are abundant. Mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is thought to play important roles in both gluconeogenesis and DNL. We examined the effects of hepatocyte-specific mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) deletion on the fasting-refeeding response. Rates of DNL during refeeding were impaired by liver MPC deletion, but this did not reduce intrahepatic lipid content. During fasting, glycerol is converted to glucose by two pathways; a direct cytosolic pathway essentially reversing glycolysis and an indirect mitochondrial pathway requiring the MPC. MPC deletion reduced the incorporation of 13C-glycerol into TCA cycle metabolites but not into newly synthesized glucose. However, suppression of glycerol metabolism did not affect glucose concentrations in fasted hepatocyte-specific MPC-deficient mice. Thus, glucose production by kidney and intestine may compensate for MPC deficiency in hepatocytes.",

    "abstract": "Sunlight regulates transcriptional programs and triggers the shaping of the genome throughout plant development. Among the different sunlight wavelengths that reach the surface of the Earth, UV-B (280-315 nm) controls the expression of hundreds of genes for the photomorphogenic responses and also induces the formation of photodamage that interfere with genome integrity and transcriptional programs. The combination of cytogenetics and deep-learning-based analyses allowed determining the location of UV-B-induced photoproducts and quantifying the effects of UV-B irradiation on constitutive heterochromatin content in different Arabidopsis natural variants acclimated to various UV-B regimes. We identified that UV-B-induced photolesions are enriched within chromocenters. Furthermore, we uncovered that UV-B irradiation promotes constitutive heterochromatin dynamics that differs among the Arabidopsis ecotypes having divergent heterochromatin contents. Finally, we identified that the proper restoration of the chromocenter shape, upon DNA repair, relies on the UV-B photoreceptor, UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8). These findings shed the light on the effect of UV-B exposure and perception in heterochromatin dynamics and structure in Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nStatements and DeclarationsAll authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or non-financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has made it possible to not only sequence entire genomes, but also identify metabolic engineering targets across the pangenome of a microbial population. This study leverages NGS data as well as existing molecular biology and bioinformatics tools to identify and validate genomic signatures for improving phenazine biosynthesis in Pseudomonas chlororaphis. We sequenced a diverse collection of 34 Pseudomonas isolates using short- and long-read sequencing techniques and assembled whole genomes using the NGS reads. In addition, we assayed three industrially relevant phenotypes (phenazine production, biofilm formation, and growth temperature) for these isolates in two different media conditions. We then provided the whole genomes and phenazine production data to a unitig-based microbial genome-wide association study (mGWAS) tool to identify novel genomic signatures responsible for phenazine production in P. chlororaphis. Post-processing of the mGWAS analysis results yielded 330 significant hits influencing the biosynthesis of one or more phenazine compounds. Based on a quantitative metric (called the phenotype score), we elucidated the most influential hits for phenazine production and experimentally validated them in vivo in the most optimal phenazine producing strain. Two genes significantly increased phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) production: a histidine transporter (ProY_1), and a putative carboxypeptidase (PS__04251). A putative MarR-family transcriptional regulator decreased PCN titer when overexpressed in a high PCN producing isolate. Overall, this work seeks to demonstrate the utility of a population genomics approach as an effective strategy in enabling identification of targets for metabolic engineering of bioproduction hosts.",

However, the full spectrum, characteristics and regulation of existing metabolic switches are unknown. We propose that metabolic switches can be recognised by locating large alternating gene expression patterns and associate them with specific metabolic states. We developed a method to identify interspersed genesets by massive correlated biclustering (MCbiclust) and to predict their metabolic wiring. Testing the method on major breast cancer transcriptome datasets we discovered a series of gene sets with switch-like behaviour, predicting mitochondrial content, activity and central carbon fluxes in tumours associated with different switch positions. The predictions were experimentally validated by bioenergetic profiling and metabolic flux analysis of 13C-labelled substrates and were ultimately extended by geneset analysis to link metabolic alterations to cellular states, thus predicting tumour pathology, prognosis and chemosensitivity. The method is applicable to any large and heterogeneous transcriptome dataset to discover metabolic and associated pathophysiological states.",

The most dramatic effect on the transcriptome was the upregulation of genes expressed during oogenesis and downregulation of genes associated with male gametogenesis. Among the detrimental effects of ascr#10 on hermaphrodites is the increased risk of persistent infections caused by pathological pharyngeal hypertrophy. Our results reveal a way in which social signals help to resolve the inherent conflict between spermatogenesis and oogenesis in a simultaneous hermaphrodite, presumably to optimally align reproductive function to the presence of potential mating partners.

ATP binding is important to maintain the NPF in a competent conformation for strand pairing and exchange. Once strand exchange is completed, ATP hydrolysis licenses the filament for disassembly. Here we show using high-resolution cryoEM that the ATP-binding site of the RAD51 NPF contains a second metal ion. In the presence of ATP, the metal ion promotes the local folding of RAD51 into the conformation required for DNA binding. The metal ion is absent in the structure of an ADP-bound RAD51 filament, that rearranges in a conformation incompatible with DNA binding. The presence of the second metal ion explains how RAD51 couples the nucleotide state of the filament to DNA binding. We propose that loss of the second metal ion upon ATP hydrolysis drives RAD51 dissociation from the DNA and weakens filament stability, thus contributing to NPF disassembly, a critical step in the completion of HR.",

As a model system for nuclear transport, we construct NPC mimics by functionalizing the pore walls of freestanding palladium zero-mode waveguides with the FG-nucleoporin Nsp1. This approach enables the measurement of single-molecule translocations through individual pores using optical detection. We probe the selectivity of Nsp1-coated pores by quantitatively comparing the translocation rates of the nuclear transport receptor Kap95 to the inert probe BSA over a wide range of pore sizes from 35 nm to 160 nm. Pores below 55 {+/-} 5 nm show significant selectivity that gradually decreases for larger pores. This finding is corroborated by coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations of the Nsp1 mesh within the pore, which suggest that leakage of BSA occurs by diffusion through transient openings within the dynamic mesh. Furthermore, we experimentally observe a modulation of the BSA permeation when varying the concentration of Kap95. The results demonstrate the potential of single-molecule fluorescence measurements on biomimetic NPCs to elucidate the principles of nuclear transport.",

    "abstract": "The cytoplasm is compartmentalized into different translation environments. mRNAs use their 3'UTRs to localize to distinct cytoplasmic compartments, including TIS granules (TGs). Many transcription factors, including MYC, are translated in TGs. It was shown that translation of proteins in TGs enables the formation of protein complexes that cannot be established when these proteins are translated in the cytosol, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that MYC protein complexes that involve binding to the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of MYC are only formed when MYC is translated in TGs. TG-dependent protein complexes require TG-enriched mRNAs for assembly. These mRNAs bind to a new and widespread RNA-binding domain in neutral or negatively charged IDRs in several transcription factors, including MYC. RNA-IDR interaction changes the conformational ensemble of the IDR, enabling the formation of MYC protein complexes that act in the nucleus and control functions that cannot be accomplished by cytosolically-translated MYC. We propose that certain mRNAs have IDR chaperone activity as they control IDR conformations. In addition to post-translational modifications, we found a novel mode of protein activity regulation. Since RNA-IDR interactions are prevalent, we suggest that mRNA-dependent control of protein functional states is widespread.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of silicosis is poorly understood, limiting development of therapies for those who have been exposed to the respirable particle. We explored the mechanisms of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model using multiple modalities including wholelung single-nucleus RNA sequencing. These analyses revealed that in addition to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, intratracheal silica challenge induced osteoclast-like differentiation of alveolar macrophages and recruited monocytes, driven by induction of the osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor-{kappa}B ligand (RANKL) in pulmonary lymphocytes and alveolar type II cells. Furthermore, anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody treatment suppressed silica-induced osteoclast-like differentiation in the lung and attenuated silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We conclude that silica induces osteoclast-like differentiation of distinct recruited and tissue resident monocyte populations, leading to progressive lung injury, likely due to sustained elaboration of bone resorbing proteases and hydrochloric acid. Interrupting osteoclast-like differentiation may therefore constitute a promising avenue for moderating lung damage in silicosis.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySilica induces the alveolar epithelium to reprogram recruited and resident pulmonary myeloid cells to become osteoclasts that contribute to pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the cortex are heterogenous, sending diverse axonal projections to multiple brain regions. Unraveling the logic of these projections requires single-neuron resolution. Although a growing number of techniques have enabled high-throughput reconstruction, these techniques are typically limited to dozens or at most hundreds of neurons per brain, requiring that statistical analyses combine data from different specimens. Here we present axonal BARseq, a high-throughput approach based on reading out nucleic acid barcodes using in situ RNA sequencing, which enables analysis of even densely labeled neurons. As a proof of principle, we have mapped the long-range projections of >8000 mouse primary auditory cortex neurons from a single brain. We identified major cell types based on projection targets and axonal trajectory. The large sample size enabled us to systematically quantify the projections of intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, and revealed that individual IT neurons project to different layers in an area-dependent fashion. Axonal BARseq is a powerful technique for studying the heterogeneity of single neuronal projections at high throughput within individual brains.",
