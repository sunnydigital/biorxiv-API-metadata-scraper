    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were the first modality to pioneer targeted gene knockdown in the treatment of ALS caused by mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). RNA interference (RNAi) is another mechanism of gene silencing with historically superior potency in which short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave complementary transcripts. However, delivery to extrahepatic tissues like the central nerve system (CNS) has been a bottleneck in the clinical development of RNAi. Herein, we identify potent siRNA duplexes for the knockdown of human SOD1 (hSOD1) in which medicinal chemistry and conjugation to an accessory oligonucleotide (ACO) enables durable and potent activity in CNS tissues. Local delivery via intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intrathecal (IT) injection into SOD1G93A mice delayed disease progression and extended animal survival with superior efficacy compared to an ASO compound resembling Tofersen in sequence and chemistry. Treatment also prevented disease-related declines in motor function including improvements in animal mobility, muscle strength, and coordination. The ACO itself does not target any specific complementary nucleic acid sequence; rather, it imparts benefits conducive to bioavailability and delivery through its chemistry. The complete conjugate (i.e., siRNA-ACO) represents a novel modality for delivery of RNAi to the CNS in which we aim to pursue ALS as an exemplary indication for clinical development.",

    "abstract": "After endocytosis, many plasma membrane components are recycled via narrow-diameter membrane tubules that emerge from early endosomes to form recycling endosomes, eventually leading to their return to the plasma membrane. We previously showed that the F- BAR and SH3 domain Syndapin/PACSIN-family protein SDPN-1 is required in vivo for basolateral endocytic recycling in the C. elegans intestine. Here we sought to determine the significance of a predicted interaction between the SDPN-1 SH3 domain and a target sequence in PXF-1/PDZ- GEF1/RAPGEF2, a known exchange factor for Rap-GTPases. We found that endogenous mutations we engineered into the SDPN-1 SH3 domain, or its binding site in the PXF-1 protein, interfere with recycling in vivo, as does loss of the PXF-1 target RAP-1. Rap-GTPases have been shown in several contexts to negatively regulate RhoA activity. Our results show that RHO- 1/RhoA is enriched on SDPN-1 and RAP-1 positive endosomes in the C. elegans intestine, and loss of SDPN-1 or RAP-1 elevates RHO-1(GTP) levels on intestinal endosomes. Furthermore, we found that depletion of RHO-1 suppressed sdpn-1 mutant recycling defects, indicating that control of RHO-1 activity is a key mechanism by which SDPN-1 acts to promote endocytic recycling. RHO-1/RhoA is well-known for controlling actomyosin contraction cycles, although little is known of non-muscle myosin II on endosomes. Our analysis found that non-muscle myosin II is enriched on SDPN-1 positive endosomes, with two non-muscle myosin II heavy chain isoforms acting in apparent opposition. Depletion of nmy-2 inhibited recycling like sdpn-1 mutants, while depletion of nmy-1 suppressed sdpn-1 mutant recycling defects, indicating actomyosin contractility in controlling recycling endosome function.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe the development of a new model system for Friedreichs Atax- ia (FA) using Dictyostelium discoideum. We investigated the conservation of function between humans and D. discoideum and showed that DdFXN can substitute the human version in the interaction and activation of the Fe-S assembly supercomplex. We edited the fxn locus and isolated a defective mutant, clone 8, which presents landmarks of frataxin deficiency, such as a decrease in Fe-S cluster-dependent enzymatic functions, growth rate reduction, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. In addition multicellular development is affected as well as grow on bacterial lawn.\n\nWe also assessed the rescuing capacity of DdFXN-G122V, a version that mimics a human variant present in some FA patients. While the expression of DdFXN-G122V rescues growth and enzymatic activity defects, as DdFXN does, multicellular development defects were only partially rescued\n\nThe results of the study suggest that this new model system offers a wide range of pos- sibilities to easily explore diverse phenotypes in FA and develop drug or treatment screenings for designing and evaluating therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "While advanced age has long been recognized as the greatest risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), the biological mechanisms behind this connection remain unclear. Previous work has demonstrated that chondrocytes from older cadaveric donors have elevated levels of DNA damage as compared to chondrocytes from younger donors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a decline in DNA repair efficiency is one explanation for the accumulation of DNA damage with age, and to quantify the improvement in repair with activation of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6). Using an acute irradiation model to bring the baseline level of all donors to the same starting point, this study demonstrates a decline in repair efficiency during aging when comparing chondrocytes from young ([&le;]45 years old), middle-aged (50-65 years old), or older (>70 years old) cadaveric donors with no known history of OA or macroscopic cartilage degradation at isolation. Activation of SIRT6 in middle-aged chondrocytes with MDL-800 (20 M) improved the repair efficiency, while inhibition with EX-527 (10 M) inhibited the rate of repair and the increased the percentage of cells that retained high levels of damage. Treating chondrocytes from older donors with MDL-800 for 48 hours significantly reduced the amount of DNA damage, despite this damage having accumulated over decades. Lastly, chondrocytes isolated from the proximal femurs of mice between 4 months and 22 months of age revealed both an increase in DNA damage with aging, and a decrease in DNA damage following MDL-800 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Heritable expression of developmental genes is mediated by autoregulating transcription factor networks (TFNs) and Polycomb repressive chromatin silencing complexes (PRCs). Whether the mammalian Polycomb pathway mediates DNA sequence-independent epigenetic memory at genes being activated by TFNs remains unknown. Here, we show that, in human cells, newly induced Polycomb silencing at initially active developmental genes can be inherited for many cell divisions. However, when Polycomb silencing is similarly induced near ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes, it is not heritable. Inheritance requires the recognition of CG-rich DNA by a Polycomb accessory protein, MTF2/PCL2, the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone H2A lysine 119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub1) activities of PRC1 and PRC2, and their associated positive feedback (read-write). In the absence of H3K27me3, H2AK119ub1 can mediate inheritance of silencing by a mechanism that requires the recognition of H2AK119ub1 by the variant Polycomb Repressive Complex 1. These findings indicate that inheritance of Polycomb silencing in human cells (1) depends on sequence features of developmental gene loci (2) requires PRC1 and H2AK119ub1, and (3) can be mediated by PRC1-H2AK119ub1 independently of H3K27me3.",

In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological information and possession status of neutralizing antibodies in patients with BI using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses (SARS-CoV-2pv). Analysis of 44 specimens diagnosed with COVID-19 after two or more vaccinations showed high inhibition of infection by 90% or more against the Wuhan strain and the Alpha and Delta variants of pseudotyped viruses in 40 specimens. In contrast, almost no neutralizing activity was observed against the Omicron BA.1 variant. Many cases without neutralizing activity or BI were immunosuppressed individuals. The results of this study show that BI occurs even when there are sufficient neutralizing antibodies in the blood due to exposure to close contacts at the time of infection. Thus, even after vaccination, sufficient precautions must be taken to prevent infection.",

The present study uses the new, ninth release of the species hypotheses of the UNITE database to show that species discovery through environmental sequencing vastly outpaces traditional, Sanger sequencing-based efforts in a strongly increasing trend over the last five years. Our findings challenge the present stance of the mycological community - that \"the code\" works fine and that these complications will somehow sort themselves out given enough time and a following wind - and suggest that we should be discussing not whether to allow DNA-based descriptions (typifications) of species and by extension higher ranks of fungi, but what the precise requirements for such DNA-based typifications should be. We submit a tentative list of such criteria for further discussion. However, the present authors fear that no waves of change will be lapping the shores of mycology for the foreseeable future, leaving the overwhelming majority of extant fungi without formal names and thus scientific and environmental agency. It is not clear to us who benefits from that, but neither fungi nor mycology are likely to be on the winning side.",

This cross talk between metabolism and epigenome impacts numerous biological processes including development and tumorigenesis.

We developed a data-driven screen to discover moonlighting metabolites by constructing a histone PTM-metabolite interaction network using global chromatin profiles, metabolomics, and epigenetic drug sensitivity data from over 600 cancer cell lines. Our ensemble statistical learning approach uncovered metabolites that are predictive of histone PTM levels and epigenetic drug sensitivity. We experimentally validated synergistic and antagonistic interactions between histone deacetylase and demethylase inhibitors with the metabolites kynurenic acid, pantothenate, and 1-methylnicotinamide. We apply our approach to track metabolic-epigenetic interactions during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Overall, our data-driven approach reveals extensive metabolic-epigenetic interactions than previously thought, with implications for reversing aberrant epigenetic alterations and enhancing epigenetic therapies.",

    "abstract": "We present an updated version of the Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions (PrePPI) webserver which predicts PPIs on a proteome-wide scale. PrePPI combines structural and non-structural clues within a Bayesian framework to compute a likelihood ratio (LR) for essentially every possible pair of proteins in a proteome; the current database is for the human interactome. The structural modeling (SM) clue is derived from templatebased modeling and its application on a proteome-wide scale is enabled by a unique scoring function used to evaluate a putative complex. The updated version of PrePPI leverages AlphaFold structures that are parsed into individual domains. As has been demonstrated in earlier applications, PrePPI performs extremely well as measured by receiver operating characteristic curves derived from testing on E. coli and human protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases. A PrePPI database of ~1.3 million human PPIs can be queried with a webserver application that comprises multiple functionalities for examining query proteins, template complexes, 3D models for predicted complexes, and related features (https://honiglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI). PrePPI is a state-of- the-art resource that offers an unprecedented structure-informed view of the human interactome.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=68 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530276v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b66c15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@71d817org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@21d984org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f6f55_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of energy homeostasis is expected to lead to effective treatment to obesity and metabolic diseases1,2. However, energy homeostasis is a complicated process largely controlled by neuronal circuits in the hypothalamus and brainstem3-5, whereas reward and motivation of food intake are mainly controlled by the limbic regions6 and cerebral cortex7,8. Although the limbic and hypothalamus connection like Nucleus Accumbens shell (NAcSh) to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) circuit has been reported to regulate feeding9,10, the neuron subtypes involved, and how do the humoral/neuronal signals coordinate to direct feeding behavior remain unknown. Here we show that the projection from dopamine receptor D1(Drd1)- and Serpinb2- expressing subtype to leptin receptor (LepR) expressing neurons in LH modulates food seeking and consumption. We demonstrate that the Serpinb2+ neuronal activity is dynamically modulated during feeding. Conversely, chemo/optogenetics-mediated modulation of Serpinb2+ neurons bidirectionally regulate food seeking and consumption. Importantly, circuitry stimulation revealed the NAcShSerpinb2[-&gt;]LHLepR projection controls refeeding and overcomes leptin-mediated feeding suppression. Ablation of NAcShSerpinb2 neurons could decrease body weight. Together, our study reveals a molecularly distinct accumbal-to-lateral hypothalamic neural circuit that controls internal state-dependent food consumption, which provides a promising therapeutic target for anorexia and obesity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is the study of the dynamical patterns emerging from brain function. We introduce EiDA (Eigenvector Dynamic Analysis), a method that losslessly reduces the dimension of the instantaneous connectivity patterns of a time series to characterise dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC). We apply EiDA to investigate the signatures of ageing on brain network dynamics in a longitudinal dataset of resting-state fMRI in ageing rats.\n\nPrevious dFC approaches have relied on the concept of the instantaneous phase of signals, computing the instantaneous phase-locking matrix (iPL) and its eigenvector decomposition. In this work, we fully characterise the eigenstructure of the iPL analytically, which provides a 1000 fold speed up in dFC computations.\n\nThe analytical characterization of the iPL matrix allows us to introduce two methods for its dynamic analysis. 1) Discrete EiDA identifies a discrete set of phase locking modes using k-means clustering on the decomposed iPL matrices. 2) Continuous EiDA provides a 2-dimensional \"position\" and \"speed\" embedding of the matrix; here, dFC is conceived as a continuous exploration of this 2-D space rather than assuming the existence of discrete brain states.\n\nWe apply EiDA to a cohort of 48 rats that underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at four stages during the course of their lifetime. Using Continuous and Discrete EiDA we found that brain phase-locking patterns become less intense and less structured with ageing. Using information theory and metastability measures derived from the properties of the iPL matrix, we see that ageing reduces the available functional repertoire postulated to be responsible for flexible cognitive functions and overt behaviours, and reduces the area explored in the embedding space.",

There is significant variation in age at onset and severity of symptoms highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyzed cell and pathology composition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains using the semi-automated workflow (QUINT); which we expanded to allow for nonlinear refinement of brain atlas-registration, and quality control assessment of atlas-registration and brain section integrity. Near global age-related increases in microglia, astrocyte, and amyloid-beta accumulation were measured, while regional variation in neuron load existed among strains. Furthermore, hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses were combined with bulk RNA- sequencing results to demonstrate the relationship between cell composition and gene expression. Overall, the additional functionality of the QUINT workflow delivers a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models.",

ILC3 are considered to be primarily tissue-resident cells, seeding the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic stages. However, the mechanisms through which ILC3 are maintained within these tissues are poorly understood. Here, we report that ILC3 are minimally replenished from bone marrow precursors in healthy adult mice, persist in the tissue for extended periods of time in the gut, and display a quiescent phenotype. Strikingly, despite robustly producing cytokines, LTi-like ILC3 remain non-proliferative during enteric bacterial infection. Survival of LTi-like ILC3 was found to be dependent upon the balance of the metabolic activity required to drive effector function and anti-apoptotic programs. Notably, the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 was required for the survival of LTi-like ILC3 but was rendered partially dispensable if mitochondrial respiration was inhibited. Together we demonstrate LTi-like ILC3 are a quiescent-like population that persists independently of haematopoietic replenishment to survive within the tissue microenvironment.",

Here, we used a multispecies occupancy model (MSOM) to understand mammalian habitat use patterns across a mosaic of tropical dry forest in Colombia and elucidate whether forest cover is more important than its integrity and other landscape configuration metrics. Surprisingly, our data suggest that none of the factors (including forest integrity) had a substantial effect on the mean community habitat use or species richness of mammals across the Montes de Maria, and there was no strong evidence to suggest any particular pattern in the distribution of functional groups in the landscapes. However, the percentage of forest cover was substantially important for herbivores, and consistently showed a moderate effect on the entire community, carnivores guild some individual species. There was high variability in the responses of each species to the examined variables that hinder us from broad generalizations, but in general, we also detected a moderate positive effect of forest cover in both diet specialists and generalists and species with small home ranges. Omnivores, on the other hand, tended to occupy more heterogeneous sites (moderate positive effects). The lack of substantial effects on most species and the absence of threatened species across this anthropogenic landscape suggests that the current community is composed of species tolerant to habitat modifications, but not only diet generalist species. This is most likely due to a long filtering process caused by land use transformation. However, our results highlight the relevance of conserving forest patches regardless of their level of modification or any other landscape attributes for maintaining assemblages of mammals.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases pose a remarkable threat to wildlife, and their incidence will likely be further exacerbated due to climate change. Therefore, developing new, preferably minimally invasive yet effective monitoring systems is crucial for conservation. We investigated whether the occurrence of white-nose disease (WND), a fungal disease of hibernating bats, can be predicted using local climatic conditions and host community composition at hibernation sites. In addition, we used our model to predict the current worldwide potential global distribution of white-nose disease, revealing areas that may be under risk if the pathogen is introduced, and further applied our model to a climate change scenario to illuminate how the potential global distribution of the disease may shift in the future. To achieve this, we fitted a logistic regression model using open-source climate data (mean annual surface temperature (MAST), annual precipitation) and hibernation site census data from 441 hibernacula across Europe. We then applied our model to the current global climatic conditions, as well as a climate change scenario for years 2061-2080, to illuminate the current and future potential global distribution of the disease. We discovered a positive association between the occurrence of WND and Myotis emarginatus, M. myotis/blythii, and M. mystacinus/brandtii, whereas Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros were negatively associated with the disease. In addition, we were able to detect several areas in the southern hemisphere, that are likely to be at risk if the pathogen is introduced, and demonstrate that climate change may cause a remarkable shift in the distribution range of the disease. We further show that MAST can be used to predict the occurrence of WND, with the highest probability in areas where MAST was 8.3 {degrees}C. Our results highlight the importance of environmental factors in controlling the manifestation of disease in localities where both the pathogen and suitable hosts are present, and the massive impact climate change could have in reshaping and expanding the geographic range where WND can occur.",

    "abstract": "Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes Flexible Hinge Domain Containing 1 (SMCHD1) is a non-canonical member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein family involved in the regulation of chromatin structure, epigenetic regulation, and transcription. Mutations in SMCHD1 cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2), a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, believed to be caused by aberrant expression of DUX4 in muscle cells. Here we suggest a new role for SMCHD1 as a regulator of alternative splicing in various cell types. We demonstrate how SMCHD1 mutations cause splicing alterations of DNA Methyltransferase 3 Beta DNMT3B which can lead to hypomethylation, DUX4 expression, and FSHD pathogenesis. Analyzing RNA-seq data from muscle biopsies of FSHD2 patients and Smchd1 knocked out cells, we found that hundreds of genes were mis-spliced upon loss of SMCHD1. At least 20% of mis-spliced genes were associated with abnormalities of the musculature. Moreover, we show that mis-spliced exons tend to be bound by SMCHD1, and these exons demonstrate a slower elongation rate, suggesting SMCHD1 binding promotes exon exclusion by slowing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Specifically, we discovered that SMCHD1 mutations promote the splicing of the DNMT3B1 isoform of DNMT3B by perturbing RNAPII elongation rate and recruitment of the splicing factor RBM5. The mis-splicing of DNMT3B leads to hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region and DUX4 overexpression. These results suggest that mis-splicing by SMCHD1 may play a major role in FSHD2 pathogenesis by promoting the mis-splicing of different targets including DNMT3B, and highlight the potential for targeting splicing as a therapeutic strategy for this disorder.\n\nSignificance statementOur study sheds light on how the loss of SMCHD1 drives the pathogenesis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. We found that SMCHD1 mutations led to changes in splicing of hundreds of genes, 20% of which were related to muscle abnormalities. We found that SMCHD1 tends to bind mis-spliced exons and that its binding slows down the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II often leading to the exclusion of the exon. One of these targets is DNA Methyltransferase 3 Beta (DNMT3B), and we show that the isoform promoted by SMCHD1 mutations leads to hypomethylation of a repeat region near DUX4 and to DUX4 overexpression, a known cause for FSHD. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder, and suggest splicing modulation as a therapeutic strategy for FSHD.",

In Drosophila larvae and many other systems, short behavioral experiments have been successful in characterizing rapid responses to a range of stimuli at the population level. However, the lack of long-term continuous observation makes it difficult to dissect comprehensive behavioral dynamics of individual animals and how behavior (and therefore the nervous system) develops over time. To allow for long-term continuous observations in individual fly larvae, we have engineered a robotic instrument that automatically tracks and transports larvae throughout an arena. The flexibility and reliability of its design enables controlled stimulus delivery and continuous measurement over developmental time scales, yielding an unprecedented level of detailed locomotion data. We utilize the new systems capabilities to perform continuous observation of exploratory behavior over a duration of six hours with and without a thermal gradient present, and in a single larva for over 30 hours. Long-term free-roaming behavior and analogous short-term experiments show similar dynamics that take place at the beginning of each experiment. Finally, characterization of larval thermotaxis in individuals reveals a bimodal distribution in navigation efficiency, identifying distinct phenotypes that are obfuscated when only analyzing population averages.",

    "abstract": "The bootstrap method is based on resampling alignments and re-estimating trees. Felsensteins bootstrap proportions (FBP) is the most common approach to assess the reliability and robustness of sequence-based phylogenies. However, when increasing taxon-sampling (i.e., the number of sequences) to hundreds or thousands of taxa, FBP tends to return low supports for deep branches. The Transfer Bootstrap Expectation (TBE) has been recently suggested as an alternative to FBP. TBE is measured using a continuous transfer index in [0,1] for each bootstrap tree, instead of the {0,1} index used in FBP to measure the presence/absence of the branch of interest. TBE has been shown to yield higher and more informative supports, without inducing falsely supported branches. Nonetheless, it has been argued that TBE must be used with care due to sampling issues, especially in datasets with high number of closely related taxa. In this study, we conduct multiple experiments by varying taxon sampling and comparing FBP and TBE support values on different phylogenetic depth, using empirical datasets. Our results show that the main critic of TBE stands in extreme cases with shallow branches and highly unbalanced sampling among clades, but that TBE is still robust in most cases, while FBP is inescapably negatively impacted by high taxon sampling. We suggest guidelines and good practices in TBE (and FBP) computing and interpretation.",

In-line with these inherent aggressive characteristics, only a subset of patients show a clinical response to the standard of care therapies, thereby highlighting the need for a more personalized treatment approach. In this study, we comprehensively unraveled the intra-patient response heterogeneity and intrinsic aggressive nature of PDAC on bulk and single-organoid resolution. We leveraged a fully characterized PDAC organoid panel (N=8) and matched our artificial intelligence-driven, live-cell organoid image analysis with retrospective clinical patient response. In-line with the clinical outcomes, we identified patient-specific sensitivities to the standard of care therapies (gemcitabine-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) using a growth rate-based and normalized drug response metric. Moreover, the single-organoid analysis was able to detect resistant as well as invasive PDAC organoid clones, which was orchestrates on a patient, therapy, drug, concentration and time-specific level. Furthermore, our in vitro organoid analysis indicated a strong correlation with the matched patient progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the current, conventional drug response readouts. This work not only provides valuable insights on the response complexity in PDAC, but it also highlights the potential applications (extendable to other tumor types) and clinical translatability of our approach in drug discovery and the emerging era of personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRadiotherapy treatment is a mainstay of cancer treatments including for thoracic malignancies such as lung or breast cancer. Cardiac toxicity is a recognised long-term complication of thoracic radiotherapy which persists despite improvements in therapeutic modalities. The mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets that could provide cardiac protection in the context of radiation therapy remain incompletely understood. Here we investigated early and late cardiac toxicity following irradiation using the A/J mouse model to identify potential molecular drivers.\n\nMethodsSingle doses of irradiation of either 13 or 15 Gy were delivered to female A/J mice aged 6 - 8 weeks using a SmART-PLAN system. ECG traces and analysis were performed on anaesthetised mice. Cardiac tissue was harvested up to 32 weeks following irradiation for histological analysis and second-harmonic imaging microscopy.\n\nResultsCardiac RT resulted in cardiac conductivity abnormalities including prolonged QTc interval. Additionally, an increase in pericardial and perivascular fibrosis was noted with a marked increase in pericardial fibrosis at 15 Gy compared to 13 Gy. Persistent DNA damage response was identified in cardiomyocytes at 7 days post irradiation and polarisation of cardiac-infiltrating macrophages towards a CD206+ M2-like phenotype at the same timepoint.\n\nConclusionsOur data introduce the A/J mouse as a novel model for the study of physiologically relevant early and late cardiac toxicities following irradiation. Early events that could contribute to long term toxicities include persistent DNA damage response and repolarisation of macrophages, further investigation of which could identify potential future cardioprotective therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes encode plant-specific transcription factors which have been found to be conserved in green plants lineage. SPL proteins are important regulators of diverse plant developmental processes in bryophytes and vascular plants. In our study, we took advantage of available genome sequences of representatives of each bryophyte clade to investigate the relationships of SPL genes between bryophytes and model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana. We have identified four SPL genes in each of the two hornworts species, Anthoceros agrestis and Anthoceros punctatus, what is similar to the set of SPL genes present in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Thus, the analyzed hornworts and liverwort genomes encode a minimal set of SPL genes in comparison to other land plants that may resemble an archetype of SPL genes present in the ancestor of land plants. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of four SPL groups. Comparative gene structure analysis showed that SPLs share similar exon-intron organization within the same phylogenetic group with some exceptions in hornworts. While we have identified conserved protein motifs between bryophytes and Arabidopsis in three out of four phylogenetic groups, the motif content differed explicitly in the fourth group. Since current understanding of SPL genes mostly arises from seed plants, the presented comparative and phylogenetic analysis will provide better understanding of SPL gene family from the representatives of the oldest living land plants.",

This ribonuclease activity was observed for all three HbPR10 splicing isoforms and is abolished by boiling. However, inclusion of a negative control proteins revealed that ribonuclease activity rather originates from RNases that are copurified from E. coli, which are overlooked by traditionally used controls such as heat inactivation, RNase inhibitors and negative control proteins obtained with different procedures. The crucial control proteins are missing for at least nine reports on ribonuclease activity in PR-10 proteins published by different laboratories worldwide, indicating that proper controls are frequently overlooked in ribonuclease assays.

    "abstract": "Resting fMRI studies have identified intrinsic spinal cord activity, which forms organised motor (ventral) and sensory (dorsal) resting-state networks. However, to facilitate the use of spinal fMRI in, for example, clinical studies, it is crucial to first assess the reliability of the method, particularly given the unique anatomical, physiological, and methodological challenges associated with acquiring the data. Here we demonstrate a novel implementation for acquiring BOLD-sensitive resting-state spinal fMRI, which was used to characterise functional connectivity relationships in the cervical cord and assess their test-retest reliability in 23 young healthy volunteers. Resting-state networks were estimated in two ways: (1) by extracting the mean timeseries from anatomically constrained seed masks and estimating voxelwise connectivity maps and (2) by calculating seed-to-seed correlations between extracted mean timeseries. Seed regions corresponded to the four grey matter horns (ventral/dorsal and left/right) of C5-C8 segmental levels. Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in the following ways: for each voxel in the cervical spine; each voxel within an activated cluster; the mean signal as a summary estimate within an activated cluster; and correlation strength in the seed-to-seed analysis. Spatial overlap of clusters derived from voxelwise analysis between sessions was examined using Dice coefficients. Following voxelwise analysis, we observed distinct unilateral dorsal and ventral organisation of cervical spinal resting-state networks that was largely confined in the rostro-caudal extent to each spinal segmental level, with more sparse connections observed between segments (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.003, threshold-free cluster enhancement with 5000 permutations). Additionally, strongest correlations were observed between within-segment ipsilateral dorso-ventral connections, followed by within-segment dorso-dorsal and ventro-ventral connections. Test-retest reliability of these networks was mixed. Reliability was poor when assessed on a voxelwise level, with more promising indications of reliability when examining the average signal within clusters. Reliability of correlation strength between seeds was highly variable, with highest reliability achieved in ipsilateral dorso-ventral and dorso-dorsal/ventro-ventral connectivity. However, the spatial overlap of networks between sessions was excellent. We demonstrate that while test-retest reliability of cervical spinal resting-state networks is mixed, their spatial extent is similar across sessions, suggesting that these networks are characterised by a consistent spatial representation over time.",

    "abstract": "Background and purposeCerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are characterized by early white matter (WM) changes, whose pathological underpinnings are yet poorly understood. CADASIL is a monogenic and archetypal SVD, providing an ideal model for investigating these changes. Here, we used multicompartment microscopic diffusion imaging and relaxometry to elucidate microstructural changes underlying early WM abnormalities in CADASIL.\n\nMethodsWe acquired diffusion MRI data with a multiple-shell Q-space sampling strategy, and relaxometry T1 and T2 data, with a 160 and 80-m isotropic resolution respectively, ex vivo, in CADASIL and control mice. Diffusion datasets were computed with the Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging model to extract the neurite density index, the extracellular free water and the orientation dispersion index. Relaxometry datasets were computed with a 3-compartment myelin water imaging model to extract the myelin content. MRI metrics were compared between CADASIL and control mice using voxel and WM tract-based analyses and with electron microscopy analysis.\n\nResultsWM in CADASIL mice displayed a widespread reduction in general fractional anisotropy, a large increase in extracellular free water, a reduction in the myelin content, but no reduction in neurite density. Electron microscopy analysis showed a {bsim}2-fold increase in the extracellular spaces and an elevation of the g-ratio indicative of myelin sheath thinning in CADASIL WM.\n\nConclusionOur findings suggest that accumulation of interstitial fluid and myelin damage are 2 major factors underlying early WM changes in CADASIL. Advanced diffusion MRI and relaxometry are promising approaches to decipher the underpinnings of WM alterations in SVDs.",

    "abstract": "Making a decision and reporting your confidence in the accuracy of that decision are thought to reflect a similar mechanism: the accumulation of evidence. Previous research has shown that choices and reaction times are well accounted for by a computational model assuming noisy accumulation of evidence until crossing a decision boundary (e.g., the drift diffusion model). Decision confidence can be derived from the amount of evidence following post-decision evidence accumulation. Currently, the stopping rule for post-decision evidence accumulation is underspecified. Inspired by recent neurophysiological evidence, we introduce additional confidence boundaries that determine the termination of post-decision evidence accumulation. If this conjecture is correct, it implies that confidence judgments should be subject to the same strategic considerations as the choice itself, i.e. a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. To test this prediction, we instructed participants to make fast or accurate decisions, and to give fast or carefully considered confidence judgments. Results show that our evidence accumulation model with additional confidence boundaries successfully captured the speed-accuracy tradeoffs seen in both decisions and confidence judgments. Most importantly, instructing participants to make fast versus accurate decisions influenced the decision boundaries, whereas instructing participants to make fast versus careful confidence judgments influenced the confidence boundaries. Our data show that the stopping rule for confidence judgments can be well understood within the context of evidence accumulation models, and that the computation of decision confidence is under strategic control.",

    "abstract": "AimRecently, the rise in Staphylococcal infection incidence accompanied by a rise of antibiotic-resistant strains is a major threat to public health. In this study, mechanisms leading to the occurrence of high-level multidrug-resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strains after fluoroquinolone (FQ) exposure were investigated.\n\nMethodologySerially exposing S. aureus ATCC 29213 to ciprofloxacin (CIP), ofloxacin (OFL), or levofloxacin (LEV) at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) for 12 days was performed to obtain S. aureus -1 strains and culturing for another 10 days without antibiotics to obtain S. aureus-2 strains. The genomic alterations in FQ-exposed strains were reached using whole genome sequencing and target sequencing. The expressions of efflux-related genes, alternative sigma factors, and genes involved in FQ resistance were evaluated using RT-qPCR.\n\nResultsAfter serial FQ exposure, we observed a strong and irreversible increase of MICs to all applied FQs, i.e 32 to 128 times in all S. aureus-1 and remained 16 to 32 times in all S. aureus-2. WGS indicated 10 significant mutations including 2 deletions, 1 insertion, and 7 missense mutations that occur in all S. aureus-1 and -2 but not in initial strain. The FQ target, GrlA, was also mutated (R570H) in all S. aureus-1 and -2 which can partly explain the development of FQ resistance over the FQ exposure. Besides, FQ exposure also resulted in overexpression of genes encoding for (1) efflux pumps and their regulator (norA, norB, norC, and mgrA); (2) alternative sigma factors (sigB and sigS); (3) acetyltransferase (rimI); (4) methicillin resistance (fmtB); and (5) hypothetical protein BJI72_0645.\n\nConclusionThe mutations occurred in the FQ-target sequence were associated with high-level FQ resistance while the activation of efflux pump systems and post-translational proteins played an important role in the emergence of MDR in S. aureus.\n\nAuthor summaryAntimicrobial resistance is a major public health problem worldwide. Multiple studies have been performed to understand how bacteria develops resistance during the antibiotic therapy in vitro and in vivo. Here we revealed how Staphylococcus aureus, a stubborn human pathogen, changed its genome and expression of important genes in responding with sub-MIC exposure to flouroquinolone antibiotics. Mutations were found in the target of flouroquinolones such as GrlA (R570H) and interestingly in some hypothetical regions which may be important for gene expression regulation. We have observed an marked overexpression of genes encoding for (1) efflux pumps and their regulator (norA, norB, norC, and mgrA); (2) alternative sigma factors (sigB and sigS); (3) acetyltransferase (rimI); (4) methicillin resistance (fmtB); and (5) hypothetical protein BJI72_0645 in all exposed strains. Importantly, the expression change still remained when the bacteria were no longer exposed to the antibiotics. This study is important to understand response of S. aureus to flouroquinolone and how it obtains the resistance phenotype under antibiotic exposure.",

Conventional methods used to investigate habitat use are time consuming, and detectability of cryptic species is often insufficient. Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based approaches now provide an alternative for ecosystems monitoring and assessment. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, such methods have never been applied to investigate habitat use at a fine scale in a continuous wetland environment. Here, we used an eDNA metabarcoding approach to characterize the breeding habitat use of local amphibian species in a wet meadow expanse along the southern shore of Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland. We retrieved DNA from six out of the seven species expected to be present. We tested the influence of six abiotic environmental variables on overall species communities as well as individual species occurrences. We showed that the main factor structuring species communities was water temperature, and that the distribution of three amphibian species was associated with several environmental variables. Our results indicate that the eDNA approach is a promising tool to study species ecology at a small scale in continuous wetland habitats.",

However, the inter-organ signaling mechanisms that relay nutrient status to modulate reproductive output are poorly understood. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to establish the Integrated Stress response (ISR) transcription factor, Atf4, as a fat tissue metabolic sensor which instructs oogenesis. We demonstrate that Atf4 regulates the lipase Brummer to mediate yolk lipoprotein synthesis in the fat body. Depletion of Atf4 in the fat body also blunts oogenesis recovery after amino acid deprivation and re-feeding, suggestive of a nutrient sensing role for Atf4. We also discovered that Atf4 promotes secretion of a fat body-derived neuropeptide, CNMamide, which modulates neural circuits that promote egg-laying behavior (ovulation). Thus, we posit that ISR signaling in fat tissue acts as a \"metabolic sensor\" that instructs female reproduction: directly, by impacting yolk lipoprotein production and follicle maturation, and systemically, by regulating ovulation.",

To advance our understanding of how fish react to unsteady flows, it is necessary to intercept the pressure signals sensed by their lateral line system. In this study, the authors propose a new, non-invasive method for reconstructing the instantaneous pressure field around a swimming fish from 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The method uses a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to predict an optimized solution for the velocity and pressure fields that satisfy in an [L]2 sense both the Navier Stokes equations and the constraints put forward by the measurements. The method was validated using a direct numerical simulation of a swimming mackerel, Scomber scombrus, and was applied to empirically obtained data of a turning zebrafish, Danio rerio. The results demonstrate that when compared to traditional methods that rely on directly integrating the pressure gradient field, the PINN is less sensitive to the spatio-temporal resolution of the velocity field measurements and provides a more accurate pressure reconstruction, particularly on the surface of the body.",

Conventional optical imaging techniques for mapping biomolecular profiles with differential staining and labeling methods are cumbersome. Different types of cellular components exhibit distinctive characteristic absorption spectra across a wide wavelength range. By virtue of this property, a lab-made wide-band optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (wbOR-PAM) system, which covers wavelengths from the ultraviolet and visible to the shortwave infrared regions, was designed and developed to capture multiple cellular components in 300-m-thick brain slices at nine different wavelengths without repetitive staining and complicated processing. This wbOR-PAM system provides abundant spectral information. A reflective objective lens with an infinite conjugate design was applied to focus laser beams with different wavelengths, avoiding chromatic aberration. The molecular components of complex brain slices were probed without labeling. The findings of the present study demonstrated a distinctive absorption of phospholipids, a major component of the cell membrane, brain, and nervous system, at 1690 nm and revealed their precise distribution with microscopic resolution in a mouse brain, for the first time. This novel imaging modality provides a new opportunity to investigate important biomolecular components without either labeling or lengthy specimen processing, thus, laying the groundwork for revealing cellular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in machine learning have greatly facilitated the design of proteins with improved properties. However, accurately assessing the contributions of an individual or multiple amino acid mutations to overall protein stability to select the most promising mutants remains a challenge. Knowing the specific types of amino acid interactions that improve energetic stability is crucial for finding favorable combinations of mutations and deciding which mutants to test experimentally. In this work, we present an interactive workflow for assessing the energetic contributions of single and multi-mutant designs of proteins. The energy breakdown guided protein design (ENDURE) workflow includes several key algorithms, including per-residue energy analysis and the sum of interaction energies calculations, which are performed using the Rosetta energy function, as well as a residue depth analysis, which enables tracking the energetic contributions of mutations occurring in different spatial layers of the protein structure. ENDURE is available as a web application that integrates easy-to-read summary reports and interactive visualizations of the automated energy calculations and helps users selecting protein mutants for further experimental characterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in identifying the mutations in a designed polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-degrading enzyme that add up to an improved thermodynamic stability. We expect that ENDURE can be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of protein design and optimization.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory has been highly valuable in studying frequency-dependent selection and growth between competing cancer phenotypes. We study the connection between the type of competition as defined by properties of the game, and the convexity of the treatment response function. Convexity is predictive of differences in the tumors response to treatments with identical cumulative doses delivered with different variances. We rely on a classification of 2 x 2 games based on the signs of  dilemma strengths, containing information about the kind of selection through the games equilibrium structure. With the disease starting in one game class, we map the type of effects treatment may have on the game depending on dosage and the implications of treatment convexity. Treatment response is a linear function of dose if the game is a prisoners dilemma, coordination, or harmony game and does not change game class, but may be convex or concave for anti-coordination games. If the game changes class, there is a rich variety in response types including convex-concave and concave-convex responses for transitions involving anti-coordination games, response discontinuity in case of a transition out of coordination games, and hysteresis in case of a transition through coordination games.",

    "abstract": "Broomrapes (Phelipanche and Orobanche spp.) and witchweeds (Striga and Alectra spp.) are obligate root parasitic weeds responsible for major crop yield losses worldwide. Their success in agricultural landscapes is attributable to their ability to produce thousands of long-lived minute seeds that coordinate their germination with the presence of nearby hosts by perceiving host-derived strigolactones. Nevertheless, the processes underlying the alleged decade(s)-long persistence in the field are understudied. Using an accelerated seed aging method coupled to germination and ELISA bioassays, we report that the loss of seed viability and germinability along seed aging is accompanied by a decrease in both strigolactone sensitivity and global DNA methylation. Our results also suggest that seeds of broomrapes are longer-lived than those of witchweeds. Overall, this study deems to initiate further research into how epigenetic mechanisms contribute to alterations in seed viability in parasitic weeds, and how seed aging influence seed responses to their environment.",

The fine mapping of promoters (transcription start sites [TSS]) and enhancers (divergent amplifying segments of the genome local to TSS) in different populations of cattle across a wide diversity of tissues provides information to locate and understand the genomic drivers of breed- and tissue-specific phenotypes. To this aim we used Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) sequencing to define TSS and their co-expressed short-range enhancers (<1kb) in the ARS-UCD1.2_Btau5.0.1Y reference genome (1000bulls run9) and analysed tissue- and population specificity of expressed promoters. We identified 51,295 TSS and 2,328 TSS-Enhancer regions shared across the three populations (Holstein, Charolais x Holstein and Kinsella beef composite [KC]). In addition, we performed a comparative analysis of our cattle dataset with available data for seven other species to identify TSS and TSS-Enhancers that are specific to cattle. The CAGE dataset will be combined with other transcriptomic information for the same tissues generated in the BovReg project to create a new high-resolution map of transcript diversity across tissues and populations in cattle. Here we provide the CAGE dataset and annotation tracks for TSS and TSS Enhancers in the cattle genome. This new annotation information will improve our understanding of the drivers of gene expression and regulation in cattle and help to inform the application of genomic technologies in breeding programmes.",

The theta band EROs were elicited in visual and auditory oddball (target detection) tasks and measured by EEG recording. Associations were found to vary with age, sex, task modality (auditory or visual), and scalp locality. Seven of the twenty-one muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic SNPs studied in the analysis, from CHRM2, CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNB4, had significant effects on theta band EROs with considerable age spans for some sex-modality combination. No SNP-age-modality combination had significant effects in the same direction for males and females. Results suggest that nicotinic receptor associations are stronger before age 18, while muscarinic receptor associations are stronger after age 18.",

    "abstract": "A fitness landscape is a biological analogue of a physical landscape, in which each genotype occupies a location whose elevation corresponds to fitness. Theoretical models predict that rugged fitness landscapes with multiple peaks should impair Darwinian evolution, because natural selection prevents evolving populations from traversing the valleys that lie between peaks. Experimental tests of this prediction are very limited. Here we combine CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and deep sequencing to map the fitness landscape of more than 260000 genotypes of the E. coli folA gene in an environment harboring the antibiotic trimethoprim. The folA gene encodes the key metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is also a target of this antibiotic. With 514 mostly low fitness peaks, the DHFR fitness landscape is rugged. Despite this ruggedness, its highest fitness peaks are easily accessible to evolving populations. Fitness-increasing paths to high fitness peaks are abundant, and individual peaks have large basins of attractions. The basins of different peaks overlap, which renders the outcome of adaptive evolution highly contingent on chance events. In sum, ruggedness need not be an obstacle to Darwinian evolution but can reduce its predictability. If true in general, evolutionary biology and other fields of sciences in which landscapes play an important role may have to re-appraise the complexity of optimization problems on realistic landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Most genomic prediction methods are based on assumptions of normality due to their simplicity, robustness, and ease of implementation. However, in plant and animal breeding, target traits are often collected as categorical data, thus violating the normality assumption, which could affect the prediction of breeding values and the estimation of crucial genetic parameters. In this study, we examined the main challenges of categorical phenotypes in genomic prediction and genetic parameter estimation using mixed models, Bayesian approaches, and machine learning techniques. We evaluated these approaches using simulated and real breeding data sets. Our contribution in this study is a five-fold demonstration: (i) collecting data using an intermediate number of categories (1 to 3 and 1 to 5 scores) is the best strategy, even considering errors and subjectivity associated with visual scores; (ii) in the context of genomic prediction, Linear Mixed Models and Bayesian Linear Regression Models are robust to the normality violation, but marginal gains can be achieved when using Bayesian Ordinal Regression Models (BORM) and Random Forest Classification technique; (iii) genetic parameters are better estimated using BORM; (iv) our conclusions using simulated data are also applicable to real data in autotetraploid blueberry, which can guide breeders decisions; and (v) a comparison of continuous and categorical phenotype testing for complex traits with low heritability, found that investing in the evaluation of 600-1000 categorical data points with low error, when it is not feasible to collect continuous phenotypes, is a strategy for improving predictive abilities. Our findings suggest the best approaches for effectively using categorical traits to explore genetic information in breeding programs, and highlight the importance of investing in the training of evaluator teams and in high-quality phenotyping.\n\nKey messageAn approach for handling categorical data with potential errors and subjectivity in scores was evaluated in simulated and blueberry recurrent selection breeding schemes to assist breeders in their decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Prestin responds to transmembrane voltage fluctuations by changing its cross-sectional area, a process underlying the electromotility of outer hair cells and cochlear amplification. Prestin belongs to the SLC26 family of anion transporters yet is the only member capable of displaying electromotility. Prestins voltage-dependent conformational changes are driven by the putative displacement of residue R399 and a set of sparse charged residues within the transmembrane domain, following the binding of a Cl- anion at a conserved binding site formed by amino termini of the TM3 and TM10 helices. However, a major conundrum arises as to how an anion that binds in proximity to a positive charge (R399), can promote the voltage sensitivity of prestin. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find that prestin displays an unstable anion-binding site, where folding of the amino termini of TM3 and TM10 is coupled to Cl- binding. This event shortens the TM3-TM10 electrostatic gap, thereby connecting the two helices such that TM3-anion-TM10 is pushed upwards by forces from the electric field, resulting in reduced cross-sectional area. These folding events upon anion-binding are absent in SLC26A9, a non-electromotile transporter closely related to prestin. We also observe helix fraying at prestins anion-binding site but cooperative unfolding of multiple lipid-facing helices, features that may promote prestins fast electromechanical rearrangements. These results highlight a novel role of the folding equilibrium of the anion-binding site, and helps define prestins unique voltage-sensing mechanism and electromotility.",

It is a powerful method for genome engineering, although it is prone to off-target effects and has limited targeting scope. Transcription activator-like effector (TALE) -based tools which allow longer recognition sequences than do CRISPR/Cas9 systems, can also be used for targeted C-to-T base editing. Here, we describe a method that efficiently achieved targeted C-to-T substitutions in Arabidopsis nuclear genes using cytidine deaminase fused to a TALE DNA-binding domain (TALECD). We used a single pair of TALEs with a novel TALE-repeat unit that can recognize all four DNA bases, especially to allow for variations in the third base of codons in homologous genes. This targeting strategy makes it possible to simultaneously base edit almost identical sites in multiple isoforms of a gene while suppressing off-target substitutions.",

TEAD1/2/3/4 are all present in SCs, but YAP/TAZ strongly favors TEAD1. It promotes myelination by both positively and negatively regulating SC proliferation, enabling Krox20/Egr2 to upregulate myelin proteins, and upregulating the cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes FDPS and IDI1. We also show stage-dependent redundancy of TEAD1 and that non-myelinating SCs have a unique requirement for TEAD1 to enwrap nociceptive axons in Remak bundles.

The average daily load of ARGs to WWTPs was about 1.21 x 1020 copies/d, and a total of 1.44 x 1018 copies/d was discharged to the environment across the entire city. Interestingly, no daily variations were observed in ARG richness, abundance, and community composition. Stochastic processes were the main force determining the assembly of ARG communities, with their relative importance ranked in the order of influent (INF) > effluent (EFF) > activated sludge (AS). Further analyses indicated that bacteria and ARGs from upstream treatment units played an increasingly dominant role in shaping ARG communities in AS and EFF, respectively, suggesting the importance of mass-immigration of bacteria and ARGs from the source on ARG transport in wastewater treatment units.

    "abstract": "A recently described member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is Mycobacterium orygis, which can cause disease primarily in animals but also in humans. Although M. orygis has been reported from different geographic regions around the world, due to a lack of proper identification techniques, the contribution of this emerging pathogen to the global burden of zoonotic tuberculosis is not fully understood. In the present work, we report single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis using whole genome sequencing (WGS) that can accurately identify M. orygis and differentiate it from other members of MTBC species. WGS-based SNPs analysis was performed for 61 isolates from different Provinces in Canada that were identified as M. orygis. A total of 56 M. orygis sequences from the public databases were also included in the analysis. Several unique SNPs in gyrB, PPE55, Rv2042c, leuS, mmpL6, and mmpS6 genes were used to determine their effectiveness as genetic markers for the identification of M. orygis. To the best of our knowledge, five of these SNPs, viz., gyrB277 (A[-&gt;]G), gyrB1478 (T[-&gt;]C), leuS1064 (A[-&gt;]T), mmpL6486 (T[-&gt;]C), and mmpS6334 (C[-&gt;]G) are reported for the first time in this study. Our results also revealed several SNPs specific to other species within MTBC. The phylogenetic analysis shows that studied genomes were genetically diverse and clustered with M. orygis sequences of human and animal origin reported from different geographic locations. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the high confidence identification of M. orygis from MTBC species based on WGS data, which can be useful for reference and diagnostic laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Deoxygenation can be fatal for many marine animals; however, some sponge species are tolerant of hypoxia and anoxia. Indeed, two sponge species, Eurypon sp. 2 and Hymeraphia stellifera, survive seasonal anoxia for months at a time. To understand their tolerance mechanisms, we performed differential gene expression analyses on the sponges, their mitochondria and their microbial symbionts under in situ conditions of normoxia, hypoxia and anoxia. Each species possessed a unique microbiome, but the microbiomes of each species were dominated by a species-specific Thaumarchaeon and a Gammaproteobacterium. Holobiont gene expression was species and oxygen level dependent, though there were some shared interspecific responses to deoxygenation. In general, few changes occurred in the expression of sponge metabolic genes as a function of oxygenation level, indicating that they may remain metabolically active under anoxia. However, ATP synthesis genes were significantly upregulated under hypoxia when compared to normoxia, and genes for DNA replication were downregulated. Mitochondrial gene expression was effectively unchanged under both hypoxia and anoxia. Nevertheless, both anoxia and hypoxia caused upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), indicating cellular level adaptations to deoxygenation stress. A meta-analysis demonstrated that sponge transcriptional responses to anoxia were distinct from those displayed by other invertebrates while dormant, rejecting the hypothesis of sponge dormancy under anoxia. Thaumarchaeota symbionts also upregulated stress response genes in hypoxia, while maintaining expression of oxygen-dependent metabolic pathways under hypoxia and anoxia. Gammaproteobacteria symbionts showed relatively few noteworthy changes in gene expression in response to anoxia but decreased metabolic gene expression in hypoxia. There was no clear evidence of upregulated anaerobic respiration in the transcriptomes of the sponge holobionts under anoxia or hypoxia. The tolerance of some sponges to prolonged anoxia warrants further investigation and could give them an advantage in future oceans following climate change as well as in ancient oceans when oxygen concentrations were lower than at present.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala is a well-studied invasive nematode parasite of amphibians. However, there are several outstanding questions about R. pseudosphaerocephala that are best answered using genomic data. This species differs phenotypically across its invasive range. These differences are challenging to interpret because this species is part of a complex that is diverse and cryptic in its home-range, and we do not know how many species from this complex originally colonised Australia. For this reason, it is unknown whether the phenotypic differences across the introduced range are due to intraspecific differentiation between populations or due to the presence of multiple species. In addition, there is little consensus in the placement of Rhabdiasidae family within the phylum Nematoda, making it difficult to perform comparative analyses with other nematodes. Within this paper, we assemble a reference genome for R. pseudosphaerocephala, the first assembly of any Rhabdiasidae species. We then use resequencing data to address outstanding questions about this species. Specifically, we combine population genetic and phylogenetic analyses to determine that there is likely only a single R. pseudosphaerocephala lineage within Australia, and identify that the invasive range population is closely related to home rage isolates that infect similar host species. We present compelling evidence for a genetic bottleneck following introduction to Australia and genetic differentiation occurring between invasive range populations. We then use genome-scale phylogenomic analysis to place the Rhabdiasidae family in the suborder Rhabditina. Ultimately, this paper brings the study of Rhabdiasidae into the genomic era, and sheds light on its ancient and modern evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "The optimization of genetically engineered biological constructs is a key step to deliver high-impact biotechnological applications. The use of high-throughput DNA assembly methods allows the construction of enough genotypic variants to successfully cover the target design space. This, however, entails extra workload for researchers during the screening stage of candidate variants. Despite the existence of commercial colony pickers, their high price excludes small research laboratories and budget-adjusted institutions from accessing such extensive screening capability. In this work we present COPICK, a technical solution to automatize colony picking in an open-source liquid handler Opentrons OT-2. COPICK relies on a mounted camera to capture images of regular Petri dishes and detect microbial colonies for automated screening. COPICKs software can then automatically select the best colonies according to different criteria (size, color and fluorescence) and execute a protocol to pick them for further analysis. Benchmark tests performed for E. coli and P. putida colonies delivers a raw picking performance over pickable colonies of 82% with an accuracy of 73.4% at an estimated rate of 240 colonies/h. These results validate the utility of COPICK, and highlight the importance of ongoing technical improvements in open-source laboratory equipment to support smaller research teams.",

    "abstract": "Biofilm production plays a clinically significant role in the pathogenicity of many bacteria, limiting our ability to apply antimicrobial agents and contributing in particular to the pathogenesis of chronic infections. Bacteriophage depolymerases, leveraged by these viruses to circumvent biofilm mediated resistance, represent a potentially powerful weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria. Such enzymes are able to degrade the extracellular matrix that is integral to the formation of all biofilms and as such would allow complementary therapies or disinfection procedures to be successfully applied. In this manuscript, we describe the development and application of a machine learning based approach towards the identification of phage depolymerases. We demonstrate that on the basis of a relatively limited number of experimentally proven enzymes and using an amino acid derived feature vector that the development of a powerful model with an accuracy on the order of 90% is possible, showing the value of such approaches in the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) compose a tumor-initiating and -propagating population, remarkably vulnerable to any variation in the stability and integrity of the endolysosomal compartment. Previous work showed that the expression and activity of the paracaspase MALT1 control GSC viability via lysosomal abundance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By combining RNAseq with proteome-wide label-free quantification, we now report that MALT1 repression in patient-derived GSCs alters the cholesterol homeostasis, which aberrantly accumulates in lysosomes. This failure in cholesterol supply culminates in cell death and autophagy defects, which can be partially reverted by providing exogenous membrane-permeable cholesterol to GSCs. From a molecular standpoint, targeted lysosome proteome analysis unraveled that NPC lysosomal cholesterol transporters were exhausted when MALT1 was held in check. Accordingly, we found that hindering NPC1 and NPC2 phenocopies MALT1 inhibition. This supports the notion that GSC fitness relies on lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis.",

Bacterial cellulose is a promising sustainable leather alternative, on account of its material properties, low infrastructure needs and biodegradability. However, for alternative textiles like bacterial cellulose to be fully sustainable, alternative ways to dye textiles need to be developed alongside alternative production methods. To address this, we here use genetic engineering of Komagataeibacter rhaeticus to create a bacterial strain that grows self-dyeing bacterial cellulose. Dark black pigmentation robust to material use is achieved through melanin biosynthesis in the bacteria from recombinant tyrosinase expression. Melanated bacterial cellulose production can be scaled up for the construction of prototype fashion products, and we illustrate the potential of combining engineered self-dyeing with tools from synthetic biology, via the optogenetic patterning of gene expression in cellulose-producing bacteria. With this work, we demonstrate that combining genetic engineering with current and future methods of textile biofabrication has the potential to create a new class of textiles.",

AD has been associated with poor vitamin D nutrition, which is correlated with low mood and impaired cognitive performance in older people. The impact of vitamin D on the insulin signaling pathway in AD is not well known. Hence, this study was to explore the effects of cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) on the expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, pAkt (Ser473), and GLUT3 in the sporadic AD rat model. The rats were induced to develop sporadic AD by intraperitoneal administration of Scopolamine. The downregulation expression of IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, pAkt (Ser473) and GLUT3 may lead to impaired insulin signaling which is associated with the development of AD. All these data were compared to Saline-treated control rats. However, cholecalciferol treatment in AD rats may improve memory performance by increasing the expression of insulin signaling proteins and hence ameliorates impaired insulin signaling. All these data were compared to Scopolamine-induced AD rats and sunflower oil-treated rats. Therefore, cholecalciferol treatment may be an alternative approach for the treatment of AD.",

To study the dynamics of sulfate assimilation pathway we created gene knockout strains of important enzymes in the sulfate assimilation pathway of M. smegmatis. We stimulated these mutants with methionine, pro-filed the changes in intracellular thiols, applied external oxidative stress, and monitored the associated intracellular redox potentials (EMSH). These experiments revealed that when M. smegmatis cultures are supplemented with methionine intracellular levels surged. When those cells were challenged with hydrogen peroxide the M. smegmatis cells showed increased intracellular oxidative potentials and took prolonged time to revert back normal redox balance state when compared to non-methionine containing controls.

    "abstract": "The symptoms of malaria occur during the blood stage of infection, when the parasite replicates within human red blood cells. The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, selectively invades reticulocytes in a process which requires an interaction between the ectodomain of the human DARC receptor and the Plasmodium vivax Duffy-binding protein, PvDBP. Previous studies have revealed that a small helical peptide from DARC binds to region II of PvDBP (PvDBP-RII). However, it is also known that sulphation of tyrosine residues on DARC affects its binding to PvDBP and these residues were not observed in previous structures. We have therefore determined the structure of PvDBP-RII bound to sulphated DARC peptide, showing that a sulphate on tyrosine 41 binds to a charged pocket on PvDBP-RII. We use molecular dynamics simulations, affinity measurements and growth-inhibition experiments in parasites to confirm the importance of this interaction. We also reveal the epitope for vaccine-elicited growth-inhibitory antibody, DB1. This provides a complete understanding of the binding of PvDBP-RII to DARC and will guide the design of vaccines and therapeutics to target this essential interaction.",

    "abstract": "Sewage contamination of freshwater occurs in the form of raw waste or as effluent (at varying levels of treatment) from wastewater treatment plants. Global management of this contamination has focused on detection of live sewage-indicating bacteria in freshwater, drinking water, and irrigation systems. While raw waste (animal and human) and underfunctioning WWTPs can introduce live enteric bacteria to freshwater systems, most WWTPs, even when operating correctly, do not remove bacterial genetic material from treated waste, resulting in the addition of concentrated enteric bacterial DNA (molecular contamination), including antibiotic resistance genes, into water columns and sediment of freshwater systems. In freshwater systems with both raw and treated waste inputs, then, there will be increased interaction between live sewage-associated bacteria (untreated sewage) and molecular contamination (from both untreated and treated wastewater effluent), with the potential of increasing antibiotic resistance in the live bacterial populations. To evaluate this understudied interaction between molecular and bacterial contamination in the freshwater environment, we conducted a three-month field-based study of sewage-associated bacteria and genetic material in water and sediment in a freshwater tributary of the Hudson River (NY, USA) that supplies drinking water and receives treated and untreated wastewater discharges from several municipalities. Using both molecular and culture-based bacterial analyses, we demonstrate both treated and untreated sewage influences on water and sediment bacterial communities in this tributary, and water-sediment exchanges of enteric bacteria and associated genetic material with rain events. Furthermore, treated sewage effluent on this waterway serves as a concentrated source of int1 (antibiotic resistance) genes, which appear to collect in the sediments below the outfall along with fecal indicating bacteria, serving as a possible genetic exchange substrate and a source for future molecular and bacterial water contamination.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/530486v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1abdb61org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cfc550org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a33647org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40829e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIIn a model freshwater system used both as drinking water and wastewater disposal,\nC_LIO_LIBacterial and genetic material differ between water and sediment compartments\nC_LIO_LILive bacteria\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Many cellular processes are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Bacterial pathogens can regulate eukaryotic proteolysis through the delivery of proteins with de-ubiquitinating (DUB) activities. The obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis secretes Cdu1 (ChlaDUB1), a dual deubiquitinase and Lys-acetyltransferase, that promotes Golgi remodeling and survival of infected host cells presumably by regulating the ubiquitination of host and bacterial proteins. Here we determined that Cdu1s acetylase but not its DUB activity is important to protect Cdu1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. We further identified three C. trachomatis proteins on the pathogen-containing vacuole (InaC, IpaM, and CTL0480) that required Cdu1 s acetylase activity for protection from degradation and determined that Cdu1 and these Cdu1-protected proteins are required for optimal egress of Chlamydia from host cells. These findings highlight a non-canonical mechanism of pathogen-mediated protection of virulence factors from degradation after their delivery into host cells and the coordinated regulation of secreted effector proteins.",

    "abstract": "Phytopathogenic fungi must adapt to the different environmental conditions found during infection and avoid the immune response of the plant. For these adaptations, fungi must tightly control gene expression, allowing sequential changes in transcriptional programs. In addition to transcription factors, chromatin modification is used by eukaryotic cells as a different layer of transcriptional control. Specifically, the acetylation of histones is one of the chromatin modifications with a strong impact on gene expression. Hyperacetylated regions usually correlate with high transcription and hypoacetylated areas with low transcription. Thus, histone deacetylases (HDACs) commonly act as repressors of transcription. One member of the family of HDACs is represented by sirtuins, which are deacetylases dependent on NAD+, and, thus, their activity is considered to be related to the physiological stage of the cells. This property makes sirtuins good regulators during environmental changes. However, only a few examples exist, and with differences in the extent of the implication of the role of sirtuins during fungal phytopathogenesis. In this work, we have performed a systematic study of sirtuins in the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis, finding Sir2 to be involved in the dimorphic switch from yeast cell to filament and pathogenic development. Specifically, the deletion of sir2 promotes filamentation, whereas its overexpression highly reduces tumor formation in the plant. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis revealed that Sir2 represses genes that are expressed during biotrophism development. Interestingly, our results suggest that this repressive effect is not through histone deacetylation, indicating a different target of Sir2 in this fungus.",

    "abstract": "1The generation of antigenic diversity, key for parasite virulence, has been investigated in the genus Plasmodium, mainly in Plasmodium falciparum. Cytogenetic and molecular studies have revealed that its subtelomeres are rich in antigenic gene families and undergo ectopic recombination. As a result, these families are highly variable and even species-specific. More recent analyses focused on the phylogenetic mapping of P. falciparum chromosomes with the bioinformatic tool PhyloChromoMap, showed that ectopic recombination of subtelomeres extends to all chromosomes. Although antigenic gene families have been described in subtelomeres of other Plasmodium species, the intensity of this mechanism in these species is still unclear. In this study, we investigated to what extent ectopic recombination of subtelomeres drives the generation of antigenic diversity in 19 Plasmodium species. To achieve this, we analyzed the profile of gene conservation in maps of all their chromosomes with PhyloChromoMap. Our results suggest that ectopic recombination of subtelomeres is more critical for the diversification of pir or rif/stevor genes than other antigenic gene families. Furthermore, its intensity varies among subgenera and was likely acquired and lost multiple times in the phylogeny of Plasmodium.",

Little is known about whether such maternal age effects vary among genotypes for a given species, however. We compared maternal age effects among four strains of rotifers in the Brachionus plicatilis species complex. For each strain, we measured lifespan, reproductive schedule, and lifetime reproductive output of offspring produced by young, middle-aged, and old mothers. We found unexpected variability among strains in the magnitude and direction of maternal age effects on offspring life history traits. In one strain, offspring of young mothers lived 20% longer than offspring of old mothers, whereas there were no significant effects of maternal age on lifespan for the other strains. Across strains, advanced maternal age had positive effects, negative effects, or no effect on lifetime reproductive output. For all but one strain, older mothers produced offspring that had higher maximum daily reproduction early in life. Maternal age effects appear to be genetically determined traits, not features of life history strategy or due to accumulation of age-related damage in the germline. Investigating intraspecific variability is critical for understanding the ubiquity of maternal age effects and their role in the evolution of life history and aging.",

    "abstract": "Multi-subunit RNA Polymerases (msRNAPs) are responsible for transcription in all kingdoms of life. At the heart of these msRNAPs is an ultra-conserved active site domain, the trigger loop (TL), coordinating transcription speed and fidelity by critical conformational changes impacting multiple steps in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. Previous studies have observed several different types of genetic interactions between eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) TL residues, suggesting that the TLs function is shaped by functional interactions of residues within and around the TL. The extent of these interaction networks and how they control msRNAP function and evolution remain to be determined. Here we have dissected the Pol II TL interaction landscape by deep mutational scanning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II. Through analysis of over 15000 alleles, representing all single mutants, a rationally designed subset of double mutants, and evolutionarily observed TL haplotypes, we identify interaction networks controlling TL function. Substituting residues creates allele-specific networks and propagates epistatic effects across the Pol II active site. Furthermore, the interaction landscape further distinguishes alleles with similar growth phenotypes, suggesting increased resolution over the previously reported single mutant phenotypic landscape. Finally, co-evolutionary analyses reveal groups of co-evolving residues across Pol II converge onto the active site, where evolutionary constraints interface with pervasive epistasis. Our studies provide a powerful system to understand the plasticity of RNA polymerase mechanism and evolution, and provide the first example of pervasive epistatic landscape in a highly conserved and constrained domain within an essential enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulate multiple cellular responses, including the response to stress and cell differentiation, and are highly conserved across eukaryotes from yeast to humans. In yeast, the canonical activation of several MAPK pathways includes the interaction of the small GTPase Cdc42p with the p21-activated kinase (PAK) Ste20p. We recently found that the active conformation of Cdc42p is regulated by turnover, which impacts the activity of the pathway that regulates filamentous growth (fMAPK). Here, we show that Ste20p is turned over by the 26S proteasome. Ste20p was stabilized when bound to Cdc42p, presumably to sustain MAPK pathway signaling. Ste20p is a major conduit by which signals flow through the fMAPK pathway; however, by genetic approaches we also identified a Ste20p-independent branch of the fMAPK pathway. Ste20p-dependent signaling required the 14-3-3 proteins, Bmh1p and Bmh2p, while Ste20p-independent signaling required the fMAPK pathway adaptor and Cdc42p-interacting protein, Bem4p. Ste20p-independent signaling was inhibited by one of the GTPase-activating proteins for Cdc42p in the fMAPK pathway, Rga1p, which also dampened basal but not active fMAPK pathway activity. Finally, the polarity adaptor and Cdc42p-interacting protein, Bem1p, which also regulates the fMAPK pathway, interacts with the tetra-span protein Sho1p, connecting a sensor at the plasma membrane to a protein that regulates the GTPase module. Collectively, these data reveal new regulatory features surrounding a Rho-PAK module that may extend to other pathways that control cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Mediator of ERBB2-driven Cell Motility 1 (MEMO1) is an evolutionary conserved protein implicated in many biological processes; however, its primary molecular function remains unknown. Importantly, MEMO1 is overexpressed in many types of cancer and was shown to modulate breast cancer metastasis through altered cell motility.\n\nTo better understand the function of MEMO1 in cancer cells, we analyzed genetic interactions of MEMO1 using gene essentiality data from 1028 cancer cell lines and found multiple iron-related genes exhibiting genetic relationships with MEMO1. We experimentally confirmed several interactions between MEMO1 and iron-related proteins in living cells or in vitro, most notably, the iron transporters transferrin (TF), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), and mitoferrin-2 (SLC25A28), and the global iron response regulator IRP1 (ACO1). These interactions indicate that cells with high MEMO1 expression levels are hypersensitive to the disruptions in iron distribution. Our data also indicate that MEMO1 is involved in ferroptosis and is linked to iron supply to mitochondria.\n\nWe have found that purified MEMO1 binds iron with high affinity under redox conditions mimicking intracellular environment and solved MEMO1 structures in complex with iron and copper. Our work reveals that the iron coordination mode in MEMO1 is very similar to that of iron-containing extradiol dioxygenases, which also display a similar structural fold. We conclude that MEMO1 is an iron-binding protein that regulates iron homeostasis in cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) under stress is believed to be a key factor in neointima formation. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key enzyme for glycolysis, has been demonstrated to promote the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. However, the mechanism by which LDHA regulates this process is still unclear. Here we show that the crotonylation and mono-ubiquitination of LDHA are increased in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced proliferative VSMCs. Crotonylation at lysine 5 (K5) activates LDHA through tetramer formation to enhance lactate production and VSMCs growth. Mono-ubiquitination at K76 induces the translocation of LDHA into mitochondria, which promotes mitochondria fission and subsequent the formation of lamellipodia and podosomes, thereby enhancing VSMC migration and growth. Furthermore, the increase of crotonylation and ubiquitination were also observed in the carotid arteries of ligation injury mice. Deletion of LDHA K5 crotonylation or K76 mono-ubiquitination decreases ligation-induced neointima formation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism that combines VSMC metabolic reprogramming and behavioral abnormity through crosstalk between LDHA K5 crotonylation and K76 mono-ubiquitination.",

Here, using a new sample preparation methodology based on functionalised pristine graphene-coated grids, we solve the cryo-EM structure of the human large ribosomal subunit to a resolution of 1.67 [A]. The accurate assignment of water molecules, magnesium and potassium ions in our model highlights the fundamental biological role of ribosomal RNA methylation in harnessing unconventional carbon-oxygen hydrogen bonds to establish chemical interactions with the environment and fine-tune the functional interplay with tRNA. In addition, the structures of three translational inhibitors bound to the human large ribosomal subunit at better than 2 [A] resolution provide mechanistic insights into how three key druggable pockets of the ribosome are targeted and illustrate the potential of this methodology to accelerate high-throughput structure-based design of anti-cancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHypercholesterolemia (HC) has previously been shown to augment restenotic response in several animal models and humans. However, the mechanistic aspects of in-stent restenosis (ISR) on a hypercholesterolemic background, including potential augmentation of systemic and local inflammation precipitated by HC are not completely understood. CD47 is a transmembrane protein known to abort crucial inflammatory pathways. Our present studies have examined the interrelation between HC, inflammation, and ISR and investigated the therapeutic potential of stents coated with a CD47-derived peptide (pepCD47) in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit model.\n\nMethods and ResultsPepCD47 was immobilized on metal foil coupons and stents using polybisphosphonate coordination chemistry and pyridyldithio/thiol conjugation. The relative abundance of the surface-associated cells on bare metal (BM) and pepCD47 foils exposed to whole rabbit blood showed a 40% inhibition of cell attachment on pepCD47-modified surfaces. Likewise, cytokine expression analyzed in buffy coat-derived cells cultured over the BM and pepCD47-derivatized foils demonstrated a M2/M1 increase with pepCD47 coating. Hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic rabbit cohorts underwent bilateral implantation of BM and pepCD47 stents in the iliac location. Hypercholesterolemia increased neointimal growth in comparison with normocholesterolemic animals at 4 weeks post-stenting. These untoward outcomes were mitigated in the arteries of hypercholesterolemic rabbits treated with pepCD47-derivatized stents. Compared to NC animals, inflammatory cytokine immunopositivity and macrophage infiltration of peri-strut areas increased in HC group animals, and was attenuated in the arteries of hypercholesterolemic rabbits treated with pepCD47 stents.\n\nConclusionsAugmented inflammatory responses triggered by HC underlie severe ISR morphology in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Blockage of initial platelet and leukocyte attachment to stent struts through CD47 functionalization of stents mitigates pro-restenotic effects of HC.",

We quantitatively reproduce the experimentally known two-fold increase of bending stiffness upon incorporation of a DNA duplex into the DX motif, and find out that its stretching and twisting stiffness are only slightly influenced. To further describe the motif, we define four effective rigid bodies, each involving several base pairs flanking the Holliday junctions from the outside, and consider internal coordinates capturing relative displacement and orientation of the bodies. Time series of the coordinates from MD then yield the global structure of the DX motif and its stiffness in the harmonic approximation.",

Here we present Rolosense, a virus sensing platform that transduces the motion of synthetic DNA-based motors transporting 5-micron particles on RNA fuel chips. Motors and chips are modified with virus-binding aptamers that lead to stalling of motion. Therefore, motors perform a \"mechanical test\" of viral target and stall in the presence of whole virions which represents a unique mechanism of transduction distinct from conventional assays. Rolosense can detect SARS-CoV-2 spiked in artificial saliva and exhaled breath condensate with a sensitivity of 103 copies/mL and discriminates among other respiratory viruses. The assay is modular and amenable to multiplexing, as we demonstrated one-pot detection of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. As a proof-of-concept, we show readout can be achieved using a smartphone camera in as little as 15 mins without any sample preparation steps. Taken together, mechanical detection using Rolosense can be broadly applied to any viral target and has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening of circulating viruses.",

    "abstract": "The development of synthetic biological circuits that maintain functionality over application relevant timescales remains a significant challenge. Here, we employed synthetic overlapping sequences in which one gene is encoded or \"entangled\" entirely within an alternative reading frame of another gene. In this design, the toxin-encoding relE was entangled within ilvA, which encodes threonine deaminase, an enzyme essential for isoleucine biosynthesis. A functional entanglement construct was obtained upon modification of the ribosome binding site of the internal relE gene. Using this optimized design, we found that the selection pressure to maintain functional IlvA stabilized the production of burdensome RelE for over 130 generations, which compares favorably with the most stable kill-switch circuits developed to date. This stabilizing effect was achieved through a complete alteration of the mutational landscape such that mutations inactivating the entangled genes were disfavored. Instead, the majority of lineages accumulated mutations within the regulatory region of ilvA. By reducing baseline relE expression, these more  benign mutations lowered circuit burden, which suppressed the accumulation of relE inactivating mutations, thereby prolonging kill-switch function. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of sequence entanglement paired with an adaptive laboratory evolution campaign to increase the evolutionary stability of burdensome synthetic circuits.",

    "abstract": "1.1The human pathogen Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) produces a lifelong infection in the majority of the worlds population. While the generalities of alpha herpesvirus assembly and egress pathways are known, the precise molecular and spatiotemporal details remain unclear. In order to study this aspect of HSV-1 infection, we engineered a recombinant HSV-1 strain expressing a pH-sensitive reporter, gM-pHluorin. Using a variety of fluorescent microscopy modalities, we can detect individual virus particles undergoing intracellular transport and exocytosis at the plasma membrane. We show that particles exit from epithelial cells individually, not bulk release of many particles at once, as has been reported for other viruses. In multiple cell types, HSV-1 particles accumulate over time at the cell periphery and cell-cell contacts. We show that this accumulation effect is the result of individual particles undergoing exocytosis at preferential sites and that these egress sites can contribute to cell-cell spread. We also show that the viral membrane proteins gE, gI, and US9, which have important functions in intracellular transport in neurons, are not required for preferential egress and clustering in non-neuronal cells. Importantly, by comparing HSV-1 to a related alpha herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, we show that this preferential exocytosis and clustering effect is cell type-dependent, not virus dependent. This preferential egress and clustering appears to be the result of the arrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton, as virus particles co-accumulate at the same cell protrusions as an exogenous plus end-directed kinesin motor.\n\nImportanceAlpha herpesviruses produce lifelong infections of their human and animal hosts. The majority of people in the world are infected with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), which typically causes recurrent oral or genital lesions. However, HSV-1 can also spread to the central nervous system, causing severe encephalitis, and might also contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Many of the steps of how these viruses infect and replicate inside host cells are known in depth, but the final step, exiting from the infected cell, is not fully understood. In this study, we engineered a novel variant of HSV-1 that allows us to visualize how individual virus particles exit from infected cells. With this imaging assay, we investigated preferential egress site formation in certain cell types and their contribution to cell-cell spread of HSV-1.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant to many classes of antibiotics, reflecting the restrictive nature of its outer membrane and the action of its numerous efflux systems. However, the dynamics of compound uptake, retention and efflux in this bacterium remain incompletely understood. Here, we exploited the sensor capabilities of a Z-nucleotide sensing riboswitch to create an experimental system able to identify physicochemical and structural properties of compounds that permeate the bacterial cell, avoid efflux, and perturb the folate cycle or de novo purine synthesis. In a first step, a collection of structurally diverse compounds enriched in antifolate drugs was screened for ZTP riboswitch reporter activity in efflux-deficient P. aeruginosa, allowing us to identify compounds that entered the cell and disrupted the folate pathway. These initial hits were then rescreened using isogenic efflux-proficient bacteria, allowing us to separate efflux substrates from efflux avoiders. We confirmed this categorization by measuring intracellular levels of select compounds in the efflux-deficient and - proficient strain using high resolution LC-MS. This simple yet powerful method, optimized for high throughput screening, enables the discovery of numerous permeable compounds that avoid efflux and paves the way for further refinement of the physicochemical and structural rules governing efflux in this multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogen.\n\nImportanceTreatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections has become increasingly challenging. The development of novel antibiotics against this multi-drug resistant bacterium is a priority, but many drug candidates never achieve effective concentrations in the bacterial cell due due to its highly restrictive outer membrane and the action of multiple efflux pumps. Here, we develop a robust and simple reporter system in P. aeruginosa to screen chemical libraries and identify compounds that either enter the cell and remain inside, or enter the cell and are exported by efflux systems. This approach enables developing rules of compound uptake and retention in P. aeruginosa that will lead to more rational design of novel antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Viruses utilize several strategies to develop latent infection and evade host immune responses. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), a class of non-protein encoding RNA that regulates various cellular functions by interacting with RNA binding proteins, is a key factor for viral latency because of its lack of antigenicity. Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which belongs to the family Retroviridae, encodes the BLV-derived lncRNA AS1-S, which is a major transcript expressed in latently infected cells. We herein identified bovine hnRNPM, an RNA-binding protein located in the nucleus, as the binding partner for AS1-S using an RNA-protein pull-down assay. The pull-down assay using recombinant hnRNPM mutants showed that RNA recognition motif 1 and 2, located in the N-terminal region of bovine hnRNPM, are responsible for binding AS1-S. Furthermore, an RNA immunoprecipitation assay showed that introduction of AS1-S increased the number of mRNA that co-immunoprecipitated with bovine hnRNPM in MDBK cells. These results suggested that AS1-S could alter the interaction between hnRNPM and host mRNAs, potentially interfering with cellular functions during the initial phase of mRNA maturation in the nucleus. Since most of the identified mRNAs that exhibited increased binding to hnRNPM were correlated with the KEGG term \"Pathways in cancer\", AS1-S may affect proliferation and expansion of BLV-infected cells and contribute to tumor progression.\n\nImportanceBLV infects bovine B cells and causes malignant lymphoma, resulting in severe economic losses in the livestock industry. Due to its low incidence rate and long latent period, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression to lymphoma remain enigmatic. Several non-coding RNAs, such as miRNA and lncRNA, have recently been discovered in the BLV genome and the relationship between BLV pathogenesis and these non-coding RNAs is attracting attention. However, most of the molecular functions of these transcripts remain un-identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing a molecular function for the BLV-derived lncRNA AS1-S. The findings reported herein reveal a novel mechanism underlying BLV pathogenesis that could provide important insights for not only BLV research but also comparative studies of retroviruses.",

In addition to drug resistance, therapeutic innovation is hindered by our limited knowledge of the mechanisms used by C. auris to evade immunity and establish infection. Here we show that C. auris escapes phagocytic containment and kills macrophages, and demonstrate that the mechanisms rely on metabolic regulation. We found that C. auris-infected macrophages undergo immunometabolic reprogramming and increase glycolysis but this does not lead to the expected antimicrobial responses, as macrophages fail to activate IL-1{beta} cytokine and curb C. auris growth. Further analysis showed that C. auris relies on its own metabolic capacity to egress from macrophages, cause macrophage metabolic stress and cell death, and establish infection in vivo. We identified a transcriptional regulator of C. auris metabolism and macrophage evasion, and further show that, contrary to several other pathogens, C. auris-induced macrophage metabolic dysfunction and death fail to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Consequently, inflammasome-dependent antimicrobial responses remain inhibited throughout infection. Our findings establish a pivotal role for metabolic regulation in enabling C. auris to eliminate macrophages while remaining immunologically silent to ensure its own survival.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDA subgroup of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients suffer from recurrent, disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) skin infections, termed eczema herpeticum (EH), which can be life-threatening and contribute to AD morbidity. The pathobiology underlying ADEH is unknown.\n\nOBJECTIVETo determine transcriptional mechanisms of skin and immune system pathobiology that underlie ADEH disease.\n\nMETHODSWe performed whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing of non-lesional skin samples (epidermis, dermis) of AD patients with (ADEH+, n=15) and without (ADEH-, n=13) recurrent EH history, and healthy controls (HC, n=15). We also performed RNA-sequencing on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) collected from these participants and infected in vitro with HSV-1. Differential expression, gene set enrichment, and endotyping analyses were performed.\n\nRESULTSADEH+ disease was characterized by dysregulation in skin gene expression, which was limited in dermis (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]=14) and widespread in epidermis (DEGs=129). ADEH+-upregulated epidermal DEGs were enriched in type 2 cytokine (T2) (IL4R, CCL22, CRLF2, IL7R), interferon (CXCL10, ICAM1, IFI44, and IRF7), and IL-36{gamma} (IL36G) inflammatory pathway genes. At a person-level, all ADEH+ participants exhibited T2 and interferon endotypes and 87% were IL36G-high. In contrast, these endotypes were more variably expressed among ADEH- participants. ADEH+ patient skin also exhibited dysregulation in epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) genes within the LCE, S100, and SPRR families, which are involved in skin barrier function, inflammation, and antimicrobial activities. pDC transcriptional responses to HSV-1 infection were not altered by ADEH status.\n\nCONCLUSIONSADEH+ pathobiology is characterized by a unique, multi-faceted epidermal inflammation that accompanies dysregulation in the expression of EDC genes.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIAD patients with a history of recurrent EH exhibit molecular skin pathobiology that is similar in form, but more severe in degree, than in AD patients without this complication.\nC_LIO_LINon-lesional skin of ADEH+ patients concurrently exhibits excessive type 2 cytokine, interferon, and IL-36{gamma}-driven epidermal inflammation.\nC_LIO_LIExpression of these inflammatory skin endotypes among ADEH+ patients is associated with dysregulation in expression of epidermal differentiation complex genes involved in barrier function, inflammation, and antimicrobial activity.\nC_LI\n\nCapsule SummaryAD patients with a history of recurrent disseminated HSV-1 skin infections form a unique molecular skin endotype group that concurrently exhibits type 2 cytokine, interferon, and IL-36{gamma}-driven skin inflammation, accompanied by dysregulation in expression of epidermal differentiation complex genes involved in barrier function, inflammation, and antimicrobial activity.",

    "abstract": "Many species of plants and animals shift to higher altitudes in response to the ongoing climate warming. Such shifts of species distributions lead to the co-occurrence of species that have not previously lived in the same environment and allow the emergence of novel plant-animal interactions with potential implications for species diversity and community composition in mountain habitats. According to the enemy release hypothesis, the spread of plants in new geographic regions may be facilitated by the reduction of damage caused by natural enemies, such as herbivores. While the importance of this mechanism for the spread of invasive exotic species has been established, it is unclear whether the movement of plants uphill within their native region in response to increasing temperatures may be also facilitated by the reduction of herbivory at sites above their current upper altitudinal limit. In our study, we experimentally tested this hypothesis. We compared herbivory damage of six species of lowland plants grown in pots exposed to herbivores at their native sites in the lowland and at sites above their current upper altitudinal limit. As a control, we also measured herbivory damage of six plants growing naturally across the entire range of altitude. We found that lowland plants had reduced herbivory damage when they were moved to highland sites, while herbivory damage of species naturally growing at both altitudes did not differ. Changes of herbivory damage were modulated by leaf dry matter content and to a lesser degree also by specific leaf area and plant height. Our results provide support for the enemy release hypothesis in the novel context of altitudinal range shifts. We conclude that the reduction of herbivory damage may facilitate the spread of plants above their current upper altitudinal limit in response to increasing temperature.",

    "abstract": "Mutant KRAS regulates transposable element (TE) RNA and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, but it remains unclear whether diverse mutations in KRAS affect different TE RNAs throughout the genome. We analyzed the transcriptomes of 3D human lung cancer spheroids that harbor KRAS(G12C) mutations to determine the landscape of TE RNAs regulated by mutant KRAS(G12C). We found that KRAS(G12C) signaling is required for the expression of LINE- and LTR-derived TE RNAs that are distinct from TE RNAs previously shown to be regulated by mutant KRAS(G12D) or KRAS(G12V). Moreover, KRAS(G12C) inhibition specifically upregulates SINE-derived TE RNAs from the youngest Alu subfamily AluY. Our results reveal that TE RNA dysregulation in KRAS-driven lung cancer cells is mutation-dependent, while also highlighting a subset of young, Alu-derived TE RNAs that are coordinately activated with innate immunity genes upon KRAS(G12C) inhibition.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSex differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles have been found across multiple tissues. Skeletal muscle is one of the top tissues that underpin sex-based differences, yet there is limited research into whether there are sex differences in miRNA expression in skeletal muscle. Further, there is limited literature investigating potential differences between males and females in skeletal muscle miRNA expression following exercise, a well-known modulator of miRNA expression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sex on miRNA expression in skeletal muscle at baseline and after an acute bout of exercise.\n\nMethodsMiRNAs were measured using Taqman(R)miRNA arrays in skeletal muscle of 42 healthy participants from the GeneSMART study (24 males and 20 females aged 18-45 yrs). Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using mixed linear models adjusted for age. Experimentally validated miRNA gene targets enriched in skeletal muscle were identified in-silico. Over representation analysis was conducted to identify enriched pathways. TransmiR V.2 was used to identify transcription factor (TF)-miR regulatory networks using CHIP-derived data. We further profiled the effects of two sex-biased miRNAs overexpressed in human primary muscle cells lines derived from male and female donors to understand the transcriptome targeted by these miRNAs and investigate and potential sex-specific effects.\n\nResultsA total of 80 miRNAs were differentially expressed in skeletal muscle between the sexes, with 61 miRNAs responding differently to the exercise between the sexes. Sex-biased miRNA gene targets were enriched for muscle-related processes including proliferation and differentiation of the muscle cells and numerous metabolic pathways, suggesting that miRNAs are playing a role in programming sex differences in skeletal muscle. Over-expression of sex-biased miRNAs miRNA-30a and miRNA-30c resulted in profound changes to gene expression profiles that were partly specific to the sex of the cell donor in human primary skeletal muscle cells.\n\nConclusionWe found sex-differences in the expression profile of skeletal muscle miRNAs at baseline and in response to exercise. These miRNAs target regulatory pathways essential to skeletal muscle development and metabolism, suggesting that miRNAs play a profound but highly complex role in programming sex-differences in the skeletal muscle phenotype.",

    "abstract": "The subgingival microbiome has been implicated in several oral and systemic diseases, such as periodontitis, arthritis, and Alzheimers disease. However, subgingival sampling is challenging and cannot be readily performed outside of primary care facilities. In order to support global, diverse, direct-to-participant clinical research studies, we developed a novel method of sampling the subgingival microbiome by rotationally swabbing the supragingival area, which we named subgingival-P (for proxy) samples. To validate this method, we sampled and metatranscriptomically analyzed subgingival and subgingival-P samples of three different teeth in 20 individuals. The subgingival-P samples were comparable to the subgingival samples in the relative abundances of microorganisms and microbial gene expression levels. Our data demonstrate that the novel method of collecting and analyzing the subgingival-P samples can act as a proxy for the subgingiva, paving the way for large and diverse studies investigating the role of the subgingival microbiome in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Among the 16 two-component systems (TCSs) in the opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, only WalKR is essential. Like orthologous systems in other Bacillota, S. aureus WalKR controls autolysins involved in peptidoglycan remodelling and is therefore intimately involved in cell division. However, despite the importance of WalKR in S. aureus, the basis for its essentiality is not understood and the regulon poorly defined. Here, we defined a consensus WalR DNA-binding motif and the direct WalKR regulon by using functional genomics, including ChIP-seq, with a panel of isogenic walKR mutants that had a spectrum of altered activities. Consistent with prior findings, the direct regulon includes multiple autolysin genes. However, this work also revealed that WalR directly regulates at least five essential genes involved in lipoteichoic acid synthesis (ltaS); translation (rplK); DNA compaction (hup); initiation of DNA replication (dnaA, hup); and purine nucleotide metabolism (prs). Thus, WalKR in S. aureus serves as a polyfunctional regulator that contributes to fundamental control over critical cell processes by co-ordinately linking cell wall homeostasis with purine biosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, and DNA replication. Collectively, our findings address the essentiality of this locus and highlight the importance of WalKR as a bona fide target for novel anti-staphylococcal therapeutics.",
