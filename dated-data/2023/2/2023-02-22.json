    "abstract": "The mRNA-seq data analysis is a powerful technology for inferring information from biological systems of interest. Specifically, the sequenced RNA fragments are aligned with genomic reference sequences, and we count the number of sequence fragments corresponding to each gene for each condition. A gene is identified as differentially expressed (DE) if the difference in its count numbers between conditions is statistically significant. Several statistical analysis methods have been developed to detect DE genes based on RNA-seq data. However, the existing methods could suffer decreasing power to identify DE genes arising from overdispersion and limited sample size. We propose a new differential expression analysis procedure: heterogeneous overdispersion genes testing (DEHOGT) based on heterogeneous overdispersion modeling and a post-hoc inference procedure. DEHOGT integrates sample information from all conditions and provides a more flexible and adaptive overdispersion modeling for the RNA-seq read count. DEHOGT adopts a gene-wise estimation scheme to enhance the detection power of differentially expressed genes. DEHOGT is tested on the synthetic RNA-seq read count data and outperforms two popular existing methods, DESeq and EdgeR, in detecting DE genes. We apply the proposed method to a test dataset using RNAseq data from microglial cells. DEHOGT tends to detect more differently expressed genes potentially related to microglial cells under different stress hormones treatments.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is currently the most powerful technique for determining the structures of large protein complexes and assemblies. Picking single-protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs (images) is a key step in reconstructing protein structures. However, the widely used template-based particle picking process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though the emerging machine learning-based particle picking can potentially automate the process, its development is severely hindered by lack of large, high-quality, manually labelled training data. Here, we present CryoPPP, a large, diverse, expert-curated cryo-EM image dataset for single protein particle picking and analysis to address this bottleneck. It consists of manually labelled cryo-EM micrographs of 32 non-redundant, representative protein datasets selected from the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR). It includes 9,089 diverse, high-resolution micrographs ([~]300 cryo-EM images per EMPIAR dataset) in which the coordinates of protein particles were labelled by human experts. The protein particle labelling process was rigorously validated by both 2D particle class validation and 3D density map validation with the gold standard. The dataset is expected to greatly facilitate the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods for automated cryo-EM protein particle picking.

    "abstract": "In recent years, parasite conservation has become a globally significant issue. Because of this, there is a need for standardised methods for inferring population status and possible cryptic diversity. However, given the lack of molecular data for some groups, it is challenging to establish procedures for genetic diversity estimation. Therefore, universal tools, such as double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), could be useful when conducting conservation genetic studies on rarely studied parasites. Here, we generated a ddRADseq dataset that includes all three described Taiwanese horsehair worms (Phylum Nematomorpha), possibly one of the most understudied animal groups. Additionally, we produced data for a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) for said species. We used the COXI dataset in combination with previously published sequences of the same locus for inferring the effective population size (Ne) trends and possible population structure.\n\nWe found that a larger and geographically broader sample size combined with more sequenced loci resulted in a better estimation of changes in Ne. We were able to detect demographic changes associated with Pleistocene events in all the species. Furthermore, the ddRADseq dataset for Chordodes formosanus did not reveal a genetic structure based on geography, implying a great dispersal ability, possibly due to its hosts. We showed that different molecular tools can be used to reveal genetic structure and demographic history at different historical times and geographical scales, which can help with conservation genetic studies in rarely studied parasites.",

    "abstract": "The sucrose preference test is a popular test for anhedonia in the chronic unpredictable stress model of depression. Yet, the test does not always produce consistent results. Long food and water deprivation before the test, while often implemented, confounds the results by introducing unwanted drives in the form of hunger and thirst. We assessed the reliability of the test when only short or no fasting was used. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress that used no more than 6 hours of food and/or water deprivation before the test. Sweet consumptions, for stressed and control/antidepressant-treated animals, in 132 studies were pooled in a random effects model. We found a decrease in sweet consumption in stressed rats, compared to controls, that was halved when a non-caloric sweetener was used and significantly reduced when sucrose consumption was corrected for body weight. The effect was reversed when the stressed rats were treated with antidepressants. Methodological strategies meant to control for recognized sources of bias when conducting the test were often missing, and so was a clear and complete report of essential study information. Our results indicate that not only is food and water deprivation before the test unnecessary, but not recommended. Even in absence of long fasting, we found evidence of an additional effect on sweet consumption that is unrelated to anhedonia. Without properly controlling for non-hedonic drivers of consumption, the test is unreliable as a proxy measure of anhedonia. Strengthening the methodological rigor and addressing the confounding effect of metabolic factors in the sucrose preference test prevents misleading conclusions that harm the translatability of the associated research and perpetuates the use of animals for little gain.",

We divide the global human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network into smaller sub-networks, and quantify the potential effects of chemicals by statistically comparing their target and non-target gene sets. By combining 9607 PPI gene sets with 2658 chemicals, we created a pre-trained pool of SEMOs, which we then used to identify SEMOs related to Covid-19 severity using DNA methylation profiling data from two clinical cohorts. The nutraceutical-derived SEMO features provided an effective model for predicting Covid-19 severity, with an AUC score of 81% in the training data and 80% in the independent validation data. Our findings suggest that Vitamin D3, Lipoic Acid, Citrulline, and Niacin, along with their associated protein networks, particularly STAT1, MMP2, CD8A, and CXCL8 as hub nodes,could be used to effectively predict Covid-19 severity. Furthermore, the severity-associated SEMOs were found to be significantly correlated with CD4+ and monocyte cell proportions. These insights can be used to generate personalized nutraceutical regimes by ranking the relative severity risk associated with each SEMO. Thus, our pre-trained SEMO model can serve as a fundamental knowledge map when coupled with DNA methylation measurements, allowing us to simultaneously generate biomarkers, targets, re-purposing drugs, and nutraceutical interventions.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesIn healthy aging, the way people differently cope with cognitive and neural decline is influenced by the exposure to cognitively enriching life-experiences. Education is one of them, so that in general the higher the education the better the expected cognitive performance in aging. At the neural level, it is not clear yet whether education can differentiate resting state functional connectivity profiles and their cognitive underpinnings. Thus, with this study, we aimed to investigate whether the variable education allowed for a finer description of age-related differences in cognition and resting state FC.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed in 197 healthy individuals (137 young adults aged 20-35, and 60 older adults aged 55-80 from the publicly available LEMON database), a pool of cognitive and neural variables, derived from magnetic resonance imaging, in relation to education. Firstly, we assessed age-related differences, by comparing young and older adults. Then, we investigated the possible role of education in outlining such differences, by splitting the group of older adults based on their education.\n\nResultsIn terms of cognitive performance, older adults with higher education and young adults were comparable in language and executive functions. Interestingly, they had a wider vocabulary compared to young adults and older adults with lower education. Concerning functional connectivity, the results showed significant age- and education-related differences within three networks: the Visual-Medial, the Dorsal Attentional and the Default Mode network (DMN). For the DMN, we also found a relationship with memory performance, which strengthen the evidence that this network has a specific role in linking cognitive maintenance and FC at rest in healthy aging.\n\nDiscussionOur study revealed that education contributes to differentiate cognitive and neural profiles in healthy older adults. Also, the DMN could be a key network in this context, as it may reflect some compensatory mechanisms relative to memory capacities in older adults with higher education.",

    "abstract": "Various gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus plantarum, possess several enzymes that produce hydroxy fatty acids (FAs), oxo FAs, conjugated FAs, and partially saturated FAs from polyunsaturated FAs as secondary metabolites. Among these derivatives, we identified 10-oxo-cis-6,trans-11-octadecadienoic acid ({gamma}KetoC), a {gamma}-linolenic acid-derived enon FA, as the most effective immunomodulator, which inhibited the antigen-induced immunoactivation and the LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines. The treatment with {gamma}KetoC markedly increased the protein level of NRF2, a master transcription factor for antioxidant responses, and the mRNA level of Hmox1, a target gene of NRF2, in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Although {gamma}KetoC significantly suppressed the LPS-induced activation of control BMDCs, particularly the secretion of IL-12/23p40, the suppressive effects of {gamma}KetoC were reduced in Nrf2-/- BMDCs. GW9508, an agonist of GPR40/GPR120, inhibited the release of cytokines from LPS-stimulated BMDCs without activating the NRF2 pathway. We evaluated the role of NRF2 in the anti-inflammatory effects of {gamma}KetoC in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. The oral administration of {gamma}KetoC significantly reduced body weight loss, improved stool scores, and attenuated atrophy of the colon, in wild-type C57BL/6J and Nrf2+/- (C57BL/6N) mice with colitis. In contrast, the pathology of colitis was deteriorated in Nrf2-/- mice even with the administration of {gamma}KetoC.\n\nCollectively, the present results demonstrated the involvement of the NRF2 pathway in {gamma}KetoC-mediated anti-inflammatory responses.",

Here, we reported that RIPK1-deficient rats represented defects of human patients and were certified as a suitable disease model. Knocking out Ripk3 rather than Caspase-8 nearly completely corrected immunodeficiency disorders, developmental defects, and necroptosis in the thymus of RIPK1-deficient rats. However, inflammatory enteritis was still detected in either Ripk1/Ripk3-or Ripk1/Casp-8-double deficient rats and only rescued in Ripk1/Ripk3/Caspase-8-triple deficient rats, suggesting RIPK3 mediated necroptosis and Caspase-8 dependent apoptosis contribute in different part in RIPK1-deficient caused the syndrome. Moreover, RIPK1-deficient rat dermal fibroblasts (RDFs) showed sensitive necroptosis and impaired NF-{kappa}B activation, also reported in RIPK1-deficient human patients. And pharmacological inhibition of NF-{kappa}B activation could sensitize necroptosis of rat cells. Since mutations that damage NF-{kappa}B activation could cause immunodeficiency in human patients, it suggested that aberrantly activated necroptosis play a vital role in certain kinds of primary immunodeficiency syndromes and pharmacological inhibition of necroptosis could be a novel therapeutic strategy for those diseases.",

However, studies on the heterogeneity of secreted substances at the single-bacterial-cell level are challenging due to the small size, motility, and rapid proliferation of bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli. Here, we propose a microfluidic device to achieve an isolated culture of single bacterial cells and capture of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from individuals. The device has winding channels to trap single rod-shaped E. coli cells at their entrances. Isolated single mother cells grew constantly up to 24 h, while their daughter cells were removed by flow. The flow carried EVs of the trapped cells along the channel, whose surface was rendered positively charged to electrostatically capture negatively charged EVs, followed by staining with a lipophilic dye to detect EVs by microscopy. Our results underline that the amounts of segregated EVs vary among cells. Moreover, individual responses to perturbation using a membrane-perturbing antibiotic were observed in growth dynamics and EV secretion of living-alone bacteria. The proposed method can be applied to detect other secreted substances of interest, possibly paving the way for elucidating unknown heterogeneities in bacteria.",

Our experimental work reveals self-organized waves of greenness -- chloroplasts -- that propagate throughout the alga and anticipate the day-night light cycle. Using dynamical systems analysis we show that these waves are coupled to a self-sustained oscillator, and demonstrate their entrainment to light. Under constant conditions we find that light intensity affects the natural period and can drive transition to temporal disorder. We find also that the rate of development of organs, and their shape and size, depend on light intensity and its temporal distribution. The findings suggest the waves and their environmental control as a link among biological oscillators, metabolism and morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disorder and the leading cause of heart-related deaths in world. Increasing molecular targets have been discovered for CAD and CAD - related complications prognosis and therapy. However, there is still an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers. Therefore, we evaluated biomarkers that might help the diagnosis and treatment of CAD and CAD - related complications. We searched next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset (GSE202625) and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing CAD and normal control samples using DESeq2. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed using the g:Profiler online database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was plotted with IMEx interactome and visualized using Cytoscape. Module analysis of the PPI network was done using PEWCC1. MiRNA - hub gene regulatory network and TF - hub gene regulatory network analysis was performed to identify the hub genes, miRNAs and TFs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to predict the diagnostic effectiveness of the hub genes. A total of 118 DEGs (479 up regulated genes and 479 down regulated genes) were detected. The GO enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs most significantly enriched in cellular response to stimulus and biosynthetic process. The REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were most significantly enriched in immune system and eukaryotic translation elongation. PPI network, modules, miRNA - hub gene regulatory network and TF - hub gene regulatory network analysis demonstrated that EGR1, SIRT1, STAT1, LRRK2, HIF1A, CSNK2B, RPS3, RPS2, RPS4X and HDAC11 were the hub genes. On the whole, the findings of this study enhance our understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms of CAD and CAD-related complications, and provide potential targets for further research.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive of all primary brain tumours. Patients typically rely on radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) treatment and face a median survival of [~]14 months. Alterations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor gene (EGFR) are common in GB tumours, but therapies targeting EGFR have not shown significant clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the influence of the EGFR regulatory genome on GB cells, and identified novel EGFR enhancers located in an intronic region nearby the GB-associated SNP rs723527. Epigenomic perturbation of this regulatory region using CRISPR-based methods decreases EGFR expression and reduces the proliferative and invasive capacity of glioblastoma cells, while increasing their sensitivity to TMZ. The enhancer-perturbed GB cells also undergo a metabolic reprogramming in favour of mitochondrial respiration and present increased apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate how epigenomic perturbation of EGFR enhancers can ameliorate the aggressiveness of glioblastoma cells and enhance the efficacy of TMZ treatment.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEOur study demonstrates how CRISPR/Cas9-based perturbation of enhancers can be used to modulate the expression of key cancer genes, which can help improve the effectiveness of existing cancer treatments and potentially the prognosis of difficult-to-treat cancers such as glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "WHIRLY1 is a chloroplast-nucleus located DNA/RNA-binding protein with functions in development and stress tolerance. By overexpression of HvWHIRLY1 in barley, lines with a 10-and two lines with a 50-fold accumulation of the protein were obtained. In these lines, the relative abundance of the nuclear form exceeded that of the chloroplast form indicating that over-accumulating WHIRLY1 exceeded the amount that chloroplasts can sequester. Growth of the plants was shown to be compromised in a WHIRLY1 abundance-dependent manner. Over-accumulation of WHIRLY1 in chloroplasts had neither an evident impact on nucleoid morphology nor on the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. Nevertheless, oeW1 plants were found to be compromised in the efficiency of photosynthesis. The reduction in growth and photosynthesis was shown to be accompanied by a decrease in the levels of cytokinins and an increase in the level of jasmonic acid. Gene expression analyses revealed that already in non-stress conditions the oeW1 plants had enhanced levels of pathogen response (PR) gene expression indicating activation of constitutive defense. During growth in continuous light of high irradiance, PR1 expression further increased in addition to an increase in the expression of PR10 and of the gene encoding phenylalanine lyase (PAL), the key enzyme of salicylic acid biosynthesis in barley. The activation of defense gene expression in oeW1 plants coincided with an enhanced resistance towards powdery mildew, which in barley is independent of salicylic acid. Taken together, the results show that over-accumulation of WHIRLY1 in barley to levels of 10 or more, amplified the tradeoff between growth and stress resistance.",

    "abstract": "In light-limiting conditions, aerial organs of most plants reorient their growth towards the light to improve photosynthesis, through a process known as phototropism1-3. The blue light receptors phototropin control phototropic responses through light-induced protein kinase activity4. Current models posit that asymmetric activation of these sensory receptors across a unilaterally illuminated organ leads to asymmetric distribution of the growth hormone auxin ultimately leading to growth re-orientation4,5. However, the tissue properties required to generate a light gradient across the stem triggering phototropism remain unclear1. Here we show that inter-cellular air channels6,7 are required for an efficient phototropic response. These channels enhance light scattering (refraction and reflection) in Arabidopsis hypocotyls thereby enhancing the light gradient across the photo-stimulated organ. We identify an embryonically expressed ABC transporter that is required to keep air in inter-cellular spaces in seedlings and for efficient phototropism. Our work suggests that this transporter shapes cell wall properties to maintain air between cells. Moreover, we establish the functional importance of inter-cellular air channels in the hypocotyl for phototropism.",

    "abstract": "The hostile tumour microenvironment limits the efficacy of adoptive cell therapies. Activation of the Fas death receptor initiates apoptosis and disrupting these receptors could be key to increase CAR T-cell efficacy. We screened a library of Fas-TNFR proteins identifying several novel chimeras that not only prevented Fas ligand-mediated kill, but also enhanced CAR T-cell efficacy by signalling synergistically with the CAR. Upon binding Fas ligand, Fas-CD40 activated the NF-{kappa}B pathway, inducing greatest proliferation and IFN{gamma} release out of all Fas-TNFRs tested. Fas-CD40 induced profound transcriptional modifications, particularly genes relating to the cell cycle, metabolism, and chemokine signalling. Co-expression of Fas-CD40 with either 4-1BB- or CD28-containing CARs increased in vitro efficacy by eliciting maximal CAR T-cell proliferation and cancer target cytotoxicity, and enhanced tumour killing and overall mouse survival in vivo. Functional activity of the Fas-TNFRs were dependent on the co-stimulatory domain within the CAR, highlighting crosstalk between signalling pathways. Furthermore, we show that a major source for Fas-TNFR activation derives from CAR T cells themselves via activation-induced Fas ligand upregulation, highlighting a universal role of Fas-TNFRs in augmenting CAR T-cell responses. We have identified Fas-CD40 as the optimal chimera for overcoming Fas ligand-mediated kill and enhancing CAR T-cell efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The human complement system plays a crucial role in immune defense. However, its erroneous activation contributes to many serious inflammatory diseases. Since most unwanted complement effector functions result from C5 cleavage, development of C5 inhibitors, such as clinically approved monoclonal antibody Eculizumab, are of great interest. In this study, we developed and characterized two anti-C5 nanobodies, UNbC5-1 and UNbC5-2. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we determined a binding affinity of 120 pM for UNbC5-1 and 8 pM for UNbC5-2. Competition experiments determined that the two nanobodies recognize distinct epitopes on C5. Both nanobodies efficiently interfered with C5 cleavage in a human serum environment, as they prevented red blood cell lysis via membrane attack complexes (C5b-9) and the formation of chemoattractant C5a. The cryo-EM structure of UNbC5-1 and UNbC5-2 in complex with C5 revealed that the binding interfaces of UNbC5-1 and UNbC5-2 overlap with known complement inhibitors Eculizumab and RaCI3, respectively. UNbC5-1 binds to the MG7 domain of C5, facilitated by a hydrophobic core and polar interactions, and UNbC5-2 interacts with the C5d domain mostly by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, UNbC5-1 potently binds and inhibits C5 R885H, a genetic variant of C5, that is not recognized by Eculizumab. Altogether, we identified and characterized two different, high affinity nanobodies against human C5. Both nanobodies could serve as diagnostic and/or research tools to detect C5 or inhibit C5 cleavage. Furthermore, the residues targeted by UNbC5-1 hold important information for therapeutic inhibition of different polymorphic variants of C5.",

While the machinery responsible for secretion of many smaller toxins has already been established, it remains enigmatic for larger ones such as Tc toxins from human and insect pathogens, which approach the size of a prokaryotic ribosome. In the present study, we combine targeted genomic editing, proteomic profiling and cryo-electron tomography of the insect pathogen Yersinia entomophaga to reveal that a specialized subset of bacterial cells produces the Tc toxin YenTc as part of a complex toxin cocktail released into the environment by controlled cell lysis using a transcriptionally-coupled, pH-dependent type 10 secretion system (T10SS). Our results dissect the process of Tc toxin export by a T10SS in hitherto unprecedented detail, identifying that T10SSs operate via a previously unknown lytic mode of action, and establishing them as crucial players in the size-insensitive release of cytoplasmically folded toxins. With T10SSs directly embedded in Tc toxin operons of major human pathogens such as Yersinia pestis and Salmonella enterica, we anticipate our findings to model an important aspect of pathogenesis in bacteria with a significant impact on global human health.",

CHCHD10 knock-in mice harboring a heterozygous S55L mutation (equivalent to the human pathogenic S59L mutation) develop a fatal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. The heart of S55L knock-in mice shows extensive metabolic rewiring triggered by proteotoxic mitochondrial integrated stress response (mtISR). In the mutant heart, mtISR initiates well before the onset of mild bioenergetic impairments and is associated with a shift from fatty acid oxidation to glycolytic metabolism and widespread metabolic imbalance. We tested therapeutic interventions to counteract the metabolic rewiring and ameliorate the metabolic imbalance. Heterozygous S55L mice were subjected to chronic high fat diet (HFD) to decrease insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake and enhance fatty acid utilization in the heart. Metabolomics and gene expression profiles demonstrated that HFD achieved an increase of fatty acid utilization in the heart accompanied by a decrease in cardiomyopathy markers. Surprisingly, HFD also decreased the accumulation of aggregated CHCHD10 in the S55L heart. Importantly, HFD increased the survival of mutant female mice exposed to acceleration of the mitochondrial cardiomyopathy associated with pregnancy. Our findings indicate that metabolic alterations can be effectively targeted for therapeutic intervention in mitochondrial cardiomyopathies associated with proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Proteins containing a RNB domain, originally identified in E. coli RNase II, are widely present throughout the tree of life. Many RNB proteins are endowed with 3-5 exoribonucleolytic activity but some have lost catalytic function during evolution. Database searches identified a new RNB domain containing protein in human: HELZ2. Analysis of genomic and expression data with evolutionary information suggested that the human HELZ2 protein is produced from an unforeseen non-canonical initiation codon in Hominidae. This unusual property was confirmed experimentally, extending the human protein by 247 residues. Human HELZ2 was further shown to be an active ribonuclease despite the substitution of a key residue in its catalytic center. HELZ2 harbors also two RNA helicase domains and several zinc-fingers and its expression is induced by interferon treatment. We demonstrate that HELZ2 is able to degrade structured RNAs through the coordinated ATP-dependent displacement of duplex RNA mediated by its RNA helicase domains and its 3-5 ribonucleolytic action. The expression characteristics and biochemical properties of HELZ2 support a role for this factor in response to viruses and/or mobile elements.",

In particular, the neurofilament-light (NF-L) subunit is required for NF assembly in vivo and is mutated in subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. NFs are highly dynamic, and the regulation of NF assembly state is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that human NF-L is modified in a nutrient-sensitive manner by O-linked-{beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a ubiquitous form of intracellular glycosylation. We identify five NF-L O-GlcNAc sites and show that they regulate NF assembly state. Interestingly, NF-L engages in O-GlcNAc-mediated protein-protein interactions with itself and with the NF component -internexin, implying that O-GlcNAc is a general regulator of NF architecture. We further show that NF-L O-GlcNAcylation is required for normal organelle trafficking in primary neurons, underlining its functional significance. Finally, several CMT-causative NF-L mutants exhibit perturbed O-GlcNAc levels and resist the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on NF assembly state, indicating a potential link between dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation and pathological NF aggregation. Our results demonstrate that site-specific glycosylation regulates NF-L assembly and function, and aberrant NF O-GlcNAcylation may contribute to CMT and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

We observed significant differences in the occurrence and extent of typical troglomorphic target characters among the offspring groups. Regardless of rearing conditions, cave fish exhibited smaller eyes, lighter body coloration, longer barbels, and larger olfactory epithelium than seen in surface fish. Hybrids in both rearing conditions generally showed an intermediate level of these traits. Surface and hybrid DD fish differed from the DL groups, resembling the cave fish phenotype in several traits, including eye size and body pigmentation. In contrast, cave and hybrid DL fish groups resembled surface fish phenotypes. Results confirmed that troglomorphic traits arise from heritable genetic differentiation of cave from surface forms and that phenotypic plasticity contributes to the process of adaptation to novel light conditions.",

Dock3 ubiquitous KO mice on the dystrophin-deficient background exacerbated skeletal muscle and cardiac phenotypes. We generated Dock3 conditional skeletal muscle knockout mice (Dock3 mKO) to characterize the role of DOCK3 protein exclusively in the adult muscle lineage. Dock3 mKO mice presented with significant hyperglycemia and increased fat mass, indicating a metabolic role in the maintenance of skeletal muscle health. Dock3 mKO mice had impaired muscle architecture, reduced locomotor activity, impaired myofiber regeneration, and metabolic dysfunction. We identified a novel DOCK3 interaction with SORBS1 through the C-terminal domain of DOCK3 that may account for its metabolic dysregulation. Together, these findings demonstrate an essential role for DOCK3 in skeletal muscle independent of DOCK3 function in neuronal lineages.",

Here, we present an automated treadmill setup capable of dynamically printing odor trails of arbitrary lengths and configurations, and with closed-loop control of speed based on the subjects movement. We used this setup to characterize trail-following behavior in locusts (Schistocerca americana). The free-moving behavior of the locusts is more naturalistic and is richer in plumbable data than many traditional assays. We reveal broad classes of behavioral walking motifs and their dynamic transitions as locusts pursue or avoid an odor trail. Furthermore, we show how these motifs vary across individuals, with the identity of the odorant and with respect to the sex of the organism. Our dataset and analyses provide a first demonstration that this model organism is capable of robust odor trail following, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic motifs that underlie this behavioral capability.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral sequence resurrection (ASR) is the inference of extinct biological sequences from extant sequences, the most popular of which are based on probabilistic models of evolution. ASR is becoming a popular method for studying the evolution of enzyme characteristics. The properties of ancestral enzymes are biochemically and biophysically characterized to gain some knowledge regarding the origin of some enzyme property. Current methodology relies on resurrection of the single most probable (SMP) sequence and is systematically biased. Previous theoretical work suggests this will result in a thermostability bias in resurrected SMP sequences, and even the activity, calling into question inferences derived from ancestral protein properties. We experimentally test the potential stability bias hypothesis by resurrecting 40 malate and lactate dehydrogenases. Despite the methodological bias in resurrecting an SMP protein, the measured biophysical and biochemical properties of the SMP protein are not biased in comparison to other, less probable, resurrections. In addition, the SMP protein property seems to be representative of the ancestral probability distribution. Therefore, the conclusions and inferences drawn from the SMP protein are likely not a source of bias.\n\nSignificanceAncestral sequence resurrection (ASR) is a powerful tool for: determining how new protein functions evolve; inferring the properties of an environment in which species existed; and protein engineering applications. We demonstrate, using lactate and malate dehydrogenases (L/MDHs), that resurrecting the single most probable sequence (SMP) from a maximum likelihood phylogeny does not result in biased activity and stability relative to sequences sampled from the posterior probability distribution. Previous studies using experimentally measured phenotypes of SMP sequences to make inferences about the environmental conditions and the path of evolution are likely not biased in their conclusions. Serendipitously, we discover ASR is also a valid tool for protein engineering because sampled reconstructions are both highly active and stable.",

However, most of our knowledge about these interactions is based on results from animal studies or in vitro models that fail to faithfully mimic the mucosal environment of the human cervix. Here we describe microfluidic organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) models of the human cervical mucosa that recreate the cervical epithelial-stromal interface with a functional epithelial barrier and produce abundant mucus that has compositional, biophysical, and hormone-responsive properties similar to the living cervix. Use of continuous fluid flow promoted ecto-cervical differentiation, whereas use of periodic flow including periods of stasis stimulated endo-cervical specialization. Similar results with minor differences were obtained using epithelial cells isolated from three donors each from a different ethnic background (African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian). When the endo-Cervix Chips were co-cultured with living Lactobacillus crispatus and Gardnerella vaginalis bacterial communities to respectively mimic the effects of human host interactions with optimal (healthy) or non-optimal (dysbiotic) microbiome, significant differences in tissue innate immune responses, barrier function, cell viability, and mucus composition were detected reminiscent of those observed in vivo. Thus, human Cervix Chips provide a physiologically relevant experimental in vitro model to study cervical mucus physiology and its role in human host-microbiome interactions as well as a potential preclinical testbed for development of therapeutic interventions to enhance womens health.",

    "abstract": "Despite their lack of a rigid structure, intrinsically disordered regions in proteins play important roles in cellular functions, including mediating protein-protein interactions. Therefore, it is important to computationally annotate disordered regions of proteins with high accuracy. Most popular tools use evolutionary or biophysical features to make predictions of disordered regions. In this study, we present DR-BERT, a compact protein language model that is first pretrained on a large number of unannotated proteins before being trained to predict disordered regions. Although it does not use any explicit evolutionary or biophysical information, DR-BERT shows a statistically significant improvement when compared to several existing methods on a gold standard dataset. We show that this performance is due to the information learned during pretraining and DR-BERTs ability to use contextual information.

    "abstract": "MotivationMonotonic bivariate classifiers can describe simple patterns in high-dimensional data that may not be discernible using only elementary linear decision boundaries. Such classifiers are relatively simple, easy to interpret, and do not require large amounts of data to be effective. A challenge is that finding optimal pairs of features from a vast number of possible pairs tends to be computationally intensive, limiting the applicability of these classifiers.\n\nResultsWe prove a simple mathematical inequality and show how it can be exploited for the faster identification of optimal feature combinations. Our empirical results suggest speedups of 10x-20x, relative to the previous, naive, approach in applications. This result thus greatly extends the range of possible applications for bivariate monotonic classifiers. In addition, we provide the first open-source code to identify optimal monotonic bivariate classifiers.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://gitlab.pasteur.fr/ofourque/mem_python.\n\nContactbenno.schwikowski@pasteur.fr",

    "abstract": "The ability of trees to survive and naturally regenerate in increasing drought conditions will depend on their capacity to vary key hydraulic and morphological traits that increase drought tolerance. Despite many studies investigating variability in these drought-tolerant traits, there has been limited investigation into this variability under recurrent severe drought conditions since the establishment phase.\n\nWe investigated the long-term hydraulic and leaf trait adjustments of Scots pine trees settled in an abandoned slag quarry by comparing them across three different topographic positions inducing contrasted effects on growth and development. We measured xylem and foliar traits to compare the water status of trees according to tree location and to evaluate the respective risk for xylem hydraulic failure using the soil-plant hydraulic model SurEau.\n\nCompared to upslope and downslope trees, slope trees exhibited lower growth, vulnerability to embolism, specific hydraulic conductivity and photosynthetic pigment contents, as well as higher water potential at turgor loss point and midday water potentials. The hydraulic adjustments of trees settled on slag slopes reduced the risk for hydraulic failure and thus prevented an increase in embolism compared to downslope and upslope trees. These results suggest a prioritization of hydraulic safety over growth in Scots pine developed in a harsh environment, resulting in a dwarf phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring plant responses to stress is an ongoing challenge for crop breeders, growers and agronomists. The measurement of below ground stress is particularly challenging as plants do not always show visible signs of stress in the above ground organs, particularly at early stages. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that could be used to overcome this challenge if associations between plant spectral data and specific stresses can be determined. In this study, three genotypes of red raspberry plants grown under controlled conditions in a glasshouse were subjected to below ground biotic stresses (root pathogen Phytophthora rubi and root herbivore Otiorhynchus sulcatus) or abiotic stress (soil water availability) and regularly imaged using hyperspectral cameras over this period. Significant differences were observed in plant biophysical traits (canopy height and leaf dry mass) and canopy reflectance spectrum between the three genotypes and the imposed stress treatments. The ratio of reflectance at 469nm and 523nm showed a significant genotype-by-treatment interaction driven by differential genotypic responses to the Phytophthora rubi treatment. This indicates that spectral imaging can be used to identify variable plant stress responses in raspberry plants.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS), the most common form of intellectual disability, is a chromosomal disorder caused by having all or part of an extra chromosome 21, leading to intellectual disability. Contrary to the extensive research on the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS in the hippocampus, the synaptic foundation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) malfunction in individuals with DS, including working memory deficits, remains largely unclear. A previous study on mBACtgDyrk1a mice, which overexpress the Dyrk1a gene, showed that this overexpression negatively impacts spine density and synaptic molecular composition, causing synaptic plasticity deficits in the PFC. By comparing Ts65Dn mice, which overexpress multiple genes including Dyrk1a, and mBACtgDyrk1a mice, we aimed to better understand the role of different genes in DS. Results from electrophysiological experiments (i.e., patch-clamp and extracellular field potential recordings ex vivo) in Ts65Dn PFC male mice revealed modifications of intrinsic properties in layer V/VI pyramidal neurons and the synaptic plasticity range. Thus, long-term depression was abolished in Ts65Dn, while synaptic or pharmacological long-term potentiation were fully expressed in Ts65Dn mice. These results, illustrating the phenotypic divergence between the polygenic Ts65Dn model and the monogenic mBACtgDyrk1a model of DS, highlight the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the neurocognitive symptoms of DS.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation is supported by at least two parallel learning systems: an intentionally controlled explicit strategy, and an involuntary implicit learning system. To investigate the error sources driving these two systems, past work focused on constrained reaches or finger movements in laboratory environments has shown subconscious learning systems to be driven in part by sensory prediction error (SPE), i.e., the mismatch between the realized and expected outcome of an action. We designed a ball rolling task to explore whether SPEs can drive implicit motor adaptation during complex whole-body movements that impart physical motion on external objects. After applying a visual shift, participants rapidly adapted their rolling angles to reduce the error between the ball and target. We removed all visual feedback and told participants to aim their throw directly toward the primary target, revealing an unintentional 5.06{degrees} implicit adjustment to reach angles that decayed over time. To determine whether this implicit adaptation was driven by SPE, we gave participants a second aiming target that would  solve the visual shift, as in Mazzoni and Krakauer (2006). Remarkably, after rapidly reducing ball rolling error to zero (due to enhancements in strategic aiming), the additional aiming target caused rolling angles to deviate beyond the primary target by 3.15{degrees}. This involuntary overcompensation, which worsened task performance, is a hallmark of SPE-driven implicit learning. These results show that SPE-driven implicit processes, previously observed within simplified finger or planar reaching movements, actively contribute to motor adaptation in more complex naturalistic skill-based tasks.\n\nNew and NoteworthyImplicit and explicit learning systems have been detected using simple, constrained movements inside the laboratory. How these systems impact movements during complex whole-body, skill-based tasks has not been established. Here we demonstrate that sensory prediction errors significantly impact how a person updates their movements, replicating findings from the laboratory in an unconstrained ball-rolling task. This real-world validation is an important step towards explaining how subconscious learning helps humans execute common motor skills in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "The ability to extract meaning from acoustic environments requires sensitivity to repeating sound structure. Yet, how events that repeat are encoded and maintained in the brain and how the brain responds to events that reoccur at later points in time is not well understood. In two electroencephalography experiments, participants listened to a longer, ongoing white-noise sound which comprised shorter, frozen noise snippets that repeated at a regular 2-Hz rate. In several conditions, the snippet repetition discontinued for a brief period after which the noise snippet reoccurred. The experiments aimed to answer whether neural activity becomes entrained by the regular repetition of noise snippets, whether entrained neural activity self-sustains during the discontinuation period, and how the brain responds to a reoccurring noise snippet. Results show that neural activity is entrained by the snippet repetition, but there was no evidence for self-sustained neural activity during the discontinuation period. However, auditory cortex responded with similar magnitude to a noise snippet reoccurring after a brief discontinuation as it responded to a noise snippet for which the snippet repetition had not been discontinued. This response invariance was observed for different onset times of the reoccurring noise snippet relative to the previously established regularity. The results thus demonstrate that the auditory cortex sensitively responds to, and thus maintains a memory trace of, previously learned acoustic noise independent of temporal interruptions.",

    "abstract": "The Bacillus subtilis extracellular biofilm matrix includes an exopolysaccharide that is critical for the architecture and function of the community. To date, our understanding of the biosynthetic machinery and the molecular composition of the exopolysaccharide of B. subtilis remains unclear and incomplete. This report presents synergistic biochemical and genetic studies built from a foundation of comparative sequence analyses targeted at elucidating the activities of the first two membrane-committed steps in the exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway. By taking this approach, we determined the nucleotide sugar donor and lipid-linked acceptor substrates for the first two enzymes in the B. subtilis biofilm exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway. EpsL catalyzes the first phosphoglycosyl transferase step using UDP-di-N-acetyl bacillosamine as phospho-sugar donor. EpsD is a GT-B fold glycosyl transferase that facilitates the second step in the pathway that utilizes the product of EpsL as an acceptor substrate and UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine as the sugar donor. Thus, the study defines the first two monosaccharides at the reducing end of the growing exopolysaccharide unit. In doing so we provide the first evidence of the presence of bacillosamine in an exopolysaccharide synthesized by a Gram-positive bacterium.\n\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are the communal way of life that microbes adopt to increase survival. Key to our ability to systematically promote or ablate biofilm formation is a detailed understanding of the biofilm matrix macromolecules.

    "abstract": "Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) has a strong influence on 3D genome organization, mediating local chromatin compaction as well as localized and chromosome-wide clustering of target loci. Several subunits of PRC1 have been shown to have the capacity to form biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and when tagged and over-expressed in cells. Here, we use 1,6-hexandiol, which disrupts liquid-like condensates, to examine the role of endogenous PRC1 biomolecular condensates on local and chromosome-wide clustering of PRC1-bound loci. Using imaging and chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing analyses, we show that PRC1-mediated chromatin compaction and clustering of targeted genomic loci - at megabase and tens of megabase length scales - can be reversibly disrupted by the addition and subsequent removal of 1,6-hexandiol to mouse embryonic stem cells. Decompaction and dispersal of polycomb domains and clusters cannot be solely attributable to the reduction of PRC1 binding following 1,6-hexandiol treatment as the addition of 2,5-hexandiol has similar effects on binding despite this alcohol not perturbing PRC1-mediated 3D clustering, at least at the sub-megabase and megabase scales.

    "abstract": "Transporting epithelial cells of the gut and kidney interact with their luminal environment through a densely-packed collection of apical microvilli known as the brush border. Proper brush border assembly depends on the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), a protocadherin-based adhesion complex found at the distal tips of microvilli that mediates adhesion between neighboring protrusions to promote their organized packing. Loss of the IMAC adhesion molecule Cadherin-related family member 5 (CDHR5) correlates with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients, though the functional properties of this protocadherin have not been thoroughly explored in relevant cell systems. Here, we show that the two dominant CDHR5 splice isoforms expressed in enterocytes interact to form an apparent cis-oligomer that is competent to target to the apical domain to drive microvillar elongation. The two isoforms exhibited distinct sequence-dependent apical targeting properties, with one isoform requiring its cytoplasmic tail. Library screening identified the Ezrin-associated scaffolds EBP50 and E3KARP as cytoplasmic binding partners for CDHR5. Consistent with this, loss of EBP50 disrupted proper brush border assembly with cells exhibiting markedly reduced apical IMAC levels. Together, our results shed light on the apical targeting determinants of CDHR5 and further define the interactome of the IMAC involved in brush border assembly.",

    "abstract": "Checkpoint activation after DNA damage causes a transient cell cycle arrest by suppressing CDKs. However, it remains largely elusive how cell cycle recovery is initiated after DNA damage. In this study, we discovered the upregulated protein level of MASTL kinase hours after DNA damage. MASTL promotes cell cycle progression by preventing PP2A/B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation of CDK substrates. DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation was caused by decreased protein degradation, and was unique among mitotic kinases. We identified E6AP as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated MASTL degradation. MASTL degradation was inhibited upon DNA damage as a result of the dissociation of E6AP from MASTL. E6AP depletion reduced DNA damage signaling, and promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that E6AP was phosphorylated at Ser-218 by ATM after DNA damage and that this phosphorylation was required for its dissociation from MASTL, the stabilization of MASTL, and the timely recovery of cell cycle progression. Together, our data revealed that ATM/ATR-dependent signaling, while activating the DNA damage checkpoint, also initiates cell cycle recovery from the arrest. Consequently, this results in a timer-like mechanism that ensures the transient nature of the DNA damage checkpoint.",

In particular, epithelial cells tightly control the number of carriers, transporters and cell adhesion proteins at their plasma membrane. However, the sensitively measuring the cell surface concentration of a particular protein of interest in live cells and in real time represents a considerable challenge.\n\nHere, we introduce a novel approach based on split luciferases, which uses one luciferase fragment as tag on the protein of interest and the second fragment as supplement to the extracellular medium. Once the protein of interest arrives at the cell surface, the luciferase fragments complement and generate luminescence. We compared the performance of split Gaussia luciferase and split Nanoluciferase by using a system to synchronize biosynthetic trafficking with conditional aggregation domains. The best results were achieved with split Nanoluciferase, for which luminescence increased more than 6000-fold upon recombination. Furthermore, we showed that our approach can separately detect and quantify the arrival of membrane proteins at the apical and basolateral plasma membrane in single polarized epithelial cells by detecting the luminescence signals with a microscope, thus opening novel avenues for characterizing the variations in trafficking in individual epithelial cells.\n\nSynopsisWe present here a novel method to determine the arrival of a membrane protein of interest at the cell surface in real time and with sufficient sensitivity to achieve single-cell resolution. This allows measuring detailed kinetics of plasma membrane trafficking and thus to detect also minor changes in protein sorting and intracellular trafficking. Furthermore, the single-cell sensitivity of the method will enable to systematically characterize variations in trafficking between neighboring cells within a multicellular organism.",

    "abstract": "Accurate measures of lifespan and age-specific mortality are important both for understanding life-history evolution and informing conservation and population management strategies. The most accurate data to estimate lifespan are from longitudinal studies, but for many species - especially those such as toothed whales that are wide-ranging and live in difficult-to-access environments - these longitudinal data are not available. However, other forms of age-structured data - such as from mass-strandings - are available for many toothed species, and using these data to infer patterns of age-specific mortality and lifespan remains an important outstanding challenge. Here we develop and test a Bayesian mortality model to derive parameters of a mortality function from age-structured data while accounting for potential error introduced to these data by mistakes in age estimation, sampling biases and population growth. We then searched the literature to assemble a database of 269 published age-structured toothed whale datasets. We applied our mortality model to derive lifespan estimates for 32 species of female and 33 species of male toothed whale. We also use our model to characterise sex differences in lifespan in toothed whales. Our mortality model allows us to curate the most complete and accurate collection of toothed whale lifespans to date.",

    "abstract": "Seasonality can influence many physiological traits requiring optimal energetic capacity for life-history stage transitions. In Atlantic salmon, high-energy status is essential for the initiation of maturation. Atlantic salmon lipid reserves are predominantly found in the viscera and myosepta in the muscle while the liver is essential for maintaining lipid metabolism. A genomic study found a region including a transcription co-factor-coding gene, vgll3, linked to Atlantic salmon maturation timing, which acts as an inhibitor of adipogenesis in mice, and mediates maturation via condition factor in Atlantic salmon. Here we investigate the influence of season and vgll3 genotypes associating with early (EE) and late (LL) maturation on lipid profiles in the muscle and liver in juvenile Atlantic salmon. We reared Atlantic salmon for two years until the occurrence of sexually mature males and sampled muscle and liver at two time points: spring and autumn of the second year. We found no seasonal or genotype effect in lipid profiles in muscle of immature males and females. However, in the liver we did detect a triacylglycerol (TG) enrichment and a genotype specific direction of change in membrane lipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), from spring to autumn. Specifically, from spring to autumn membrane lipid concentrations increased in vgll3*EE individuals and decreased in vgll3*LL individuals. This could be explained with two possible scenarios 1) a seasonally more stable capacity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions in vgll3*EE individuals compared to vgll3*LL individuals or 2) vgll3*LL individuals storing larger lipid droplets from spring to autumn in the liver compared to vgll3*EE individuals at the expense of ER capacity. This genotype specific seasonal direction of change in membrane lipid concentrations provides more indirect evidence that a mechanism linking vgll3 with lipid metabolism and storage exists.\n\nHighlightsO_LISeasonal lipid species profile separation in muscle and liver in juvenile Atlantic salmon\nC_LIO_LIGenotype specific direction of change of membrane lipids from spring to autumn\nC_LIO_LIIndirect evidence that a mechanism linking vgll3 with lipid metabolism and storage exists\nC_LI",

However, the traditional manual segmentation of stained thrombi is laborious and inconsistent. In this study, we propose a label-free method that combines optical diffraction tomography (ODT) and deep learning (DL) to automate the histological quantification process. The DL model classifies ODT image patches with 95% accuracy, and the collective prediction generates a whole-slide map of red blood cells and fibrin. The resulting whole-slide composition displays an average error of 1.1% and does not experience staining variability, facilitating faster analysis with reduced labor.

    "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used to analyze metabolites in biological samples, but the analysis can be cumbersome and inaccurate. Here, we present a powerful automated tool, SPA-STOCSY (Spatial Clustering Algorithm - Statistical Total Correlation Spectroscopy), which overcomes the challenges by identifying metabolites in each sample with high accuracy. As a data-driven method, SPA-STOCSY estimates all parameters from the input dataset, first investigating the covariance pattern and then calculating the optimal threshold with which to cluster data points belonging to the same structural unit, i.e. metabolite. The generated clusters are then automatically linked to a compound library to identify candidates. To assess SPA-STOCSYs efficiency and accuracy, we applied it to synthesized and real NMR data obtained from Drosophila melanogaster brains and human embryonic stem cells. In the synthesized spectra, SPA outperforms Statistical Recoupling of Variables, an existing method for clustering spectral peaks, by capturing a higher percentage of the signal regions and the close-to-zero noise regions. In the real spectra, SPA-STOCSY performs comparably to operator-based Chenomx analysis but avoids operator bias and performs the analyses in less than seven minutes of total computation time. Overall, SPA-STOCSY is a fast, accurate, and unbiased tool for untargeted analysis of metabolites in the NMR spectra. As such, it might accelerate the utilization of NMR for scientific discoveries, medical diagnostics, and patient-specific decision making.",

The discovery of active nitrite-oxidising bacteria (NOB), long thought to be obligately aerobic, in AMZs has altered our perception of how nitrogen cycles in these oxygen-deficient waters. Yet, why NOB succeed in AMZs remains unclear. Here, we show that obligately aerobic NOB can thrive alongside aerobic microheterotrophs in AMZs via infrequent intrusions of oxygen. Ecological theory, biogeochemical modelling and metagenome-based maximum growth rate estimates suggest that NOB are opportunists that take advantage of periodic oxygen intrusions to rapidly accumulate biomass. Rather than harsh, AMZs prone to oxygen intrusions appear optimal for NOB, whose abundance and activity peaks in a  goldilocks zone of periodic oxygen and high nitrite supply. Our results recast the intermediate disturbance hypothesis to AMZs and highlight how the nitrogen cycle relies on dynamic coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms.",

Endogenous HSPs are often synthesized in direct response to these stresses but in many situations are inadequate in protecting cells. The present study addresses the transduction of Hsp70 into cells providing protection from acute oxidative stress by H2O2. The recombinant Fv-Hsp70 protein and two mutant Fv-Hsp70 proteins minus the ATPase domain, and minus the ATPase and terminal lid domains were tested at 0.5 and 1.0 uM concentrations after two different concentrations of H2O2 treatment. All three recombinant proteins protected SH-SY5Y cells from acute H2O2 toxicity. This data indicated that the protein binding domain was responsible for cellular protection. In addition, experiments pretreating cells with inhibitors of antioxidant proteins catalase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase (GGCS) before H2O2 resulted in cell death despite treatment with Fv-Hsp70, implying that both enzymes were protected from acute oxidative stress after treatment with Fv-Hsp70. This study demonstrates that Fv-Hsp70 is protective in our experiments primarily by the protein-binding domain. The Hsp70 terminal lid domain was also not necessary for protection. Cellular protection was protective via the antioxidant proteins catalase and GGCS.",

Our objective was to design and validate a Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) marker, which has advantages for high-throughput screening. First, the accuracy of the SCAR marker was confirmed in two segregating tetraploid populations. Then, using whole genome sequencing data for two RB-positive segregants and a diverse set of 23 RB-negative varieties, a SNP in the 5 untranslated (UTR) region was identified as unique to RB. The KASP marker based on this SNP, which had 100% accuracy in the cultivated diversity panel, was used to generate diploid breeding lines containing RB. The KASP marker is publicly available for others to utilize.",

We investigated the utility of DuplexSeq to quantify induced mutation frequency (MF) and spectrum in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells exposed to a prototypical DNA alkylating agent, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Furthermore, we explored appropriate experimental parameters for this application, and assessed inter-laboratory reproducibility. In two independent experiments in two laboratories, TK6 cells were exposed to ENU (25-200 {micro}M) and DNA was sequenced 48, 72, and 96 h post-exposure. A DuplexSeq mutagenicity panel targeting twenty 2.4-kb regions distributed across the genome was used to sample diverse, genome-representative sequence contexts. A robust increase in MF that was unaffected by time was observed in both laboratories. Concentration-response in the MF from the two laboratories was strongly positively correlated (R2=0.95). C:G>T:A, T:A>C:G, T:A>A:T, and T:A>G:C mutations increased in consistent, concentration-dependent manners in both laboratories, with high proportions of C:G>T:A at all time points.

We here apply sterolomics to organoids used for disease modeling of NAFLD. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with on-line sample clean-up and enrichment, we establish that liver organoids produce and secrete oxysterols. We find elevated levels of 26-hydroxycholesterol, an LXR agonist and the first oxysterol in the acidic bile acid synthesis, in medium from steatotic liver organoids compared to untreated organoids. Other upregulated sterols in medium from steatotic liver organoids are dihydroxycholesterols, such as 7,26-dihydroxycholesterol, and 7,25-dihydroxycholesterol. Through 26-hydroxycholesterol exposure to human stem cell-derived hepatic stellate cells, we observe a trend of expressional downregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine CCL2, suggesting a protective role of 26-hydroxycholesterol during early-phased NAFLD disease development. Our findings support the possibility of oxysterols serving as NAFLD indicators, demonstrating the usefulness of combining organoids and mass spectrometry for disease modeling and biomarker studies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529551v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9de7fdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9b328org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f14101org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e2e9c3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We examined the potential of urolithin A (UroA) as a CYP1A1/1B1 substrate to enhance AHR activity in vivo. UroA is a competitive substrate for CYP1A1/1B1 in an in vitro competition assay. A broccoli-containing diet promotes the gastric formation of the potent hydrophobic AHR ligand and CYP1A1/1B1 substrate, 5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ). Dietary exposure to UroA in a broccoli diet led to a coordinated increase in duodenal, cardiac, and pulmonary AHR activity, but no increase in activity in liver. Thus, CYP1A1 dietary competitive substrates can lead to intestinal \"escape\", likely through the lymphatic system, increasing AHR activation in key barrier tissues.",

A forward biochemical screen of 140 animal cGLRs reveals a conserved mechanism of signaling including response to dsDNA and dsRNA ligands and synthesis of alternative nucleotide signals including isomers of cGAMP and cUMP-AMP. Using structural biology, we explain how synthesis of distinct nucleotide signals enables cells to control discrete cGLR-STING signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Hemodynamics is crucial for the activation and aggregation of platelets in response to flow-induced shear. In this paper, a novel image-based computational model simulating blood flow through and around platelet aggregates is presented. The microstructure of aggregates was captured by two different modalities of microscopy images of in vitro whole blood perfusion experiments in microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. One set of images captured the geometry of the aggregate outline, while the other employed platelet labelling to infer the internal density. The platelet aggregates were modelled as a porous medium, the permeability of which was calculated with the Kozeny-Carman equation. The computational model was subsequently applied to study hemodynamics inside and around the platelet aggregates. The blood flow velocity, shear stress and kinetic force exerted on the aggregates were investigated and compared under 800 s-1, 1600 s-1 and 4000 s-1 wall shear rates. The advection-diffusion balance of agonist transport inside the platelet aggregates was also evaluated by local Peclet number. The findings show that the transport of agonists is not only affected by the shear rate but also significantly influenced by the microstructure of the aggregates. Moreover, large kinetic forces were found at the transition zone from shell to core of the aggregates, which could contribute to identifying the boundary between the shell and the core. The shear rate and the rate of elongation flow were investigated as well. The results imply that the emerging shapes of aggregates are highly correlated to the shear rate and the rate of elongation. The framework provides a way to incorporate the internal microstructure of the aggregates into the computational model and yields a better understanding of the hemodynamics and physiology of platelet aggregates, hence laying the foundation for predicting aggregation and deformation under different flow conditions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe initial step in the formation of an arterial thrombus is the rapid aggregation of the tiny blood particles called platelets. This process significantly influences the formation and structure of the resulting thrombi. The mechanical properties of the aggregates depend on their microstructure, which in turn is dictated by their interaction with the flow during formation. However, due to currently existing technological limitations, it is not possible to measure these interactions in sufficient detail experimentally. In this paper, an image-based computational model is proposed based on two different modalities of experimental images, that can complement the experiments and give detailed information on hemodynamics during the aggregation. The image sets are captured from whole blood perfused microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. One modality of images captured the shape of the aggregate outline with high contrast, while the other employed platelet labeling to infer the internal density. The platelet aggregates are considered as porous media in the simulations, informed by the images. This framework incorporates the internal microstructure of the aggregates into the computational model and yields a better understanding of the hemodynamics and physiology of platelet aggregates, hence laying the foundation for predicting aggregation and deformation under different flow conditions.",

    "abstract": "New folded molecular structures can only evolve after arising through mutations. This aspect is modelled using genotype-phenotype (GP) maps, which connect sequence changes through mutations to changes in molecular structures. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of appearing through mutations can differ by orders of magnitude from structure to structure and that this can affect the outcomes of evolutionary processes. Thus, we focus on the phenotypic mutation probabilities{phi}  qp, i.e. the likelihood that a random mutation changes structure p into structure q. For both RNA secondary structures and the HP protein model, we show that a simple biophysical principle can explain and predict how this likelihood depends on the new structure q:{phi}  qp is high if sequences that fold into p as the minimum-free-energy structure are likely to have q as an alternative structure with high Boltzmann frequency. This generalises the existing concept of plastogenetic congruence from individual sequences to the entire neutral spaces of structures. Our result helps us understand why some structural changes are more likely than others, can be used as a basis for estimating these likelihoods via sampling and makes a connection to alternative structures with high Boltzmann frequency, which could be relevant in evolutionary processes.",

To discover novel mechanisms through which MM cells overcome DNA damage, we investigated how MM cells become resistant to antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy targeting ILF2, a DNA damage regulator that is overexpressed in 70% of MM patients whose disease has progressed after standard therapies have failed. Here, we show that MM cells undergo an adaptive metabolic rewiring and rely on oxidative phosphorylation to restore energy balance and promote survival in response to DNA damage activation. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screening strategy, we identified the mitochondrial DNA repair protein DNA2, whose loss of function suppresses MM cells ability to overcome ILF2 ASO-induced DNA damage, as being essential to counteracting oxidative DNA damage and maintaining mitochondrial respiration. Our study revealed a novel vulnerability of MM cells that have an increased demand for mitochondrial metabolism upon DNA damage activation.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEMetabolic reprogramming is a mechanism through which cancer cells maintain survival and become resistant to DNA-damaging therapy.

    "abstract": "1.Biologics, such as pharmaceutical peptides, have notoriously short shelf lives, insufficient for long-duration space flight missions to the Moon or Mars. To enable the sustainable presence of humans on the Moon or Mars, we must develop methods for on-site production of pharmaceutical peptides in space, a concept we call Astropharmacy. Here, we present proof-of-concept for the first step needed: a low-mass system for pharmaceutical production designed to be stable in space. To demonstrate feasibility, we engineered strains of the space-hardy spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, to secrete two pharmaceutical peptides important for astronaut health: teriparatide (an anabolic agent for combating osteoporosis) and filgrastim (an effective countermeasure for radiation-induced neutropenia). We found that the secretion peptides from the walM and yoqH genes of B. subtilis 168 worked well for secreting teriparatide and filgrastim, respectively. In consideration of the TRISH challenge to produce a dose equivalent in 24 hours, dried spores of our engineered strains were used to produce 1 dose equivalent of teriparatide from a 2 mL culture and 1 dose equivalent of filgrastim from 52 mL of culture in 24 hours. Further optimization of strain growth conditions, expression conditions, and promoter sequences should allow higher production rates to be achieved. These strains provide the template for future optimization efforts and address the first step in the Astropharmacy, capable of on-site production, purification, and processing of biopharmaceutical compounds in platforms amenable for use in space.",

A seeds innate quality is determined during seed development and the following seed maturation phase. It is tightly controlled by the genetic make-up of the mother plant and further shaped by the environmental conditions of the mother plant. The interaction between genotype and environment can result in substantial quantitative variation in seed traits like dormancy and viability.\n\nMaking use of naturally occurring variation within the Arabidopsis thaliana germplasm, we studied the interaction between seed production environments and the genetic architecture of mother plants on diverse seed quality traits. An Arabidopsis Bayreuth-0 x Shahdara recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was grown in four different seed production environments: high temperature, high light, low phosphate, and control conditions. The seeds harvested from the mother plants that were exposed to these environments from flowering until seed harvest were subsequently subjected to germination assays under standard and mild stress conditions (cold, heat, osmotic stress and added phytohormone ABA). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified many environmental-sensitive QTLs (QTL x E) as well as several interactions between the maternal and germination environments. Variation in the number and position of the QTLs was largely determined by the germination conditions, however effects of the maternal environment were clearly present regarding the genomic location as well as significance of the individual QTLs.\n\nTogether, our findings uncover the extensive environmental modulation of the genetic influence on seed performance and how this is shaped by the genetic make-up of the mother plant. Our data provides a systems-view of the complex genetic basis of genotype-by-environment interactions determining seed quality.",

    "abstract": "Memories are often categorized into types, reflecting their behavioural, anatomical and molecular diversity: these classifications both aid understanding of the differences among varieties of memory and help delineate the unifying cross-species principles underlying them. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that an associative memory of the pairing of the normally attractive odorant benzaldehyde and starvation depends on de novo transcription and translation, is independent of CREB, and is produced by massed training: a pattern which does not correspond to any of the well-characterized molecular categories of invertebrate memory. Further, as has been shown for many memories in vertebrates, but not previously in nematodes, we find that formation of this memory continues after removal of the stimuli initially causing it, and that it is labile to disruption through protein synthesis inhibition following training, but that inhibition of proteasomal activity does not extend the duration of the memory. Previous findings have implicated insulin pathway signalling as a key component of this benzaldehyde/starvation memory, however we find that the transcriptional activity required for the memory is likely to be independent of the transcription factors that function at the terminus of this pathway. These findings better characterize this model associative memory in relation to other invertebrate memory types and identify ways in which it both shares their traits and differs from them.",

How cerebral and spinal components interact and how spinal activation is influenced by cerebral primary motor and premotor areas is poorly understood. Here we conducted combined cortico-spinal functional MRI during a simple visually guided isometric force generation task in a group of 20 healthy young subjects. Activation was localized in the ipsilateral cervical spinal cord and contralateral primary motor and premotor areas. The main finding is that spinal activation was influenced by ventral premotor cortex activation. Spinal activation was furthermore significantly correlated with primary motor cortex activation while increasing target forces led to an increase in the amount of activation. These data indicate that human premotor areas such as the ventral premotor cortex might be functionally connected to the lower cervical spinal cord contributing to distal upper limb functions, a finding which extends our understanding about human motor function beyond the animal literature.",

    "abstract": "Investigations into how individual neurons encode behavioral variables of interest have revealed specific representations in single neurons, such as place and object cells, as well as a wide range of cells with conjunctive encodings or mixed selectivity. However, as most experiments examine neural activity within individual tasks, it is currently unclear if and how neural representations change across different task contexts. Within this discussion, the medial temporal lobe is particularly salient, as it is known to be important for multiple behaviors including spatial navigation and memory, however the relationship between these functions is currently unclear. Here, to investigate how representations in single neurons vary across different task contexts in the MTL, we collected and analyzed single-neuron activity from human participants as they completed a paired-task session consisting of a passive-viewing visual working memory and a spatial navigation and memory task. Five patients contributed 22 paired-task sessions, which were spike sorted together to allow for the same putative single neurons to be compared between the different tasks. Within each task, we replicated concept-related activations in the working memory task, as well as target-location and serial-position responsive cells in the navigation task. When comparing neuronal activity between tasks, we first established that a significant number of neurons maintained the same kind of representation, responding to stimuli presentations across tasks. Further, we found cells that changed the nature of their representation across tasks, including a significant number of cells that were stimulus responsive in the working memory task that responded to serial position in the spatial task. Overall, our results support a flexible encoding of multiple, distinct aspects of different tasks by single neurons in the human MTL, whereby some individual neurons change the nature of their feature coding between task contexts.",

TUS is already well-established in animal models, providing foundations to now optimize neuromodulatory efficacy for human applications. Across multiple studies, one promising protocol, pulsed at 1000 Hz, has consistently resulted in motor cortical inhibition in humans. At the same time, a parallel research line has highlighted the potentially confounding influence of peripheral auditory stimulation arising from TUS pulsing at audible frequencies.\n\nObjectiveIn this study, we disentangle direct neuromodulatory and indirect auditory contributions to motor inhibitory effects of TUS. To this end, we include tightly matched control conditions across four experiments, one preregistered, conducted independently at three institutions.\n\nMethodsWe employed a combined transcranial ultrasonic and magnetic stimulation paradigm, where TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) served as an index of corticospinal excitability. Results: We replicated motor inhibitory effects of TUS but showed through both tight controls and manipulation of stimulation intensity, duration, and auditory masking conditions that this inhibition was driven by peripheral auditory stimulation, not direct neuromodulation. Further, we consider neuromodulation beyond driving overall excitation/inhibition and show preliminary evidence of how TUS might interact with ongoing neural dynamics instead.\n\nConclusionsThis study highlights the substantial impact of the auditory confound, invites a reevaluation of prior findings, and calls for appropriate control conditions in future TUS studies. Only when direct effects are disentangled from those driven by peripheral confounds can TUS fully realize its potential for research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "A model based on inhibitory coupling has been proposed to explain perceptual oscillations. This  adapting reciprocal inhibition model postulates that it is the strength of inhibitory coupling that determines the fate of competition between percepts. Here, we used an fMRI-based adaptation technique to reveal the influence of neighboring neuronal populations, such as reciprocal inhibition, in motion-selective hMT+/V5. If reciprocal inhibition exists in this region, the following predictions should hold: 1. stimulus-driven response would not simply decrease, as predicted by simple repetition-suppression of neuronal populations, but instead increase due to the activity from adjacent populations; 2. perceptual decision involving competing representations, should reflect decreased reciprocal inhibition by adaptation; 3. neural activity for the competing percept should also later on increase upon adaptation. Our results confirm these three predictions, showing that a model of perceptual decision based on adapting reciprocal inhibition holds true. Finally, they also show that the well-known repetition suppression phenomenon can be reversed by this mechanism.\n\nSignificance StatementfMRI-based adaptation has been developed as a tool to identify functional selectivity in the human brain. This is based on the notion that stimulus-selective adaptation leads to direct response suppression. In this study, we go a step further by showing that adaptation can also reveal the influence of neighboring neuronal populations. Our data reveals neural evidence for a disinhibition effect as a result of the adaptation of adjacent populations, which is in line with the adapting reciprocal inhibition model. Reciprocal inhibition can, thus, be tracked in the human brain using fMRI, adding to the understanding of human multistable perception and the neural coding of visual information. Moreover, our results also provide a mechanism for reversal of repetition suppression.",

However, outcome measures used to report E-field magnitude vary considerably and have not yet been compared in detail.\n\nObjectivesThe goal of this two-part study, encompassing a systematic review and modeling experiment, was to provide an overview of the different outcome measures used to report the magnitude of tES and TMS E-fields, and to conduct a direct comparison of these measures across different stimulation montages.\n\nMethodsThree electronic databases were searched for tES and/or TMS studies reporting E-field magnitude. We extracted and discussed outcome measures in studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Additionally, outcome measures were compared via models of four common tES and two TMS modalities in 100 healthy younger adults.\n\nResultsIn the systematic review, we included 118 studies using 151 outcome measures related to E-field magnitude. Structural and spherical regions of interest (ROI) analyses and percentile-based whole-brain analyses were used most often. In the modeling analyses, we found that there was an average of only 6% overlap between ROI and percentile-based whole-brain analyses in the investigated volumes within the same person. The overlap between ROI and whole-brain percentiles was montage- and person-specific, with more focal montages such as 4x1 and APPS-tES, and figure-of-eight TMS showing up to 73%, 60%, and 52% overlap between ROI and percentile approaches respectively. However, even in these cases, 27% or more of the analyzed volume still differed between outcome measures in every analyses.\n\nConclusionsThe choice of outcome measures meaningfully alters the interpretation of tES and TMS E-field models. Well-considered outcome measure selection is imperative for accurate interpretation of results, valid between-study comparisons, and depends on stimulation focality and study goals. We formulated four recommendations to increase the quality and rigor of E-field modeling outcome measures. With these data and recommendations, we hope to guide future studies towards informed outcome measure selection, and improve the comparability of studies.",

    "abstract": "Bacterioplankton of the SAR11 clade are the most abundant marine microorganisms and consist of numerous subclades spanning Order level divergence (Pelagibacterales). The assignment of the earliest diverging subclade V (a.k.a. HIMB59) to the Pelagibacterales is highly controversial, with multiple recent phylogenetic studies placing them completely separate from SAR11. Other than through phylogenomics, subclade V has not received detailed examination due to limited genomes from this group. Here, we assessed the ecogenomic characteristics of subclade V to better understand the role of this group in comparison to the Pelagibacterales. We used a new isolate genome, recently released single amplified genomes (SAGs) and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and previously established SAR11 genomes to perform a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis. We paired this analysis with recruitment of metagenomes spanning open ocean, coastal, and brackish systems. Phylogenomics, average amino acid identity, and 16S rRNA gene phylogeny indicate that SAR11 subclade V is synonymous with the ubiquitous AEGEAN-169 clade, and support the contention that this group represents a taxonomic Family. AEGEAN-169 shared many bulk genome qualities with SAR11, such as streamlining and low GC content, but genomes were generally larger. AEGEAN-169 had overlapping distributions with SAR11 but was metabolically distinct from SAR11 in its potential to transport and utilize a broader range of sugars as well as in transport of trace metals and thiamin. Thus, regardless of the ultimate phylogenetic placement of AEGEAN-169, these organisms have distinct metabolic capacities that likely allow them to differentiate their niche from canonical SAR11 taxa.\n\nIMPORTANCEOne goal of marine microbiologists is to uncover the roles various microorganisms are playing in biogeochemical cycles. Success in this endeavor relies on differentiating groups of microbes and circumscribing their relationships. An early-diverging group (subclade V) of the most abundant bacterioplankton, SAR11, has recently been proposed as a separate lineage that does not share a most recent common ancestor. But beyond phylogenetics, little has been done to evaluate how these organisms compare with SAR11. Our work leverages dozens of new genomes to demonstrate the similarities and differences between subclade V and SAR11. In our analysis, we also establish that subclade V is synonymous with a group of bacteria established from 16S rRNA gene sequences, AEGEAN-169. Subclade V/AEGEAN-169 has clear metabolic distinctions from SAR11 and their shared traits point to remarkable convergent evolution if they do not share a most recent common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a process vital to angiogenesis as well as general vascular homeostasis. In pathologies where supraphysiological growth factor signaling underlies disease etiology, such as in diabetic retinopathy and solid tumors, strategies to limit chronic growth factor signaling by way of CME have been shown to have tremendous clinical value. ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a small GTPase that promotes the assembly of actin necessary for CME. In its absence, growth factor signaling is greatly diminished, which has been shown to ameliorate pathological signaling input in diseased vasculature. However, it is less clear if there are bystander effects related to loss of Arf6 on angiogenic behaviors. Our goal was to provide a analysis of Arf6s function in angiogenic endothelium, focusing on its role in lumenogenesis as well as its relation to actin and CME. We found that Arf6 localized to both filamentous actin and sites of CME in 2-dimensional culture. Loss of Arf6 distorted both apicobasal polarity and reduced the total cellular filamentous actin content, and this may be the primary driver underlying gross dysmorphogenesis during angiogenic sprouting in its absence. Our findings highlight that endothelial Arf6 is a potent mediator of both actin regulation and CME.",

    "abstract": "Gene-based burden tests are a popular and powerful approach for analysis of exome-wide association studies. These approaches combine sets of variants within a gene into a single burden score that is then tested for association. Typically, a range of burden scores are calculated and tested across a range of annotation classes and frequency bins. Correlation between these tests can complicate the multiple testing correction and hamper interpretation of the results. We introduce a new method called the Sparse Burden Association Test (SBAT) that tests the joint set of burden scores under the assumption that causal burden scores act in the same effect direction. The method simultaneously assesses the significance of the model fit and selects the set of burden scores that best explain the association at the same time. Using simulated data, we show that the method is well calibrated and highlight some scenarios where the test outperforms existing gene-based tests. We apply the method to 73 quantitative traits from the UK Biobank which further illustrates the power of the method. This test is implemented in the REGENIE software.",

In addition, the effects of a CXCR1/CXCR2 antagonist, SX-682, on melanoma tumorigenesis were evaluated in BrafV600E/Pten-/- and NRasQ61R/INK4a-/- mice and in melanoma cell lines. Potential mechanisms by which Cxcr2 affects melanoma tumorigenesis in these murine models were explored using RNAseq, mMCP-counter, ChIPseq, and qRT-PCR; flow cytometry, and reverse phosphoprotein analysis (RPPA).\n\nResultsGenetic loss of Cxcr2 or pharmacological inhibition of CXCR1/CXCR2 during melanoma tumor induction resulted in key changes in gene expression that reduced tumor incidence/growth and increased anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, after Cxcr2 ablation, Tfcp2l1, a key tumor suppressive transcription factor, was the only gene significantly induced with a log2 fold-change greater than 2 in these three different melanoma models.\n\nConclusionsHere, we provide novel mechanistic insight revealing how loss of Cxcr2 expression/activity in melanoma tumor progenitor cells results in reduced tumor burden and creation of an anti-tumor immune microenvironment. This mechanism entails an increase in expression of the tumor suppressive transcription factor, Tfcp2l1, along with alteration in the expression of genes involved in growth regulation, tumor suppression, stemness, differentiation, and immune modulation. These gene expression changes are coincident with reduction in the activation of key growth regulatory pathways, including AKT and mTOR.",

To investigate the multivariate association of MetS and cortical thickness, we applied partial least squares (PLS) correlation to a pooled sample of two large-scale population-based cohort studies totaling 40,087 individuals. PLS identified a latent clinical-anatomical dimension relating more severe MetS with a widespread pattern of cortical thickness abnormalities and worse cognitive performance. MetS effects were strongest in regions with high density of endothelial cells, microglia and excitatory neurons of subtype 8. Moreover, regional MetS effects correlated within functionally and structurally connected brain networks.

    "abstract": "The Hydra nervous system is the paradigm of a \"simple nerve net\". Nerve cells in Hydra, as in many cnidarian polyps, are organized in a nerve net extending throughout the body column. This nerve net is required for control of spontaneous behavior: elimination of nerve cells leads to polyps that do not move and are incapable of capturing and ingesting prey (Campbell, 1976). We have re-examined the structure of the Hydra nerve net by immunostaining fixed polyps with a novel pan-neuronal antibody that stains all nerve cells. Confocal imaging shows that there are two distinct nerve nets, one in the ectoderm and one in the endoderm, with the unexpected absence of nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles. The nerve nets in the ectoderm and endoderm do not contact each other. High-resolution images show that the nerve nets consist of bundles of parallel overlapping neurites. Transmission and serial block face scanning electron microscopy show that nerve bundles in the ectoderm are closely associated with ectodermal muscle processes. Nerve bundles in the endoderm are separate from muscle processes. The occurrence of bundles of neurites supports a model for continuous growth and differentiation of the nerve net by lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing net. This model was confirmed by tracking newly differentiated nerve cells.",

    "abstract": "Physiological noise has been shown to have a large impact on the quality of functional MRI data, especially in areas close to fluid-filled cavities and arteries, such as the brainstem. Commonly, physiological recordings during scanning are transformed with methods such as RETROICOR and used as nuisance regressors in general linear models to remove variance associated with cardiac and respiratory cycles from the data. In contrast, modern pre-processing pipelines such as fMRIPrep, have created easy access to streamlined data-driven noise reduction methods such as aCompCor and ICA-AROMA. In combination, these methods have shown efficacy in correcting for motion, scanner as well as physiological artifacts. Given the ease of usability, it has to be questioned, whether there is any added benefit to applying logistically demanding methods such as RETROICOR. To answer this question, we applied RETROICOR, ICA-AROMA and aCompCor to a resting-state data set and compared variance explained by the respective methods and improvements in temporal signal-to-noise ratio throughout different regions of interest in the brain. In line with previous literature, RETROICOR significantly explains variance throughout the brain with peaks around areas of strong cardiac pulsations. ICA-AROMA and aCompCor largely account for the same variance. Nonetheless, RETROICOR retains unique explanatory power in individual participants. Further analysis points towards a pattern of unreliability of ICA-AROMA and aCompCor to consistently remove physiological noise across recordings, which is compensated by RETROICOR. While some of this inconsistency could be attributed to misclassifications in the noise selection models of ICA-AROMA, most is likely the consequence of secondary factors such as fMRI sequence parameters (e.g. long TR) limiting the efficiency of aCompCor and ICA-AROMA. Thus, it is advisable to additionally apply RETROICOR, especially when assuming regionally high levels of physiological noise.",

An important, yet understudied aspect of threat experience concerns the ability to exert control over the thread. In this study, we used a Virtual Reality (VR) environment showing an approaching avatar that was either angry (threatening body expression) or neutral (neutral body expression) and informed participants to stop avatars from coming closer under five levels of control success (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100%) when they felt uncomfortable. Behavioral results revealed that social threat triggered faster reactions at a greater virtual distance from the participant than the neutral avatar. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed that the angry avatar elicited a larger N170/vertex positive potential (VPP) and a smaller N3 than the neutral avatar. The 100% control condition elicited a larger late positive potential (LPP) than the 75% control condition. In addition, we observed enhanced theta power and accelerated heart rate for the angry avatar vs. neutral avatar, suggesting that these measures index threat perception. Our results indicate that perception of social threat takes place in early to middle cortical processing stages, and control ability is associated with cognitive evaluation in middle to late stages.",

Pairing task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) with operant learning revealed a dorsal hippocampal hyperactivation during Nogo task, implying that hippocampal hyperexcitability might underlie the observed behavioral deficits. Notably, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) revealed enhanced functional connectivity between the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus following NBN silencing. Further exploration of PV+ interneurons and mossy cells activities highlighted NBNs integral part in preserving the excitation/inhibition balance within the hippocampus.

    "abstract": "Many songbirds learn to produce songs through vocal practice early in life and continue to sing numerous renditions of their learned songs daily throughout their lifetime. While it is well-known that adult songbirds sing as part of a mating ritual, the functions of singing behavior outside of reproductive contexts are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that adult singing outside of reproductive contexts serves to prevent passive changes in song performance. We suppressed the daily singing behavior of adult zebra finches produced in the solo context for two weeks using a reversible behavioral manipulation and examined the effect on song performance. Our results indicated that suppressing daily singing significantly decreased the pitch of song elements and both the amplitude and duration of song motifs. These findings suggest that adult song is not acoustically stable without singing, and that adult birds maintain their song performance by daily singing. Moreover, we found that the changes in song structure caused by singing suppression were substantially recovered within two weeks of free singing, even in deafened birds. Thus, the recovery of song performance does not necessarily require auditory feedback but is predominantly caused by singing behavior per se (i.e., the physical act of singing). Finally, unlike the auditory feedback-dependent song plasticity reported previously, the passive song changes caused by singing suppression were not significantly dependent on age. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that adult songbirds maintain song performance by preventing passive song changes through the physical act of daily singing throughout their life. Such daily singing likely functions as vocal training to maintain the neural and/or muscular system in optimal conditions for song performance in reproductive contexts, similar to how human singers and athletes practice daily to maintain their performance.",

Sex chromosomes in eutherians share an evolutionary origin as an ancestral pair of autosomes. In humans, they share three regions of high sequence identity (~98-100%), which--along with the unique transmission patterns of the sex chromosomes--introduce technical artifacts into genomic analyses. However, the human X chromosome bears numerous important genes--including more \"immune response\" genes than any other chromosome--which makes its exclusion irresponsible when sex differences across human diseases are widespread. To better characterize the effect that including/excluding the X chromosome may have on variants called, we conducted a pilot study on the Terra cloud platform to replicate a subset of standard genomic practices using both the CHM13 reference genome and sex chromosome complement-aware (SCC-aware) reference genome. We compared quality of variant calling, expression quantification, and allele-specific expression using these two reference genome versions across 50 human samples from the Genotype-Tissue-Expression consortium annotated as females. We found that after correction, the whole X chromosome (100%) can generate reliable variant calls--allowing for the inclusion of the whole genome in human genomics analyses as a departure from the status quo of omitting the sex chromosomes from empirical and clinical genomics studies.",
