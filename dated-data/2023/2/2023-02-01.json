    "abstract": "Although liver transplantation (LT) is an effective therapy for cirrhosis, the risk of post-LT NASH is alarmingly high and is associated with accelerated progression to fibrosis/cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease, and decreased survival. Lack of risk stratification strategies hamper liver undergoes significant remodeling during inflammatory injury. During such remodeling, degraded peptide fragments (i.e.,  degradome) of the ECM and other proteins increase in plasma, making it a useful diagnostic/prognostic tool in chronic liver disease. To investigate whether inflammatory liver injury caused by post-LT NASH would yield a unique degradome profile, predictive of severe post-LT NASH fibrosis, we performed a retrospective analysis of 22 biobanked samples from the Starzl Transplantation Institute (12 with post-LT NASH after 5 years and 10 without). Total plasma peptides were isolated and analyzed by 1D-LC-MS/MS analysis using a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1000 UHPLC and nanoelectrospray ionization into an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. Qualitative and quantitative peptide features data were developed from MSn datasets using PEAKS Studio X (v10). LC-MS/MS yielded [~]2700 identifiable peptide features based on the results from Peaks Studio analysis. Several peptides were significantly altered in patients that later developed fibrosis and heatmap analysis of the top 25 most significantly-changed peptides, most of which were ECM-derived, clustered the 2 patient groups well. Supervised modeling of the dataset indicated that a fraction of the total peptide signal ([~]15%) could explain the differences between the groups, indicating a strong potential for representative biomarker selection. A similar degradome profile was observed when the plasma degradome patterns were compared being obesity sensitive (C57Bl6/J) and insensitive (AJ) mouse strains. Both The plasma degradome profile of post-LT patients yields stark difference based on later development of post-LT NASH fibrosis. This approach could yield new \"fingerprints\" that can serve as minimally-invasive biomarkers of negative outcomes post-LT.",

    "abstract": "Melatonin secretion follows a circadian pattern with a maximum level at night in many species. However, in zebrafish (Danio rerio, a diurnal fish species) large inter-individual variations in daily rhythmicity of melatonin levels are present and are associated with variation in behaviour. Melatonin secretion rhythm of proactive individuals that are more active and exploratory are of larger amplitude compared to reactive individuals. In threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a nocturnal species, inter-individual variability of behaviour is well described. However, inter-individual variation of melatonin rhythm and its association with variation in behaviour has never been measured in this species, which would allow to test if patterns found in zebrafish can be generalized for diurnal and nocturnal species. We measured large inter-individual variation in melatonin levels and found that activity was positively correlated with plasma melatonin concentration measured at night. We did not observe any significant difference in nigh-day variation in melatonin concentration between very active and less active groups. However, we found that individuals classified as reactive based on their propensity to wall-hugging, a measure of anxiety in fish, showed large variation in melatonin between night and day, while this rhythm was not seen in proactive individuals that frequently used the centre of the aquarium. Overall, our study suggests that melatonin may directly modulate specific behaviours in wild sticklebacks, and that while interindividual variation in melatonin rhythm may be widespread in fish, different patterns of association with behaviours should be expected.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal ripple oscillations have been implicated in important cognitive functions such as memory consolidation and planning. Multiple computational models have been proposed to explain the emergence of ripple oscillations, relying either on excitation or inhibition as the main pacemaker. Nevertheless, the generating mechanism of ripples remains unclear. An interesting dynamical feature of experimentally measured ripples, which may advance model selection, is intra-ripple frequency accommodation (IFA): a decay of the instantaneous ripple frequency over the course of a ripple event. So far, only the \"bifurcation-based\" inhibition-first model, which is based on delayed inhibitory synaptic coupling, has been shown to reproduce IFA. Here we use an analytical mean-field approach and numerical simulations of a leaky integrate-and-fire spiking network to explain the mechanism of IFA. We develop a drift-based approximation for the oscillation dynamics of the population rate and the mean membrane potential of interneurons under strong drive and strong inhibitory coupling. We demonstrate that IFA arises due to a speed-dependent hysteresis effect in the dynamics of the mean membrane potential, when the interneurons receive transient, sharp wave-associated excitation. We thus predict that the IFA asymmetry vanishes in the limit of slowly changing drive, but is otherwise a robust feature of the bifurcation-based inhibition-first ripple model.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal representations throughout the primate visual system display a wide range of nonlinear dynamics in response to static visual stimuli. To understand the neural basis of visual perception, it is important to quantify these nonlinearities and to develop general models that allow one to predict response dynamics to visual stimuli with arbitrary temporal waveform.\n\nVoltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a powerful method for measuring neural population responses from the cortex of awake, behaving, subjects. Here we used VSDI to measure the dynamics of neural population responses in macaque V1 to visual stimuli with a wide range of time courses.\n\nWe found that beyond clear nonlinearities for briefly presented visual stimuli, stimulus-evoked VSDI responses are surprisingly near additive in time. These results are qualitatively different from neural dynamics to similar stimuli previously measured in human visual cortex using fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG), which show strong sub-additivity in time.\n\nTo test whether this discrepancy is specific to VSDI, a signal dominated by subthreshold neural activity, we repeated our measurements using a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP), a signal dominated by spiking activity. We found that GCaMP signals in macaque V1 are also near-additive. Therefore, the discrepancies in the degree of additivity between these different measurements are not attributed to the difference between sub- and supra-threshold neural response.\n\nFinally, we show that a simple yet flexible delayed normalization model can capture the dynamics of all of these measurements, suggesting that dynamic gain-control is an important mechanism contributing to neural processing in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Tight junctions (TJs) are multi-protein complexes at the interface between adjacent endothelial or epithelial cells. In the blood-brain barrier (BBB), they are responsible for sealing the paracellular spaces and their backbone is formed by Claudin-5 (Cldn5) proteins. Despite the important role in preserving brain homeostasis, little is known on how Cldn5 oligomers assemble. Different structural models have been suggested, where Cldn5 protomers from opposite cells associate to generate paracellular pores that do not allow the passage of ions or small molecules. Recently, the first Cldn5 pathogenic mutation, G60R, was identified and shown to induce anion selectivity in the BBB TJs. This offers an excellent opportunity to further assess the structural models. In this work, we performed umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations to study the permeation of single Na+, Cl- and H2O through two distinct G60R Cldn5 paracellular models. Only one of them, called Pore I, reproduces the functional modification observed in the experiments, displaying a free energy (FE) minimum for Cl- and a barrier for Na+ at the central constriction, consistent with the formation of an anionic channel. To further test the validity of the model, we performed the same calculations for the Q57D and the Q63D mutants, which affect two side-chains in the constriction site. In particular, Q57 is conserved among various Cldns, with few exceptions such as the two cation permeable homologs Cldn15 and Cldn10b. In both cases, we obtain that the FE profiles are modified with respect to the wild-type system, facilitating the passage of cations. Our calculations are the first in-silico description of the effect of a Cldn5 pathogenic mutation, and provide a further assessment of the Pore I model for Cldn5-based TJ architectures, yielding new atom-detailed insight on the selective permeability of the paracellular spaces in BBB.",

While combination treatment with an antitumor antibody (TA99) displayed only modest efficacy, simultaneous depletion of CD4+ T cells boosted cure rates to over 90% of mice. We elucidated two mechanisms of action for this synergy: CD4 eliminated tumor draining lymph node Tregs, enhancing priming and activation of CD8+ T cells, and TA99 + 4-1BB-LAIR supported the cytotoxic program of these newly primed CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Replacement of CD4 with CTLA-4, a clinically approved antibody that enhances T cell priming, produced equivalent cure rates while additionally generating robust immunological memory against secondary tumor rechallenge.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of nodal Tregs enhances CD8+ T cell priming, improving antitumor responses to collagen-anchored 4-1BB combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "1.Anthropogenic activity is threatening ecosystem multifunctionality, i.e. the ability of ecosystems to provide multiple functions and services which are vital for human well-being. Here we assess how multifunctionality of agroecosystems in Central Germany depends on land-use type and climate change. Our analysis included 13 ecosystem functions in a large-scale field experiment with five different land-use types (three grassland and two farmland types either sustainably or intensively managed) under two different climate scenarios (ambient and future climate). We consider ecological measures of multifunctionality using averaging approaches with different weights, i.a. reflecting preferences of farmers and environmentalists, and assess an economic multifunctionality measure based on the total value of ecosystem services. Results show that intensive management and future climate decrease ecological multifunctionality for multiple weighting scenarios in both grassland and farmland. Only under a weighting according to farmers preferences, intensively-managed grassland shows higher multifunctionality as compared to sustainably-managed grassland. The economic multifunctionality measure, which includes economic benefits for society at large, reveals a multifunctionality about [~]1.7 times higher for sustainable compared to intensive management for both grassland and farmland. Above-belowground biodiversity correlates positively with ecosystem multifunctionality and is expected to be one of its main drivers. Based on these findings, we suggest to promote and economically incentivise sustainable land management that enhances both ecological and economic multifunctionality, also under future climatic conditions.",

Optical imaging techniques are particularly useful for tracking cells due to their clinical translatability and potential for intra-operative use to validate cell delivery. However, there is a lack of appropriate optical probes for cell tracking. The only FDA-approved material for clinical use is indocyanine green (ICG). ICG can be used for both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, but is prone to photodegradation, and at higher concentrations, undergoes quenching and can adversely affect cell health. We have developed novel near-infrared imaging probes comprising conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) that can be fine-tuned to absorb and emit light at specific wavelengths. To compare the performance of the CPNs with ICG for in vivo cell tracking, labelled mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were injected subcutaneously in mice and detected using fluorescence imaging (FI) and a form of photoacoustic imaging called multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). MSCs labelled with either ICG or CPN 770 could be detected with FI, but only CPN 770-labelled MSCs could be detected with MSOT. These results show that CPNs show great promise for tracking cells in vivo using optical imaging techniques, and for some applications, out-perform ICG.",

Massive and plating corals have a high capacity to trap sediments, and active removal mechanisms can be energetically costly. Branching corals trap less sediment, but are more susceptible to light limitation caused by suspended sediment. Despite deleterious effects of sediments on corals, few studies have examined the molecular response of corals with different morphological characteristics to sediment stress. To address this knowledge gap, this study assessed the transcriptomic responses of branching and massive corals in Florida and Hawai{square}i to varying levels of sediment exposure. Gene expression analysis revealed a molecular responsiveness to sediments across species and sites. Differentially Gene Expression (DEG) followed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified that branching corals had the largest transcriptomic response to sediments, in developmental processes and metabolism, while significantly enriched GO terms were highly variable between massive corals, despite similar morphologies. Comparison of DEGs within orthogroups revealed that while all corals had DEGs in response to sediment, there was not a concerted gene set response by morphology or location. These findings illuminate the species specificity and genetic basis underlying coral susceptibility to sediments.",

    "abstract": "Top-down attentional control seems to increase and suppress the activity of sensory cortices for relevant stimuli and to suppress activity for irrelevant ones. Higher physical activity (PA) and aerobic fitness (AF) levels have been associated with improved attention, but most studies have focused on unimodal tasks (e.g., visual stimuli only). The impact of higher PA or AF levels on the ability of developing brains to focus on certain stimuli while ignoring distractions remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the neural processes in visual and auditory sensory cortices during a cross-modal attention-allocation task using magnetoencephalography in 13-16-year-old adolescents (n = 51). During continuous and simultaneous visual (15 Hz) and auditory (40 Hz) noise-tagging stimulation, participants attended to either visual or auditory targets appearing on their left or right sides. High and low PA groups were formed based on seven-day accelerometer measurements, and high and low AF groups were determined based on the 20-m shuttle-run test. Steady-state (evoked) responses to the visual stimulus were observed in all the adolescents in the primary visual cortex, but some did not show responses in the primary auditory cortices to the auditory stimulus. The adolescents with auditory-tag-driven signals in the left temporal cortex were older than those who did not show responses. Visual cortices showed enhanced visual-tag-related activity with attention, but there was no cross-modal effect, perhaps due to the developmental effect observed in the temporal areas. The visual-tag-related responses in the occipital cortex were enhanced in the higher-PA group, irrespective of task demands. In summary, sensory cortices are unequally involved in cross-modal attention in the adolescent brain. This involvement seems to be enhanced by attention. Higher PA seems to be associated with a specific visual engagement benefit in the adolescent brain.\n\nHighlights- Visual and auditory cortices engagement differs in cross-modal processing in adolescence.\n- Adolescents with responses in the left temporal cortex are older than those without responses.\n- Physical activity, but not aerobic fitness, is associated with visual engagement benefits in the adolescent brain.",

    "abstract": "Variations in the geometry of the environment, such as the shape and size of an enclosure, have profound effects on navigational behavior and its neural underpinning. Here, we show that these effects arise as a consequence of a single, unifying principle: to navigate efficiently, the brain must maintain and update the uncertainty about ones location. We developed an image-computable Bayesian ideal observer model of navigation, continually combining noisy visual and self-motion inputs, and a neural encoding model optimized to represent the location uncertainty computed by the ideal observer. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the ideal observer accounts for a diverse range of sometimes paradoxical distortions of human homing behavior in anisotropic and deformed environments, including  boundary tethering, and its neural encoding accounts for distortions of rodent grid cell responses under identical environmental manipulations. Our results demonstrate that spatial uncertainty plays a key role in navigation.",

    "abstract": "In humans, the nocturnal secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland is suppressed by ocular exposure to light. In the laboratory, melatonin suppression is a convenient biomarker for this neural pathway. Recent work has found that individuals differ substantially in their melatonin-suppressive response to light, with the most sensitive individuals being up to 60 times more sensitive than the least sensitive individuals. Planning experiments with melatonin suppression as an outcome needs to incorporate these individual differences, particularly in common resource-limited scenarios where running within-subjects studies at multiple light levels is expensive and not feasible with respect to participant compliance. Here, we present a novel framework for virtual laboratory melatonin suppression experiments, incorporating a Bayesian statistical model. We provide a Shiny web app for power analyses that allows users to modify various experimental parameters (sample size, individual-level heterogeneity, statistical significance threshold, light levels), and simulate a systematic shift in sensitivity (e.g., due to a pharmacological or other intervention). Our framework helps experimenters to design compelling and robust studies, offering novel insights into the underlying biological variability relevant for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "CD40 is a central co-stimulatory receptor implicated in the development of productive anti-tumor immune responses across multiple cancers, including bladder cancer. Despite strong preclinical rationale, systemic administration of therapeutic agonistic antibodies targeting the CD40 pathway have demonstrated dose limiting toxicities with minimal clinical activity to date, emphasizing an important need for optimized CD40-targeted approaches, including rational combination therapy strategies. Here, we describe an important role for the endogenous IL-15 pathway in contributing to the therapeutic activity of CD40 agonism in orthotopic bladder tumors, with upregulation of trans-presented IL-15/IL-15R surface complexes, particularly by cross-presenting cDC1s, and associated enrichment of activated CD8 T cells within the bladder tumor microenvironment. In bladder cancer patient samples, we identify DCs as the primary source of IL-15, however, they lack high levels of IL-15R at baseline. Using humanized immunocompetent orthotopic bladder tumor models, we demonstrate the ability to therapeutically augment this interaction through combined treatment with anti-CD40 agonist antibodies and exogenous IL-15, including the fully-human Fc-optimized antibody 2141-V11 currently in clinical development for the treatment of bladder cancer. Combination therapy enhances the crosstalk between Batf3-dependent cDC1s and CD8 T cells, driving robust primary anti-tumor activity and further stimulating long-term systemic anti-tumor memory responses associated with circulating memory-phenotype T and NK cell populations. Collectively, these data reveal an important role for IL-15 in mediating anti-tumor CD40 agonist responses in bladder cancer and provide key proof-of-concept for combined use of Fc-optimized anti-CD40 agonist antibodies and agents targeting the IL-15 pathway. These data support expansion of ongoing clinical studies evaluating anti-CD40 agonist antibodies and IL-15-based approaches to evaluate combinations of these promising therapeutics for the treatment of patients with bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConventional CD4+ T (Tconv) lymphocytes play important roles in tumor immunity; however, their contribution to tumor elimination remains poorly understood.\n\nMethodsHere we describe a subset of Tconv cells characterized by the expression of CD39. The phenotype, the effector function and transcriptional profile of tumor-infiltrating CD39+ Tconv lymphocytes from different mouse cancer models and breast cancer patients were studied by multiparametric flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. The impact of the in vivo CTLA-4 blockade on the tumor-infiltrating CD39+ Tconv population was assessed in mice grafted with the immunogenic MC38 colorectal tumor. Overall survival was evaluated in a cohort of patients from the TCGA consortium.\n\nResultsIn mouse cancer models, we observed that CD39+ Tconv cells accumulated in tumors as they grew but were absent in lymphoid organs. Compared to tumor CD39- counterparts, CD39+ Tconv cells exhibited a cytotoxic and exhausted signature at the transcriptomic level, confirmed by high protein expression of inhibitory receptors and transcription factors related to the exhaustion phenotype. Additionally, CD39+ Tconv cells showed increased production of IFN gamma, granzyme B, perforin and CD107a expression, but reduced production of TNF. In vivo CTLA-4 blockade induced the expansion of tumor CD39+ Tconv cells, which maintained their cytotoxic and exhausted features. In breast cancer patients, CD39+ Tconv cells were found in tumors and in metastatic lymph nodes but were less frequent in adjacent non-tumoral mammary tissue and not detected in non-metastatic lymph nodes and blood. Human tumor CD39+ Tconv cells constituted a heterogeneous cell population with features of exhaustion, impaired TNF production, and high expression of inhibitory receptors and CD107a. We found that high CD4 and ENTPD1 (CD39) gene expression in human tumor tissues correlated with a higher overall survival rate in breast cancer patients.\n\nConclusionsWe found that CD39 acts as a biomarker of Tconv cells with characteristics of both exhaustion and cytotoxic potential. CTLA-4 blockade expands CD39+CD4+ T cells which may contribute to the reduction of tumor development. Discovering the role of CD39-expressing CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment should help design new strategies to manipulate them and improve the efficacy of current immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 3% of children in Western countries are diagnosed with peanut allergy, a likely lifelong disease. The preferred treatment for food allergy is allergen avoidance. However, oral immunotherapy is an FDA-approved treatment to re-induce tolerance, still, not all patients respond as expected. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate whether the association of an antigen-specific tolerogenic (oral tolerance) bystander effect can ameliorate the recovery of inflamed intestinal mucosa. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were divided into five groups, four of which were submitted to an intestinal inflammation induction protocol to peanuts. After sensitization, experimental groups were orally challenged with either peanuts or a hybrid diet (peanuts + mouse chow). In a second stage, groups were sensitized, challenged with peanuts, and then received either peanuts, hybrid diet, or ovalbumin chow during the recovery period of the inflamed mucosa. Results showed no changes in diet intake and body weight. Polyisotypic anti-peanut IgG and IgG1 were significantly increased in the serum from animals in allergic groups. The group that received the hybrid diet showed an increase in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, as well as in B220+CD3-CD27+ memory B cells. Histology of the duodenum showed a decrease in intraepithelial leukocytes in animals who received hybrid diet. Together, our results show that when the tolerogen is added to a diet containing the allergen, it can ameliorate the induction of local inflammation. Simultaneously offering the allergen with a tolerated food increased the mucosal recovery due to the expansion of previously induced memory cells.",

    "abstract": "Integration of multi-omics data is a challenging but necessary step to advance our understanding of the biology underlying human health and disease processes. To date, investigations seeking to integrate multi-omics (e.g., microbiome and metabolome) employ simple correlation-based network analyses; however, these methods are not always well-suited for microbiome analyses because they do not accommodate the excess zeros typically present in these data. In this paper, we introduce a bivariate zero-inflated negative binomial (BZINB) model-based network and module analysis method that addresses this limitation and improves microbiome-metabolome correlation-based model fitting by accommodating excess zeros. We use real and simulated data based on a multi-omics study of childhood oral health (ZOE 2.0; investigating early childhood dental disease, ECC) and find that the accuracy of the BZINB model-based correlation method is superior compared to Spearmans rank and Pearson correlations in terms of approximating the underlying relationships between microbial taxa and metabolites. The new method, BZINB-iMMPath facilitates the construction of metabolite-species and species-species correlation networks using BZINB and identifies modules of (i.e., correlated) species by combining BZINB and similarity-based clustering. Perturbations in correlation networks and modules can be efficiently tested between groups (i.e., healthy and diseased study participants). Upon application of the new method in the ZOE 2.0 study microbiome-metabolome data, we identify that several biologically-relevant correlations of ECC-associated microbial taxa with carbohydrate metabolites differ between healthy and dental caries-affected participants. In sum, we find that the BZINB model is a useful alternative to Spearman or Pearson correlations for estimating the underlying correlation of zero-inflated bivariate count data and thus is suitable for integrative analyses of multi-omics data such as those encountered in microbiome and metabolome studies.",

Here, we analyzed the mutational landscape of Mycobacterium smegmatis during long-term evolution with increasing concentrations of rifampicin, using a mutation accumulation assay combined with whole genome sequencing. Antibiotic treatment enhanced the acquisition of mutations, doubling the genome-wide mutation rate of the wild type cells. While antibiotic exposure led to extinction of almost all wild type lines, the hypermutable phenotype of the {Delta}nucS strain (noncanonical mismatch repair deficient) provided an efficient response to the antibiotic, leading to high rates of survival. This adaptative advantage resulted in the emergence of higher levels of rifampicin resistance, an accelerated acquisition of drug resistance mutations in rpoB ({beta} RNA polymerase) and a wider diversity of evolutionary pathways that led to drug resistance. Lastly, this approach revealed a subset of adaptive genes under positive selection with rifampicin that were able to drive novel rifampicin resistance mechanisms.",

We investigated the prevalence of Salmonella in healthy and diseased pigs from Thai pig farms and determined their phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance profiles. A total of 150 fecal samples were collected from pigs housed in pens from four separate pig farms in southern Thailand and tested for the presence of Salmonella. Confirmed Salmonella isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials, and PCR used to detect known antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Salmonella isolates were cultured from 69% (103/150) of all fecal samples, with higher prevalence in disease pigs (12/15; 80%), compared with healthy pigs (91/135; 67%). Serotype Rissen was the most frequently identified serotype among the Salmonella isolates. Resistance to ampicillin (AMP) (97%), sulfonamide-trimethoprim (SXT) (97%), and tetracycline (TET) (94%) were the most common phenotypes observed. The most common ARGs identified were blaTEM gene (99.%), tetA (87%), sul1 (77%), and dfrA1 (74%), and more than 95% of the Salmonella isolates tested were MDR - based on resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes. The most common antimicrobial resistance pattern exhibited was AMP-TET-SXT (76%), and resistance to colistin (via the mcr-1 gene) was observed in both healthy and diseased pigs.

    "abstract": "Formation of the mycelial pellet in submerged cultivation of Streptomycetes is unwanted in industrial fermentation processes as it imposes mass transfer limitations, changes in the rheology of a medium, and affects the production of secondary metabolites. Though detailed information is not available about the factors involved in regulating mycelial morphology but it is studied that culture conditions and genetic information of strain play a key role. Moreover, the proteomic study has revealed the involvement of low molecular weight proteins such as; DivIVA, FilP, ParA, Scy, and SsgA proteins in apical growth and branching of hyphae which results in the establishment of the mycelial network. The present study proposes the mechanism of pellet formation of Streptomyces toxytricini (NRRL B-5426) with the help of microscopic and proteomic analysis. The microscopic analysis revealed that growing hyphae followed a certain organized path of growth and branching, which was further converted into the pellet, and proteomic analysis revealed the production of low molecular weight proteins, which possibly participate in the regulation of pellet morphology.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved a wide range of defense strategies to protect themselves against bacterial viruses (phages). However, the known mechanisms almost exclusively target phages with DNA genomes. While several bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems have been considered to cleave single-stranded bacterial RNA in response to stressful conditions, their role in protecting bacteria against phages with single-stranded RNA genomes has not been studied. Here we investigate the role of a representative toxin-antitoxin system, MazEF, in protecting Escherichia coli against two RNA phages - MS2 and Q{beta}. Our population-level experiments revealed that a mazEF deletion strain is more susceptible to RNA phage infection than the wild-type. At the single-cell level, deletion of the mazEF locus significantly shortened the time to lysis of individual bacteria challenged with RNA phage. At the genomic level, we found that the adenine-cytosine-adenine sequence, directly recognized and cleaved by the MazF toxin, is systematically underrepresented in the genomes of RNA phages that are known to infect E. coli, indicating selection for decreased probability of cleavage. These results suggest that in addition to other physiological roles, RNA-degrading toxin-antitoxin modules can function as a primitive immune system against RNA phages.",

    "abstract": "Both the bacterial flagellum and the evolutionary related injectisome encoded on the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) play crucial roles during the infection cycle of Salmonella species. The interplay of both is highlighted by the complex cross-regulation that includes transcriptional control of the flagellar master regulatory operon flhDC by HilD, the master regulator of SPI-1 gene expression. Contrary to the HilD-dependent activation of flagellar gene expression, we report here that activation of HilD resulted in a dramatic loss of motility, which was dependent on the presence of SPI-1. Single cell analyses revealed that HilD-activation results in a SPI-1-dependent induction of the stringent response and a pronounced decrease of proton motive force (PMF), while flagellation was not affected. We further found that activation of HilD enhanced the adhesion of Salmonella to epithelial cells. A transcriptome analysis revealed a concomitant upregulation of several adhesin systems, which when overproduced, phenocopied the HilD-induced motility defect. We propose that a combination of SPI-1-dependent depletion of the PMF and upregulation of adhesins upon HilD-activation allows flagellated Salmonella to rapidly modulate their motility during infection, thereby enabling efficient adhesion to host cells and delivery of effector proteins.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic resistance under treatment depends on the availability of resistance alleles and their establishment in the population. Novel resistance alleles are encoded either in chromosomal or extrachromosomal genetic elements; both types may be present in multiple copies within the cell. However, the effect of polyploidy on the emergence of antibiotic resistance remains understudied. Here we show that the establishment of resistance alleles in microbial populations depends on the ploidy level. Evolving bacterial populations under selection for antibiotic resistance, we demonstrate that resistance alleles in polyploid elements are lost frequently in comparison to alleles in monoploid elements due to segregational drift. Integrating the experiments with a mathematical model, we find an agreement between the theoretical and empirical allele dynamics, confirming our understanding of the allele segregation process. Using the mathematical model, we further show that the effect of polyploidy on the establishment probability of beneficial alleles is strongest for low replicon copy numbers and plateaus for high replicon copy numbers. Our results suggest that the distribution of fitness effects for mutations that get fixed in a population depends on the replicon ploidy level. Our study indicates that strategies for drug treatment of bacterial infections should take into consideration the pathogen ploidy level.",

    "abstract": "The biocide triclosan is used extensively in both household and hospital settings. The chronic exposure to the biocide occurring in individuals that use triclosan-containing products results in low levels of triclosan present in the human body that has been linked to induction of antibiotic tolerance and altered biofilm formation. Here we aimed to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in triclosan induced antibiotic tolerance and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. Triclosan treatment prior to planktonic exposure to bactericidal antibiotics resulted in 1,000 fold higher viable cell counts compared to non-pretreated cultures. Triclosan pretreatment also protected S. aureus biofilms against otherwise lethal doses of antibiotics as shown by live/dead cell staining and viable cell counting. Triclosan mediated antibiotic tolerance in planktonic and biofilm cultures required an active stringent response because a pppGpp0 strain was not protected from antibiotic killing. Incubation of S. aureus with triclosan also altered biofilm structure due to SarA-mediated overproduction of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) in the biofilm matrix. Thus, physiologically relevant concentrations of triclosan can trigger (p)ppGpp dependent antibiotic tolerance as well as SarA dependent biofilm formation.\n\nImportanceThe prevalent bacterium Staphylococcus aureus infects skin lesions and indwelling devices, and this can cause sepsis with 33% mortality. Intrinsic to this is the formation of co-ordinated communities (biofilms) protected by a polysaccharide coat. S. aureus is increasingly difficult to eradicate due to its antibiotic resistance. Protection against Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) includes pre-hospital admission washing with products containing biocides. The biocide triclosan is the predominant antibacterial compound in sewage in Ontario due to its use in household and hospital settings. Levels of triclosan accumulate with exposure in humans. The significance of our research is in identifying the mechanisms triggered by exposure of S. aureus to physiological levels of triclosan that go on to raise the tolerance of S. aureus to antibiotics and promote the formation of biofilms. This understanding will inform future criteria used to determine effective antimicrobial treatments.",

We documented health determinants (infectious diseases and trace elements), processes (cortisol, pathology), and health outcomes (pregnancy and body condition). During a recent period of steep population decline our results suggested relatively good body condition and pregnancy rates and decreasing levels of stress, along with low adult cow survival. We identified multiple determinants of health as potential contributors to reduced survival, including Brucella suis biovar 4, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and lower hair trace minerals.

    "abstract": "Snail-borne diseases affect more than a quarter of a billion people worldwide and pose a high burden in the livestock industry. A fundamental understanding of the drivers of the epidemiology of these diseases is crucial for the development of sustainable control measures. The microbiome is increasingly being recognized as an important player in the tripartite interaction between parasitic flatworms, snail intermediate hosts and the snail microbiome. In order to better understand these interactions, transplant experiments are needed, which rely on the development of a reliable and reproducible protocol to obtain microbiome-disturbed snails. Here we report on the first successful snail microbiome transplants, which indicate that Biomphalaria glabrata can accrue novel bacterial assemblies depending on the available environmental bacteria obtained from donor snails. Moreover, the phylogenetic relatedness to the donor significantly affected the survival probability of the recipients, corroborating the phylosymbiosis pattern in freshwater snails. The transplant technique described here, complemented by field-based studies, could facilitate future research endeavors to investigate the role of specific bacteria or bacterial communities in parasitic flatworm resistance of B. glabrata and might ultimately pave the way for microbiome-mediated control of snail-borne diseases.",

    "abstract": "Crustacean genomes harbor sequences originating from nimaviruses, a family of large double-stranded DNA viruses infecting crustaceans. In this study, we recovered metagenome-assembled genomes of 25 endogenous nimaviruses from crustacean genome data. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four major lineages within Nimaviridae, and for three of these lineages, we propose novel genera of endogenous nimaviruses: \"Majanivirus\" and \"Pemonivirus\" identified from penaeid shrimp genomes, and \"Clopovirus\" identified from terrestrial isopods. Majanivirus genomes contain multiple eukaryotic-like genes such as baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing genes, innexins, and heat shock protein 70-like genes, some of which contain introns. An alignment of long reads revealed that that each endogenous nimavirus species specifically inserts into host microsatellites or within 28S rDNA. This insertion preference was associated with the type of virus-encoded DNA recombination enzymes, the integrases. Majaniviruses, pemoniviruses, some whispoviruses, and possibly clopoviruses specifically insert into the arthropod telomere repeat motif (TAACC/GGTTA)n and all possessed a specific tyrosine recombinase family. Pasiphaea japonica whipovirus and Portunus trituberculatus whispovirus, the closest relatives of white spot syndrome virus, integrate into the host 28S rDNA and are equipped with members of another family of tyrosine recombinases that are distantly related to telomere-specific tyrosine recombinases. Endogenous nimavirus genomes identified from sesarmid crabs, which lack tyrosine recombinases and are flanked by a 46-bp inverted terminal repeat, integrate into (AT/TA)n microsatellites through the acquisition of a Ginger2-like cut- and-paste DDE transposase. These results suggest that endogenous nimaviruses are giant transposable elements that occupy different sequence niches through the acquisition of different integrase families.\n\nImportanceCrustacean genomes harbor sequences originating from a family of large DNA viruses called nimaviruses, but it is unclear why they are present. We show that endogenous nimaviruses selectively insert into repetitive sequences within the host genome, and this insertion specificity was correlated with different types of integrases, which are DNA recombination enzymes encoded by the nimaviruses themselves. This suggests that endogenous nimaviruses have colonized various genomic niches through the acquisition of integrases with different insertion specificities. Our results point to a novel survival strategy of endogenous large DNA viruses colonizing the host genomes. These findings may clarify the evolution and spread of nimaviruses in crustaceans and lead to measures to control and prevent the spread of pathogenic nimaviruses in aquaculture settings.",

    "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal tract contains diverse microbial communities, including archaea. Among them, Methanobrevibacter smithii represents a highly active and clinically relevant methanogenic archaeon, being involved in gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBD and obesity. Herein, we present an integrated approach using sequence and structure information to improve the annotation of M. smithii proteins using advanced protein structure prediction and annotation tools, such as AlphaFold2, trRosetta, ProFunc, and DeepFri. Of an initial set of 873 481 archaeal proteins, we found 707 754 proteins exclusively present in the human gut. Having analysed archaeal proteins together with 87 282 994 bacterial proteins, we identified unique archaeal proteins and archaeal-bacterial homologs. We then predicted and characterized functional domains and structures of 73 unique and homologous archaeal protein clusters linked the human gut and M. smithii. We refined annotations based on the predicted structures, extending existing sequence similarity-based annotations. We identified gut-specific archaeal proteins that may be involved in defense mechanisms, virulence, adhesion, and the degradation of toxic substances. Interestingly, we identified potential glycosyltransferases that could be associated with N-linked and O-glycosylation. Additionally, we found preliminary evidence for interdomain horizontal gene transfer between Clostridia species and M. smithii, which includes sporulation stage V proteins AE and AD. Our study broadens the understanding of archaeal biology, particularly M. smithii, and highlights the importance of considering both sequence and structure for the prediction of protein function.",

    "abstract": "Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes several human diseases including Kaposis sarcoma (KS), a leading cause of cancer in Africa and in patients with AIDS. KS tumor cells harbor KSHV predominantly in a latent form, while typically <5% contain lytic replicating virus. Because both latent and lytic stages likely contribute to cancer initiation and progression, continued dissection of host regulators of this biological switch will provide insights into fundamental pathways controlling the KSHV life cycle and related disease pathogenesis. Several cellular protein kinases have been reported to promote or restrict KSHV reactivation, but our knowledge of these signaling mediators and pathways is incomplete. We employed a polypharmacology-based kinome screen to identifiy specific kinases that regulate KSHV reactivation. Those identified by the screen and validated by knockdown experiments included several kinases that enhance lytic reactivation: ERBB2 (HER2 or neu), ERBB3 (HER3), ERBB4 (HER4), MKNK2 (MNK2), ITK, TEC, and DSTYK (RIPK5). Conversely, ERBB1 (EGFR1 or HER1), MKNK1 (MNK1) and FRK (PTK5) were found to promote the maintenance of latency. Mechanistic characterization of ERBB2 pro-lytic functions revealed a signaling connection between ERBB2 and the activation of CREB1, a transcription factor that drives KSHV lytic gene expression. These studies provided a proof-of-principle application of a polypharmacology-based kinome screen for the study of KSHV reactivation and enabled the discovery of both kinase inhibitors and specific kinases that regulate the KSHV latent-to-lytic replication switch.\n\nAuthor SummaryKaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposis sarcoma, a cancer particularly prevalent in Africa. In cancer cells, the virus persists in a quiescent form called latency, in which only a few viral genes are made. Periodically, the virus switches into an active replicative cycle in which most of the viral genes are made and new virus is produced. What controls the switch from latency to active replication is not well understood, but cellular kinases, enzymes that control many cellular processes, have been implicated. Using a cell culture model of KSHV reactivation along with an innovative screening method that probes the effects of many cellular kinases simultaneously, we identified drugs that significantly limit KSHV reactivation, as well as specific kinases that either enhance or restrict KSHV replicative cycle. Among these were the ERBB kinases which are known to regulate growth of cancer cells. Understanding how these and other kinases contribute to the switch leading to production of more infectious virus helps us understand the mediators and mechanisms of KSHV diseases. Additionally, because kinase inhibitors are proving to be effective for treating other diseases including some cancers, identifying ones that restrict KSHV replicative cycle may lead to new approaches to treating KSHV-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Gnotobiotic animal models reconventionalized under controlled laboratory conditions with multi-species bacterial communities are commonly used to study host-microbiota interactions under presumably more reproducible conditions than conventional animals. The usefulness of these models is however limited by inter-animal variability in bacterial colonization and our general lack of understanding of the inter-individual fluctuation and spatio-temporal dynamics of microbiota assemblies at the micron to millimeter scale. Here, we show underreported variability in gnotobiotic models by analyzing differences in gut colonization efficiency, bacterial composition, and host intestinal mucus production between conventional and gnotobiotic zebrafish larvae re-conventionalized with a mix of 9 bacteria isolated from conventional microbiota. Despite similar bacterial community composition, we observed high variability in the spatial distribution of bacteria along the intestinal tract in the reconventionalized model. We also observed that, whereas bacteria abundance and intestinal mucus per fish were not correlated, reconventionalized fish had lower intestinal mucus compared to conventional animals, indicating that the stimulation of mucus production depends on the microbiota composition. Our findings, therefore, suggest that variable colonization phenotypes affect host physiology and impact the reproducibility of experimental outcomes in studies that use gnotobiotic animals. This work provides insights into the heterogeneity of gnotobiotic models and the need to accurately assess re-conventionalization for reproducibility in host-microbiota studies.",

During the pandemic, cases of COVID-19 were aggravated by secondary infections because of impaired immunity and medical interventions, which was clearly evident in the second wave of COVID-19 in India. The potential dangers and clinical difficulties of bacterial and fungal secondary infections in COVID-19 patients necessitate microbial exploration of the URT. In this regard, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome data of nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients was used to investigate the metaproteome. The MS datasets were searched against a comprehensive protein sequence database of common URT pathogens using multiple search platforms (MaxQuant, MSFragger, and Search GUI/PeptideShaker). The detected microbial peptides were verified using PepQuery, which analyses peptide-spectrum pairs to give statistical output for determining confident microbial peptides. Finally, a protein sequence database was generated using the list of verified microbial peptides for identification and quantitation of microbial peptides and proteins, respectively. The taxonomic analysis of the detected peptides revealed several opportunistic pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Rhizopus microsporus, Clavispora lusitaniae, and Syncephalastrum racemosum among others. Using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), we validated a few identified microbial peptides in clinical samples. The analysis also revealed proteins belonging to species like Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter, and Clostridium to be up-regulated in severe COVID-19 samples. Thus, MS can serve as a powerful tool for untargeted detection of a wide range of microorganisms. Metaproteomic analysis in COVID-19 patients for early identification and characterisation of co-infecting microorganisms can significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients.",

    "abstract": "The horizontal transfer of plasmids is an important driver of microbial evolution, such as conferring antibiotic resistance (AR) to new genotypes. In biofilms, the abundance of cell-cell contacts promotes the frequent transfer of plasmids and their associated genes. In this study, we expand our knowledge about AR-encoding plasmids by investigating their transfer between discrete biofilms as the biofilms grow and physically collide with each other. Using an experimental system consisting of two fluorescently labelled Pseudomonas stutzeri strains and an Escherichia coli strain, we show that biofilm collisions promote plasmid transfer along the collision boundaries. The extent of plasmid transfer depends on the plasmid loss probability, the plasmid transfer probability, and the relative growth rates of plasmid-free and plasmid-carrying cells. We further show that the proliferation of plasmids after biofilm collision depends on the spatial positionings of plasmid-carrying cells along the collision boundary, thus establishing a link between the large-scale spatial distribution of discrete biofilms and the small-scale spatial arrangement of cells within individual biofilms. Our study reveals that plasmid transfer during biofilm collisions is determined by spatial factors operating at different organizational levels and length scales, expanding our understanding of the fate of plasmid-encoded traits in microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Early life microbial colonizers shape and support the immature vertebrate immune system. Microbial colonization relies on the vertical route via parental provisioning and the horizontal route via environmental contribution. Vertical transmission is mostly a maternal trait making it hard to determine the source of microbial colonization in order to gain insight in the establishment of the microbial community during crucial development stages. The evolution of unique male pregnancy in pipefishes and seahorses enables the disentanglement of both horizontal and vertical transmission, but also facilitates the differentiation of maternal vs. paternal provisioning ranging from egg development, to male pregnancy and early juvenile development. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing and source-tracker analyses, we revealed how the distinct origins of transmission (maternal, paternal & horizontal) shaped the juvenile internal and external microbiome establishment in the broad-nosed pipefish Syngnathus typhle. Paternal provisioning mainly shaped the juvenile external microbiome, whereas maternal microbes were the main source of the internal juvenile microbiome, later developing into the gut microbiome. This suggests that stability of niche microbiomes may vary depending on the route and time point of colonization, the strength of environmental influences (i.e., horizontal transmission), and potentially the homeostatic function of the niche microbiome.",

    "abstract": "The breadth of phenotypes influenced by the gut microbiome in multicellular hosts has attracted the keen and renewed interest of evolutionary biologists.\n\nComparative studies suggest that coevolutionary processes may occur as hosts and their associated microbes (i.e., holobionts) diverge. The majority of studies to date however lack information beyond that of 16S rRNA gene profiling, and thus fail to capture potential underlying genomic changes among microbes. In this study, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 19 newly sampled Bacteroides acidifaciens isolates derived from the eastern and western house mouse subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Through a panel of genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses applied to pangenomic content, structural gene rearrangements, and SNPs, we reveal several candidates for adaptation to the host subspecies environment. The proportion of significant loci in each respective category is small, indicating low levels of differentiation according host subspecies. However, consistent signal is observed for genes involved in processes such as carbohydrate acquisition/utilization (SusD/RagB, amyA and amyS) and de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis (purD), which serve as promising candidates for future experimental investigation in the house mouse as a model of holobiont evolution.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) genome organization becomes altered during development, aging, and disease, but the factors regulating chromatin topology are incompletely understood and currently no technology can efficiently screen for new regulators of long-range chromatin organization. Here, we developed an image-based high-content CRISPR screening platform that combines a new FISH-based barcode readout method (BARC-FISH) with chromatin tracing. We performed a pooled loss-of-function genetic screen in human cells and visualized alterations to their genome organization from 13,000 imaging target-perturbation combinations, alongside perturbation-paired barcode readout in the same single cells. Using 1.4 million 3D positions along chromosome traces, we identified 26 regulators of chromatin architectures at different length scales. We found that the ATP-dependent helicase CHD7, the loss of which causes the congenital syndrome CHARGE, cooperates with CTCF to promote large-scale chromatin compaction. Altogether, our method enables scalable, high-throughput identification of chromatin topology regulators that will stimulate new insights into the 3D genome.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryIn situ CRISPR screen, cellular barcoding, and chromatin tracing identify regulators of higher-order chromatin organization.",

For increased controllability, multi-input switches that integrate several cooperating and competing signals for the regulation of a shared output are of particular interest. The nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily offers promising starting points for engineering multi-input-controlled responses to clinically approved drugs. Starting from the VgEcR/RXR pair, we demonstrate that novel (multi-)drug regulation can be achieved by exchange of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) ligand binding domain (LBD) for other human NHR-derived LBDs. For responses activated to saturation by an agonist for the first LBD, we show that outputs can be boosted by an agonist targeting the second LBD. In combination with an antagonist, output levels are tunable by up to three simultaneously present small-molecule drugs. Such high-level control validates NHRs as a versatile, engineerable platform for programming multi-drug-controlled responses.",

    "abstract": "In healthy cells, pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family and BH3-only proteins are expressed in a delicate equilibrium. In contrast, this homeostasis is frequently perturbed in cancer cells due to the overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins. Variability in the expression and sequestration of these proteins in Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) likely contributes to variability in response to BH3-mimetics. Successful deployment of BH3-mimetics in DLBCL requires reliable predictions of which lymphoma cells will respond. Here we show that a computational systems biology approach enables accurate prediction of the sensitivity of DLBCL cells to BH3-mimetics. We found that fractional killing of DLBCL, can be explained by cell-to-cell variability in the molecular abundances of signaling proteins. Importantly, by combining protein interaction data with a knowledge of genetic lesions in DLBCL cells, our in silico models accurately predict in vitro response to BH3-mimetics. Furthermore, through virtual DLBCL cells we predict synergistic combinations of BH3-mimetics, which we then experimentally validated. These results show that computational systems biology models of apoptotic signaling, when constrained by experimental data, can facilitate the rational assignment of efficacious targeted inhibitors in B cell malignancies, paving the way for development of more personalized approaches to treatment.",

The key is the use cryo-preserved first-staged larvae raised to the infective third larval stage using activated charcoal mixed with uninfected feces from a permissive host.

    "abstract": "The production of dissolved organic matter during phytoplankton blooms and consumption by heterotrophic prokaryotes promotes marine carbon biogeochemical cycling. Although prokaryotic viruses are crucial biological entities, their dynamics during such blooms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the dynamics of coastal prokaryotic communities and viruses during blooms in a microcosm experiment using dissolved intracellular fractions of taxonomically distinct phytoplankton, the diatom Chaetoceros sp. (CIF) and the raphidophycean alga Heterosigma akashiwo (HIF). Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon and viral metagenomic analyses revealed that particular prokaryotes and prokaryotic viruses specifically increased in either CIF and HIF, indicating that different phytoplankton intracellular fractions promote distinct dynamics of not only prokaryotic community but also prokaryotic viruses. Our microcosm experiments and environmental data mining identified both known and novel possible host-virus pairs. In particular, a growth of phytoplanktonic organic matter-associated prokaryotes, such as Bacteroidetes Polaribacter and NS9 marine group, Vibrio spp., and Rhodobacteriales Nereida and Planktomarina, was accompanied by an increase in viruses predicted to infect Bacteroidetes, Vibrio, and Rhodobacteriales, respectively.

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is a major cause of hospital-acquired opportunistic infections. The increasing spread of pan-drug resistant strains, paired with a surge in virulence, makes A. baumannii top-ranking among the ESKAPE pathogens for which novel routes of treatment are urgently needed. Comparative genomics approaches have successfully identified genetic changes that coincide with the emergence of pathogenicity in Acinetobacter. Genes that are prevalent both in pathogenic and a-pathogenic Acinetobacter species were not considered ignoring that virulence factors may emerge by the modification of evolutionarily old and widespread proteins.\n\nHere, we increased the resolution of comparative genomics analyses to also include lineage-specific changes in protein domain architectures. Using type IVa pili (T4aP) as an example, we show that two pilus components, FimU and the pilus tip adhesin ComC, exist with markedly differing domain architectures in pathogenic Acinetobacter species. ComC, has gained a von Willebrand Factor type A domain displaying a finger-like protrusion, and we provide experimental evidence that this finger conveys virulence-related functions in A. baumannii. Both genes together form an evolutionary cassette, which has been replaced at least twice during A. baumannii diversification. The resulting strain-specific differences in T4aP layout suggests differences in the way how individual strains interact with their host. Our study underpins the hypothesis that A. baumannii uses T4aP for host infection as it was shown previously for other pathogens. It also indicates that many more functional complexes may exist whose precise function can be rapidly adjusted by changing the domain architecture of individual proteins.\n\nAuthor SummaryType IVa pili (T4aP) are hair-like, extendable, and retractable appendages that many bacteria use for interacting with their environment. Several human pathogens have independently recruited these pili for processes related to host infection, but the modifications necessary to turn T4aP into virulence factors are largely unknown. Here, we studied if and how T4aP components have changed in the nosocomial pathogen A. baumannii compared to its largely a-pathogenic relatives in the Acinetobacter genus. Most A. baumannii isolates have T4aP with a pilus tip adhesin containing a protein domain not seen outside the pathogenic clade. This domain is essential for bacterial motility and contributes to host cell adhesion and natural competence. However, some isolates have T4aP resembling those of largely a-pathogenic species in this genus. This indicates that the way these pili are used during infection processes differs between A. baumannii isolates probably as a result of niche adaptation. In a broader perspective, our findings highlight that many relevant genetic differences between pathogens and their a-pathogenic relatives emerge only on the domain- and sub-domain level. This suggests that comparative genomics studies have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg of genetic determinants that contribute to A. baumannii virulence.",

The molecular mechanisms that underlie this remarkable dormant state remain largely unknown. Here we show that m6A RNA methylation by Mettl3 is required for developmental pausing in mice by maintaining dormancy of paused embryonic stem cells and blastocysts. Mettl3 enforces transcriptional dormancy via two interconnected mechanisms: i) it promotes global mRNA destabilization and ii) suppresses global nascent transcription by specifically destabilizing the mRNA of the transcriptional amplifier and oncogene N-Myc, which we identify as a critical anti-pausing factor. Our findings reveal Mettl3 as a key orchestrator of the crosstalk between transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic regulation during pausing, with implications for dormancy in stem cells and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tripartite biotic interactions are inherently complex, and the strong interdependence of species and high levels of exploitation can make these systems short-lived and vulnerable to extinction. The persistence of species depends then on the balance between exploitation and avoidance of exploitation of the resource beyond the point where sustainable exploitation is no longer possible. We used this general prediction to test the potential for long-term persistence in a recently discovered tripartite microbial system in which a eukaryotic host is preyed upon by a giant virus that is in turn parasitized by a virophage. Host and virophage may benefit from this interaction because the virophage reduces the harmful effects of the giant virus on the host population over time and the virophage can survive integrated into the host genome when giant viruses are scarce. Here, we grew hosts in the presence and absence of the giant virus and virophage over ~280 host generations. We found that the three players persisted, but that the beneficial effect of the virophage for the host population diminished over time. We further tested whether the level of exploitation and replication evolved in the giant virus and/or virophage population over the course of the experiment and whether the changes were such that they avoid overexploitation. We found that the giant virus evolved towards lower replication levels and the virophage towards increased replication but decreased giant virus exploitation. These changes are predicted to facilitate persistence by lowering giant virus and host exploitation and consequently reducing the protective effect of the virophage.",

Trm10 is conserved throughout Eukarya and Archaea, and mutations in the human gene (TRMT10A) have been linked to neurological disorders such as microcephaly and intellectual disability, as well as defects in glucose metabolism. Of the 26 tRNAs in yeast with guanosine at position 9, only 14 are substrates for Trm10. However, no common sequence or other posttranscriptional modifications have been identified among these substrates, suggesting the presence of some other tRNA feature(s) which allow Trm10 to distinguish substrate from nonsubstrate tRNAs. Here, we show that substrate recognition by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Trm10 is dependent on both intrinsic tRNA flexibility and the ability of the enzyme to induce specific tRNA conformational changes upon binding. Using the sensitive RNA structure-probing method SHAPE, conformational changes upon binding to Trm10 in tRNA substrates, but not nonsubstrate, were identified and mapped onto a model of Trm10-bound tRNA. These changes may play an important role in substrate recognition by allowing Trm10 to gain access to the target nucleotide. Our results highlight a novel mechanism of substrate recognition by a conserved tRNA modifying enzyme. Further, these studies reveal a strategy for substrate recognition that may be broadly employed by tRNA-modifying enzymes which must distinguish between structurally similar tRNA species.",

In this study, we report on extending the gain in STED resolution into the optical axis to visualize dendritic spines in the hippocampus in vivo. The approach is based on a spatial light modulator to shape the focal STED light intensity in all three dimensions and a conically shaped window that is compatible with an objective that has a long working distance and a high numerical aperture. Moreover, we corrected distortions of the laser wavefront to optimize the shape of the bottle beam of the STED laser, which is required for 3D-STED microscopy.

We identified a network of proteins involved in actin remodelling, including Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family G member 3 (PLEKHG3), an actin-binding Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor enriched in protrusions. We show that GFP-PLEKHG3 accumulates in focal adhesion sites, where it colocalizes with peripheral lysosomes. Peripheral accumulation of lysosomes concentrates PLEKHG3 below the plasma membrane, inhibits protrusion formation and limits cell motility. Thus, subcellular positioning of lysosomes impacts PLEKHG3 subcellular localization and the cells protrusion activity, shape, and motility.

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration requires the highly coordinated cooperation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) with other cellular components. However, due to technical limitations, it remains unclear how MuSCs dynamically interact with non-myogenic cells, especially myeloid cells, in live animals. In this work, we developed a dual-laser multimodal nonlinear optical microscope platform to serve as an effective tool for studying the real-time interaction between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells during the early phase of muscle regeneration. Increased cell volume and mitochondrial mass, cell density, and myotube formation are indicative of MuSCs activation/growth, proliferation, and differentiation, respectively. Using 3D time-lapse imaging on live reporter mice containing both red fluorescence protein (RFP)-labeled macrophages and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-labeled MuSCs, and taking advantages of the autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), we monitored the real-time spatiotemporal interaction between RFP+ macrophages/RFP- non-myogenic cells and YFP+ muscle stem/progenitor cells during the activation and the proliferation stages of regeneration. Our results indicated that their cell-cell contact was transient in nature. By inhibiting macrophage infiltration, we further showed that direct cell-cell contact between macrophages and MuSCs was not required for early activation of MuSCs before the proliferation stage. However, decreased macrophage infiltration impeded the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs and also led to intramuscular fibrosis. Besides, neutrophil depletion in the CCR2 deficient mice did not delay the initial growth of MuSCs. These findings provide a new perspective on myeloid cells role during muscle regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The proper distribution of lipids within organelle membranes requires rapid, interorganelle lipid transport, much of which occurs at membrane contact sites and is mediated by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). Our current understanding of LTP mechanism and function is based largely on structural studies and in vitro reconstitution. Existing cellular assays for LTP function use indirect readouts, and it remains an open question as to whether substrate specificity and transport kinetics established in vitro are similar in cellular settings. Here, we harness bioorthogonal chemistry to develop tools for direct visualization of interorganelle transport of phospholipids between the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Unnatural fluorescent phospholipid analogs generated by the transphosphatidylation activity of phospholipase D (PLD) at the PM are rapidly transported to the ER dependent in large part upon extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts), a family of LTPs at ER-PM contact sites. Ectopic expression of an artificial E-Syt-based tether at ER-mitochondria contact sites results in fluorescent phospholipid accumulation in mitochondria. Finally, in vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that the fluorescent lipids are bona fide E-Syt substrates. Thus, fluorescent lipids generated in situ via PLD activity and bioorthogonal chemical tagging can enable direct visualization of the activity of LTPs that mediate bulk phospholipid transport at ER-PM contact sites.",

    "abstract": "A cells function is defined by its intrinsic characteristics and its niche: the tissue microenvironment in which it dwells. Here, we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data to discover cellular niches within eight regions of the human heart. We map cells to micro-anatomic locations and integrate knowledge-based and unsupervised structural annotations. For the first time, we profile the cells of the human cardiac conduction system, revealing their distinctive repertoire of ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and cell interactions using a custom CellPhoneDB.org module. We show that the sinoatrial node is compartmentalised, with a core of pacemaker cells, fibroblasts and glial cells supporting paracrine glutamatergic signalling. We introduce a druggable target prediction tool, drug2cell, which leverages single-cell profiles and drug-target interactions, providing unexpected mechanistic insights into the chronotropic effects of drugs, including GLP-1 analogues. In the epicardium, we show enrichment of both IgG+ and IgA+ plasma cells forming immune niches which may contribute to infection defence. We define a ventricular myocardial-stress niche enriched for activated fibroblasts and stressed cardiomyocytes, cell states that are expanded in cardiomyopathies. Overall, we provide new clarity to cardiac electro-anatomy and immunology, and our suite of computational approaches can be deployed to other tissues and organs.",
