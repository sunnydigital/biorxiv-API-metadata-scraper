    "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity is an important driver of treatment failure in cancer since therapies often select for drug-tolerant or drug-resistant cellular subpopulations that drive tumor growth and recurrence. Profiling the drug-response heterogeneity of tumor samples using traditional genomic deconvolution methods has yielded limited results, due in part to the imperfect mapping between genomic variation and functional characteristics. Here, we leverage mechanistic population modeling to develop a statistical framework for profiling phenotypic heterogeneity from standard drug screen data on bulk tumor samples. This method, called PhenoPop, reliably identifies tumor subpopulations exhibiting differential drug responses, and estimates their drug-sensitivities and frequencies within the bulk. We apply PhenoPop to synthetically-generated cell populations, mixed cell-line experiments, and multiple myeloma patient samples, and demonstrate how it can provide individualized predictions of tumor growth under candidate therapies. This methodology can also be applied to deconvolution problems in a variety of biological settings beyond cancer drug response.\n\nMotivationTumors are typically comprised of heterogeneous cell populations exhibiting diverse phenotypes. This heterogeneity, which is correlated with tumor aggressiveness and treatment failure, confounds current drug screening efforts aimed at informing therapy selection. In order to optimally select treatments, understanding the frequency and drug-response profile of individual subpopulations within a tumor is critical. Furthermore, quantitative profiles of tumor drug-response heterogeneity, in combination with predictive mathematical modeling of tumor dynamics, can be used to design effective temporal drug-sequencing strategies for tumor reduction.\n\nHere, we present a method that enables the deconvolution of tumor samples into individual sub-components exhibiting differential drug-response. This method relies on standard bulk drug-screen measurements and outputs the frequencies and drug-sensitivities of tumor subpopulations. This framework can also be applied more broadly to deconvolve cellular populations with heterogeneous responses to a variety of external stimuli and environmental factors.",

An autocrine feedback mechanism of GH/IGF1/SST (Growth hormone/Insulin-like growth factor 1/Somatostatin) signaling, mediated by GHRH/GHRH-R (Growth hormone-releasing hormone/GHRH-Receptor), is established specifically in NKX2-5 (NK2 Homeobox 5) expressing myocardial cells which affects HIF-1 stability through cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) or cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) activity. cAMP-mediated HIF-1 stabilization fuels Warburg metabolism and enhances NKX2-5 expression, limiting the developmental and regenerative growth of cardiomyoblasts. In contrast, cGMP-mediated HIF- 1 inhibition (or knock-out of HIF-1) redirects glycolytically derived citrate toward long-chain saturated fatty acid biosynthesis, leading to enhanced developmental and regenerative growth of cardiomyoblasts. These findings suggest that HIF1-mediated glycolysis serves as a rate-limiting, O2-independent sensor of cardiomyogenesis and that targeting GHRH/GHRH-R signaling could be a therapeutic strategy for regenerating the mammalian heart post-injury.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/478572v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d3f74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16115edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e68dc7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@660861_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSummary Figure.C_FLOATNO Cardiomyoblast proliferative capacity is regulated by HIF1-mediated metabolic profile, through an NKX2-5 lineage-specific, O2-independent feedback mechanism.\n\n(A), HIF-1 is aerobically regulated through the intracellular activation of cAMP and cGMP in response to a GH1/IGF1/SST feedback mechanism, which activates the GHRH/GHRH-R signaling pathway in NKX2-5+ cardiomyoblasts. Stabilized HIF-1 (e.g. by CoCl2) promotes Warburg metabolism and cell cycle exit, whereas knockout or inhibition (e.g. YC-1) of HIF-1 or cAMP (low-dose metformin) promotes de novo fatty acid synthesis and enhances cardiomyoblast proliferation. (B), HIF-1 aerobic stabilization switches the metabolism towards glycolysis and restricts cardiomyoblast proliferation.

    "abstract": "Each year, fungi cause more than 1.5 billion infections worldwide and have a devastating impact on human health, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or patients in intensive care units. The limited antifungal arsenal and emerging multidrug resistant species necessitate the development of new therapies. One strategy for combating drug resistant pathogens is the administration of molecules that restore fungal susceptibility to approved drugs. Accordingly, we carried out a screen to identify small molecules that could restore the susceptibility of pathogenic Candida species to azole antifungals. This screening effort led to the discovery of novel 1,4-benzodiazepines that restore fluconazole susceptibility in resistant isolates of Candida albicans, as evidenced by 100-1000-fold potentiation of fluconazole activity. This potentiation effect was also observed in azole-tolerant strains of C. albicans and in other pathogenic Candida species. The 1,4-benzodiazepines selectively potentiated different azoles, but not other approved antifungals. A remarkable feature of the potentiation was that the combination of the compounds with fluconazole was fungicidal, whereas fluconazole alone is fungistatic. Interestingly, the potentiators were not toxic to C. albicans in the absence of fluconazole, but inhibited virulence-associated filamentation of the fungus. We found that the combination of the potentiators and fluconazole significantly enhanced host survival in a Galleria mellonella model of systemic fungal infection. Taken together, these observations validate a strategy wherein small molecules can restore the activity of highly used anti-infectives that have lost potency.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn the last decade, we have been witnessing a higher incidence of fungal infections, due to an expansion of the fungal species capable of causing disease (e.g., Candida auris), as well as increased antifungal drug resistance. Among human fungal pathogens, Candida species are a leading cause of invasive infections and are associated with high mortality rates. Infections by these pathogens are commonly treated with azole antifungals, yet the expansion of drug-resistant isolates have reduced their clinical utility. In this work, we describe the discovery and characterization of small molecules that potentiate fluconazole and restore the susceptibility of azole-resistant and azole-tolerant Candida isolates. Interestingly, the potentiating 1,4-benzodiazepines were not toxic to fungal cells but inhibited their virulence-associated filamentous growth. Furthermore, combinations of the potentiators and fluconazole decreased fungal burdens and enhanced host survival in a Galleria mellonella model of systemic fungal infections. Accordingly, we propose the use of novel antifungal potentiators as a powerful strategy for addressing the growing resistance of fungi to clinically approved drugs.",

    "abstract": "Kale are a group of diverse Brassicaceae species that are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated and/or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content; however, being a non-model organism, foundational, systems-level analyses of kale are lacking. Previous studies in kale have shown that time-of-day harvesting can affect its nutritional composition. Therefore, to gain a systems-level diel understanding of kale across its wide-ranging and diverse genetic landscape, we selected nine publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under near-sunlight LED light conditions ideal for vertical farming. We then analyzed changes in morphology, growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As the diel molecular activities of plants drive their daily growth and development, ultimately determining their productivity as a crop, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel proteome and metabolome signatures divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our multi-cultivar, multi-omic analysis provides robust quantitative insights into the molecular underpinnings of the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green super-food for next-generation horticulture / vertical farming applications.",

    "abstract": "Colour is often used as an aposematic warning signal, with predator learning expected to lead to a single colour pattern within a population. However, there are many puzzling cases where aposematic signals are also polymorphic. The wood tiger moth, Arctia plantaginis, displays bright hindwing colours associated with unpalatability, and males have discrete colour morphs which vary in frequency between localities. In Finland, both white and yellow morphs can be found, and these colour morphs also differ in behavioural and life-history traits. Here, we show that male colour is linked to an extra copy of a yellow family gene that is only present in the white morphs. This white-specific duplication, which we name valkea, is highly upregulated during wing development, and CRISPR knockouts validate the role of valkea in producing white wing colour. We also characterise the pigments responsible for yellow, white and black colouration, showing that yellow is partly produced by pheomelanins, while black is dopamine-derived eumelanin. Our results add to a growing number of studies on the genetic architecture of complex and seemingly paradoxical polymorphisms, and the role of gene duplications and structural variation in adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Heterospecific communication is common for birds when mobbing a predator. However, joining the mob should depend on the number of callers already enrolled, as larger mobs imply lower individual risks for the newcomer. In addition, some  community informant species seem more reliable regarding the information transferred in mobbing calls. Birds should therefore rely on both the number of callers and the species identity of the caller(s) when mobbing. In the present study, we tested the potential interaction between two acoustic cues. In a playback experiment, we modified the number of callers (through an increased number of calling individuals correlated to an increased duty cycle) and the emitter species (crested tits versus coal tits). Overall, we found that soundtracks with three callers triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with one caller and that soundtracks with coal tits calls triggered more mobbing than soundtracks with crested tits calls. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that birds consider both the species and the number of callers when joining a mobbing chorus in winter. Finally, we replicated the experiment in spring and did not record the same responses from the bird community. Indeed, only soundtracks with three coal tits triggered a mobbing response, suggesting therefore that the seasonal context can affect the results of studies on heterospecific communication. The potential mechanisms implicated in the varying responses to different acoustic cues and different seasons are discussed and should deserve further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) or pontine (P) waves have long been recognized as an electrophysiological signature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, P-waves can be observed not just during REM sleep, but also during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Recent studies have uncovered that P-waves are functionally coupled with hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) during NREM sleep. However, it remains unclear to what extent P-waves during NREM sleep share their characteristics with P-waves during REM sleep and how the functional coupling to P-waves modulates SWRs. Here, we address these issues by performing multiple types of electrophysiological recordings and fiber photometry in both sexes of mice. P-waves during NREM sleep share their waveform shapes and local neural ensemble dynamics at a short ([~]100 ms) timescale with their REM sleep counterparts. However, the dynamics of mesopontine cholinergic neurons are distinct at a longer ([~]10 s) timescale: although P-waves are accompanied by cholinergic transients, the cholinergic tone gradually reduces before P-wave genesis during NREM sleep. While P-waves are coupled to hippocampal theta rhythms during REM sleep, P-waves during NREM sleep are accompanied by a rapid reduction in hippocampal ripple power. SWRs coupled with P-waves are short-lived and hippocampal neural firing is also reduced after P-waves. These results demonstrate that P-waves are part of coordinated sleep-related activity by functionally coupling with hippocampal ensembles in a state-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the effect of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is key to elucidate how neural networks change over long timescales and to design interventions aimed at modulating such networks in neurological disorders. However, progress is restricted by the significant computational cost associated with simulating neural network models with STDP, and by the lack of low-dimensional description that could provide analytical insights. Phase-difference-dependent plasticity (PDDP) rules approximate STDP in phase oscillator networks, which prescribe synaptic changes based on phase differences of neuron pairs rather than differences in spike timing. Here we construct mean-field approximations for phase oscillator networks with STDP to describe part of the phase space for this very high dimensional system. We first show that single-harmonic PDDP rules can approximate a simple form of symmetric STDP, while multi-harmonic rules are required to accurately approximate causal STDP. We then derive exact expressions for the evolution of the average PDDP coupling weight in terms of network synchrony. For adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators that form clusters, we formulate a family of low-dimensional descriptions based on the mean field dynamics of each cluster and average coupling weights between and within clusters. Finally, we show that such a two-cluster mean-field model can be fitted to synthetic data to provide a low-dimensional approximation of a full adaptive network with symmetric STDP. Our framework represents a step towards a low-dimensional description of adaptive networks with STDP, and could for example inform the development of new therapies aimed at maximizing the long-lasting effects of brain stimulation.",

Since the glucose importer, GLUT1, is a highly enriched phenotypic marker of NP cells, we hypothesized that it is vital for the development and post-natal maintenance of the disc. Surprisingly, primary NP cells treated with two well-characterized GLUT1 inhibitors maintained normal rates of glycolysis and ATP production, indicating intrinsic compensatory mechanisms. We show in vitro that NP cells mitigate GLUT1 loss by rewiring glucose import through GLUT3. Noteworthy, we demonstrate that substrates, such as glutamine and palmitate, do not compensate for glucose restriction resulting from dual inhibition of GLUT1/3 and inhibition compromises long-term cell viability. To investigate the redundancy of GLUT1 function in NP, we generated two NP-specific knockout mice: Krt19CreERT; Glut1f/f and Foxa2Cre; Glut1f/f. Noteworthy, there were no apparent defects in post-natal disc health or development and maturation in mutant mice. Microarray analysis confirmed that GLUT1 loss did not cause transcriptomic alterations in the NP, supporting that cells are refractory to GLUT1 loss. These observations provide the first evidence of functional redundancy in GLUT transporters in the physiologically hypoxic intervertebral disc and underscore the importance of glucose as the indispensable substrate for NP cells.",

These domains are enriched in polyisoprenoid lipids and scaffolding proteins belonging to the Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin, and HflK/C (SPFH) protein superfamily that was also identified in Gram-positive bacteria. By contrast, little is still known about FMMs in Gram-negative bacteria. In Escherichia coli K12, 4 SPFH proteins, YqiK, QmcA, HflK, and HflC, were shown to localize in discrete polar or lateral inner-membrane locations, raising the possibility that E. coli SPFH proteins could contribute to the assembly of inner-membrane FMMs and the regulation of cellular processes.\n\nHere we studied the determinant of the localization of QmcA and HflC and showed that FMM-associated cardiolipin lipid biosynthesis is required for their native localization pattern. Using Biolog phenotypic arrays, we showed that a mutant lacking all SPFH genes displayed increased sensitivity to aminoglycosides and oxidative stress that is due to the absence of HflKC. Our study therefore provides further insights into the contribution of SPFH proteins to stress tolerance in E. coli.\n\nIMPORTANCEEukaryotic cells often segregate physiological processes in cholesterol-rich functional membrane micro-domains.

This suggests that cardiolipins contribute to E. coli membrane microdomain assembly.

    "abstract": "Spreading depolarization (SD) is a massive wave of cellular depolarization that slowly migrates across the brain gray matter. Cortical SD is frequently generated following brain injury, while less is understood about its potential contribution to genetic disorders of hyperexcitability, such as SCN1A deficient epilepsy in which febrile seizure often contributes to disease initiation. Here we report that spontaneous SD waves are a predominant EEG abnormality in the Scn1a deficient mouse (Scn1a+/R1407X) and undergo sustained intensification following a single hyperthermic seizure. Chronic DC-band EEG recording detected spontaneous SDs, seizures, and seizure-SD complexes in Scn1a+/R1407X mice but not wild-type littermates. The SD events were infrequent, while a single hyperthermia-induced seizure robustly increased SD frequency over four-fold during the initial postictal week. This prolonged neurological aftermath could be suppressed by memantine administration. Video, electromyogram (EMG), and EEG spectral analysis revealed distinct neurobehavioral patterns; individual seizures were associated with increased motor activities, while SDs were generally associated with immobility. We also identified a stereotypic SD prodrome, detectable over a minute before the onset of the DC potential shift, characterized by increased motor activity and bilateral EEG frequency changes. Our study suggests that cortical SD is a pathological manifestation in SCN1A deficient epileptic encephalopathy.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state fMRI is commonly used to derive brain parcellations, which are widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpreting human neuroscience studies. We previously developed a model that integrates local and global approaches for estimating areal-level cortical parcellations. The resulting local-global parcellations are often referred to as the Schaefer parcellations. However, the lack of homotopic correspondence between left and right Schaefer parcels has limited their use for brain lateralization studies. Here, we extend our previous model to derive homotopic areal-level parcellations. Using resting-fMRI and task-fMRI across diverse scanners, acquisition protocols, preprocessing and demographics, we show that the resulting homotopic parcellations are as homogeneous as the Schaefer parcellations, while being more homogeneous than five publicly available parcellations. Furthermore, weaker correlations between homotopic parcels are associated with greater lateralization in resting network organization, as well as lateralization in language and motor task activation. Finally, the homotopic parcellations agree with the boundaries of a number of cortical areas estimated from histology and visuotopic fMRI, while capturing sub-areal (e.g., somatotopic and visuotopic) features. Overall, these results suggest that the homotopic local- global parcellations represent neurobiologically meaningful subdivisions of the human cerebral cortex and will be a useful resource for future studies. Multi-resolution parcellations estimated from 1479 participants are publicly available (GITHUB_LINK).",

Cells have the capability of modeling matrix in distance, however, the biophysical mechanism is largely unknown. We investigated underlying mechanism of large collagen I (COL) fibrillary modeling by cell mechanics with designed arrays of cell clusters. By incorporating dynamic contractions, Molecular Dynamics simulations yielded highly matching isotropic outcomes with observed COL clustering in experiments from variable geometrical arrays without spatial limitation. Further designed single polygons from triangles to hexagons resulted in predicted structural assembly which showed maintained spatial balance. Cell cytoskeletal integrity (actin filaments, microtubules), actomyosin contractions, and endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels were essential for remote fiber inductions, while membrane mechanosensitive integrin and Piezo showed coordinative role in regulating the fiber assembly. The study provides new insights on cell mechanics-induced isotropic matrix modeling with dynamic large-spatial scales and the associated cellular mechanism. The assembled biomechanical scaffolds with pre-designs may lead to applications in micro-tissue engineering.

    "abstract": "Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 still threaten the effectiveness of currently deployed vaccines, and antivirals can prove to be an effective therapeutic option for attenuating it. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive target due to its sequence conservation and critical role in the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. PLpro also plays very important role in modulation of host immune responses by deubiquitinating (DUBs) or deISGylating host proteins. Thus, targeting PLpro serves as a two-pronged approach to abate SARS-CoV-2. Due to its structural and functional similarities with the host DUB enzymes, an in-house library of DUB inhibitors was constituted in this study. Five promising compounds exhibiting high binding affinities with the substrate binding site of PLpro were identified from a library of 81 compounds with in silico screening, docking, and simulation studies. Interestingly, lithocholic acid, linagliptin, teneligliptin, and flupenthixol significantly inhibited the proteolytic activity of PLpro. Each of these compounds abrogated in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 values in the range of 5-21 M. In addition, crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and its complex with inhibitors have been determined that revealed their inhibitory mechanism. The findings of this study provide the proof-of-principle that the DUB inhibitors hold high potential as a new class of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, this is the first study that has opened a new avenue towards not only targeting PLpro active site but also simultaneously directing towards restoration of antiviral immune response of the host for deterring SARS-CoV-2.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516107v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7d0c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab9c13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@93d3f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14021e6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Collagen is the main load-bearing component of cornea and sclera. When stretched, both of these tissues exhibit a behavior known as collagen fiber recruitment. In recruitment, as the tissues stretch the constitutive collagen fibers lose their natural waviness, progressively straightening. Recruited, straight, fibers bear substantially more mechanical load than non-recruited, wavy, fibers. As such, the process of recruitment underlies the well-established nonlinear macroscopic behavior of the corneoscleral shell. Recruitment has an interesting implication: when recruitment is incomplete, only a fraction of the collagen fibers is actually contributing to bear the loads, with the rest remaining \"in reserve\". In other words, at a given intraocular pressure (IOP), it is possible that not all the collagen fibers of the cornea and sclera are actually contributing to bear the loads.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the fraction of corneoscleral shell fibers recruited and contributing to bear the load of IOP has not been reported. Our goal was to obtain regionally-resolved estimates of the fraction of corneoscleral collagen fibers recruited and in reserve. We developed a fiber-based microstructural constitutive model that could account for collagen fiber undulations or crimp via their tortuosity. We used experimentally-measured collagen fiber crimp tortuosity distributions in human eyes to derive region-specific nonlinear hyperelastic mechanical properties. We then built a three-dimensional axisymmetric model of the globe, assigning region-specific mechanical properties and regional anisotropy. The model was used to simulate the IOP-induced shell deformation. The model-predicted tissue stretch was then used to quantify collagen recruitment within each shell region. The calculations showed that, at low IOPs, collagen fibers in the posterior equator were recruited the fastest, such that at a physiologic IOP of 15 mmHg, over 90% of fibers were recruited, compared with only a third in the cornea and the peripapillary sclera. The differences in recruitment between regions, in turn, mean that at a physiologic IOP the posterior equator had a fiber reserve of only 10%, whereas the cornea and peripapillary sclera had two thirds. At an elevated IOP of 50 mmHg, collagen fibers in the limbus and the anterior/posterior equator were almost fully recruited, compared with 90% in the cornea and the posterior sclera, and 70% in the peripapillary sclera and the equator. That even at such an elevated IOP not all the fibers were recruited suggests that there are likely other conditions that challenge the corneoscleral tissues even more than IOP. The fraction of fibers recruited may have other potential implications. For example, fibers that are not bearing loads may be more susceptible to enzymatic digestion or remodeling. Similarly, it may be possible to control tissue stiffness through the fraction of recruited fibers without the need to add or remove collagen.",

Using 209 army ant samples collected from 29 colonies and the virion-associated nucleic acid-based metagenomics approach, we showed that a broad diversity of bacterial, plant, invertebrate and vertebrate viral sequences were accumulated by army ants: including sequences from 157 different viral genera in 56 viral families. This suggests that using predators and scavengers such as army ants to sample broad swathes of tropical forest viromes can shed light on the composition and the structure of viral populations of these complex and inaccessible ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reinforced efforts for developing effective vaccination strategy for existing and emerging viruses. Currently there are various vaccine technology available for treating viral diseases, however it is imperative to develop and investigate second-generation vaccines such as chimeric virus-like particles (chi-VLPs) vaccine for increased immunogenicity, ease of production and scalability to supplement the worldwide vaccine supply. Intriguingly, chi-VLPs expresses more than one antigenic epitope on its surface, hence it is expected to be a more effective vaccine candidate. Hereby, this study reports, a novel bivalent vaccine design of chimeric alphavirus coronavirus virus-like particles (ChAC-VLPs), displaying fusion glycoproteins of CHIKV and receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 on its surface. Uniqueness and versatility of ChAC-VLPs has been demonstrated via a various techniques including Western blot, Immunofluorescence, cryoEM, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The multimeric epitope display of immunogenic antigens, i.e CHIKV envelop glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 RBD was validated by cell-based assays. ChAC-VLP immunized mice has shown substantial neutralization titres for CHIKV (PRNT50 of 1:25) from the serum collected after 2nd booster doses. Similarly, serum antibodies were detected for SARS-CoV2 RBD as observed by antigen specific ELISA and validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR binding response was detected to be >200 RU for anti-RBD antibody in post-immunized mice sera. In conclusion, present study proposes ChAC-VLPs as a potential hybrid vaccine candidate for CHIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes valuable insights in chi-VLPs domain.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a key driver of bacterial evolution via transmission of genetic materials across taxa. Class 1 integrons are genetic elements that correlate strongly with anthropogenic pollution and contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes via HGT. Despite their significance to human health, there is a shortage of robust, culture-free surveillance technologies for identifying uncultivated environmental taxa that harbour class 1 integrons. We developed a modified version of epicPCR (emulsion, paired isolation and concatenation polymerase chain reaction) that links class 1 integrons amplified from single bacterial cells to taxonomic markers from the same cells in emulsified aqueous droplets. Using this single-cell genomic approach and Nanopore sequencing, we successfully assigned class 1 integron gene cassette arrays containing mostly AMR genes to their hosts in coastal water samples that were affected by pollution. Our work presents the first application of epicPCR for targeting variable, multi-gene loci of interest. We also identified the Rhizobacter genus as novel hosts of class 1 integrons. These findings establish epicPCR as a powerful tool for linking taxa to class 1 integrons in environmental bacterial communities and offer the potential to direct mitigation efforts towards hotspots of class 1 integron-mediated dissemination of AMR.\n\nSynopsisWe present a novel single-cell genomic surveillance technology for identifying environmental bacterial hosts of a class of mobile genetic elements that are linked to anthropogenic pollution and contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Vast majority of cellular activities are carried out by protein complexes that assembled dynamically in response to cellular needs and environmental cues. Large scale efforts had uncovered a large repertoire of functionally uncharacterized protein complexes which necessitate new strategies to delineate their roles in various cellular activities and diseases. Thermal proximity co-aggregation profiling could be readily deployed to simultaneously characterize the dynamics for hundreds to thousands of protein complexes in situ across different cellular conditions. Toward this goal, we had optimized the original method both experimentally and computationally. In this new iteration termed Slim-TPCA, fewer temperatures are used which increase throughputs by over 3X, while coupled with new scoring metrics and statistical evaluation resulted in minimal compromise in coverage and the detection of more relevant protein complexes. Overall, less samples are needed, false positives from batch effects are minimized and statistical evaluation time is reduced by two orders of magnitude. We applied Slim-TPCA to profile state of protein complexes in K562 cells under different duration of glucose deprivation. More protein complexes are found dissociated based on TPCA signature in accordance with expected downregulation of most cellular activities. These complexes include 55S ribosome and various respiratory complexes in mitochondria revealing the utility of TPCA to study protein complexes in organelles. On other hand, protein complexes involved in protein transport and degradation are found increasingly associated revealing their involvement in metabolic reprogramming during glucose deprivation. In summary. Slim-TPCA is an efficient strategy for proteome-wide characterization of protein complexes. The various algorithmic improvement of Slim-TPCA is available as Python package at https://pypi.org/project/Slim-TPCA/",

Smaug proteins contain a characteristic RNA-binding sterile- motif (SAM) domain and a conserved but uncharacterized N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we resolved the crystal structure of the NTD of the human SAM domain-containing protein 4A (SAMD4A, a.k.a.

Furthermore, we show that Drosophila Smaug directly interacts with the Drosophila germline inducer Oskar and with the Hedgehog signaling transducer Smoothened through its D-PHAT domain. We determined the crystal structure of the D-PHAT domain of Smaug in complex with a Smoothened -helical peptide to 1.61 [A] resolution. The peptide binds within a groove that is formed by both the D- and PHAT subdomains. Structural modeling supported by experimental data suggested that an -helix within the disordered region of Oskar binds to the D-PHAT domain in a mode similar to Smoothened. Together, our data uncover the N-terminal D-PHAT domain of Smaug as peptide-binding domain.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques are being used to design new proteins by creating target backbone geometries and finding sequences that can fold into those shapes. While methods like ProteinMPNN provide an efficient algorithm for generating sequences for a given protein backbone, there is still room for improving the scope and computational efficiency of backbone generation. Here, we report a backbone hallucination protocol that uses a relaxed sequence representation. Our method enables protein backbone generation using a gradient descent driven hallucination approach and offers orders-of-magnitude efficiency enhancements over previous hallucination approaches. We designed and experimentally produced over 50 proteins, most of which expressed well in E. Coli, were soluble and adopted the desired oligomeric state along with the correct composition of secondary structure as measured by CD. Exemplarily, we determined 3D electron density maps using single-particle cryo EM analysis for three single-chain de-novo proteins comprising 600 AA which closely matched with the designed shape. These have no structural analogues in the protein data bank (PDB), representing potentially novel folds or arrangement of domains. Our approach broadens the scope of de novo protein design and contributes to accessibility to a wider community.",

    "abstract": "We recently discovered that some bacteriophages establish a nucleus-like replication compartment (phage nucleus), but the core genes that define nucleus-based phage replication and their phylogenetic distribution were unknown. By studying phages that encode the major phage nucleus protein chimallin, including previously sequenced yet uncharacterized phages, we discovered that chimallin-encoding phages share a set of 72 highly conserved genes encoded within seven distinct gene blocks. Of these, 21 core genes are unique to this group, and all but one of these unique genes encode proteins of unknown function. We propose that phages with this core genome comprise a novel viral family we term Chimalliviridae. Fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography studies of Erwinia phage vB_EamM_RAY confirm that many of the key steps of nucleus-based replication encoded in the core genome are conserved among diverse chimalliviruses, and reveal that non-core components can confer intriguing variations on this replication mechanism. For instance, unlike previously studied nucleus-forming phages, RAY doesnt degrade the host genome, and its PhuZ homolog appears to form a five-stranded filament with a lumen. This work expands our understanding of phage nucleus and PhuZ spindle diversity and function, providing a roadmap for identifying key mechanisms underlying nucleus-based phage replication.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved several mechanisms to counter host defense arsenal for its proliferation. We show that Mtb employs multi-pronged approach to modify host epigenetic machinery for its survival upon infection. It secretes methyltransferase (MTase) Rv2067c into macrophages, trimethylating K79 of histone H3 in non-nucleosomal context. Rv2067c downregulates host MTase DOT1L, decreasing its H3K79me3 mark added nucleosomally on pro-inflammatory response genes. Consequent inhibition of caspase8 dependent apoptosis and enhancement of RIPK3 mediated necrosis results in increased pathogenesis. In parallel, Rv2067c enhances the expression of SESTRIN3, NLRC3 and TMTC1 enabling the pathogen to overcome host inflammatory and oxidative response. We provide structural basis for differential methylation of H3 by Rv2067c and DOT1L. The structure of Rv2067c and DOT1L explain how their action on H3K79 is temporally and spatially separated enabling Rv2067c to effectively intercept the host epigenetic circuit and downstream signalling.",

    "abstract": "Contamination of water with bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens can cause human diseases. Both humans and non-humans can release these pathogens through their feces. To identify the sources of fecal contamination in the water environment, microbial source tracking (MST) approaches have been developed; however, the relationship between MST markers and pathogens is still not well understood most likely due to the lack of comprehensive datasets of pathogens and MST marker concentrations. In this study, we developed a novel microfluidic quantitative PCR (MFQPCR) platform for the simultaneous quantification of MST markers, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens in many samples. A total of 80 previously validated TaqMan probe assays were applied on the MFQPCR chips, including those for two FIB, 22 bacterial pathogens, 11 viral pathogens, five protozoan pathogens, 37 MST markers for various host species, and three process controls. Specific and sensitive detection was verified for most assays on the MFQPCR platform. The MFQPCR chip was applied to analyze pathogen removal rates during the wastewater treatment processes. In addition, multiple host-specific MST markers, FIB, and pathogens were successfully quantified in human and avian-impacted surface waters. While the genes for pathogens were relatively infrequently detected, positive correlations were observed between some potential pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens and Mycobacterium spp., and human MST markers. The MFQPCR chips developed in this study, therefore, can provide useful information to monitor and improve water quality.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat to human and animal health. Due to the rise of multi- and extreme drug resistance, last resort antibiotics, such as colistin, are extremely important in human medicine. While the distribution of colistin resistance genes can be tracked through sequencing methods, phenotypic characterization of putative antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes is still important to confirm the phenotype conferred by different genes. While heterologous expression of AMR genes (e.g., in E. coli) is a common approach, so far, no standard method for heterologous expression and characterization of mcr genes exists. E. coli B-strains, designed for optimum protein expression, are frequently utilized. Here we report that four E. coli B-strains are intrinsically resistant to colistin (MIC 8 - 16 g/mL). Additionally, the three tested B-strains that encode T7 RNA show growth defects when transformed with empty or gene-expressing pET17b plasmids and grown in the presence of IPTG; K-12 or B-strains without T7 RNA polymerase do not show these growth defects. The E. coli Shuffle T7 express strain carrying empty pET17b also showed a heteroresistance phenotype when exposed to colistin in the presence of IPTG. These phenotypes could explain why B-strains were erroneously reported as colistin susceptible. Analysis of existing genome data identified one nonsynonymous change in each pmrA and pmrB in all four E. coli B-strains; the E121K change in PmrB has previously been linked to intrinsic colistin resistance. We conclude that E. coli B-strains are not appropriate heterologous expression hosts for identification and characterization of mcr genes.",

In this study, we demonstrated that U1 AMO could disrupt U1 snRNP structure both in vitro and in vivo, thereby affecting U1 snRNP/RNAP polymerase II (RNAPII) interaction. We further showed that U1 AMO treatment might promote RNAPII disassociation with pre-mRNA in an RNA pull-down assay. By performing ChIP-seq for phosphorylation of Ser2 (Ser2P) and Ser5 (Ser5P) of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), we showed that transcription elongation was disturbed upon U1 AMO treatment, with a particular high Ser2P signal at intronic cryptic polyadenylation sites (PASs). In addition, we showed that core 3 processing factors CPSF/CstF are involved in the processing of intronic cryptic PAS. Their recruitment accumulated toward cryptic PASs upon U1 AMO treatment, as indicated by ChIP-seq and iCLIP-seq analysis. Furthermore, we showed that most of these PCPAed transcripts could be exported to cytoplasm and have the potential to be translated. Conclusively, our data provide more insight into U1 snRNP telescripting, and suggest a common theme that modulation of transcription elongation may be an important mode for the regulation of mRNA polyadenylation.",

To delineate populations and identify potential zones of hybridisation, we conducted a discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), admixture analysis, and calculated pairwise Fst values. The DAPC revealed four clusters: southern California, eastern Rocky Mountains, northwestern Rocky Mountains and Oregon/northern California. We then used BayeScEnv to highlight significant outlier SNPs associated with the five environmental variables. We identified over 150 genes linked to outlier SNPs associated with more than 15 pathways, including stress response and circadian rhythm. We also found a strong signal of isolation by distance. Local temperature was highly correlated with genetic distance.

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen responsible for an acute musculo-skeletal disease in humans. The viral RNA genome replication occurs in membrane spherules named replication organelles (ROs). In this work, we investigate the native structural organization of CHIKV ROs in their cellular context using in situ cryogenic-electron microscopy approaches at late replication stage. We observed previously unreported diameter heterogeneity of ROs at the plasma membrane of infected human cells. CHIKV ROs were only marginally detected in cytopathic vacuoles where they are homogeneous in size, suggesting a finely regulated internalization process. Our data show that ROs maintained at the plasma membrane beyond the first viral cycle are dynamically active both in viral RNA replication, in its export to the cell cytosol, but also in the production of viral proteins. We suggest that late CHIKV ROs have an amplifying role or represent an alternative pathway in the production of infectious viral particles. All these observations bring new insight into the CHIKV life cycle in human cells.",

    "abstract": "The retroviral Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays a central role in the selection of unspliced viral genomic RNA for packaging into new virions. Previously, we demonstrated that full-length HIV-1 Gag undergoes nuclear trafficking where it associates with unspliced viral RNA (vRNA) at transcription sites. To further explore the kinetics of HIV-1 Gag nuclear localization, we used biochemical and imaging techniques to examine the timing of HIV-1 entry into the nucleus. We also aimed to determine more precisely Gags subnuclear distribution to test the hypothesis that Gag would be associated with euchromatin, the transcriptionally active region of the nucleus. We observed that HIV-1 Gag localized to the nucleus shortly after its synthesis in the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear trafficking was not strictly concentration-dependent. Furthermore, we found that HIV-1 Gag preferentially localized to the transcriptionally active euchromatin fraction compared to the heterochromatin-rich region in a latently-infected CD4+ T cell line (J-Lat 10.6) treated with latency-reversal agents. Interestingly, HIV-1 Gag was more closely associated with transcriptionally-active histone markers near the nuclear periphery, where the HIV-1 provirus was previously shown to integrate. Although the precise function of Gags association with histones in transcriptionally-active chromatin remains uncertain, together with previous reports, this finding is consistent with a potential role for euchromatin-associated Gag molecules to select newly transcribed unspliced vRNA during the initial stage of virion assembly.\n\nImportanceThe traditional view of retroviral assembly posits that HIV-1 Gag selection of unspliced vRNA begins in the cytoplasm. However, our previous studies demonstrated that HIV-1 Gag enters the nucleus and binds to unspliced HIV-1 RNA at transcription sites, suggesting that genomic RNA selection may occur in the nucleus. In the present study, we observed nuclear entry of HIV-1 Gag and co-localization with unspliced viral RNA within 8 hours post-expression. In CD4+ T cells (J-Lat 10.6) treated with latency reversal agents, as well as a HeLa cell line stably expressing an inducible Rev-dependent provirus, we found that HIV-1 Gag preferentially localized with histone marks associated with enhancer and promoter regions of transcriptionally active euchromatin near the nuclear periphery, which favors HIV-1 proviral integration sites. These observations support the hypothesis that HIV-1 Gag hijacks euchromatin-associated histones to localize to active transcription sites, promoting capture of newly synthesized genomic RNA for packaging.",

    "abstract": "Secondary infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae has contributed significantly to morbidity and mortality during multiple influenza virus pandemics and remains a common threat today. During a concurrent infection, both pathogens can influence the transmission of each other, but the mechanisms behind this are unclear. In this study, condensation air sampling and cyclone bioaerosol sampling were performed using ferrets first infected with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm09) and secondarily infected with S. pneumoniae strain D39 (Spn). We detected viable pathogens and microbial nucleic acid in expelled aerosols from co-infected ferrets, suggesting that these microbes could be present in the same respiratory expulsions. To assess whether microbial communities impact pathogen stability within an expelled droplet, we performed experiments measuring viral and bacterial persistence in 1 L droplets. We observed that H1N1pdm09 stability was unchanged in the presence of Spn. Further, Spn stability was moderately increased in the presence of H1N1pdm09, although the degree of stabilization differed between airways surface liquid collected from individual patient cultures. These findings are the first to collect both pathogens from the air and in doing so, they provide insight into the interplay between these pathogens and their hosts.\n\nImportanceThe impact of microbial communities on transmission fitness and environmental persistence is under-studied. Environmental stability of microbes is crucial to identifying transmission risks and mitigation strategies, such as removal of contaminated aerosols and decontamination of surfaces. Co-infection with S. pneumoniae is very common during influenza virus infection, but little work has been done to understand whether S. pneumoniae alters stability of influenza virus, or vice versa, in a relevant system. Here, we demonstrate that influenza virus and S. pneumoniae are expelled by co-infected hosts. Our stability assays did not reveal any impact of S. pneumoniae on influenza virus stability, and a trend towards increased stability of S. pneumoniae in the presence of influenza viruses. Future work characterizing environmental persistence of viruses and bacteria should include microbially-complex solutions to better mimic physiologically relevant conditions.",

The tube is equipped with a spike-shaped protein (product of P2 gene V, gpV or Spike) that contains a membrane-attacking Apex domain carrying a centrally positioned Fe ion. The ion is enclosed in a histidine cage that is formed by three symmetry-related copies of a conserved HxH (histidine, any residue, histidine) sequence motif. Here, we used solution biophysics and X-ray crystallography to characterize the structure and properties of Spike mutants in which the Apex domain was either deleted or its histidine cage was either destroyed or replaced with a hydrophobic core. We found that the Apex domain is not required for the folding of full-length gpV or its middle intertwined {beta}-helical domain. Furthermore, despite its high conservation, the Apex domain is dispensable for infection in laboratory conditions. Collectively, our results show that the diameter of the Spike but not the nature of its Apex domain determines the efficiency of infection, which further strengthens the earlier hypothesis of a drill bit-like function of the Spike in host envelope disruption.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis in the Drosophila male germline proceeds through a unique transcriptional program controlled both by germline-specific transcription factors and by testis-specific versions of core transcriptional machinery. This program includes the activation of genes on the heterochromatic Y chromosome, and reduced transcription from the X chromosome, but how expression from these sex chromosomes is regulated has not been defined. To resolve this, we profiled active chromatin features in the testes from wildtype and meiotic arrest mutants and integrate this with single-cell gene expression data from the Fly Cell Atlas. These data assign the timing of promoter activation for genes with germline-enriched expression throughout spermatogenesis, and general alterations of promoter regulation in germline cells. By profiling both active RNA polymerase II and histone modifications in isolated spermatocytes, we detail widespread patterns associated with regulation of the sex chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that the X chromosome is not enriched for silencing histone modifications, implying that sex chromosome inactivation does not occur in Drosophila. Instead, a lack of dosage compensation in spermatocytes accounts for the reduced expression from this chromosome. Finally, profiling uncovers dramatic ubiquitinylation of histone H2A and lysine-16 acetylation of histone H4 across the Y chromosome in spermatocytes that may contribute to the activation of this heterochromatic chromosome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReverse transcribed gene copies, or retrocopies, have emerged as a major source of evolutionary novelties. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, highly conserved RNAs molecules among species that serve as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. The birth and subsequent evolution of miRNAs have been addressed, but not fully.\n\nResultsIn this study, we carried out a comprehensive investigation of miRNAs origination through retroduplicated mRNA sequences (retrocopies). We identified 17 retroduplicated miRNAs (retro-miRs) that emerged from mRNAs retrocopies. Four of these retro-miRs had de novo origination within retrocopied sequences, while 13 retro-miRNAs were located within exon regions and were duplicated along with their host mRNAs. We found that retro-miRs are primates specific, including 5 retro-miRs conserved among all primates and two human-specific retro-miRs. All of the retro-miRs were expressed and had predicted and experimentally validated target genes, with the exception of miR-10527. Notably, the target genes of retro-miRs are involved in key biological processes, such as metabolic processes, cell signaling and regulation of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Additionally, we found that these retro-miRs have a potential oncogenic role in cancer, targeting key cancer genes and being overexpressed in several cancer types, including Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Stomach Adenocarcinoma.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate that mRNAs retrotransposition is a key mechanism for the generation of novel miRNAs (retro-miRs) in primates. These retro-miRs are expressed, conserved, have target genes with important cellular functions, and play roles in cancer.",

It is not currently possible to measure directly in vivo mechanical responses in the narrow cleft between the tectorial membrane and organ of Corti over a wide range of stimulus frequencies and intensities. The mechanical responses can, however, be derived by measuring hair cell receptor potentials. We demonstrate that the seemingly complex frequency and intensity dependent behaviour of outer hair cell receptor potentials could be qualitatively explained by a two-degrees of freedom system with a local cochlear partition and tectorial membrane resonances strongly coupled by the outer hair cell stereocilia. A local minimum in the receptor potential below the characteristic frequency is always observed at the tectorial membrane resonance frequency which, however, might shift with stimulus intensity.",

    "abstract": "Many efforts are underway to improve immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy including potentiating MHC-I antigen processing and presentation. Accumulating evidence links the Hippo pathway to immunotherapy response, but the understanding of how the tumor-intrinsic Hippo signaling regulating antitumor immunity is limited. Here, we report that inhibition of the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP in tumor cells increases the expression of genes involving in MHC-I antigen processing and presenting machinery (APM) and CXCL10, promoting robust tumor-infiltrating of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) and overcoming tumor resistance to anti-PD1 ICB therapy. Mechanically, we find that YAP/TEAD complex directly binds and recruits NuRD complex to the NLRC5 promoter to repress NLRC5 transcription, thereby blunting MHC-I antigen presentation. Patient cohort analysis revealed that YAP expression negatively correlated with the expression of NLRC5 and MHC-I APM and intratumoral infiltration of CTLs. Collectively, our results suggest that a novel tumor- promoting function of YAP depends on NLRC5 to impair MHC-I antigen processing and presentation and provide a rationale for inhibiting YAP activity in ICB therapy for cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Factors (TRAFs) are a protein family with a wide variety of roles and binding partners. Among them, TRAF6, a ubiquitin ligase, possesses unique receptor binding specificity and shows diverse functions in immune system regulation, cellular signaling, central nervous system (CNS), and tumor formation. TRAF6 consists of an N-terminal Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain, multiple zinc fingers, and a C-terminal TRAF domain. RING domain and zinc fingers mediate the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B), which has essential roles in the regulation of inflammatory responses, proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. Therefore, it has been found that TRAF6 is overexpressed in various types of cancer including pancreatic, liver, lung, head and neck, breast, colorectal cancers, and melanoma along with inflammatory, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, TRAF6 is an important therapeutic target for numerous disorders and structural studies of this protein are crucial for the development of next-generation therapeutics. Here, we present a TRAF6 N-terminal structure determined at the Turkish Light Source \"Turkish DeLight\" to 2.6 [A] resolution at cryogenic temperature. This structure offers insight into the domain organization and zinc-binding, which are critical for protein function. Since the RING domain and the zinc fingers are key targets for TRAF6 therapeutics, structural insights are crucial for future research.",

    "abstract": "Persisting replication intermediates can confer mitotic catastrophe if left unresolved. Loss of the fission yeast telomere protein Taz1 (ortholog of mammalian TRF1/TRF2) causes telomeric replication fork stalling and in turn, telomere entanglements that stretch between the segregating chromosomes at anaphase. At [&le;]20{degrees}C, these entanglements fail to resolve, resulting in lethality. Rif1, a conserved DNA replication/repair protein, localizes between the segregating chromosomes and specifically hinders the resolution of telomere entanglements without affecting their formation. During anaphase, the spindle and the last segments of segregating chromatin are encased by the nuclear envelope (NE), creating a microdomain termed the anaphase midregion. In the final stages of fission yeast mitosis, this midregion undergoes local NE breakdown. Here we demonstrate that in response to taz1{Delta} telomeric entanglements, Rif1 delays midregion NE breakdown, and this delay disfavors entanglement resolution. Accordingly, gene deletions that hasten midregion NE breakdown phenocopy, and are epistatic with, rif1+ deletion. Conversely, gene deletions that delay midregion NE breakdown block the taz1{Delta} telomere detanglement afforded by loss of Rif1. Overexpression of Rif1 in a wild type background causes cold-specific NE defects and lethality, which are rescued by treatment with a membrane fluidizing agent. We propose that delayed NE breakdown normally favors the resolution of simple entanglements, arising from incomplete replication, by delaying exposure to the cytoplasm. In contrast, resolution of more complex entanglements involving strand invasion, like entanglements between nonsister taz1{Delta} telomeres, requires more rapid exposure to the cytoplasm. These observations uncover an unexpected coordination between NE remodeling and DNA processing events that can prevent or promote aneuploidy.",

    "abstract": "The liver has a unique ability to regenerate1,2, however in the setting of acute liver failure (ALF) this regenerative capacity is often overwhelmed and emergency liver transplantation is the only curative option3-5. To advance our understanding of human liver regeneration and to inform design of pro-regenerative therapies, we use paired single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) combined with spatial profiling of healthy and ALF explant human livers to generate the first single-cell, pan-lineage atlas of human liver regeneration. We uncover a novel ANXA2+ migratory hepatocyte subpopulation which emerges during human liver regeneration, and a corollary migratory hepatocyte subpopulation in a mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver regeneration. Importantly, interrogation of necrotic wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation across multiple timepoints following APAP-induced liver injury in mice demonstrates that wound closure precedes hepatocyte proliferation. 4-D intravital imaging of APAP-induced mouse liver injury identifies motile hepatocytes at the edge of the necrotic area, enabling collective migration of the hepatocyte sheet to effect wound closure. Depletion of hepatocyte ANXA2 expression reduces HGF-induced human and mouse hepatocyte migration in vitro, and abrogates necrotic wound closure following APAP-induced mouse liver injury. Taken together, our work dissects unanticipated aspects of liver regeneration, demonstrating an uncoupling of wound closure and hepatocyte proliferation and uncovering a novel migratory hepatocyte subpopulation which mediates wound closure following liver injury. Therapies designed to promote rapid reconstitution of normal hepatic microarchitecture and reparation of the gut-liver barrier may open up new areas of therapeutic discovery in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Tissue regeneration after injury involves the dedifferentiation of somatic cells, a natural adaptive reprogramming process that leads to the emergence of injury-responsive cells with fetal-like characteristics in the intestinal epithelium. However, there is no direct evidence that adaptive reprogramming involves a shared molecular mechanism with direct cellular reprogramming. Here, we induced dedifferentiation of intestinal epithelial cells through forced partial reprogramming in vivo using \"Yamanaka factors\" (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc: OSKM). The OSKM-induced dedifferentiation showed similar molecular features of intestinal regeneration, including a rapid transition from homeostatic cell types to injury-responsive-like cell types. These injury-responsive-like cells, sharing a gene signature of revival stem cells and atrophy-induced villus epithelial cells, actively assisted tissue regeneration following ionizing radiation-induced acute tissue damage. In contrast to normal intestinal regeneration, which involves epi-mesenchymal crosstalk through induction of Ptgs2 (encoding Cox2) upon injury, the OSKM expression promotes the autonomous production of prostaglandin E2 via epithelial Ptgs1 (encoding Cox1) expression. These results indicate that prostaglandin synthesis is a common mechanism for intestine epithelial regeneration but involves a different enzyme (Ptgs1 for Cox1) when partial reprogramming is directly applied to the intestinal epithelium.",

The DBD in elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which are descended from a CR, lack these four amino acids, suggesting that a CR2 is their common ancestor. To determine if, similar to lamprey CR1, the presence of this insert in elephant shark MR and GR decreases transcriptional activation by corticosteroids, we inserted these four CR1-specific residues into the DBD of elephant shark MR and GR. Compared to steroid activation of wild-type elephant shark MR and GR, cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol had lower transcriptional activation of these mutant MR and GR receptors, indicating that the absence of this four-residue segment in the DBD in wild-type elephant shark MR and GR increases transcriptional activation by corticosteroids.",

The most evolutionarily labile traits (showing >150 transitions across the genus) relate to plant structure (growth form and sympodial unit structure), herbivore defence (glandular trichomes), pollination (corolla shape and colour), and dispersal (fruit colour). Ten further traits show evolutionary lability with 50-100 transitions across the genus (e.g., specialised underground organs, trichome structure, leaf type, inflorescence position and branching, stamen heteromorphism). Our results reveal a number of highly convergent traits in Solanum, including tubers, rhizomes, simple leaves, yellow corollas, heteromorphic anthers, dioecy, and dry fruits, and some unexpected pathways of trait evolution that could be explored in future studies.

A dataset consisting of 17 genomes was used in this study. Genomes were annotated using PROKKA ver.1.14.5. The web tool antiSMASH ver. 5.1.2 was used to predict the BGCs profiles of each strain, with a total number of 198 BGCs. The comparison was made quantitatively based on a BGCs counts matrix comprising all the compared genomes and visualized using the Morpheus tool. The constitution, distribution, and evolutionary relationships of the detected BGCs were further analyzed using a manual approach based on a BLASTp analysis (using BRIG ver. 0.95); a phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated BGCs sequences to highlight the evolutionary relationships; and the conservation, distribution and the genomic co-linearity of the studied BGCs using Mauve aligner ver. 2.4.0. Finally, the BIG-SCAPE/CORASON automated pipeline was used as a complementary strategy to investigate the gene cluster families (GCFs) among the B. cereus group.\n\nResultsBased on the manual approach, we identified BGCs conserved across the studied strains with very low variation and interesting singletons BGCs. Moreover, we highlighted the presence of two major BGCs synteny blocks (named \"synteny block A\" and \"synteny block B\"), each composed of conserved homologous BGCs among the B. cereus group. For the automatic approach, we identified 23 families among the different BGCs classes of the B. cereus group, named using a rational basis. The proposed manual and automatic approaches proved to be in harmony and complete each other, for the study of BGCs among the selected genomes.\n\nConclusionUltimately, we propose a framework for an expanding classification of the B. cereus group BGCs, based on a set of reference BGCs reported in this work.",

Mutation in genes that encode for these Cry proteins is the common cause for congenital cataract. Despite extensive studies, the pathogenic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified a novel mutation in CRYBB1 from a congenital cataract family, and demonstrated that this mutation led to an earlier termination of protein translation, resulting in a 49-residue truncation at the CRY{beta}B1 C-terminus. This mutant is susceptible to proteolysis and allows us to determine a 1.2- [A] resolution crystal structure of CRY{beta}B1 without the entire C-terminal domain. In this crystal lattice, two N-terminal domain monomers form a dimer that structurally resembles a wild-type (WT) monomer, but with different surface characteristics. Biochemical analyses suggest that this mutant is significantly more liable to aggregate and degrade, when compared to WT CRY{beta}B1. All our results provide an insight into the mechanism regarding how a mutant Cry contributes to the development of congenital cataract possibly through alteration of inter-protein interactions that result in the opacity of eye lens.",

Although cMyBP-C phosphorylation by various protein kinases has been extensively studied, the influence of protein phosphatases on cMyBP-Cs multiple phosphorylation sites has remained largely obscure. Here we provide a detailed biochemical characterization of cMyBP-C dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) and develop an integrated kinetic model for cMyBP-C phosphorylation using data for both PP1, PP2A and protein kinases A (PKA), C and RSK2. We find strong site-specificity and a hierarchical mechanism for both phosphatases, proceeding in the opposite direction of sequential phosphorylation by PKA. The model is consistent with published data from human patients and predicts complex non-linear cMyBP-C phosphorylation patterns that are validated experimentally. Our results emphasize the importance of phosphatases for cMyBP-C regulation and prompt us to propose reciprocal relationships between cMyBP-C m-motif conformation, phosphorylation state and myofilament function.",

    "abstract": "Targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) provides an interesting therapeutic option in cancer therapy because this kinase participates in regulating the cell cycle and transcription. Here, we describe a new trisubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivative, LGR6768, that inhibits CDK7 in the nanomolar range and displays favourable selectivity across the CDK family. We determined the structure of fully active CDK2/cyclin A2 in complex with LGR6768 at 2.6 [A] resolution using X-ray crystallography, revealing conserved interactions within the active site. Structural analysis and comparison with LGR6768 docked to CDK7 provides an explanation of the observed biochemical selectivity, which is linked to a conformational difference in the biphenyl moiety. In cellular experiments, LGR6768 affected regulation of the cell cycle and transcription by inhibiting the phosphorylation of cell cycle CDKs and the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, respectively. LGR6768 limited the proliferation of several leukaemia cell lines, triggered significant changes in protein and mRNA levels related to CDK7 inhibition and induced apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent experiments. Our work supports previous findings and provides further information for the development of selective CDK7 inhibitors.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=58 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529844v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d13e99org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@64ea36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c9705org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14efc31_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A lack of composable and tunable gene regulators has hindered efforts to engineer non-model bacteria and consortia. To address this, we explore the broad-host potential of small transcription activating RNA (STAR) and propose a novel design strategy to achieve tunable gene control. First, we demonstrate that STARs optimized for E. coli function across different Gram-negative species and can actuate using phage RNA polymerase, suggesting that RNA systems acting at the level of transcription are portable. Second, we explore a novel RNA design strategy that uses arrays of tandem and transcriptionally fused RNA regulators to precisely alter regulator concentration from 1 to 8 copies. This provides a simple means to predictably tune output gain across species and does not require access to large regulatory part libraries. Finally, we show RNA arrays can be used to achieve tunable cascading and multiplexing circuits across species, analogous to the motifs used in artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Loss of muscle stem cell (MuSC) self-renewal with aging reflects a combination of influences from the intracellular (e.g., post-transcriptional modifications) and extracellular (e.g., matrix stiffness) environment. Whereas conventional single cell analyses have revealed valuable insights into factors contributing to impaired self-renewal with age, most are limited by static measurements that fail to capture nonlinear dynamics. Using bioengineered matrices mimicking the stiffness of young and old muscle, we showed that while young MuSCs were unaffected by aged matrices, old MuSCs were phenotypically rejuvenated by young matrices. Dynamical modeling of RNA velocity vector fields in silico revealed that soft matrices promoted a self-renewing state in old MuSCs by attenuating RNA decay. Vector field perturbations demonstrated that the effects of matrix stiffness on MuSC self-renewal could be circumvented by fine-tuning the expression of the RNA decay machinery. These results demonstrate that post-transcriptional dynamics dictate the negative effect of aged matrices on MuSC self-renewal.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/529950v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a840corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d354cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@650556org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41587c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract description:\n\nThe balance of self-renewal and differentiation in young muscle stem cells (MuSCs) is robust to perturbations of the biophysical microenvironment.

    "abstract": "The antiviral DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B has been implicated as a source of mutation in many different cancers. Despite over 10 years of work, a causal relationship has yet to be established between APOBEC3B and any stage of carcinogenesis. Here we report a murine model that expresses tumor-like levels of human APOBEC3B after Cre-mediated recombination. Animals appear to develop normally with full-body expression of APOBEC3B. However, adult males manifest infertility and older animals of both sexes show accelerated rates of tumorigenesis (mostly lymphomas or hepatocellular carcinomas). Interestingly, primary tumors also show overt heterogeneity, and a subset spreads to secondary sites. Both primary and metastatic tumors exhibit increased frequencies of C-to-T mutations in TC dinucleotide motifs consistent with the established biochemical activity of APOBEC3B. Elevated levels of structural variation and insertion-deletion mutations also accumulate in these tumors. Together, these studies provide the first cause-and-effect demonstration that human APOBEC3B is an oncoprotein capable of causing a wide range of genetic changes and driving tumor formation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Visual processing is strongly influenced by context. Stimuli that deviate from contextual regularities elicit augmented responses in primary visual cortex (V1). These heightened responses, known as \"deviance detection,\" require both inhibition local to V1 and top-down modulation from higher areas of cortex. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which these circuit elements interact to support deviance detection. Local field potential recordings in mice in anterior cingulate area (ACa) and V1 during a visual oddball paradigm showed that interregional synchrony peaks in the theta/alpha band (6-12 Hz). Two-photon imaging in V1 revealed that mainly pyramidal neurons exhibited deviance detection, while vasointestinal peptide-positive interneurons (VIPs) increased activity and somatostatin-positive interneurons (SSTs) decreased activity (adapted) to redundant stimuli (prior to deviants). Optogenetic drive of ACa-V1 inputs at 6-12 Hz activated V1-VIPs but inhibited V1-SSTs, mirroring the dynamics present during the oddball paradigm. Chemogenetic inhibition of VIP interneurons disrupted ACa-V1 synchrony and deviance detection responses in V1. These results outline spatiotemporal and interneuron-specific mechanisms of top-down modulation that support visual context processing.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum contains most of the neurons in the human brain, and exhibits unique modes of development, malformation, and aging. For example, granule cells--the most abundant neuron type--develop unusually late and exhibit unique nuclear morphology. Here, by developing our high-resolution single-cell 3D genome assay Dip-C into population-scale (Pop-C) and virus-enriched (vDip-C) modes, we were able to resolve the first 3D genome structures of single cerebellar cells, create life-spanning 3D genome atlases for both human and mouse, and jointly measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility during development. We found that while the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of human granule cells exhibit a characteristic maturation pattern within the first year of postnatal life, 3D genome architecture gradually remodels throughout life into a non-neuronal state with ultra-long-range intra-chromosomal contacts and specific inter-chromosomal contacts. This 3D genome remodeling is conserved in mice, and robust to heterozygous deletion of chromatin remodeling disease-associated genes (Chd8 or Arid1b). Together these results reveal unexpected and evolutionarily-conserved molecular processes underlying the unique development and aging of the mammalian cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "SORL1 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) through human genetic studies that point to an association of reduced SORL1 levels with higher risk for AD. To interrogate the role(s) of SORL1 in human brain cells, SORL1 null iPSCs were generated, followed by differentiation to neuron, astrocyte, microglia, and endothelial cell fates. Loss of SORL1 led to alterations in both overlapping and distinct pathways across cell types, with the greatest effects in neurons and astrocytes. Intriguingly, SORL1 loss led to a dramatic neuron-specific reduction in APOE levels. Further, analyses of iPSCs derived from a human aging cohort revealed a neuron-specific linear correlation between SORL1 and APOE RNA and protein levels, a finding validated in human post-mortem brain. Pathway analysis implicated intracellular transport pathways and TGF- {beta}/SMAD signaling in the function of SORL1 in neurons. In accord, enhancement of retromer-mediated trafficking and autophagy rescued elevated phospho-tau observed in SORL1 null neurons but did not rescue APOE levels, suggesting that these phenotypes are separable. Stimulation and inhibition of SMAD signaling modulated APOE RNA levels in a SORL1-dependent manner. These studies provide a mechanistic link between two of the strongest genetic risk factors for AD.",

    "abstract": "Foraging is a universal behavior that has co-evolved with predation pressure. We investigated the role of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) GABA neurons in robotic and live predator threat processing and their consequences in post-threat encounter foraging. Mice were trained to procure food in a laboratory-based foraging apparatus in which food pellets were placed at discrete and incrementally greater distances from a nest zone. After mice learned to forage, they were exposed to either a robotic or live predator threat, while BNST GABA neurons were chemogenetically inhibited. Post-robotic threat encounter, mice spent more time in the nest zone, but other foraging parameters were unchanged compared to pre-encounter behavior. Inhibition of BNST GABA neurons had no effect on foraging behavior post-robotic threat encounter. Following live predator exposure, control mice spent significantly more time in the nest zone, increased their latency to successfully forage, and their overall foraging performance was significantly a ltered. I nhibition o f BNST GABA neurons during live predator exposure prevented changes in foraging behavior from developing after live predator threat. BNST GABA neuron inhibition did not alter foraging behavior during robotic or live predator threat. We conclude that while both robotic and live predator encounter effectively intrude on foraging behavior, the perceived risk and behavioral consequence of the threats are distinguishable. Additionally, BNST GABA neurons may play a role in the integration of prior innate predator threat experience that results in hypervigilance during post-encounter foraging behavior.",
