    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiome has been linked to numerous negative health outcomes including preterm birth. Specific taxa, including Gardnerella spp., have been identified as risk factors for these conditions. Historically, microbiome analysis methods have treated all Gardnerella spp. as one species, but the broad diversity of Gardnerella has recently become more apparent. In the present study, we explore the diversity of Gardnerella clades and genomic species in the vaginal microbiome of pregnant women and their impacts on microbiome composition and associations with preterm birth.\n\nShotgun metagenomic sequencing data collected longitudinally from three distinct cohorts of pregnant women were assessed. Relative abundance of Gardnerella clades and genomic species and other taxa was quantified, and associations between Gardnerella clades and signatures of the vaginal microbiome were measured. We also assessed the diversity and abundance of Gardnerella variants in 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from seven previously conducted studies in differing populations on the vaginal microbiome and preterm birth.\n\nIndividual microbiomes often contained multiple Gardnerella variants, and the number of clades was associated with increased microbial load. The genus Gardnerella was also associated with increased microbial load, or the ratio of non-human reads to human reads. Taxon co-occurrence patterns matched previously described community structures, and were largely consistent across Gardnerella clades and among cohorts. Some variants previously described as rare were prevalent in other cohorts, highlighting the importance of surveying a diverse set of populations to fully capture the diversity of Gardnerella.\n\nThe diversity of Gardnerella both across populations and within individual vaginal microbiomes has long been unappreciated, as has been the intra-species diversity of many other members of the vaginal microbiome.1 The broad genomic diversity of Gardnerella has led to its reclassification as multiple species; here we demonstrate the diversity of Gardnerella found within and between vaginal microbiomes. Further studies should investigate the phenotypes of Gardnerella variants that may underlie the mechanisms by which Gardnerella species may differentially shape the vaginal microbiome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are most commonly used in cell therapy and stem cell research, the mechanism and the locations of their self-renewal are still unknown.\n\nMethodMouse blood was collected, and examined under microscopy. The results were compared with the data of human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) collected 10 years ago.\n\nResultsWe found that the procedure of self-renewal for the mesenchymal stem cells in mouse blood and hUCB needs at least 5 steps. First, tube-shaped stem cell niches release long segmented materials composed of sand-like particles and semitransparent granules. Second, the sand-like particles and semitransparent granules separate from the segmented materials. Third, each of the individual semitransparent granules releases groups of fusiform-shaped structures that do not stain to H&E. The sizes of the fusiform-shaped structures range from 1 to 100 m in length in mouse blood, but can be 200 m in hUCB. Fourth, the large-sized fusiform structures can directly transform into lineage-restricted cellular structures; the medium-sized fusiform structures fuse or engulf each other to form cellular structures. The cellular structures further acquire membranes from the adjacent nucleated cells. Fifth, the nucleolus appears in the new cellular structures before the nucleus. During all the procedures, the adjacent nucleated mesenchymal cells are must needed. Thus, these newly formed cellular structures will further differentiate into nucleated mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nConclusionOur findings again provide new evidence that, in physiological conditions, mesenchymal stem cell self-renewal needs several steps to complete, which, however, does not occur by mitotic division. The tube-shaped structures are the niches of the stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Tendons are essential, frequently injured connective tissues that transmit forces from muscle to bone. Their unique highly ordered, matrix-rich structure is critical for proper function. While adult mammalian tendons heal after acute injuries, endogenous tendon cells, or tenocytes, fail to respond appropriately, resulting in the formation of disorganized fibrovascular scar tissue with impaired function and increased propensity for re-injury. Here, we show that unlike mammals, adult zebrafish tenocytes activate upon injury and fully regenerate the tendon. Using a full tear injury model in the adult zebrafish craniofacial tendon, we defined the hallmark stages and cellular basis of tendon regeneration through multiphoton imaging, lineage tracing, and transmission electron microscopy approaches. Remarkably, we observe that the zebrafish tendon can regenerate and restore normal collagen matrix ultrastructure by 6 months post-injury (mpi). We show that tendon regeneration progresses in three main phases: inflammation within 24 hours post-injury (hpi), cellular proliferation and formation of a cellular bridge between the severed tendon ends at 3-5 days post-injury (dpi), and re-differentiation and matrix remodeling beginning from 5 dpi to 6 mpi. Importantly, we demonstrate that pre-existing tenocytes are the main cellular source of regeneration. Collectively, our work debuts the zebrafish tendon as one of the only reported adult tendon regenerative models and positions it as an invaluable comparative system to identify regenerative mechanisms that may inspire new tendon injury treatments in the clinic.",

However, an interaction between soil and climate effect caused this better performance in home soil to occur only when in foreign climate. Similarly, performance improved in home climate only when plants were also placed in foreign soil.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: In contrast to predictions from the literature, no benefit from growing in foreign soils are indicated. At least on the short term, climate change alone is not suggested to affect native grassland plant performance. However, when introduced to a habitat with a similar climate to their native habitat, plants may perform as well as in their native range, but when introduced both to a new soil and climate, plants will do poorly.

    "abstract": "Comprehending symbiont abundance among host species is a major ecological endeavour, and the metabolic theory of ecology has been proposed to understand what constraints symbiont populations. We parameterized metabolic theory equations to predict how bird species body size and the body size of their feather mites relate to mite abundance according to four potential energy (microbial abundance, uropygial gland size) and space constraints (wing area, number of feather barbs). Predictions were compared with the empirical scaling of feather mite abundance from 26,604 birds of 106 passerine species, using phylogenetic modelling and quantile regression. Feather mite populations were strongly constrained by host space (number of feather barbs) and not energy. Moreover, feather mite species body size was unrelated to their abundance or to the body size of their host species. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the bird-feather mite system and for symbiont abundance in general.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of major axes of correlated functional variation among species and habitats has revealed the fundamental trade-offs structuring both functional and taxonomic diversity in eukaryotes such as plants. Whether such functional axes exist in the bacterial realm and whether they could explain bacterial taxonomic turnover among ecosystems remains unknown. Here we use a data-driven approach to leverage global genomic and metagenomic datasets to reveal the existence of major axes of functional variation explaining both evolutionary differentiation within Bacteria and their ecological sorting across diverse habitats. We show that metagenomic variation among bacterial communities from various ecosystems is structured along a few axes of correlated functional pathways. Similar clusters of traits explained phylogenetic trait variation among >16,000 bacterial genomes, suggesting that functional turnover among bacterial communities from distinct habitats does not only result from the differential filtering of similar functions among communities, but also from phylogenetic correlations among these functions. Concordantly, functional pathways associated with trait clusters that were most important for defining functional turnover among bacterial communities were also those that had the highest phylogenetic signal in the bacterial genomic phylogeny. This study overall underlines the important role of evolutionary history in shaping contemporary distributions of bacteria across ecosystems.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementIn this article, we use a trait screening approach based on genomic and metagenomic data to identify the key functional strategies of bacteria across ecosystems but also across the bacterial tree of life. This novel approach allows us to quantify the role of evolutionary processes in structuring microbial ecological differences among ecosystems. By reducing the high-dimensionality of trait variation observed among microorganisms around a small number of fundamental axes of trait covariation, we make a significant step towards generalization of the drivers of biological diversity in microbes but also across study systems. This research provide a major advance in our understanding of the origin and maintenance of bacterial biological diversity, expanding on related findings for plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes (Numts) has been linked to lifespan in non-human species 1-3 and recently demonstrated to occur in rare instances from one human generation to the next 4. Here we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging 5. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every [~]13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7- fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan. These findings open the possibility that mito-nuclear horizontal gene transfer among human post-mitotic tissues produce functionally-relevant human Numts over timescales shorter than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria originated from an ancient bacterial endosymbiont that underwent reductive evolution by gene loss and endosymbiont gene transfer to the nuclear genome. The diversity of mitochondrial genomes published to date has revealed that gene loss and transfer processes are ongoing in many lineages. Most well-studied eukaryotic lineages are represented in mitochondrial genome databases, except for the superphylum Retaria--the lineage comprising Foraminifera and Radiolaria. Using single-cell approaches, we present two complete mitochondrial genomes of Foraminifera and two near-complete mitochondrial genomes of radiolarians. We report the complete coding content of an additional 14 foram species. We show that foraminiferan and radiolarian mitochondrial genomes encode a nearly fully overlapping but reduced mitochondrial gene complement compared to other sequenced rhizarians. In contrast to animals and fungi, many protists encode a diverse set of proteins on their mitochondrial genomes, including several ribosomal genes; however, some aerobic eukaryotic lineages (euglenids, myzozoans, and chlamydomonas-like algae) have reduced mitochondrial gene content and lack all ribosomal genes. Similar to these reduced outliers, we show that retarian mitochondrial genomes lack ribosomal protein and tRNA genes, contain truncated and divergent small and large rRNA genes, and encode only 14-15 protein-coding genes, including nad1, 3, 4, 4L, 5, 7, cob, cox1, 2, 3, atp1, 6, and 9, with forams and radiolarians additionally encoding nad2 and nad6, respectively. In radiolarian mitogenomes, a non-canonical genetic code was identified in which all three stop codons encode amino acids. Collectively, these results add to our understanding of mitochondrial genome evolution and fill in one of the last major gaps in mitochondrial sequence databases.",

    "abstract": "Greetings in primates fulfil important functions including navigation of rank, maintenance of social relationships, and potentially establishing coalition partnerships. Papio makes a particularly valuable study genus as baboons show variation in greeting, male-male cooperation, philopatry, and social system. However, baboon greeting research has largely focused on male-male interactions, with female approach behaviour neglected except in relation to friendships and grunting. Most if not all signals seen in male-male greetings are also present in approaches between other sex combinations. To understand these signals further, their use in all sex combinations should be explored. We investigated approaches between male and female adult chacma baboons (Papio ursinus griseipes), the only savannah baboon reportedly lacking male-male cooperation, recorded in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. We compared male-male greetings with those of other baboon species, identified network clusters of co-occurring signals, and compared male and female approaches more broadly. Male-male approaches were similar to those in other baboon species. We identified several predictable signal combinations, ear-flattening with lip-smacking being a particularly strong signal of benign intent across sexes. Further research comparing greeting across sex combinations and species will help disentangle links between risk, cooperation, and greeting behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Glycans are the most abundant and diverse fundamental biomolecules. Profiling glycans is essential to elucidate biomolecular mechanisms and to predict biological consequences; however, the analysis of glycans remains challenging due to their structural complexity. A novel glycan detection platform is established through the integration of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), boronic acid receptors, and machine learning tools. SERS is able to distinguish isomeric structures and provide fingerprint information of molecules. Boronic acid receptors can selectively bind with glycans, and the reaction influences molecular vibrations, leading to unique Raman spectral patterns. For proof-of-concept, two boronic acids, 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4MBA) and 1-thianthrenylboronic acid (1TBA) were used for glycan detection. The spectra were analyzed by the machine learning algorithm. The sensing platform successfully recognized the stereoisomers (glucose, mannose, and galactose), the structural isomers with -1,4 and -1,6 glycosidic linkages, and the {beta}-1,4 glycosidic linkage within lactose molecules. The collective spectra that combine the spectra from both boronic acid receptors could improve the performance of the support vector machine model due to the enrichment of the structural information of glycans. In addition to qualitative analysis, this new sensor could quantify the mole fraction of sialic acid in lactose background using the machine learning regression technique. The quantification accuracy reached a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.998 and a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.00195. This low-cost, rapid, and highly accessible sensor will provide the scientific community with another option for frequent glycan screening in standard biological laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Many methodologically diverse computational methods have been applied to the growing challenge of predicting and interpreting the effects of protein variants. As many pathogenic mutations have a perturbing effect on protein stability or intermolecular interactions, one highly interpretable approach is to use protein structural information to model the physical impacts of variants and predict their likely effects on protein stability and interactions. Previous efforts have assessed the accuracy of stability predictors in reproducing thermodynamically accurate values and evaluated their ability to distinguish between known pathogenic and benign mutations. Here, we take an alternate approach, and explore how well stability predictor scores correlate with functional impacts derived from deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. In this work, we compare the predictions of 9 protein stability-based tools against mutant protein fitness values from 45 independent DMS datasets, covering 161,441 unique single amino acid variants. We find that FoldX and Rosetta show the strongest correlations with DMS-based functional scores, similar to their previous top performance in distinguishing between pathogenic and benign variants. For both methods, performance is considerably improved when considering intermolecular interactions from protein complex structures, when available. Finally, we also highlight that predicted stability effects show consistently higher correlations with certain DMS experimental phenotypes, particularly those based upon protein abundance, and, in certain cases, can be competitive with other sequence-based variant effect prediction methodologies for predicting functional scores from DMS experiments.",

    "abstract": "Naive T lymphocytes traffic through the organism in their search for antigen, alternating between blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes relies on the chemokine CCL21, while exit into efferent lymphatics relies on the sphingolipid S1P. Surprisingly, while both molecules are claimed chemotactic, a quantitative analysis of naive T lymphocyte migration along defined gradients is missing. Here, we used a reductionist in vitro approach to study the real-time, single-cell response of naive T lymphocytes to CCL21 and S1P-rich serum. Using high-throughput microfluidic and optical micropatterning ad hoc tools, we show that CCL21 triggers long-range chemotaxis whereas S1P-rich serum does not. Instead, S1P-rich serum triggers a transient polarization that may represent a brief transmigration step through exit portals. Our data thus validate naive T lymphocyte chemotaxis towards CCL21 but not S1P, which complements in vivo observations and is of interest for a better tailoring of immunosuppressive drugs.",

    "abstract": "Membrane asymmetry is ubiquitous in cell membranes particularly with respect to lipids, whereby charged lipids are mainly restricted to the inner monolayer. We investigate the influence of anionic lipid asymmetry on the stability of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), minimal plasma membrane models. To quantify asymmetry, we apply a fluorescence quenching assay, which is often difficult to reproduce and caution in handling the quencher is generally underestimated. Thus, we first optimize this assay and then apply it to GUVs prepared with the inverted emulsion transfer protocol using increasing fractions of anionic lipids restricted to one leaflet. This protocol is found to produce highly asymmetric bilayers, but with ~20% interleaflet mixing. To probe the stability of asymmetric vs symmetric membranes, we expose the GUVs to porating DC pulses and monitor the fraction of destabilized vesicles. The pulses open macropores, and the GUVs either completely recover their integrity or become destabilized exhibiting leakage or bursting/collapse. Destabilization is much more pronounced in asymmetrically charged membranes, which is corroborated by pore edge tension data showing considerable decrease with asymmetry. Rendering GUV membrane asymmetric from exposure to different transmembrane pH, we confirm that poration-triggered destabilization does not depend on the approach used to generate membrane asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "BRAF V600E-mutated glioma patients are in urgent need of new treatments, since standard chemoradiotherapy and surgery achieves tumor control in less than 30% of patients. BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations have shown promising results against several types of BRAF V600E mutated cancers. Patients with high-grade BRAF V600E mutated gliomas frequently experience therapy failure with concurrent BRAF V600E and MEK inhibition (BRAFi+MEKi). Overcoming therapy resistance begins with understanding how these inhibitors affect tumor cells and the immune microenvironment. In novel syngeneic murine models and patient-derived cell lines of BRAF V600E-mutated high-grade astrocytomas, we analyzed effects of BRAF V600E expression and BRAF V600E inhibitor Dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor Trametinib (BRAFi+MEKi). BRAF V600E expression disrupted asymmetric cell division and glial differentiation, and BRAFi+MEKi restored these defects, and enriched for potentially therapy resistant CD133+ tumor cells. Increased interferon alpha and gamma signatures and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected. Programmed death (PD-1) receptor ligand was found to be expressed in murine and human BRAF V600E mutated high-grade gliomas, and BRAFi+MEKi upregulated the frequency of tumor-infiltrating T cells expressing inhibitory immune checkpoints, suggestive of T cell exhaustion. Combining dual MAPK pathway with immune checkpoint inhibition by anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatment decreased T cell deactivation and resulted in a T cell-dependent survival benefit of mice with orthotopic BRAF V600E-mutated high-grade gliomas. These data showed that clinically relevant dual MAPK pathway inhibition sensitized high-grade gliomas to the anti-tumor activity of concurrent dual immune checkpoint blockades. Therefore, we propose that in patients with BRAF V600E high-grade gliomas, improved therapeutic benefits could be derived from combining BRAFi+MEKi with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Microbial signatures show remarkable potentials in predicting colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic powers of multimodal microbial signatures, multi-kingdom species, genes, and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) for detecting pre-cancerous adenomas. We performed cross-cohort analyses on whole metagenome sequencing data of 750 samples via xMarkerFinder to identify adenoma-associated microbial multimodal signatures. Our data revealed that fungal species outperformed species from other kingdoms with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.71 in distinguishing adenomas from controls, while classifier based on SNVs of bacterial species displayed the strongest diagnostic capability (AUC=0.89). SNV biomarkers also exhibited outstanding performances in three independent validation cohorts (AUCs = 0.83, 0.82, and 0.76, respectively) and were highly specific to adenoma. In further support of the above results, functional analyses revealed more frequent inter-kingdom associations between bacteria and fungi, and abnormalities in quorum sensing, purine and butanoate metabolism in adenoma, which were further validated in a newly-recruited cohort via qRT-PCR. Therefore, these data extend our understanding of adenoma-associated multimodal alterations in the gut microbiome and provide a rationale of microbial SNVs for the early detection of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Metastrongyle lungworms could be particularly detrimental for diving animals such as marine mammals, however little is known of the drivers of pathogenic host-parasite relationships in this group. This systematic review analyzed the diversity of metastrongyles in marine mammals and the host and parasite traits associated with virulence. There have been at least 40 species of metastrongyles described in 66 species of marine mammals. After penalization for study biases, Halocercus hyperoodoni, Otostrongylus circumlitus, Parafilaroides gymnurus, Halocercus brasiliensis, and Stenurus minor were the metastrongyles with the widest host range. Most studies (80.12%, n=133/166) reported that metastrongyles caused bronchopneumonia, while in the cardiovascular system metastrongyles caused vasculitis in nearly half of the studies (45.45%, n=5/11) that assessed these tissues. Metastrongyles were associated with otitis in 23.08% (n=6/26) of the studies. Metastrongyle infection was considered a potential contributory to mortality in 44.78% (n=90/201) of the studies while 10.45% (n=21/201) of these studies considered metastrongyles the main cause of death. Metastrongyle species with a wider host range were more likely to induce pathogenic effects. Metastrongyles can cause significant tissue damage and mortality in marine mammals although virulent host-parasite relationships are dominated by a few metastrongyle species with wider host ranges.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527020v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a3e28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66c8eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10cffforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c781df_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.",

    "abstract": "Motor planning facilitates rapid and precise execution of volitional movements. Although motor planning has been classically studied in humans and monkeys, the mouse has become an increasingly popular model system to study neural mechanisms of motor planning. It remains yet untested whether mice and primates share common behavioral features of motor planning. We combined videography and a delayed response task paradigm in an autonomous behavioral system to measure motor planning in non-body- restrained mice. Motor planning resulted in both reaction time savings and increased movement accuracy, replicating classic effects in primates. We found that motor planning was reflected in task-relevant body features. Both the specific actions prepared and the degree of motor readiness could be read out online during motor planning. The online readout further revealed behavioral evidence of simultaneous preparation for multiple actions under uncertain conditions. These results validate the mouse as a model to study motor planning, demonstrate body feature movements as a powerful real-time readout of motor readiness, and offer behavioral evidence that motor planning can be a parallel process that permits rapid selection of multiple prepared actions.",

    "abstract": "After traumatic injury, healing of mammalian ligaments is typically associated with fibrotic scarring as opposed to scar-free regeneration. In contrast, here we show that the ligament supporting the jaw joint of adult zebrafish is capable of rapid and complete scar-free healing. Following surgical transection of the jaw joint ligament, we observe breakdown of ligament tissue adjacent to the cut sites, expansion of mesenchymal tissue within the wound site, and then remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) to a normal ligament morphology. Lineage tracing of mature ligamentocytes following transection shows that they dedifferentiate, undergo cell cycle re-entry, and contribute to the regenerated ligament. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the regenerating ligament reveals dynamic expression of ECM genes in neural-crest-derived mesenchymal cells, as well as diverse immune cells expressing the endopeptidase-encoding gene legumain. Analysis of legumain mutant zebrafish shows a requirement for early ECM remodeling and efficient ligament regeneration. Our study establishes a new model of adult scar-free ligament regeneration and highlights roles of immune-mesenchyme cross-talk in ECM remodeling that initiates regeneration.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRapid regeneration of the jaw joint ligament in adult zebrafish\nC_LIO_LIDedifferentiation of mature ligamentocytes contributes to regeneration\nC_LIO_LIscRNAseq reveals dynamic ECM remodeling and immune activation during regeneration\nC_LIO_LIRequirement of Legumain for ECM remodeling and ligament healing\nC_LI",

The molecular mechanisms through which beta cell hierarchy is established remain poorly understood. The neuronatin (Nnat) gene is imprinted in mice and humans and is required for normal insulin synthesis and secretion. Here, we demonstrate that Nnat is differentially expressed in a discrete beta cell population in a developmental-stage and DNA methylation (DNMT3A)-dependent manner. Explored in mice expressing eGFP from a bacterial artificial chromosome-expressed transgene, NNAT+ cells displayed a discrete transcriptome, and appear to represent a beta cell population specialised for insulin production. Correspondingly, highly connected  hub cells were less abundant in the NNAT+ population. These findings demonstrate that differential DNA methylation at Nnat represents a novel means through which beta cell heterogeneity is established.",

    "abstract": "Mutations to the LMNA gene cause laminopathies including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) that severely affect the cardiovascular system. The origins of tissue specificity in these diseases are unclear, as the A-type Lamins are abundant and broadly expressed proteins. We show that A-type Lamin protein and transcript levels are uncorrelated across tissues. As protein-transcript discordance can be caused by variations in protein lifetime, we applied quantitative proteomics to profile protein turnover rates in healthy and progeroid tissues. We discover that tissue context and disease mutation each influence A-type Lamin protein lifetime. Lamin A/C has a weeks-long lifetime in the aorta, heart, and fat, where progeroid pathology is apparent, but a days-long lifetime in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, which are spared from disease. The A-type Lamins are insoluble and densely bundled in cardiovascular tissues, which may present an energetic barrier to degradation and promote long protein lifetime. Progerin is even more long-lived than Lamin A/C in the cardiovascular system and accumulates there over time. Progerin accumulation interferes broadly with protein homeostasis, as hundreds of abundant proteins turn over more slowly in progeroid tissues. These findings indicate that potential gene therapy interventions for HGPS will have significant latency and limited potency in disrupting the long-lived Progerin protein. Finally, we reveal that human disease alleles are significantly over-represented in the long-lived proteome, indicating that long protein lifetime may influence disease pathology and present a significant barrier to gene therapies for numerous human diseases.\n\nSignificance statementMany human diseases are caused by mutations to broadly expressed proteins, yet disease mysteriously manifests only in specific tissues. An example of this is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), which is caused by a mutation to the Lamin A/C protein. We show that this mutation slows the turnover of Lamin A/C proteins in disease-afflicted tissues, causing the mutant \"Progerin\" protein to accumulate over time and interfere with the normal turnover of hundreds of other proteins. Because Progerin is a long-lived protein, effective therapies for this disease will need to attack the protein and not just the gene that encodes it.",

    "abstract": "In promiscuous species, fitness estimates obtained from genetic parentage may often reflect both pre- and post-copulatory components of sexual selection. Directly observing copulations can help isolate the role of pre-copulatory selection, but such behavioral data are difficult to obtain in the wild and may also overlook post-copulatory factors that alter the relationship between mating success and reproductive success. To overcome these limitations, we combined genetic parentage analysis with behavioral estimates of size-specific mating in a wild population of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei). Males of this species are twice as large as females and multiple mating among females is common, suggesting the scope for both pre- and post-copulatory processes to shape sexual selection on male body size. Our genetic estimates of reproductive success revealed strong positive directional selection for male size, which was also strongly associated with the number of mates inferred from parentage. In contrast, a males size was not associated with the fecundity of his mates or his competitive fertilization success. By simultaneously tracking copulations in the wild via the transfer of colored powder to females by males from different size quartiles, we independently confirmed that large males were more likely than small males to mate. We conclude that body size is primarily under pre-copulatory sexual selection in brown anoles, and that post-copulatory processes do not substantially alter this pre-copulatory selection. Our study also illustrates the utility of combining both behavioral and genetic methods to estimate mating success to disentangle pre- and post-copulatory processes in promiscuous species.",

Here, we developed Precision Run-On coupled to Immuno-Precipitation sequencing (PRO-IP-seq) and tracked phosphorylation of Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) at nucleotide-resolution. We uncovered precise positional control of Pol II CTD phosphorylation as transcription proceeds from the initiating nucleotide, through early and late promoter-proximal pause, and into productive elongation. Pol II CTD was predominantly unphosphorylated in the early pause-region, whereas serine-2- and serine-5-phosphorylations occurred preferentially in the later pause-region. Serine-7-phosphorylation dominated after the pause-release in a region where Pol II accelerates to its full elongational speed. Interestingly, tracking transcription upon heat-induced reprogramming demonstrated that Pol II with phosphorylated CTD remains paused on heat-repressed genes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/527107v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd08c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb7507org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c05c1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1deffdf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The west coast of Saudi Arabia borders the Red Sea, which maintains high average temperatures and increased salinity compared to other seas or oceans. Summer conditions in the Arabian Peninsula may exceed the temperature tolerance of most currently cultivated microalgae. The Cyanidiales are polyextremophilic red algae whose native habitats are at the edges of acidic hot springs. Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D has recently emerged as an interesting model organism capable of high-cell density cultivation on pure CO2 with optimal growth at 42 {degrees}C and low pH between 0.5-2. C. merolae biomass has an interesting macromolecular composition, is protein rich, and contains valuable bio-products like heat-stable phycocyanin, carotenoids, {beta}-glucan, and starch. Here, photobioreactors were used to model C. merolae 10D growth performance in simulated environmental conditions of the mid-Red Sea coast across four seasons, it was then grown at various scales outdoors in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia during the Summer of 2022. We show that C. merolae 10D is amenable to cultivation with industrial-grade nutrient and CO2 inputs outdoors in this location and that its biomass is relatively constant in biochemical composition across culture conditions. We also show the adaptation of C. merolae 10D to high salinity levels of those found in Red Sea waters and conducted further modeled cultivations in nutrient enriched local sea water. It was determined that salt-water adapted C. merolae 10D could be cultivated with reduced nutrient inputs in local conditions. The results presented here indicate this may be a promising alternative species for algal bioprocesses in outdoor conditions in extreme desert summer environments.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundPost-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is caused by knee injuries like anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Often, ACL injuries are accompanied by damage to other tissues and structures within the knee including the meniscus. Both are known to cause PTOA but underlying cellular mechanisms driving disease remain unknown. Aside from injury, patient sex is a prevalent risk factor associated with PTOA.\n\nHypothesisMetabolic phenotypes of synovial fluid that differ by knee injury pathology and participant sex will be distinct from each other.\n\nStudy DesignA cross-sectional study.\n\nMethodsSynovial fluid from n=33 knee arthroscopy patients between 18 and 70 years with no prior knee injuries was obtained pre-procedure and injury pathology assigned post-procedure. Synovial fluid was extracted and analyzed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry metabolomic profiling to examine differences in metabolism between injury pathologies and participant sex. Additionally, samples were pooled and underwent fragmentation to identify metabolites.\n\nResultsMetabolite profiles revealed that injury pathology phenotypes were distinct from each other where differences in endogenous repair pathways that are triggered post-injury were detected. Specifically, acute differences in metabolism mapped to amino acid metabolism, lipid-related oxidative metabolism, and inflammatory-associated pathways. Lastly, sexual dimorphic metabolic phenotypes were examined between male and female participants, and within injury pathology. Specifically, Cervonyl Carnitine and other identified metabolites differed in concentration between sexes.\n\nConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that different injuries (e.g., ligament vs. meniscus), as well as sex are associated with distinct metabolic phenotypes. Considering these phenotypic associations, a greater understanding of metabolic mechanisms associated with specific injuries and PTOA development may yield data regarding how endogenous repair pathways differ between injury types. Furthermore, ongoing metabolomic analysis of synovial fluid in injured male and female patients can be performed to monitor PTOA development and progression.\n\nClinical RelevanceExtension of this work may potentially lead to the identification of biomarkers as well as drug targets that slow, stop, or reverse PTOA progression based on injury type and patient sex.",

Despite the prosperous development of algorithms for this task, existing methods tend to leverage limited and noisy residue environment when generating sequences. In this paper, we develop an iterative sequence refinement pipeline, which can refine the sequence generated by existing sequence design models. It selects and retains reliable predictions based on the models confidence in predicted distributions, and decodes the residue type based on a partially visible environment. The proposed scheme can consistently improve the performance of a number of IPF models on several sequence design benchmarks, and increase sequence recovery of the SOTA model by up to 10%. We finally show that the proposed model can be applied to redesign Transposon-associated transposase B. 8 variants exhibit improved gene editing activity among the 20 variants we proposed.

Although complex functions based on oligonucleotides have been studied, we still lack an understanding of how the oligonucleotide dynamics are affected by the condensed internal environment of these droplets. Particularly, we lack high-resolution experimental measurements of the dynamical parameters that control oligonucleotide diffusion inside the phase-separated droplets. In addition, there is no clarity on how these dynamical parameters differ in the charged (coacervates) vs non-charged (aqueous two-phase system, ATPS) environment of these droplets. In this study, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we demonstrate the constrained dynamics of oligonucleotides inside membraneless phase-separated droplets at an unprecedented resolution. We further compare transport properties at different lengths of oligonucleotides as well as salt concentrations. We observe that among all the parameters the oligonucleotides caging (spatial restriction in the movement) inside the matrix has a considerable impact on the diffusive dynamics. Our study provides a way of unravelling, quantifying and understanding physical parameters governing the polymer transport dynamics inside the phase-separated droplets.",

Arabidopsis thaliana has two NORs, one on chromosome 2 (NOR2) and the other on chromosome 4 (NOR4). Each NOR consists of [~] 400 rRNA gene copies. We recently showed that rRNA gene subtypes that map to NOR2 are silenced during development, whereas those that map to NOR4 are active. In several DNA methylation mutants of Arabidopsis, we show disruption of the NOR2 gene silencing to varying degrees. Significantly, the highest disruption of NOR2 gene silencing correlates with a maximum loss of cytosine methylation in the CHH context followed by the CG context, independent of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Next, we show in Col-0 that NOR2 genes are relatively hypermethylated and NOR4 genes are hypomethylated using multiple methylation analysis of genomic DNA carried out with different types of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. We demonstrate similar differential methylation status between NOR2 and NOR4 genes in an introgression line named ColSf-NOR4, which carries NOR2 from Col-0 and NOR4 from ecotype Sf-2. Lastly, using Tn5 transposon-mediated transposition into native chromatin, we show that NOR2 gene chromatin is in more condensed state than NOR4 gene chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Developmental programmed cell death (dPCD) in Arabidopsis thaliana is an integral part of the differentiation process of the root cap, a specialized organ surrounding meristematic stem cells. dPCD in lateral root cap (LRC) cells depends on the transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and is followed by rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance, involving the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 downstream of SMB. Based on transcriptomic analyses, we observed the downregulation of BFN1 during colonization of A. thaliana by the beneficial root endophyte Serendipita indica. Roots of smb3 mutants, deficient in root cap dPCD and corpse clearance, are covered by uncleared LRC cell corpses and hypercolonized by S. indica from the root tip upwards. The bfn1-1 mutant exhibits an attenuated delayed corpse clearance phenotype, but still enhances colonization by S. indica. These results highlight that the constant production and clearance of LRC cells, in addition to its function in root cap size control, represents a sophisticated physical defense mechanism to prevent microbial colonization in close proximity to meristematic stem cells. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism by which S. indica manipulates dPCD in A. thaliana roots by downregulating BFN1 to promote fungal colonization through delayed clearance of dead cells, which present potential sources of nutrients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe gastrointestinal microbiome plays a significant role in numerous host processes and has an especially large impact on modulating the host metabolism. Prior studies have shown that when mice receive fecal transplants from obese donors that were fed high-fat diets (HFD) (even when recipient mice are fed normal diets after transplantation), they develop obese phenotypes. These studies demonstrate the prominent role that the gut microbiota play in determining lean and obese phenotypes. While much of the credit has been given to gut bacteria, studies have not measured the impact of gut viruses on these phenotypes. To address this shortcoming, we gavaged mice with viromes isolated from donors fed HFD or normal chow. By characterizing the mices gut bacterial biota and weight-gain phenotypes over time, we demonstrate that viruses can shape the gut bacterial community and affect weight gain or loss.\n\nResultsWe gavaged mice longitudinally over 4 weeks while measuring their body weights and collecting fecal samples for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We evaluated mice that were fed normal chow or high-fat diets, and gavaged each group with either chow-derived fecal viromes, HFD-derived fecal viromes, or phosphate buffered saline controls. We found a significant effect of gavage type, where mice fed chow but gavaged with HFD-derived viromes gained significantly more weight than their counterparts receiving chow-derived viromes. The converse was also true: mice fed HFD but gavaged with chow-derived viromes gained significantly less weight than their counterparts receiving HFD-derived viromes. These results were replicated in two separate experiments and the phenotypic changes were accompanied by significant and identifiable differences in the fecal bacterial biota. Notably, there were differences in Lachnospirales and Clostridia in mice fed chow but gavaged with HFD-derived fecal viromes, and in Peptostreptococcales, Oscillospirales, and Lachnospirales in mice fed HFD but gavaged with chow-derived fecal viromes. Due to methodological limitations, we were unable to identify specific bacterial species or strains that were responsible for respective phenotypic changes.\n\nConclusionsThis study confirms that virome-mediated perturbations can alter the fecal microbiome in an in vivo model and indicates that such perturbations are sufficient to drive lean and obese phenotypes in mice.",

    "abstract": "In a variety of practical applications, there is a need to investigate diffusion or reaction-diffusion processes on complex structures, including brain networks, that can be modeled as weighted undirected and directed graphs. As an instance, the celebrated Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) reaction-diffusion equation are becoming increasingly popular for use in graph frameworks by substituting the standard graph Laplacian operator for the continuous one to study the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as tauopathies including Alzheimers disease (AD). However, due to the porous structure of neuronal fibers, the spreading of toxic species can be governed by an anomalous diffusion process rather than a normal one, and if this is the case, the standard graph Laplacian cannot adequately describe the dynamics of the spreading process. To capture such more complicated dynamics, we propose a diffusion equation with a nonlinear Laplacian operator and a generalization of the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equation on undirected and directed networks using extensions of fractional polynomial (FP) functions. A complete analysis is also provided for the extended FP diffusion equation, including existence, uniqueness, and convergence of solutions, as well as stability of equilibria. Moreover, for the extended FP Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion equation, we derive a family of positively invariant sets allowing us to establish existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions. Finally, we conclude by investigating nonlinear diffusion on a directed one-dimensional lattice and then modeling tauopathy progression in the mouse brain to gain a deeper understanding of the potential applications of the proposed extended FP equations.",

When the RBP binds to a mRNA, ADAR catalyzes A to G modifications in the target mRNA that can be easily identified in standard RNA-sequencing. In STAMP, the concept is the same except the ADARcd is replaced by the RNA editing enzyme APOBEC. Here we compared the two enzymes fused to the RBP TDP-43 in human cells. Although they both identified TDP-43 target mRNAs, combining the two methods more successfully identified high confidence targets. We also assayed the two enzymes in Drosophila cells: RBP-APOBEC fusions generated only low numbers of editing sites, comparable to the level of control editing.

However, there is no canonical reference of gene expression in islet cell types in both health and disease that is also easily accessible for researchers to access, query, and use in bioinformatics pipelines. Here we present an integrated reference map of islet cell type-specific gene expression from 192,203 cells derived from single cell RNA-seq assays of 65 non-diabetic, T1D autoantibody positive (Aab+), T1D, and T2D donors from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program.

We tested for differential expression within each cell type in T1D Aab+, T1D, and T2D states, and identified 1,701 genes with significant changes in expression in any cell type. Most changes were observed in beta cells in T1D, and, by comparison, there were almost no genes with changes in T1D Aab+.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSimultaneous intracellular depolymerization of xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) and acetate fermentation by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers an advance towards more cost-effective second-generation (2G) ethanol production. As xylan is one of the most abundant polysaccharides present in lignocellulosic residues, the transport and breakdown of XOS in an intracellular environment might bring a competitive advantage for recombinant strains in competition with contaminating microbes, which are always present in fermentation tanks; furthermore, acetic acid is a ubiquitous toxic component in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, deriving from hemicellulose and lignin breakdown. In the present work, the previously engineered S. cerevisiae strain, SR8A6S3, expressing NADPH-linked xylose reductase (XR), NAD+-linked xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) (for xylose assimilation), as well as NADH-linked acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (AADH) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) (for an NADH-dependent acetate reduction pathway), was used as the host for expressing of two {beta}-xylosidases, GH43-2 and GH43-7, and a xylodextrin transporter, CDT-2, from Neurospora crassa, yielding the engineered strain SR8A6S3-CDT2-GH432/7. Both {beta}-xylosidases and the transporter were introduced by replacing two endogenous genes, GRE3 and SOR1, that encode aldose reductase and sorbitol (xylitol) dehydrogenase, respectively, which catalyse steps in xylitol production. Xylitol accumulation during xylose fermentation is a problem for 2G ethanol production since it reduces final ethanol yield. The engineered strain, SR8A6S3-CDT2-GH432/7, produced ethanol through simultaneous co-utilization of XOS, xylose, and acetate. The mutant strain produced 60% more ethanol and 12% less xylitol than the control strain when a hemicellulosic hydrolysate was used as a mono- and oligosaccharide source. Similarly, the ethanol yield was 84% higher for the engineered strain using hydrolysed xylan compared with the parental strain. The consumption of XOS, xylose, and acetate expands the capabilities of S. cerevisiae for utilization of all of the carbohydrate in lignocellulose, potentially increasing the efficiency of 2G biofuel production.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIntegration of XOS pathway in an acetate-xylose-consuming S. cerevisiae strain;\nC_LIO_LIIntracellular fermentation of XOS, acetate and xylose improved ethanol production;\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of both sor1{Delta} and gre3{Delta} reduced xylitol production.\nC_LI",
