    "abstract": "V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells are potent but elusive cytotoxic effectors. Means to stimulate their function could lead to powerful new cancer immunotherapies. BTN2A1, a surface protein has recently been shown to bind the V{gamma}9 chain of the {gamma}{delta} TCR but its precise role in modulating V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells functions remains unknown.\n\nHere we show that 107G3B5, a monoclonal anti-BTN2A1 agonist antibody, significantly enhances V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell functions against hematological or solid cell lines and against primary cells from adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. New computer vision strategies applied to holotomographic microscopy videos show that 107G3B5 enhances the interaction between V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells and target cells in a quantitative and qualitative manner. In addition, we provide evidence that V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells activated by 107G3B5 induce caspase 3/7 activation in tumor cells, thereby triggering their death by pyroptosis.\n\nWe thus demonstrate that targeting BTN2A1 with 107G3B5 enhances the V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell antitumor response by triggering the pyroptosis-induced immunogenic cell death.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale transcriptomic data are crucial for understanding the molecular features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By integrating 15 transcriptomic datasets of HCC clinical samples, the first version of HCCDB was released in 2018. The meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes and prognosis-related genes across multiple datasets provides a systematic view of the altered biological processes and the inter-patient heterogeneities of HCC with high reproducibility and robustness. After four years, the database needs to integrate recently published datasets. Furthermore, the latest single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provided a great opportunity to decipher the complex gene expression variations at the cellular level with spatial architecture. Here, we present HCCDB v2.0, an updated version that combines bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic data of HCC clinical samples. It dramatically expands the bulk sample size, adding 1656 new samples of 11 datasets to the existing 3917 samples, thereby enhancing the reliability of transcriptomic meta-analysis. A total of 182,832 cells and 69,352 spatial spots are added to the single-cell and spatial transcriptomics sections, respectively. A novel single-cell level and 2-dimension (sc-2D) metric was proposed to summarize the cell type-specific and dysregulated gene expression patterns. Results are all graphically visualized in our online portal, allowing users to easily retrieve data through a user-friendly interface and navigate between different views. With extensive clinical phenotypes and transcriptomic data in the database, we show two applications for identifying prognosis-associated cells and tumor microenvironment. HCCDB v2.0 is available at http://lifeome.net/database/hccdb2.",

    "abstract": "The predictive coding hypothesis proposes that top-down predictions are compared with incoming bottom-up sensory information, with prediction errors signaling the discrepancies between these inputs. While this hypothesis explains the presence of prediction errors, recent experimental studies suggest that prediction error signals can emerge within a local circuit, that is, from bottom-up sensory input alone. In this paper, we test whether local circuits alone can generate predictive signals by training a recurrent spiking network using local plasticity rules. Our network model replicates prediction errors resembling various experimental results, such as a biphasic pattern of prediction errors and context-specific representation of error signals. Our findings shed light on how synaptic plasticity can shape prediction errors and enables the acquisition and updating of an internal model of sensory input within a recurrent neural network.",

    "abstract": "Perisomatic inhibition profoundly controls neural function. However, the structural organisation of inhibitory circuits giving rise to the perisomatic inhibition in the higher-order cortices is not completely known. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of those GABAergic cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that provide inputs onto the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Our results show that most GABAergic axonal varicosities contacting the perisomatic region of superficial (layer 2/3) and deep (layer 5) pyramidal cells express parvalbumin (PV) or cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). Further, we found that the ratio of PV/CB1 GABAergic inputs is larger on the somatic membrane surface of pyramidal tract neurons in comparison to those projecting to the contralateral hemisphere. Our morphological analysis of in vitro labelled PV+ basket cells (PVBC) and CCK/CB1+ basket cells (CCKBC) revealed differences in many features. PVBC dendrites and axons arborized preferentially within the layer where their soma was located. In contrast, the axons of CCKBCs expanded throughout layers, though their dendrites were found preferentially either in superficial or deep layers. Finally, using anterograde trans-synaptic tracing we observed that PVBCs are preferentially innervated by thalamic and basal amygdala afferents in layer 5a and 5b, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that PVBCs can control the local circuit operation in a layer-specific manner via their characteristic arborization, while CCKBCs rather provide cross-layer inhibition in the mPFC.\n\nSignificance StatementInhibitory cells in cortical circuits are crucial for the precise control of local network activity. Nevertheless, in higher-order cortical areas that are involved in cognitive functions like decision making, working memory and cognitive flexibility, the structural organisation of inhibitory cell circuits is not completely understood. In this study we show that perisomatic inhibitory control of excitatory cells in the medial prefrontal cortex is performed by two types of basket cells endowed with different morphological properties that provide inhibitory inputs with distinct layer specificity on cells projecting to disparate areas. Revealing this difference in innervation strategy of the two basket cell types is a key step towards understanding how they fulfil their distinct roles in cortical network operations.",

    "abstract": "Sex allocation theory generally assumes maternal control of offspring sex and makes few predictions for populations evolving under paternal control. Using population genetic simulations, we show that maternal and paternal control of the sex ratio lead to different equilibrium sex ratios in structured populations. Sex ratios evolved under paternal control are more female biased. This effect is dependent on the population subdivision; fewer founding individuals leads to both more biased sex ratios and a greater difference between the paternal and maternal equilibria. In addition, sexual antagonism evolves in simulations with both maternally- and paternally-acting loci. Maternally-acting loci continuously accumulate ever more female-biasing effects as male-biasing effects accumulate at paternally-acting loci. The difference in evolved sex-ratio equilibria and the evolution of sexual antagonism can be largely explained by differences in the between-group variance of maternal and paternal effects in the founding generation. These theoretical results apply to any system with biparental autosomal influence over offspring sex, opening up an exciting new line of questioning.",

    "abstract": "The Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, is an ecologically and economically important pollinator. Mapping its genetic variation is key to understanding population-level health, histories, and potential capacities to respond to environmental changes. However, most efforts to date were focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on a single reference genome, thereby ignoring larger-scale genomic variation. We employed long-read sequencing technologies to generate a chromosome-scale reference genome for the ancestral group of A. cerana. Integrating this with 525 resequencing datasets, we constructed the first pan-genome of A. cerana, encompassing almost the entire gene content. We found that 31.32% of genes in the pan-genome were variably present across populations, providing a broad gene pool for environmental adaptation. We identified and characterized structural variations (SVs) and found that they were not closely linked with SNP distributions, however, the formation of SVs was closely associated with transposable elements. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using SVs revealed a novel A. cerana ecological group not recoverable from the SNP data. Performing environmental association analysis identified a total of 44 SVs likely to be associated with environmental adaptation. Verification and analysis of one of these, a 330 bp deletion in the Atpalpha gene, indicated that this SV may promote the cold adaptation of A. cerana by altering gene expression. Taken together, our study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of applying pan-genome approaches to map and explore genetic feature variations of honeybee populations, and in particular to examine the role of SVs in the evolution and environmental adaptation of A. cerana.",

CAR T cells specific for the CD117 antigen can deplete malignant and healthy hematopoietic stem cells. Here we exploit non-viral technology to achieve early termination of CAR T cell activity to prevent incoming graft rejection. Transient expression of an anti-CD117 CAR by mRNA conferred T cells the ability to eliminate CD117+ targets in vitro and in vivo. As an alternative approach, we used a Sleeping Beauty transposon vector for the generation of CAR T cells incorporating an inducible Caspase 9 safety switch. Stable CAR expression was associated with high proportion of T memory stem cells, low levels of exhaustion markers, and potent cellular cytotoxicity. Anti-CD117 CAR T cells mediated depletion of leukemic cells and healthy hematopoietic stem cells in NSG mice reconstituted with human leukemia or CD34+ cord blood cells, respectively, and could be chemically terminated in vivo. The use of a non-viral technology to control CAR T cell pharmacokinetic properties is attractive for a first-in-human study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) is the persistent reshuffling of cancer karyotypes via chromosome mis-segregation during cell division. In cancer, CIN exists at varying levels that have differential effects on tumor progression. However, mis-segregation rates remain challenging to assess in human cancer despite an array of available measures. We evaluated measures of CIN by comparing quantitative methods using specific, inducible phenotypic CIN models of chromosome bridges, pseudobipolar spindles, multipolar spindles, and polar chromosomes. For each, we measured CIN fixed and timelapse fluorescence microscopy, chromosome spreads, 6-centromere FISH, bulk transcriptomics, and single cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq). As expected, microscopy of tumor cells in live and fixed samples correlated well (R=0.77; p<0.01) and sensitively detect CIN. Cytogenetics approaches include chromosome spreads and 6-centromere FISH, which also correlate well (R=0.77; p<0.01) but had limited sensitivity for lower rates of CIN. Bulk genomic DNA signatures and bulk transcriptomic scores, CIN70 and HET70, did not detect CIN. By contrast, single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) detects CIN with high sensitivity, and correlates very well with imaging methods (R=0.83; p<0.01). In summary, single-cell methods such as imaging, cytogenetics, and scDNAseq can measure CIN, with the latter being the most comprehensive method accessible to clinical samples. To facilitate comparison of CIN rates between phenotypes and methods, we propose a standardized unit of CIN: Mis-segregations per Diploid Division (MDD). This systematic analysis of common CIN measures highlights the superiority of single-cell methods and provides guidance for measuring CIN in the clinical setting.\n\nSignificanceCancer relies on genomic changes to drive evolution. One type of change, Chromosomal INstability (CIN), promotes plasticity and heterogeneity of chromosome sets via ongoing errors in mitosis. The rate of these errors informs patient prognosis, drug response, and risk of metastasis. However, measuring CIN in patient tissues is challenging, hindering the emergence of CIN rate as a prognostic and predictive clinical biomarker. To advance clinical measures of CIN, we quantitatively tested the relative performance of several CIN measures in tandem using four well-defined, inducible CIN models. This survey revealed poor sensitivity in several common CIN assays and highlights the primacy of single-cell approaches. Further, we propose a standard, normalized unit of CIN, permitting comparison across methods and studies.",

Dynamic MRS comprises a rich set of contrasts, including diffusion-weighted, relaxation-weighted, functional, edited, or hyperpolarized spectroscopy, leading to quantitative insights into multiple physiological or microstructural processes. Conventional approaches to dynamic MRS analysis ignore the shared information between spectra, and instead proceed by independently fitting noisy individual spectra before modelling temporal changes in the parameters. Here we propose a universal dynamic MRS toolbox which allows simultaneous fitting of dynamic spectra of arbitrary type. A simple interface allows information to be shared and precisely modelled across spectra to make inferences on both spectral and dynamic processes. We demonstrate and thoroughly evaluate our approach in three types of dynamic MRS techniques. Simulations of functional and edited MRS are used to demonstrate the advantages of dynamic fitting. Analysis of synthetic functional 1H-MRS data shows a marked decrease in parameter uncertainty as predicted by prior work. Analysis with our tool replicates the results of two previously published studies using the original in vivo functional and diffusion-weighted data. Finally, joint spectral fitting with diffusion orientation models is demonstrated in synthetic data. The toolbox is shared as a fully open-source software with comprehensive documentation, example data, and tutorials.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis in clinical trials has been extensively researched, but its applicability to large omics-based biobanks requires further investigation. This study addresses two important issues in time-to-event data analysis in biobank settings. First, there is the need to pay attention to left-truncation of some outcomes that would prevent individuals joining the biobank, if the event of interest occurs before possible recruitment time. To avoid biases due to left-truncation, it has been suggested to use age as time scale in the analysis, whereas an individual is considered at risk only after recruitment to the biobank. Second, one needs to address the computational burden due to relative slowness of the conventional algorithm to maximize the partial likelihood function for the Cox model. This study examines the impact of the choice of timescale on the bias and power, while varying effect size and censoring rate in the range realistically seen in a typical biobank setting. Moreover, the study explores a computationally fast two-step martingale residual (MR) based approach for Cox modeling in high-dimensional omics data. The findings indicate that the choice of timescale has minimal impact on accuracy for small hazard ratios (HR), but for larger HRs, accounting for left-truncation is crucial to reduce bias. When maximizing power for association discovery, using participant age as the time scale (whereas individual is considered to be at risk immediately after birth) yields the highest power. The two-step MR approach is recommended for genome-wide association studies due to acceptable precision and retained power for small effect sizes. However, for predictions and polygenic risk score calculations, effect sizes should be recalculated using the conventional Cox proportional hazards model while accounting for left-truncation. The conclusions are based on simulations and illustrated with survival data from the Estonian Biobank cohort.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStatins lower circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Though highly efficacious in general, there is considerable inter-individual variation in statin efficacy that remains largely unexplained.\n\nMethodsTo identify novel genes that may modulate statin-induced LDLC lowering, we used RNA-sequencing data from 426 control- and 2 M simvastatin-treated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from European and African American ancestry participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) 40 mg/day 6-week simvastatin clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00451828). We correlated statin-induced changes in LCL gene expression with plasma LDLC statin response in the corresponding CAP participants. For the most correlated gene identified (ZNF335), we followed up in vivo by comparing plasma cholesterol levels, lipoprotein profiles, and lipid statin response between wild-type mice and carriers of a hypomorphic (partial loss of function) missense mutation in Zfp335 (the mouse homolog of ZNF335).\n\nResultsThe statin-induced expression changes of 147 human LCL genes were significantly correlated to the plasma LDLC statin responses of the corresponding CAP participants in vivo (FDR=5%). The two genes with the strongest correlations were zinc finger protein 335 (ZNF335 aka NIF-1, rho=0.237, FDR-adj p=0.0085) and CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 3 (CNOT3, rho=0.233, FDR-adj p=0.0085). Chow-fed mice carrying a hypomorphic missense (R1092W; aka bloto) mutation in Zfp335 had significantly lower non-HDL cholesterol levels than wild type C57BL/6J mice in a sex combined model (p=0.04). Furthermore, male (but not female) mice carrying the Zfp335R1092W allele had significantly lower total and HDL cholesterol levels than wild-type mice. In a separate experiment, wild-type mice fed a control diet for 4 weeks and a matched simvastatin diet for an additional 4 weeks had significant statin-induced reductions in non-HDLC (-43{+/-}18% and -23{+/-}19% for males and females, respectively). Wild-type male (but not female) mice experienced significant reductions in plasma LDL particle concentrations, while male mice carrying Zfp335R1092W allele(s) exhibited a significantly blunted LDL statin response.\n\nConclusionsOur in vitro and in vivo studies identified ZNF335 as a novel modulator of plasma cholesterol levels and statin response, suggesting that variation in ZNF335 activity could contribute to inter-individual differences in statin clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Drug dose response curves are ubiquitous in cancer biology, but these curves are often used to measure differential response in first-order effects: the effectiveness of increasing the cumulative dose delivered. In contrast, second-order effects (the variance of drug dose) are often ignored. Knowledge of second-order effects may improve the design of chemotherapy scheduling protocols, leading to improvements in tumor response without changing the total dose delivered. By considering treatment schedules with identical cumulative dose delivered, we optimize treatment by comparing high variance schedules (e.g. high dose, low dose) with low variance schedules (constant dose). We extend a previous framework used to quantify second-order effects, known as antifragility theory, to investigate the role of drug pharmacokinetics. Using a simple one-compartment model, we find that high variance schedules are effective for a wide range of cumulative dose values. Next, using a mouse-parameterized two-compartment model of 5-fluorouracil, we show that the optimal schedule depends on initial tumor volume. Finally, we illustrate the trade-off between tumor response and lean mass preservation. Mathematical modeling indicates that high variance dose schedules provide a potential path forward in mitigating the risk of chemotherapy-associated cachexia by preserving lean mass without sacrificing tumor response.",

    "abstract": "Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is mediated by a neural circuit that includes the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, but the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the regulation of CFC by neuromodulators remain unclear. Dopamine D1-like receptors (D1Rs) in this circuit regulate CFC and local synaptic plasticity, which is facilitated by synchronized oscillations between these areas. In rats, we determined the effects of systemic D1R blockade on CFC and oscillatory synchrony between dorsal hippocampus (DH), prelimbic (PL) cortex, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (VH), which sends hippocampal projections to PL and BLA. D1R blockade altered DH-VH and reduced VH-PL and VH-BLA synchrony during CFC, as inferred from theta and gamma coherence and theta-gamma coupling. D1R blockade also impaired CFC, as indicated by decreased freezing at retrieval, which was characterized by altered DH-VH and reduced VH-PL, VH-BLA, and PL-BLA synchrony. This reduction in VH-PL-BLA synchrony was not fully accounted for by non-specific locomotor effects, as revealed by comparing between epochs of movement and freezing in the controls. These results suggest that D1Rs regulate CFC by modulating synchronized oscillations within the hippocampus-prefrontal-amygdala circuit. They also add to growing evidence indicating that this circuit synchrony at retrieval reflects a neural signature of learned fear.",

    "abstract": "Following prolonged activity blockade, amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) increase, a form of homeostatic plasticity termed \"synaptic scaling.\" We previously showed that a presynaptic protein, the small GTPase Rab3A, is required for full expression of the increase in miniature endplate current amplitudes following prolonged blockade of action potential activity at the mouse neuromuscular junction in vivo (Wang et al., 2011), but it is unknown whether this form of Rab3A-dependent homeostatic plasticity shares any characteristics with central synapses. We show here that synaptic scaling of mEPSCs is impaired in mouse cortical neuron cultures prepared from Rab3A-/- and Rab3A Earlybird mutant mice. To determine if Rab3A is involved in the well-established homeostatic increase in postsynaptic AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs), we performed a series of experiments in which electrophysiological recordings of mEPSCs and confocal imaging of synaptic AMPAR immunofluorescence were assessed within the same cultures. We found that Rab3A is required for the increase in synaptic AMPARs following prolonged activity blockade, but the comparison of mEPSC amplitude and synaptic AMPARs in the same cultures revealed that mEPSC amplitude cannot solely be determined by postsynaptic AMPAR levels. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab3A is acting in neurons because selective loss of Rab3A in astrocytes did not disrupt homeostatic plasticity, whereas selective loss in neurons strongly reduced the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitudes. Taken together with the results at the neuromuscular junction, we propose that Rab3A is a presynaptic homeostatic regulator that controls quantal size on both sides of the synapse.",

Here, we study large-scale multielectrode electrophysiological recordings of macaque (Macaca mulatta) areas V1, V4 and DP with a high spatio-temporal resolution. We find, for the first time, that the population activity of V1 contains two separate neural manifolds, which correlate strongly with eye closure (eyes open/closed) and have distinct dimensionalities. Moreover, we find strong top-down signals from V4 to V1, particularly to the foveal region of V1, which are significantly stronger during the eyes-open periods, a previously unknown effect. Finally, in silico simulations of a balanced spiking neuron network qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. Taken together, our analyses and simulations suggest that top-down signals modulate the population activity of V1, causing two distinct neural manifolds. We postulate that the top-down modulation during the eyes-open periods prepares V1 for fast and efficient visual responses, resulting in a type of visual stand-by mode.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in the GNAO1 gene, encoding the alpha subunit of an inhibitory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Go) highly expressed in the mammalian brain, have been linked to encephalopathy characterized by different combinations of neurological symptoms, including developmental delay, hypotonia, epilepsy and hyperkinetic movement disorder with life-threatening paroxysmal exacerbations. Currently there are no curative but only symptomatic treatments, and little is known on the pathophysiology of the disease. In this work, we report the characterization of a new in vitro model system based on patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying the recurrent p.G203R amino acid substitution in Go, and a CRISPR-Cas9-genetically corrected isogenic control line. RNA-Seq analysis highlighted aberrant cell fate commitment in neuronal progenitor cells carrying the p.G203R pathogenic variant. Upon differentiation into cortical neurons, patients cells showed reduced expression of early neural genes and increased expression of astrocyte markers, as well as premature and defective differentiation processes leading to aberrant formation of neuronal rosettes. Of note, comparable defects in gene expression and in the morphology of neural rosettes were observed in hiPSCs from an unrelated individual harboring the same GNAO1 variant. Functional characterization showed lower basal intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), reduced frequency of spontaneous activity, and a smaller response to several neurotransmitters in 40- and 50-days differentiated p.G203R neurons compared to control cells. These findings suggest that the GNAO1 pathogenic variant causes a neurodevelopmental phenotype characterized by aberrant differentiation of both neuronal and glial populations leading to a significant alteration of neuronal communication and signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Capacity limitations in visual tasks can be observed when the number of task-related objects increases. An influential idea is that such capacity limitations are determined by competition at the neural level: two objects that are encoded by shared neural populations interfere more in behavior (e.g., visual search) than two objects encoded by separate neural populations. However, the neural representational similarity of objects varies across brain regions and across time, raising the question of where and when competition determines task performance. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between neural representational similarity and task performance is common or unique across tasks. Here, we used neural representational similarity derived from fMRI, MEG, and deep neural networks (DNN) to predict performance on two visual search tasks involving the same objects and requiring the same responses but differing in instructions: cued visual search and oddball visual search. Separate groups of participants viewed the individual objects in neuroimaging experiments to establish the neural representational similarity between those objects. Results showed that performance on both search tasks could be predicted by neural representational similarity throughout the visual system (fMRI), from 80 msec after onset (MEG), and in all DNN layers. Stepwise regression analysis, however, revealed task-specific associations, with unique variability in oddball visual search performance predicted by early/posterior neural similarity, and unique variability in cued visual search task performance predicted by late/anterior neural similarity. These results reveal that capacity limitations in superficially similar visual search tasks may reflect competition at different stages of visual processing.\n\nSignificance StatementVisual search for target objects is slowed down by the presence of distractors, but not all distractors are equally distracting - the more similar a distractor is to the target, the more it slows down search. Here, we used fMRI, MEG, and a deep neural network to reveal where, when, and how neural similarity between targets and distractors predicts visual search performance across two search tasks: oddball visual search (locating the different-looking object) and cued visual search (locating the cued object). Results also revealed brain regions, time points, and feature levels that predicted task-unique performance. These results provide a neural basis for similarity theories of visual search and show that this neural basis differs across visual search tasks.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is a globally significant crop, playing a vital role in human nutrition and agriculture. Its complex genetic structure and wide trait variation, however, pose challenges for breeders and researchers aiming to optimize its yield and quality. Addressing this biological complexity requires innovative and accurate tools for trait prediction. In response to this challenge, we have developed SoyDNGP, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based model that offers significant advancements in the field of soybean trait prediction. Compared to existing methods, such as DeepGS and DNNGP, SoyDNGP boasts a distinct advantage due to its lower parameter volume and superior predictive accuracy. Through rigorous performance comparison, including prediction accuracy and model complexity, SoyDNGP consistently outperformed its counterparts. Furthermore, it effectively predicted complex traits with remarkable precision, demonstrating robust performance across different sample sizes and trait complexities. We also tested the versatility of SoyDNGP across multiple crop species, including Cotton, Maize, Rice, and Tomato. Our results showed its consistent and comparable performance, emphasizing SoyDNGPs potential as a versatile tool for genomic prediction across a broad range of crops. To enhance its accessibility to users without extensive programming experience, we have designed a user-friendly web server, available at http://xtlab.hzau.edu.cn/SoyDNGP. The server provides two primary features:  Trait Lookup, offering users the ability to access pre-existing trait predictions for over 500 soybean accessions, and  Trait Prediction, allowing for the upload of VCF files for trait estimation. By providing a high-performing, accessible tool for trait prediction and genomic analysis, SoyDNGP opens up new possibilities in the quest for efficient and optimized soybean breeding.",

Herein, we present a novel 4D spatiotemporal clustering method to examine dynamic neural activity associated with events (specifically the onset of human faces in audiovisual movies). Results from this study showed that 4D spatiotemporal clustering can extract clusters of fMRI activation over time that closely resemble the known spatiotemporal pattern of human face processing without the need to model a hemodynamic response function.

Spindle metrics, including chirp, and slow oscillation (SO) characteristics were compared between groups. SO and fast and slow spindle (FS, SS) interactions were also investigated. Secondary analyses were performed assessing behavioural data associations, as well as exploratory cohort comparisons to children with non-autism developmental delay (DD).\n\nResultsPosterior FS and SS chirp was significantly more negative in ASD than TD. Both groups had comparable intra-spindle frequency range and variance. Frontal and central SO amplitude were decreased in ASD. In contrast to previous manual findings, no differences were detected in other spindle or SO metrics. The ASD group displayed a higher parietal coupling angle. No differences were observed in phase-frequency coupling. The DD group demonstrated lower FS chirp and higher coupling angle than TD. Parietal SS chirp was positively associated with full developmental quotient.\n\nConclusionsFor the first time spindle chirp was investigated in autism and was found to be significantly more negative than in TD in this large cohort of young children. This finding strengthens previous reports of spindle and SO abnormalities in ASD. Further investigation of spindle chirp in healthy and clinical populations across development will help elucidate the significance of this difference and better understand this novel metric.",

In our accompanying paper, using the Drosophila lamina neurons (L1- L5) as a model, we show that the homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF) Bsh specifies L4 and L5 fates. Here we test the hypothesis that Notch signaling enables Bsh to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates. We show asymmetric Notch signaling between newborn L4 and L5 neurons, but they are not siblings; rather, Notch signaling in L4 is due to Delta expression in adjacent L1 neurons. While Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent, Notch is necessary and sufficient for Bsh to specify L4 fate over L5. With Notch signaling, L4 generates a distinct open chromatin landscape which results in distinct Bsh genome-binding loci, leading to L4-specific gene transcription. We propose that Notch signaling and HDTF function are integrated to diversify neuronal types.",

PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) can currently be derived in vitro from pluripotent cells exposed to signalling cocktails and aggregated into large embryonic bodies, but these do not recapitulate the native embryonic environment during PGC formation. Here we show that mouse gastruloids, a three-dimensional in vitro model of gastrulation, contain a population of Gastruloid-derived PGC-like cells (Gld-PGCLCs) that resemble early PGCs in vivo. Importantly, the conserved organisation of mouse gastruloids leads to coordinated spatial and temporal localisation of Gld-PGCLCs relative to surrounding somatic cells, even in the absence of specific exogenous PGC-specific signalling or extraembryonic tissues. In gastruloids, self-organised interactions between cells and tissues, including the endodermal epithelium, enables the specification and subsequent maturation of a pool of Gld-PGCLCs. As such, mouse gastruloids represent a new source of PGCLCs in vitro and, due to their inherent co-development, serve as a novel model to study the dynamics of PGC development within integrated tissue environments.",

    "abstract": "Axon pathfinding is controlled by attractive and repulsive molecular cues that activate receptors on the axonal growth cone, but the full repertoire of axon guidance molecules remains unknown. The vertebrate DCC receptor family contains the two closely related members DCC and Neogenin with prominent roles in axon guidance and three additional, divergent members - Punc, Nope, and Protogenin - for which functions in neural circuit formation have remained elusive. We identified a secreted Punc/Nope/Protogenin ligand, WFIKKN2, which guides mouse peripheral sensory axons through Nope-mediated repulsion. In contrast, WFIKKN2 attracts motor axons, but not via Nope. These findings identify WFIKKN2 as a bifunctional axon guidance cue that acts through divergent DCC family members, revealing a remarkable diversity of ligand interactions for this receptor family in nervous system wiring.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWFIKKN2 is a ligand for the DCC family receptors Punc, Nope, and Prtg that repels sensory axons and attracts motor axons.",

However, these structures are all in a similar state and information about the motion of different elements of the structure is limited, preventing a deeper understanding of how these channels work. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine high resolution structures of Arabidopsis thaliana OSCA1.2 and OSCA2.3 in peptidiscs. The structure of OSCA1.2 resembles previous structures of the same protein in different environments. Yet, in OSCA2.3 the TM6a-TM7 linker constricts the pore on its cytoplasmic side, revealing conformational heterogeneity within the OSCA family. Furthermore, coevolutionary sequence analysis uncovered a conserved interaction between TM6a-TM7 linker and the Beam-Like Domain. Our results support the involvement of TM6a-TM7 in mechanosensation and potentially in the diverse response of OSCA channels to mechanical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) can provide precise analysis of a proteins conformational dynamics across varied states, such as heat-denatured vs. native protein structures, localizing regions that are specifically affected by such conditional changes. Maximizing protein sequence coverage provides high confidence that regions of interest were located by HDX-MS, but one challenge for complete sequence coverage is N-glycosylation sites. The deuteration of glycopeptides has not always been identified in previous reports of HDX-MS analyses, causing significant sequence coverage gaps in heavily glycosylated proteins and uncertainty in structural dynamics in many regions throughout a glycoprotein. We report HDX-MS analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain in its trimeric pre-fusion form, which has 22 predicted N-glycosylation sites per monomer, with and without heat treatment. We identified glycopeptides and calculated their isotopic mass shifts from deuteration. Inclusion of the deu-terated glycopeptides increased sequence coverage of spike ectodomain from 76% to 84%, demonstrated that glycopeptides had been deuterated, and improved confidence in results localizing structural re-arrangements. Inclusion of deuterated glycopeptides improves the analysis of the conformational dynamics of glycoproteins such as viral surface antigens and cellular receptors.\n\nAbstract Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544985v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8e1f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db0774org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c68d1eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15aed98_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Creating large-scale public datasets of human motion biomechanics could unlock data-driven breakthroughs in our understanding of human motion, neuromuscular diseases, and assistive devices. However, the manual effort currently required to process motion capture data and quantify the kinematics and dynamics of movement is costly and limits the collection and sharing of large-scale biomechanical datasets. We present a method, called AddBiomechanics, to automate and standardize the quantification of human movement dynamics from motion capture data. We use linear methods followed by a non-convex bilevel optimization to scale the body segments of a musculoskeletal model, register the locations of optical markers placed on an experimental subject to the markers on a musculoskeletal model, and compute body segment kinematics given trajectories of experimental markers during a motion. We then apply a linear method followed by another non-convex optimization to find body segment masses and fine tune kinematics to minimize residual forces given corresponding trajectories of ground reaction forces. The optimization approach requires approximately 3-5 minutes to determine a subjects skeleton dimensions and motion kinematics, and less than 30 minutes of computation to also determine dynamically consistent skeleton inertia properties and fine-tuned kinematics and kinetics, compared with about one day of manual work for a human expert. We used AddBiomechanics to automatically reconstruct joint angle and torque trajectories from previously published multi-activity datasets, achieving close correspondence to expert-calculated values, marker root-mean-square errors less than 2 cm, and residual force magnitudes smaller than 2% of peak external force. Finally, we confirmed that AddBiomechanics accurately reproduced joint kinematics and kinetics from synthetic walking data with low marker error and residual loads. We have published the algorithm as an open source cloud service at AddBiomechanics.org, which is available at no cost and asks that users agree to share processed and de-identified data with the community. As of this writing, hundreds of researchers have used the prototype tool to process and share about ten thousand motion files from about one thousand experimental subjects. Reducing the barriers to processing and sharing high-quality human motion biomechanics data will enable more people to use state-of-the-art biomechanical analysis, do so at lower cost, and share larger and more accurate datasets.",

    "abstract": "The clustering method is the key to high dimensional large data analysis, especially for single-cell NGS data in biological science and biomedicine sectors. Those data require a hierarchical clustering method to unveil important biological features including differentiation patterns, stem cell identifications, cell sub-type discovery, and so on. Traditional hierarchical clustering has several issues to be applied to large high-dimension data. There are a few new approaches invented recently trying to fill in the blank. However, these approaches were either based on low-dimension or down-sampled data after dimension reduction (Anibal et al., 2022) from methods like PCA or consumed an enormous amount of computing resources to get a massive number of layer levels with highly limited interpretable information. In order to create a practically available solution, I invented an entirely new hierarchical clustering method called the BW method which can be directly applied to high-dimension large data without a requirement for dimension reduction or massive computing resources. I applied BW clustering to six single-cell RNA sequence sample data. BW clustering brought deep insight into these sample data including sub-type, differentiation branch, cell state changes (development, aging process), and gene expression instability. BW-generated layers were very concise. For almost nineteen thousand cells, BW clustering only yielded 9 layers. An analysis system was created based on the BW clustering method which can unprecedentedly display the true form of high dimensional data space. The resource BW required is also very low as all the work done in this paper used a 16GB memory laptop only, making it easily accessible to researchers with limited computing resources. Overall, the BW clustering method represents a major advancement in high-dimensional large data analysis for biological and biomedical applications.",

The mechanism for VP39 assembly remains unknown. We determined a 3.2 [A] electron cryomicroscopy helical reconstruction of an infectious nucleocapsid of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, revealing how dimers of VP39 assemble into a 14-stranded helical tube. We show that VP39 comprises a unique protein fold conserved across baculoviruses, which includes a Zinc finger domain and a stabilizing intra-dimer sling.

    "abstract": "Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling is essential for mammalian kidney development, but in the adult kidney is restricted to occasional collecting duct epithelial cells. We now show there is widespread reactivation of RAR signaling in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) in human sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), and in mouse models of AKI. Genetic inhibition of RAR signaling in PTECs protects against experimental AKI but is associated with increased expression of the PTEC injury marker, Kim-1. However, Kim-1 is also expressed by de-differentiated, proliferating PTECs, and protects against injury by increasing apoptotic cell clearance, or efferocytosis. We show that the protective effect of inhibiting PTEC RAR signaling is mediated by increased Kim-1 dependent efferocytosis, and that this is associated with de-differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic reprogramming of PTECs. These data demonstrate a novel functional role that reactivation of RAR signaling plays in regulating PTEC differentiation and function in human and experimental AKI.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545113v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140ba6borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f02f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10a123eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33b564_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Specifically, the role of carbohydrate overconsumption in the regulation of interoceptive circuits has been minimally examined in vivo. Here we report that an obesogenic high-sucrose diet (HSD) selectively blunts silencing of hunger-promoting AgRP neurons following intragastric delivery of glucose, whereas we previously showed that overconsumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) selectively attenuates lipid-induced neural silencing. By contrast, both HSD and HFD reversibly dampen rapid AgRP neuron sensory inhibition following chow presentation and promote intake of more palatable foods. Our findings reveal that excess sugar and fat pathologically modulate feeding circuit activity in both macronutrient-dependent and -independent ways, and thus may additively exacerbate obesity.",

Here we provide novel insight on this debate by using precision fMRI to compare the VWFA to adjacent VTC regions, amodal language, and multiple-demand networks. We find that the VWFA is unique in its word-selectivity within VTC. The VWFA also uniquely shows auditory language-selectivity, but this language responsiveness is dwarfed by i) its visual-selectivity even to non-preferred stimuli and ii) language-selectivity of the language network. We additionally identify a region at the tip of the VTC which prefers auditory language to visual stimuli. Finally, almost all VTC fROIs are modulated by attention, not just the VWFA. We propose that the VWFA primarily operates as a visual look-up dictionary of orthographic information, presumably facilitated through connections with canonical language cortex.",

    "abstract": "PPM1H phosphatase reverses Parkinsons disease-associated, LRRK2-mediated Rab GTPase phosphorylation. We show here that PPM1H relies on an N-terminal amphipathic helix for Golgi localization. The amphipathic helix enables PPM1H to bind to liposomes in vitro, and small, highly curved liposomes stimulate PPM1H activity. We artificially anchored PPM1H to the Golgi, mitochondria, or mother centriole. Our data show that regulation of Rab10 GTPase phosphorylation requires PPM1H access to Rab10 at or near the mother centriole. Moreover, poor co-localization of Rab12 explains in part why it is a poor substrate for PPM1H in cells but not in vitro. These data support a model in which localization drives PPM1H substrate selection and centriolar PPM1H is critical for regulation of Rab GTPase-regulated ciliogenesis. Moreover, Golgi localized PPM1H maintains active Rab GTPases on the Golgi to carry out their non-ciliogenesis-related functions in membrane trafficking.\n\nSignificance StatementPathogenic, hyperactive LRRK2 kinase is strongly linked to Parkinsons disease and LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases that are master regulators of membrane trafficking. PPM1H phosphatase specifically dephosphorylates Rab8A and Rab10, the major LRRK2 substrates. Here we provide novel cell biological and biochemical insight related to the localization and activation of PPM1H phosphatase. Understanding how PPM1H modulates LRRK2 activity is of fundamental interest and also important, as activators of PPM1H may eventually benefit Parkinsons disease patients.",

Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.",

    "abstract": "AimMany factors influence genetic variation within species, which is key for adaptation and survival in changing environments. Using amphibians as a study system, we investigated genetic diversity and structure within Neotropical species to provide insights into how natural history traits, phylogeny, and geographic characteristics influence intraspecific genetic variation.\n\nLocationNeotropical Region.\n\nTaxonAmphibians.\n\nMethodsWe assembled datasets for Neotropical amphibians using open-access databases for natural history traits, genetic sequences, phylogenetic trees, and geographic data. For each species, we calculated overall nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and tested for isolation by distance (IBD). We then identified predictors of genetic diversity ({pi}) and genetic structure (IBD) using Random Forest (RF) regression or RF classification, respectively. To more explicitly incorporate phylogenetic relationships, we also used phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs), and phylogenetic linear regression or phylogenetic logistic regression models to predict{pi} and IBD, respectively.\n\nResultsWe compiled > 4,000 mitochondrial DNA sequences from 256 amphibian species (230 frogs and 26 salamanders), georeferencing 2,468 sequences from 176 species that were not already linked to occurrence data. RF regressions, phylogenetic linear regression, and PGLMMs were congruent in identifying range size and elevation as the most important predictors of{pi} . Species with larger ranges and at lower elevations tended to have higher overall genetic diversity. RF classification and phylogenetic comparative methods identified minimum elevation as the most important predictor of IBD, with species at lower elevations being more likely to exhibit genetic structure.\n\nMain conclusionsThese results could play a key role in the development of conservation strategies for amphibians. For example, species living at high elevations or with small ranges need substantial protection due to their low genetic diversity. We also show that the Choco, Andes, and Atlantic Forests biogeographic units harbor high diversity across many species that should be prioritized for protection.",

MS is a large multi-domain protein capable of binding and activating three substrates: homocysteine, folate, S-adenosylmethionine for methylation. Achieving three chemically distinct methylations necessitates significant domain rearrangements to facilitate substrate access to the cobalamin cofactor at the right time. The distinct conformations required for each reaction have eluded structural characterization as its inherently dynamic nature renders structural studies difficult. Here, we use a thermophilic MS homolog (tMS) as a functional MS model. Its exceptional stability enabled characterization of MS in the absence of cobalamin, marking the first studies of a cobalamin-binding protein in its apoenzyme state. More importantly, we report the first high-resolution full-length MS structure, ending a multi-decade quest. We also captured cobalamin loading in crystallo, providing structural insights into holoenzyme formation. Our work paves the way for unraveling how MS orchestrates large-scale domain rearrangements crucial for achieving challenging chemistries.",

    "abstract": "The negative allosteric modulation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by Na+ ions, known as the sodium effect, was first described in the 1970s for opioid receptors (ORs). Since then, it has been detected almost universally amongst class A GPCRs. High-resolution structures of class A GPCRs in the inactive state exhibit a Na+ ion bound to a conserved pocket near residue D2.50, whereas the active state structures of GPCRs are incompatible with Na+ binding. Correspondingly, Na+ ions diminish the affinity of receptor agonists, stabilize the receptors in the inactive state, and reduce basal signalling levels. Despite these observations, a detailed mechanistic explanation of how Na+ ions negatively modulate the receptor and inhibit activation has remained elusive. Here, we apply a mutual-information based analysis method to s-timescale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the -OR to decipher conformational changes within the protein matrix and protein-internal water molecules that are directly coupled to the binding of Na+. Our results reveal that Na+ binding is tightly coupled to a water wire that links the Na+ binding site with the agonist binding pocket. Furthermore, Na+ binding leads to rearrangements in polar protein networks that propagate conformational changes both to the agonist and the intracellular G-protein binding sites via conserved micro-switch motifs. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between the presence of the ion and altered agonist binding affinity, receptor deactivation and the depression of basal signalling.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway is one of the most frequent alterations in cancer; yet therapies targeting this pathway have shown limited benefit due to drug resistance. For example, resistance to MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutant cancer cells occurs due to relief of a negative feedback that promotes CRAF activation and CRAF-MEK protein interactions, bypassing MEK inhibition. Consequently, combining CRAF and MEK inhibitors for KRAS mutant cancer is an area of intense research. Here, we discovered that the MEK1/2 PROTAC (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras) degrader, MS934, caused collateral degradation of CRAF in KRAS mutant cells via a PROTAC-mechanism, offering a new strategy to simultaneously degrade both CRAF and MEK1/2. Importantly, CRAF has been shown to have essential kinase-independent growth and survival functions outside the MEK-ERK pathway in KRAS mutant cells, making CRAF degradation an attractive therapeutic avenue. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, no CRAF PROTACs have been published. Importantly, our discovery of MS934 as a first-in-class dual CRAF/MEK degrader provides a newfound approach to overcome MEK inhibitor resistance due to relief of negative feedback, as well as block CRAF kinase-independent functions in KRAS mutant cells.",

Most scoring of fibrotic remodeling in preclinical animal models rely on the modified Ashcroft score, which is a semi-quantitative scoring rubric of macroscopic resolution. The obvious limitations inherent in manual pathohistological grading have generated an unmet need for unbiased, repeatable scoring of fibroproliferative burden in tissue. Using computer vision approaches on immunofluorescent imaging of the extracellular matrix (ECM) component laminin, we generate a robust and repeatable quantitative remodeling scorer (QRS). In the bleomycin lung injury model, QRS shows significant agreement with modified Ashcroft scoring with a significant Spearman coefficient r=0.768. This antibody-based approach is easily integrated into larger multiplex immunofluorescent experiments, which we demonstrate by testing the spatial apposition of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) to fibroproliferative tissue.

    "abstract": "Ion channels function within a membrane environment characterized by dynamic lipid compartmentalization. Limited knowledge exists regarding the response of voltage-gated ion channels to transmembrane potential within distinct membrane compartments. By leveraging fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we visualized the localization of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in membrane domains. HCN4 channels exhibit a greater affinity for ordered domains compared to HCN1 channels. To investigate the conformational changes in voltage-sensing domains (VSD) of HCN channels, we used dual stop-codon suppression to incorporate different noncanonical amino acids, orthogonal click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling, and transition metal FLIM-FRET. Remarkably, altered FRET levels were observed between VSD sites within HCN channels upon disruption of membrane domains. We propose that VSD rearrangements, directly influenced by membrane lipid domains, can explain the heightened activity of pacemaker HCN channels when localized in cholesterol-poor, disordered lipid domains, leading to membrane hyperexcitability and diseases.",

Plants grown under 1 x g (gravitational acceleration on Earth) conditions for 20-23 days and having the first visible flower bud were exposed to hypergravity at 8 x g for 10 days. We analyzed the effect of prolonged hypergravity conditions on growth, lignin deposition, and tissue anatomy of the main axis. As a result, the length of the main axis decreased and cross-sectional area, dry mass per unit length, cell number, lignin content of the main axis significantly increased under hypergravity. Lignin content in the rosette leaves also increased when they were exposed to hypergravity during their development. Except for interfascicular fibers, cross-sectional areas of the tissues composing the internode significantly increased under hypergravity in most type of the tissues in the basal part than the apical part of the main axis, indicating that the effect of hypergravity is more pronounced in the basal part than the apical part. The number of cells in fascicular cambium and xylem significantly increased under hypergravity both in the apical and basal internodes of the main axis, indicating a possibility that hypergravity stimulates procambium activity to produce xylem element more than phloem element. The main axis was suggested to be strengthened through changes in its morphological characteristics as well as lignin deposition under prolonged hypergravity conditions.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the process of transcription through the modulation of different kinetic steps. Although models can often describe the observed transcriptional output of a measured gene, predicting a TFs role on a given promoter requires an understanding of how the TF alters each step of the transcription process. In this work, we use a simple model of transcription to assess the role of promoter identity, and the degree to which TFs alter binding of RNAP (stabilization) and initiation of transcription (acceleration) on three primary characteristics: the range of steady-state regulation, cell-to-cell variability in expression, and the dynamic response time of a regulated gene. We find that steady state regulation and the response time of a gene behave uniquely for TFs that regulate incoherently, i.e that speed up one step but slow the other. These TFs function as activators when regulating weak promoters but switch to repression when the promoters are strong or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that TFs with this regulatory make-up have dynamic implications, with one type of incoherent mode configuring the promoter to respond more slowly at intermediate TF concentrations. We also demonstrate that the noise of gene expression for these TFs is sensitive to promoter strength, with a distinct non-monotonic profile that is apparent under stronger promoters. Taken together, our work uncovers the coupling between promoters and TF regulatory modes with implications for understanding natural promoters and engineering synthetic gene circuits with desired expression properties.",

The tendency to excessively discount the value of delayed rewards is thought to reflect deficits in brain regions critical for impulse control such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This study tested the hypothesis that dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) is critically involved in flexibly managing neural representations of strategies that limit impulsive choices. Optogenetic silencing of neurons in the rat dmPFC increased impulsive choices at an 8 sec, but not 4 sec, delay. Neural recordings from dmPFC ensembles revealed that, at the 8-sec delay, the encoding landscape transitions to reflect a deliberative-like process rather than the schema-like processes observed at the 4-sec delay. These findings show that changes in the encoding landscape reflect changes in task demands and that dmPFC is uniquely involved in decisions requiring deliberation.",

Ion channels are a crucial component of the cellular machinery for the proper physiological functioning of all living species. This study aims to explore the evolution of ion channels during the evolutionary history of cetaceans. To do so, we created a bioinformatic pipeline to annotate the repertoire of ion channels in the genome of the species included in our sampling. Our main results show that cetaceans have fewer ion channels than non-cetacean mammals and that the signal of positive selection was found in ion channels related to heart, locomotion, and hearing phenotypes. Interestingly the NaV1.5 ion channel of most toothed whales (odontocetes) seems to be sensitive to TTX, similar to NaV1.7, given the presence of tyrosine, instead of cysteine, in a specific position of the ion channel. Finally, the gene turnover rate of the cetacean crown group is more than two times faster than non-cetacean mammals.",

Chloroquine blocks this detoxification process, resulting in heme-mediated toxicity in malaria parasites. However, the exact mechanism of chloroquines action remains unknown. This study investigates the impact of chloroquine on the transformation of heme into {beta}-hematin. The results show that chloroquine does not completely halt the transformation process but rather slows it down. Additionally, chloroquine complexation with free heme does not affect substrate availability or inhibit {beta}-hematin formation. SEM and XRD studies indicate that the size of {beta}-hematin crystal particles and crystallite increases in the presence of chloroquine, suggesting that chloroquine does not impede crystal growth. These findings suggest that chloroquine delays hemozoin production by perturbing the nucleation events of crystals and/or the stability of crystal nuclei. Thus, contrary to prevailing beliefs, this study provides a new perspective on the working mechanism of chloroquine.",

    "abstract": "Vancomycins interactions with cellular targets drive its antimicrobial activity, and also trigger expression of resistance against the antibiotic. Interaction partners for vancomycin have previously been identified using photoaffinity probes, which have proven to be useful tools for exploring vancomycins interactome. This work seeks to develop diazirine-based vancomycin photoprobes that display enhanced specificity and bear fewer chemical modifications, as compared to previous photoprobes. Using proteins fused to vancomycins main cell-wall target, D-alanyl-D-alanine, we use mass spectrometry to show that these photoprobes specifically label known vancomycin-binding partners within minutes. In a complementary approach, we developed a Western-blot strategy targeting the vancomycin adduct of the photoprobes, eliminating the need for affinity tags and simplifying the analysis of photolabeling reactions. Together, the probes and identification strategy provide a novel and streamlined pipeline for identifying novel vancomycin-binding proteins.\n\nFor Table of Contents Only.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545140v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d21b8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f4d4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19bb1f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf3dd5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons of eutherian mammals project to the contralateral hemisphere, crossing the midline primarily via the corpus callosum and the anterior, posterior, and hippocampal commissures. We recently reported an additional commissural pathway in rodents, termed the thalamic commissures (TCs), as another interhemispheric axonal fiber pathway that connects cortex to the contralateral thalamus. Here, we demonstrate that TCs also exist in primates and characterize the connectivity of these pathways with high-resolution diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, viral axonal tracing, and functional MRI. We present evidence of TCs in both New World (Callithrix jacchus and Cebus apella) and Old World primates (Macaca mulatta). Further, like rodents, we show that the TCs in primates develop during the embryonic period, forming anatomical and functionally active connections of the cortex with the contralateral thalamus. We also searched for TCs in the human brain, showing their presence in humans with brain malformations, although we could not identify TCs in healthy subjects. These results pose the TCs as an important fiber pathway in the primate brain, allowing for more robust interhemispheric connectivity and synchrony and serving as an alternative commissural route in developmental brain malformations.\n\nSignificance statementBrain connectivity is a central topic in neuroscience. Understanding how brain areas can communicate allows for the comprehension of brain structure and function. We have described in rodents a new commissure pathway that connects the cortex to the contralateral thalamus. Here, we investigate whether this pathway exists in non-human primates and humans. The presence of these commissures poses the TCs as an important fiber pathway in the primate brain, allowing for more robust interhemispheric connectivity and synchrony and serving as an alternative commissural route in developmental brain malformations.",

    "abstract": "How we perceive the physical world is not only organized in terms of objects, but also structured in time as sequences of events. This is especially evident in intuitive physics, with temporally bounded dynamics such as falling, occlusion, and bouncing demarcating the continuous flow of sensory inputs. While the spatial structure and attentional consequences of physical objects have been well-studied, much less is known about the temporal structure and attentional consequences of physical events in visual perception. Previous work has recognized physical events as units in the mind, and used pre-segmented object interactions to explore physical representations. However, these studies did not address whether and how perception imposes the kind of temporal structure that carves these physical events to begin with, and the attentional consequences of such segmentation during intuitive physics. Here, we use performance-based tasks to address this gap. In Experiment 1, we find that perception not only spontaneously separates visual input in time into physical events, but also, this segmentation occurs in a nonlinear manner within a few hundred milliseconds at the moment of the event boundary. In Experiment 2, we find that event representations, once formed, use coarse  look ahead simulations to selectively prioritize those objects that are predictively part of the unfolding dynamics. This rich temporal and predictive structure of physical events, formed during vision, should inform models of intuitive physics.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster larval development relies on a specialized metabolic state that utilizes carbohydrates and other dietary nutrients to promote rapid growth. One unique feature of the larval metabolic program is that Lactate Dehydrogenase (Ldh) activity is highly elevated during this growth phase when compared to other stages of the fly life cycle, indicating that Ldh serves a key role in promoting juvenile development. Previous studies of larval Ldh activity have largely focused on the function of this enzyme at the whole animal level, however, Ldh expression varies significantly among larval tissues, raising the question of how this enzyme promotes tissue-specific growth programs. Here we characterize two transgene reporters and an antibody that can be used to study Ldh expression in vivo. We find that all three tools produce similar Ldh expression patterns. Moreover, these reagents demonstrate that the larval Ldh expression pattern is complex, suggesting the purpose of this enzyme varies across cell types. Overall, our studies validate a series of genetic and molecular reagents that can be used to study glycolytic metabolism in the fly.",

Our mechanistic knowledge of this window of human life remains limited due to restricted access to in vivo samples for both technical and ethical reasons. Additionally, human stem cell models of early post-implantation development with both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue morphogenesis are lacking. Here, we present iDiscoid, produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells via an engineered a synthetic gene circuit. iDiscoids exhibit reciprocal co-development of human embryonic tissue and engineered extra-embryonic niche in a model of human post-implantation. They exhibit unanticipated self-organization and tissue boundary formation that recapitulates yolk sac-like tissue specification with extra-embryonic mesoderm and hematopoietic characteristics, the formation of bilaminar disc-like embryonic morphology, the development of an amniotic-like cavity, and acquisition of an anterior-like hypoblast pole and posterior-like axis. iDiscoids offer an easy-to-use, high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable platform to probe multifaceted aspects of human early post-implantation development.

    "abstract": "The detection of selective sweeps from population genomic data often relies on the premise that the beneficial mutations in question have fixed very near the sampling time. As it has been previously shown that the power to detect a selective sweep is strongly dependent on the time since fixation as well as the strength of selection, it is naturally the case that strong, recent sweeps leave the strongest signatures. However, the biological reality is that beneficial mutations enter populations at a rate, one that partially determines the mean wait time between sweep events and hence their age distribution. An important question thus remains about the power to detect recurrent selective sweeps when they are modelled by a realistic mutation rate and as part of a realistic distribution of fitness effects (DFE), as opposed to a single, recent, isolated event on a purely neutral background as is more commonly modelled. Here we use forward-in-time simulations to study the performance of commonly used sweep statistics, within the context of more realistic evolutionary baseline models incorporating purifying and background selection, population size change, and mutation and recombination rate heterogeneity. Results demonstrate the important interplay of these processes, necessitating caution when interpreting selection scans; specifically, false positive rates are in excess of true positive across much of the evaluated parameter space, and selective sweeps are often undetectable unless the strength of selection is exceptionally strong.\n\nTeaser TextOutlier-based genomic scans have proven a popular approach for identifying loci that have potentially experienced recent positive selection. However, it has previously been shown that an evolutionarily appropriate baseline model that incorporates non-equilibrium population histories, purifying and background selection, and variation in mutation and recombination rates is necessary to reduce often extreme false positive rates when performing genomic scans. Here we evaluate the power to detect recurrent selective sweeps using common SFS-based and haplotype-based methods under these increasingly realistic models. We find that while these appropriate evolutionary baselines are essential to reduce false positive rates, the power to accurately detect recurrent selective sweeps is generally low across much of the biologically relevant parameter space.",

In vitro experiments that mimic the mechanical environment experienced by cells in vivo are crucial for understanding cellular behavior and the progression of disease. In this study, we developed and validated a low-cost pneumatically-controlled cell stretcher with independent control of strain in two directions of a membrane, enabling unequal biaxial stretching and realtime microscopy during actuation.\n\nMethodsThe stretching was achieved by two independent pneumatic channels controlled by electrical signals. We used finite element simulations to compute the membranes strain field and particle tracking algorithms based on image processing techniques to validate the strain fields and measure the cell orientation and morphology.\n\nResultsThe device can supply uniaxial, equibiaxial, and unequal biaxial stretching up to 15% strain in each direction at a frequency of 1Hz, with a strain measurement error of less than 1%. Through live cell imaging, we determined that distinct stretching patterns elicited differing responses and alterations in cell orientation and morphology, particularly in terms of cell length and area.\n\nConclusionThe device successfully provides a large, uniform, and variable strain field for cell experiments, while also enabling real-time, live cell imaging.\n\nSignificanceThis scalable, low-cost platform provides mechanical stimulation to cell cultures by independently controlling strains in two directions.

We introduce the Expander-Collider penalty to tackle under and overestimation in TMCMC-HMMs. We address all known challenges inherent in BS-Seq data by introducing novel approaches for capturing functional patterns and autocorrelation structure of the data, as well as for handling missing values, multiple covariates, multiple comparisons, and family-wise errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMCTHM through comprehensive simulation studies. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other competing methods in identifying DMCs.

We investigated whether miRNAs from human islets and islet-derived EVs could provide insight into {beta} cell stress pathways activated during type 1 diabetes (T1D) evolution, therefore serving as potential disease biomarkers. We treated human islets from 10 cadaveric donors with IL-1{beta} and IFN-{gamma} to model T1D ex vivo. MicroRNAs were isolated from islets and islet-derived EVs, and small RNA sequencing was performed. We found 20 and 14 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in cytokine-versus control-treated islets and EVs, respectively. Interestingly, the miRNAs found in EVs were mostly different from those found in islets. Only two miRNAs, miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p, were upregulated in both islets and EVs, suggesting selective sorting of miRNAs into EVs. We used machine learning algorithms to rank DE EV-associated miRNAs, and developed custom label-free Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance-based biosensors to measure top ranked EVs in human plasma. Results from this analysis revealed that miR-155, miR-146, miR-30c, and miR-802 were upregulated and miR-124-3p was downregulated in plasma-derived EVs from children with recent-onset T1D. In addition, miR-146 and miR-30c were upregulated in plasma-derived EVs of autoantibody positive (AAb+) children compared to matched non-diabetic controls, while miR-124 was downregulated in both T1D and AAb+ groups. Furthermore, single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed increased expression of the most highly upregulated islet miRNA, miR-155, in pancreatic sections from organ donors with AAb+ and T1D.\n\nOne Sentence SummarymiRNA expression patterns in human pancreatic islets and EVs change under inflammatory conditions and can be leveraged to inform biomarkers strategies for T1D.",

Additionally, sugar and anthocyanin accumulation in the fruit were monitored at the end of the season to characterize the impact of the virus on ripening. Virus infection significantly reduced carbon assimilation pre- and postveraison, but the impact was more pronounced postveraison and during the afternoon when vine water status was the lowest. Similarly, virus infection significantly increased leaf starch concentration pre- and postveraison, but increased leaf starch in infected vines was detected two weeks prior to veraison. Virus infection had the greatest impact on obstructing leaf carbon export postveraison, especially during the afternoon. The virus had no impact on chlorophyll fluorescence, indicating there was no sustained photosystem impairment and suggesting that changes in chlorophyll fluorescence were a transient response to reduced carbon assimilation and export. This study provides evidence that reduced carbon export constitutes a feedback inhibition response to accumulation of leaf starch prior to the appearance of visible symptoms or impacts to ripening, which may aid earlier detection of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Older individuals and people with HIV (PWH) were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination, yet comprehensive studies of the immunogenicity of these vaccines and their effects on HIV reservoirs are not available. We followed 68 PWH aged 55 and older and 23 age-matched HIV-negative individuals for 48 weeks from the first vaccine dose, after the total of three doses. All PWH were on antiretroviral therapy (cART) and had different immune status, including immune responders (IR), immune non-responders (INR), and PWH with low-level viremia (LLV). We measured total and neutralizing Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD in sera, total anti-spike Abs in saliva, frequency of anti-RBD/NTD B cells, changes in frequency of anti-spike, HIV gag/nef-specific T cells, and HIV reservoirs in peripheral CD4+ T cells. The resulting datasets were used to create a mathematical model for within-host immunization. Various regimens of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 vaccines elicited equally strong anti-spike IgG responses in PWH and HIV- participants in serum and saliva at all timepoints. These responses had similar kinetics in both cohorts and peaked at 4 weeks post-booster (third dose), while half-lives of plasma IgG also dramatically increased post-booster in both groups. Salivary spike IgA responses were low, especially in INRs. PWH had diminished live virus neutralizing titers after two vaccine doses which were  rescued after a booster. Anti-spike T cell immunity was enhanced in IRs even in comparison to HIV- participants, suggesting Th1 imprinting from HIV, while in INRs it was the lowest. Increased frequency of viral  blips in PWH were seen post-vaccination, but vaccines did not affect the size of the intact HIV reservoir in CD4+ T cells in most PWH, except in LLVs. Thus, older PWH require three doses of COVID-19 vaccine to maximize neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2, although vaccines may increase HIV reservoirs in PWH with persistent viremia.",

    "abstract": "The IgG antibody class forms an important basis of the humoral immune response, conferring reciprocal protection from both pathogens and autoimmunity. IgG function is determined by the IgG subclass, as defined by the heavy chain, as well as the glycan composition at N297, the conserved site of N-glycosylation within the Fc domain. For example, lack of core fucose promotes increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, whereas 2,6-linked sialylation by the enzyme ST6Gal1 helps to drive immune quiescence. Despite the immunological significance of these carbohydrates, little is known about how IgG glycan composition is regulated. We previously reported that mice with ST6Gal1-deficient B cells have unaltered IgG sialylation. Likewise, ST6Gal1 released into the plasma by hepatocytes does not significantly impact overall IgG sialylation. Since IgG and ST6Gal1 have independently been shown to exist in platelet granules, it was possible that platelet granules could serve as a B cell-extrinsic site for IgG sialylation. To address this hypothesis, we used a platelet factor 4 (Pf4)-Cre mouse to delete ST6Gal1 in megakaryocytes and platelets alone or in combination with an albumin-Cre mouse to also remove it from hepatocytes and the plasma. The resulting mouse strains were viable and had no overt pathological phenotype. We also found that despite targeted ablation of ST6Gal1, no change in IgG sialylation was apparent. Together with our prior findings, we can conclude that in mice, neither B cells, the plasma, nor platelets have a substantial role in homeostatic IgG sialylation.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial motility is generally a critical virulence factor for pathogenic species, and thus studies on bacterial motility are significant given that they elucidate the mechanisms of infection and disease. Although fluorescent labeling has been the mainstream approach to detecting individual bacteria in a population or in host tissues, it contains problems related to protein expression stability and interference with bacterial physiology. Here, we applied machine learning to microscopic image analysis to achieve label-free motion tracking of the zoonotic bacterium Leptospira interrogans on cultured animal cells. The label-free method allowed us to measure various leptospiral strains isolated from human and animal patients, and natural reservoirs, showing that fast mobility on kidney cells tends to result in severe symptom. We also analyzed the surface locomotion of mutant strains lacking outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and revealed that the loss of OMPs reduced adherence and facilitated motility on cultured kidney cells. The behavior of clinical isolates and OMP-deficient mutants on cultured cells showed the inverse correlation between adhesion and mobility, which could affect infection outcomes. Thus, our computer vision technique eliminated the restriction on available bacterial strains and provided information that could help in understanding the mechanisms underlying motility-dependent bacterial pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASCL1) is a lineage oncogene that is central for the growth and survival of small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC-NE) that express it. Targeting ASCL1, or its downstream pathways, remains a challenge. However, a potential clue to overcoming this challenage has been information that SCLC and NSCLC-NE that express ASCL1 exhibit extremely low ERK1/2 activity, and efforts to increase ERK1/2 activity lead to inhibition of SCLC growth and surival. Of course, this is in dramatic contrast to the majority of NSCLCs where high activity of the ERK pathway plays a major role in cancer pathogenesis. A major knowledge gap is defining the mechanism(s) underlying the low ERK1/2 activity in SCLC, determining if ERK1/2 activity and ASCL1 function are inter-related, and if manipulating ERK1/2 activity provides a new therapeutic strategy for SCLC. We first found that expression of ERK signaling and ASCL1 have an inverse relationship in NE lung cancers: knocking down ASCL1 in SCLCs and NE-NSCLCs increased active ERK1/2, while inhibition of residual SCLC/NSCLC-NE ERK1/2 activity with a MEK inhibitor increased ASCL1 expression. To determine the effects of ERK activity on expression of other genes, we obtained RNA-seq from ASCL1-expressing lung tumor cells treated with an ERK pathway MEK inhibitor and identified down-regulated genes (such as SPRY4, ETV5, DUSP6, SPRED1) that potentially could influence SCLC/NSCLC-NE tumor cell survival. This led us to discover that genes regulated by MEK inhibition suppress ERK activation and CHIP-seq demonstrated these are bound by ASCL1. In addition, SPRY4, DUSP6, SPRED1 are known suppressors of the ERK1/2 pathway, while ETV5 regulates DUSP6. Survival of NE lung tumors was inhibited by activation of ERK1/2 and a subset of ASCL1-high NE lung tumors expressed DUSP6. Because the dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) is an ERK1/2-selective phosphatase that inactivates these kinases and has a pharmacologic inhibitor, we focused mechanistic studies on DUSP6. These studies showed: Inhibition of DUSP6 increased active ERK1/2, which accumulated in the nucleus; pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of DUSP6 affected proliferation and survival of ASCL1-high NE lung cancers; and that knockout of DUSP6 \"cured\" some SCLCs while in others resistance rapidly developed indicating a bypass mechanism was activated. Thus, our findings fill this knowledge gap and indicate that combined expression of ASCL1, DUSP6 and low phospho-ERK1/2 identify some neuroendocrine lung cancers for which DUSP6 may be a therapeutic target.",

Sequence-based approaches showed success but remain restrictive, especially when the amount of experimental data used for the training is scarce. Structure-based approaches which represent powerful alternatives, notably to optimize TCRs affinity towards specific epitopes, show limitations for large scale predictions. To handle these challenges, we present TCRpcDist, a 3D-based approach that calculates similarities between TCRs using a metric related to the physico-chemical properties of the loop residues predicted to interact with the epitope. By exploiting private and public datasets and comparing TCRpcDist with competing approaches, we demonstrate that TCRpcDist can accurately identify groups of TCRs that are likely to bind the same or similar epitopes. Additionally, we experimentally validated the ability of TCRpcDist to predict antigen-specificities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes orphan TCRs obtained from four cancer patients. TCRpcDist is a promising approach to support TCR repertoire analysis and cancer immunotherapies.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe present a new approach for TCR clustering which allows TCR deorphanization for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Suppressive function of regulatory T (Treg) cells is dependent on signaling of their antigen receptors triggered by cognate self, dietary or microbial antigens in the form of peptide-MHC class II complexes. However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCR are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we used a fixed TCR{beta} chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector TCR repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. For both subsets, we observed challenge-specific clonal expansion yielding homologous TCR clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which were reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some clusters were shared across cancer challenges, suggesting response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eTreg clonal response did not overlap, indicating the distinct origin of the two cell subsets. At the same time, we observed such overlap at the sites of certain tumor challenges. The overlaps included dominant responding TCR motif and characteristic iNKT TCR, suggesting the tumor-induced eCD4-eTreg plasticity. Our TCR repertoire analysis also demonstrated that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for eTreg cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge, revealing the homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations. Altogether, our study highlights both challenge-specific and tissue-specific responses of Treg cells associated with distinct clonal expansions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/544726v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d8577dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57d497org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4633d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5872b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Interspecific competition is one of the most important metabolic interactions within microbial communities, and exoelectrogenic bacteria that can conduct extracellular electron transfer act essential roles in nature and engineering systems for pollutants removal. In the present study we investigated the long-term impact of substrate competition from non-exoelectrogenic Citrobacter freundii An1 on exoelectrogenic Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Without additional electron acceptor or with electron acceptor of oxygen, C. freundii An1 typically suppressed the growth of S. oneidensis MR-1. In contrast, S. oneidensis MR-1 grown better with electron acceptor of ferrihydrite by taking advantage of extracellular electron transfer. However, the presence of ferrihydrite did not enhance the ferrihydrite reduction of S. oneidensis MR-1 after the 160 d-acclimation. The whole genome resequencing showed a complex evolution of S. oneidensis MR-1 when the strain faced the competition from C. freundii An1 for substrate.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of archaellation, the formation of archaeal flagella-like appendages called archaella, is crucial for the motility, adhesion, and survival of archaeal organisms. Although the heavily archaellated and highly motile Pyrococcus furiosus is a key model organism for understanding the production and function of archaella in Euryarchaea, the transcriptional regulation of archaellum assembly is so far unknown. Here we show that the transcription factor EarA is the master regulator of the archaellum (arl) operon transcription, which is further modulated by intergenic transcription termination signals. EarA deletion or overexpression strains demonstrate that EarA is essential for archaellation in P. furiosus and governs the degree of archaellation. Providing a single-molecule update on the transcriptional landscape of the arl operon in P. furiosus, we identify sequence motifs for EarA binding upstream of the arl operon and intergenic terminator sequences as critical elements for fine-tuning the expression of the multicistronic arl cluster. Furthermore, transcriptome re-analysis across different Thermococcales species demonstrated a heterogeneous production of major archaellins, suggesting a more diverse composition of archaella than previously recognized. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulation of archaellation and highlights the essential role of EarA in Pyrococcus furiosus. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms governing archaellation and have implications for the functional diversity of archaella.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella Typhimurium is an enteric pathogen that is highly tolerant to bile. Next-generation mRNA sequencing was performed to analyse the stress and adaptive responses of S. Typhimurium to bile. We identified the cellular pathways affected during bile stress in wild type (WT) and a mutant lacking cspE ({Delta}cspE), which plays an essential role in protection from bile stress. We observed transcriptional upregulation of several genes involved in nitrate metabolism, in response to bile stress. These genes were also differentially expressed between the bile-resilient WT and the bile-sensitive {Delta}cspE strain. To understand the role of nitrate metabolism in bile stress response, we generated a strain lacking fnr ({Delta}fnr), which is the global regulator of nitrate metabolism in S. Typhimurium. fnr was highly induced in the bile treated WT strain but not in the {Delta}cspE strain. Notably, the {Delta}fnr strain was susceptible to bile-mediated killing. Our studies revealed a new role for fnr in mediating the bile stress response. In addition, a strain lacking arcA ({Delta}arcA), a two-component system response regulator involved in anaerobic metabolism, also showed a marked reduction in growth in presence of bile. This corroborated the significance of anaerobic metabolism in S. Typhimurium bile tolerance. Importantly, overexpression of fnr and arcA lowered reactive oxygen species and significantly enhanced the survival of the bile-sensitive {Delta}cspE strain. We also observed that S. Typhimurium pre-treated with nitrate displayed better growth in the presence of bile. Together, these results demonstrate that nitrate-dependent anaerobic metabolism promotes adaptation of S. Typhimurium to bile.\n\nImportanceSalmonella Typhimurium, as an enteric pathogen, manifests an extreme example of bile tolerance. This study describes the diverse metabolic changes at the level of transcriptome in S. Typhimurium exposed to bile. We identified the differential expression of several genes involved in anaerobic metabolism between bile-tolerant WT and bile-sensitive {Delta}cspE strains. Two major regulators of anaerobic metabolism, fnr and arcA, support the growth of S. Typhimurium in bile. Our results highlight that, in presence of bile, S. Typhimurium activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, specifically nitrate metabolism, that improves survival of bacteria during bile stress.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate host signaling pathways, including the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, where pathogen-derived biomolecules imitate host biomolecules. In this study, we used a sequence-based bioinformatics pipeline to identify potential molecular mimicry candidates between humans and 32 pathogenic species--bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths--of global health importance. We observed considerable variation in the number of mimicry candidates across pathogenic species, with pathogenic bacteria exhibiting fewer candidates compared to fungi and protozoans. Further analysis revealed that the candidate mimicry regions were enriched in solvent-accessible regions, highlighting their potential functional relevance. We identified a total of 1878 mimicked regions in 1439 human proteins, and clustering analysis indicated diverse target proteins across pathogen species. The human proteins containing mimicked regions revealed significant associations between these proteins and various biological processes, with an emphasis on host extracellular matrix organization and cytoskeletal processes. However, immune-related proteins were underrepresented as targets of mimicry. Our findings provide insights into the broad range of host-pathogen interactions mediated by molecular mimicry and highlight potential targets for further investigation. This comprehensive analysis contributes to our understanding of the complex mechanisms employed by pathogens to subvert host defenses and promotes the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "An ability of fungi to undergo hyphal constriction is important for fungal ecology and diseases. In the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, hyphal constriction is required to traverse host cell junctions through pit fields. However, little is known about genetic underpinnings of hyphal constriction, except the requirement of a mitogen-activated protein kinase, Pmk1. Here we demonstrate that a simple in vitro assay based on nitrocellulose membrane allows investigation of the genetic basis for hyphal constriction. Using the assay, we found that the constriction limit of M. oryzae hypha lies between 0.22 and 0.3 m, and that a histone modification might be involved in hyphal constriction. RNA-seq experiments combining our assay and {Delta}pmk1 showed that hyphal constriction relies on transcriptional changes of genes implicated primarily in membrane and cell wall-related cellular processes in Pmk1-dependent and/or Pmk1-independent manner. Furthermore, our assays with diverse fungal species suggest correlation between hyphal constriction and fungal lifestyles.

We demonstrated that WBSCR16 is essential for the specific cleavage of 16S rRNA-tRNALeu, leading to the production of maturated 16S rRNA, which in turn controls mitochondrial large ribosomal assembly. Importantly, WBSCR16 was identified as a 16S rRNA-binding protein that directly interacts with RNase P subunit MRPP3. Furthermore, evidence showed that WBSCR16 ablation promotes energy wasting via lipid cycling in BAT, leading to excess energy expenditure and resistance to obesity. Conversely, cells and mice with WBSCR16 overexpression preferred to glucose utilization.

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models can provide predictive insight into the design and optimization of engineered biological systems, but the kinetic parameters in the models need to be frequently calibrated and uniquely identified. This limitation can be addressed by integrating mechanistic models with data-driven approaches, a strategy known as hybrid modeling. Herein, we developed a hybrid modeling strategy using bioelectrochemical systems as a platform system. The data-driven component of the model consisted of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that were trained by using mechanistically derived parameter values (e.g., the maximum specific growth rate {micro}max and the maximum substrate utilization rate kmax for the fermentative, electroactive, and methanogenic populations, and the mediator yield for electroactive microbes YM) as outputs to compute error signals. The hybrid model was built using 148 samples collected from 25 publications. After ten-fold cross-validation, the model was tested with another 28 samples. Internal resistance was accurately predicted with a relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.9%. Microbial kinetic parameters were also calibrated using the data-driven component. They were fed into the mechanistic component to predict system performance. The R2 between the predicted and observed organic removal and current production for systems fed with a simple substrate were 0.90 and 0.94, respectively, significantly higher than those obtained with a standalone data-driven model (0.51 and 0) and a standalone mechanistic model (0.07 and 0.15). The hybrid modeling strategy can potentially be applied to a variety of engineered biological systems for in silico system design and optimization.\n\nSYNOPSISA hybrid modeling strategy was developed to predict the performance of engineered biological systems without the need for laborious experiment-based parameter calibration.",

    "abstract": "Microbial predators obtain energy from killing other living cells. In this study, we present compelling evidence demonstrating that widely distributed Streptomyces soil bacteria, typically not considered as predators, possess the ability to detect and prey on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that predation is initiated by physical contact between Streptomyces lavendulae YAKB-15 and yeast cells. Comparative transcriptomics data indicated that the interaction triggered the production of numerous lytic enzymes to digest all major components of the yeast cell wall. The production of various glucanases, mannosidases and chitinases was confirmed by proteomics and enzymatic activity measurements. In order to destabilise the yeast cell membrane and assimilate yeast, Streptomyces lavendulae YAKB-15 induced production of cell-associated antifungal polyenes, namely pentamycin and filipin III, and cholesterol oxidase ChoD. In response, yeast downregulated protein synthesis and attempted to enter a quiescence-like state. We show that yeast predation is a common phenomenon in Streptomyces, including well-characterized strains such as Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 27952, where the interaction led to production of 14-hydroxyisochainin. Finally, gene inactivation studies lead us to propose a multidirectional assault model harbouring numerous redundancies that are not dependant on any single individual factor. Our results provide insights into the ecological role of Streptomyces and highlight the utilization of predation as a mechanism to elicit the production of bioactive natural products for drug discovery.\n\nSignificance StatementSoil is a rich environment for microbes, where they compete for space and resources. Streptomyces bacteria are well-known for their ability to synthesize natural products, particularly antibiotics, that are used in chemical defense against competing microbes. Here we show that Streptomyces are, in fact, predatory bacteria. Upon encountering yeast cells, Streptomyces initiate the production of numerous enzymes that digest the cell wall of yeast. In addition, the interaction triggers the production of natural products that destabilize the yeast cell membrane.

    "abstract": "The influence of Streptococcus pneumoniae metabolism on nasal epithelial interactions is under-explored. We have assessed S. pneumoniae mutations affecting glutamate 5 kinase (proABC) and formate tetrahydrofolate reductase (fhs). A Pia iron transporter (piaA) mutation was added to ensure attenuation in Experimental Human Pneumococcal Challenge (EHPC).\n\nEpithelial microinvasion by {Delta}proABC/piaA and {Delta}fhs/piaA strains was enhanced compared to wild-type (WT) in EHPC and Detroit 562 cell infection. In primary epithelium, acetylated tubulin and {beta} catenin expression was increased following {Delta}proABC exposure and uteroglobin expression was increased with {Delta}fhs exposure. In Detroit 562 cells, WT and {Delta}proABC infection induced an inflammatory epithelial transcriptomic response. The {Delta}fhs/piaA strain induced primarily cellular stress/ repair gene responses. Differential caspase 3/7/8 activity appeared linked to pneumococcal pneumolysin activity and hydrogen peroxide secretion.\n\nOur findings highlight the broad-ranging effects of single gene mutations in pneumococcal metabolism which underlies the complexity of the differences between seemingly closely related pneumococci.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACTBacterial transcriptomics revealed profound effects of biosynthesis gene mutations on bacterial gene expression under serum stress, with upregulation of bacterial virulence factors such as pneumolysin and hydrogen peroxide regulator genes (e.g. spxB). Epithelial microinvasion by the isogenic mutants was increased compared to wild type strain, but bacterial load was not sufficient to account for the differences observed in epithelial gene expression. Deletion of the fhs gene induced a more intrinsic cellular stress and repair response, compared to the wild-type strain or deletion of the proABC operons which induced a more typical pro-inflammatory response. Differential effects were also seen in cellular re-modelling and caspase activity. We postulate that this link between bacterial metabolism and virulence under conditions of stress will ultimately influence the outcome of colonisation in terms of transmission potential, transition to disease and generation of protective immunity.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=86 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/545009v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ca414org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c85381org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e246ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a5b36_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for chronic, drug-resistant lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although extensive heterogeneity in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes of P. aeruginosa CF lung populations has been previously described, there has yet to be a thorough investigation on how genomic diversification drives the evolution of AMR diversity within a population. In this study, we harnessed sequencing from a collection of 300 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa to unravel the evolution of resistance diversity in four individuals with CF. We found that genomic diversity was not always a reliable predictor of phenotypic AMR diversity within a population, and notably, the least genetically diverse population in this cohort displayed AMR diversity comparable to that of populations with up to two orders of magnitude more SNPs. Hypermutator strains often displayed increased sensitivity to antimicrobials, even when there was a history of use of antimicrobial in the treatment of the patient. Lastly, we sought to determine whether diversity in AMR could be explained by evolutionary trade-offs with other traits. Our results showed no strong evidence of collateral sensitivity between aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, or fluoroquinolone antibiotics within these populations. Additionally, there was no evidence of trade-offs between AMR and growth in a sputum-mimicking environment. Overall, our findings highlight that (i) genomic diversity within a population is not a necessary precursor to phenotypic diversity in AMR; (ii) hypermutator populations can evolve increased sensitivity to antimicrobials even under apparent antibiotic selection; and that (iii) resistance to a single antibiotic may not impose enough of a fitness cost to elicit trade-offs with fitness.",

We develop and outline a protocol that leverages S1 nucleases ability to effectively introduce breaks into both open and closed chromatin regions, allowing for comprehensive profiling of chromatin properties. Our S1 Hi-C method enables the preparation of high-quality Hi-C libraries, marking a significant advancement over previously established DNase I Hi-C protocols. Moreover, S1 nucleases capability to fragment chromatin to mono-nucleosomes suggests the potential for mapping the three-dimensional organization of the genome at high resolution. This methodology holds promise for an improved understanding of chromatin state-dependent activities and may facilitate the development of new genomic methods.",

    "abstract": "Translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) typically abrogates translation of main (m)ORFs. The molecular mechanism of uORF regulation in cells is not well understood. Here, we identified a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure residing within the GATA4 uORF that augments uORF translation and inhibits mORF translation. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that disrupt this dsRNA structure promote mORF translation, while ASOs that base-pair immediately downstream (i.e., forming a bimolecular double-stranded region) of either the uORF or mORF start codon enhance uORF or mORF translation, respectively. Human cardiomyocytes and mice treated with a uORF-enhancing ASO showed reduced cardiac GATA4 protein levels and increased resistance to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We further show the general utility of uORF-dsRNA- or mORF- targeting ASO to regulate mORF translation for other mRNAs. Our work demonstrates a regulatory paradigm that controls translational efficiency and a useful strategy to alter protein expression and cellular phenotypes by targeting or generating dsRNA downstream of a uORF or mORF start codon.\n\nBullet points for discoveriesO_LIdsRNA within GATA4 uORF activates uORF translation and inhibits mORF translation.\nC_LIO_LIASOs that target the dsRNA can either inhibit or enhance GATA4 mORF translation.\nC_LIO_LIASOs can be used to impede hypertrophy in human cardiomyocytes and mouse hearts.\nC_LIO_LIuORF- and mORF-targeting ASOs can be used to control translation of multiple mRNAs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "One-carbon metabolism is a complex network of metabolic reactions that are essential for cellular function including DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 and folate are micronutrients that are utilized in this pathway and their deficiency can result in the perturbation of one-carbon metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA replication and repair. This effect has been well characterized in nuclear DNA but to date, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been investigated extensively. Mitochondrial variants have been associated with several inherited and age-related disease states; therefore, the study of factors that impact heteroplasmy are important for advancing our understanding of the mitochondrial genomes impact on human health.\n\nHeteroplasmy studies require robust and efficient mitochondrial DNA enrichment to carry out in-depth mtDNA sequencing. Many of the current methods for mtDNA enrichment can introduce biases and false positive results. Here we use a method that overcomes these limitations and have applied it to assess mitochondrial heteroplasmy in mouse models of altered one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to cause increased levels of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all tissues that were investigated. Folic acid supplementation also contributed to elevated mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all mouse tissues investigated. Heteroplasmy analysis of human data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested a potential sex-specific effect of folate and vitamin B12 status on mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This is a novel relationship that may have broader consequences for our understanding of one-carbon metabolism, mitochondrial related disease and the influence of nutrients on DNA mutation rates.\n\nSignificance StatementUsing a sensitive method for mitochondrial heteroplasmy analysis, we show that both vitamin B12 and folic acid can impact mitochondrial DNA mutation. This effect requires further investigation of the potential impact on humans.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsProgressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a severe rare liver disease which affects between 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 children. In physiological conditions, bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, then it flows to the small intestine to play its role in fat digestion. To prevent tissue damage, bile acids are kept into phospholipid micelles. Mutations in phosphatidyl choline transporter ABCB4 (MDR3) lead to intrahepatic accumulation of free bile acids that results in liver damage. PFIC3 onset occurs usually at early ages, progress rapidly and the prognosis is poor. Currently, besides the palliative use of ursodeoxycholate, the only available treatment for this disease is liver transplantation, which is really challenging for short-aged patients.\n\nMethodsTo gain insight into the pathogenesis of PFIC3 we have performed an integrated proteomics and phosphoproteomics study in human liver samples to then validate the emerging functional hypotheses in a PFIC3 murine model.\n\nResultsWe identified 6,246 protein groups, 324 proteins among them showing differential expression between control and PFIC3. The phosphoproteomic analysis allowed the identification of 5,090 phosphopeptides, from which 215 corresponding to 157 protein groups, were differentially phosphorylated in PFIC3, including MDR3. Regulation of essential cellular processes and structures, such as inflammation, metabolic reprograming, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation were identified as main drivers of the disease.\n\nConclusionOur results provide a strong molecular background that significantly contributes to a better understanding of PFIC3 and provides new concepts that might prove useful in the clinical management of patients.\n\nLay Summary/Key PointsPFIC3 is a rare disease that affect 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 children that present severe symptoms in the first years of life and have scarce therapeutic options. We identified a panel of proteins that recapitulate some of the main cellular processes associated to the progression of liver injury in PFIC3 patients and suggest alternative treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) control local and temporal amounts of diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) by converting DAG to PA through phosphorylation in cells. Certain DGK enzymes possess C-terminal sequences that encode potential PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs), which could be involved in their recruitment into supramolecular signaling complexes. In this study, we used two different interactomic approaches, quantitative native holdup (nHU) and qualitative affinity purification (AP), both coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the PDZ partners associated with the potential PBMs of DGKs. Complementing these results with site-specific affinity interactomic data measured on isolated PDZ domain fragments and PBM motifs, as well as evolutionary conservation analysis of the PBMs of DGKs, we explored functional differences within different DGK groups. All our results indicate that putative PBM sequences of type II enzymes are likely to be nonfunctional. In contrast, type IV enzymes possess highly promiscuous PBMs that interact with a set of PDZ proteins with very similar affinity interactomes. The combination of various interactomic assays and evolutionary analyses provides a useful strategy for identifying functional domains and motifs within diverse enzyme families.",
