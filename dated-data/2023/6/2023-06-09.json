    "abstract": "Plant resistances impose strong selective pressure on plant pathogen populations through the deployment of major resistance genes, which leads to the emergence of new virulences. The pathogen adaptation also involves other life-history or parasitic fitness traits, especially aggressiveness components. A previous study on Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of wheat leaf rust, revealed that the distribution frequency of virulences in the French pathogen population cannot be fully explained by the major resistance genes deployed in the landscape. From 2012 to 2015, two major pathotypes (groups of isolates with the same combinations of virulences) -- 166 317 0 and 106 314 0 -- were equally represented in the landscape, despite the theoretical advantage conferred to 166 317 0 by its virulence to Lr3 frequent in the cultivated landscape, whereas 106 314 0 is avirulent to this gene. To explain this apparent contradiction, we assessed three components of aggressiveness -- infection efficiency, latency period and sporulation capacity -- for 23 isolates representative of the most frequent pathotype-genotype combination (named  pathogenotype) within each pathotype. We tested these isolates on seedlings of Michigan Amber, a  naive wheat cultivar that has never been grown in the landscape, Apache, a neutral  cultivar with no selection effect on the landscape-pathotype pattern, and several cultivars that were frequently grown. We found that pathogenotype 106 314 0-G2 was more aggressive than 166 317 0-G1, with a consistency for the three components of aggressiveness. Our results show that aggressiveness plays a significant role in driving evolution in pathogen populations by acting as a selective advantage, even offsetting the disadvantage of lacking virulence towards a major Lr gene. Higher aggressiveness represents a competitive advantage that is likely even more pronounced when exhibited at the landscape scale as the expression of its multiple components is amplified by the polycyclic nature of epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in tissue processing, labeling, and fluorescence microscopy are providing unprecedented views of the structure of cells and tissues at sub-diffraction resolutions and near single molecule sensitivity, driving discoveries in diverse fields of biology, including neuroscience. Biological tissue is organized over scales of nanometers to centimeters. Harnessing molecular imaging across three-dimensional samples on this scale requires new types of microscopes with larger fields of view and working distance, as well as higher imaging throughput. We present a new expansion-assisted selective plane illumination microscope (ExA-SPIM) with diffraction-limited and aberration-free performance over a large field of view (85 mm2) and working distance (35 mm). Combined with new tissue clearing and expansion methods, the microscope allows nanoscale imaging of centimeter-scale samples, including entire mouse brains, with diffraction-limited resolutions and high contrast without sectioning. We illustrate ExA-SPIM by reconstructing individual neurons across the mouse brain, imaging cortico-spinal neurons in the macaque motor cortex, and tracing axons in human white matter.",

    "abstract": "Problematic alcohol consumption is associated with deficits in decision-making, and alterations in prefrontal cortex neural activity likely contributes. We hypothesized that differences in cognitive control would be evident between male Wistar rats and a model for genetic risk for alcohol use disorder (alcohol-preferring P rats). Cognitive control can be split into proactive and reactive components. Proactive control maintains goal-directed behavior independent of a stimulus whereas reactive control elicits goal-directed behavior at the time of a stimulus. We hypothesized that Wistars would show proactive control over alcohol-seeking whereas P rats would show reactive control over alcohol-seeking. Neural ensembles were recorded from prefrontal cortex during an alcohol seeking task that utilized two session types. On congruent sessions the CS+ was on the same side as alcohol access. Incongruent sessions presented alcohol opposite the CS+. Wistars, but not P rats, exhibited an increase in incorrect approaches during incongruent sessions, suggesting that Wistars utilized the previously learned task-rule. This motivated the hypothesis that ensemble activity reflecting proactive control would be observable in Wistars but not P rats. While P rats showed differences in neural activity at times relevant for alcohol delivery, Wistars showed differences prior to approaching the sipper. These results support our hypothesis that Wistars are more likely to engage proactive cognitive-control strategies whereas P rats are more likely to engage reactive cognitive control strategies. Although P rats were bred to prefer alcohol, differences in cognitive control may reflect a sequela of behaviors that mirror those in humans at risk for an AUD.\n\nSignificance StatementCognitive control refers to the set of executive functions necessary for goal-directed behavior. It is a major mediator of addictive behaviors and can be subdivided into proactive and reactive cognitive control. We observed behavioral and electrophysiological differences between outbred Wistar rats and the selectively bred Indiana alcohol-preferring P rat while they sought and consumed alcohol. These differences are best explained by reactive cognitive control in P rats and proactive in Wistar rats.",

    "abstract": "Small organic molecules like metabolites and drugs are critical for diagnostics, treatment, and synthetic biology. Measuring them presents two key challenges however: they are biochemically highly diverse and there is no method to amplify them. Mass spectrometry has been the workhorse of metabolomics for decades but is costly and slow and single-cell metabolomics remains very challenging. Here we describe an alternative platform for metabolomics based on structure-switching aptamers (SSAs). SSAs are short nucleic acid molecules that each recognise a specific target ligand and undergo a major conformational change on ligand binding. This conformational change can drive detection such as fluorescence allowing SSAs to be used as sensors. We adapted conventional SSAs to a novel readout: barcode release. Each SSA recognises a unique ligand and each SSA releases a unique barcode allowing many ligands to be detected in parallel. We show that these barcode SSAs (bSSAs) can be multiplexed and act as independent sensors and that barcode release can be massively amplified to allow high sensitivity. Finally, we establish methods for the generation of large collections of bSSAs where barcode-SSA matching is completely directed. We believe that this novel platform which converts metabolite detection into barcode sequencing will allow the deep multiplexed detection of metabolites and drugs down to the scale of single cells.",

We found a striking convergence of age- and rejuvenation-related epigenetic alterations on targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).

    "abstract": "Sleep and wake are understood to be slow, long-lasting processes that span the entire brain. Brain states correlate with many neurophysiological changes, yet the most robust and reliable signature of state is enriched in rhythms between 0.1 and 20 Hz. The possibility that the fundamental unit of brain state could be a reliable structure at the scale of milliseconds and microns has not been addressed due to the physical limits associated with oscillation-based definitions. Here, by analyzing high resolution neural activity recorded in 10 anatomically and functionally diverse regions of the murine brain over 24 h, we reveal a mechanistically distinct embedding of state in the brain. Sleep and wake states can be accurately classified from on the order of 100 to 101 ms of neuronal activity sampled from 100 m of brain tissue. In contrast to canonical rhythms, this embedding persists above 1,000 Hz. This high frequency embedding is robust to substates and rapid events such as sharp wave ripples and cortical ON/OFF states. To ascertain whether such fast and local structure is meaningful, we leveraged our observation that individual circuits intermittently switch states independently of the rest of the brain. Brief state discontinuities in subsets of circuits correspond with brief behavioral discontinuities during both sleep and wake. Our results suggest that the fundamental unit of state in the brain is consistent with the spatial and temporal scale of neuronal computation, and that this resolution can contribute to an understanding of cognition and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain often alternates between transient remission and relapse of severe pain. While most research on chronic pain has focused on mechanisms maintaining pain, there is a critical unmet need to understand what prevents pain from re-emerging in those who recover from acute pain. We found that interleukin (IL)-10, a pain resolving cytokine, is persistently produced by resident macrophages in the spinal meninges during remission from pain. IL-10 upregulated expression and analgesic activity of {delta}-opioid receptor ({delta}OR) in the dorsal root ganglion. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of IL-10 signaling or {delta}OR triggered relapse to pain in both sexes. These data challenge the widespread assumption that remission of pain is simply a return to the naive state before pain was induced. Instead, our findings strongly suggest a novel concept that: remission is a state of lasting pain vulnerability that results from a long-lasting neuroimmune interactions in the nociceptive system.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variability has been widely observed across organisms and traits, including in humans. Both gene-gene and gene-environment interactions can lead to an increase in phenotypic variability. Therefore, detecting the underlying genetic variants, or variance Quantitative Trait Loci (vQTLs), can provide novel insights into complex traits. Established approaches to detect vQTLs apply different methodologies from variance-only approaches to mean-variance joint tests, but a comprehensive comparison of these methods is lacking. Here, we review available methods to detect vQTLs in humans, carry out a simulation study to assess their performance under different biological scenarios of gene-environment interactions, and apply the optimal approaches for vQTL identification to gene expression data. We find that the squared residual value linear model (SVLM) method is optimal when the interacting exposure is discrete, and both SVLM and the deviation regression model (DRM) perform well when the interacting exposure is continuous. Additionally, a larger sample size, smaller minor allele frequency, and more balanced sample distribution in different exposure categories increase power of SVLM and DRM. Our results highlight vQTL detection methods that perform optimally under realistic simulation settings and show that their relative performance depends on the type of exposure in the interaction model underlying the vQTL.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic background can influence organismal response to changes in the environment, including through effects of gene-environment (GxE) interactions. GxE interactions form a fundamental component of complex phenotypes and disease. The presence of GxE interactions leads to increases in phenotypic variability, where individuals of a certain genotype can display more divergent phenotypes. Therefore, identifying genetic variation that can alter phenotypic variance is an alternative approach to identifying genetic variants that underlie GxE effects. Here, we conduct a systematic assessment of methods that detect genetic variants linked to phenotypic variance under several GxE scenarios. We identify the most optimal approaches for different environmental exposure settings and apply these to validate previously detected GxE signals. We also estimate power of these methods to detect GxE effects. Our results help guide experimental design for future studies aiming to identify genetic variant impacts on phenotypic variance, and their result interpretation in context of gene-environment interactions in complex traits.",

Hantaviridae contain a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that replicates and transcribes the viral genome in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Here we establish the expression and purification of the polymerase from the Old World Hantaan orthohantavirus and characterise the structure using single particle cryo electron microscopy. We determine a series of structures at resolutions between 2.7 and 3.3 [A] of RNA free polymerase comprising the core, core and endonuclease, and a full-length polymerase. The full-length polymerase structure depicts the location of the cap binding and C-terminal domains which are arranged in a conformation that is incompatible with transcription and in a novel conformation not observed in previous conformations of cap-snatching viral polymerase. We further describe structures with 5' vRNA promoter in the presence and absence of a nucleotide triphosphate. The nucleotide bound structure mimics a replication pre-initiation complex and the nucleotide stabilises the motif E in a conformation distinct from those previously observed. We observe motif E in four distinct conformations including {beta}-sheet, two helical arrangements, and an ordered loop.

    "abstract": "Gene transcription is a fundamental cellular process carried out by RNA polymerase (RNAP). Transcription initiation is highly regulated and in bacteria, transcription initiation is mediated by {sigma} factors, which recruit RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the promoter DNA region and facilitate open complex formation, where double stranded DNA is opening up into a transcription bubble and template strand DNA is in position for initial RNA synthesis. During initial transcription, DNA downstream of the transcription start site is fed into the active site of RNAP, whilst the upstream promoter DNA remains tethered to the RNAP via the {sigma} factor, resulting in a build-up of tension. In order to progress to the processive elongation state, RNAP must escape from the promoter, and displace or dissociate the {sigma} factor. Bacteria s factors can be broadly separated into two classes with the majority belong to the s70 class, represented by the {sigma}70 that regulate housekeeping genes. {sigma}54 forms a class on its own and regulate stress response genes. Extensive studies on {sigma}70 have revealed the molecular mechanisms of {sigma}70 promoter escape while how {sigma}54 transitions from initial transcription to elongation is unknown. Here we present a series of cryo electron microscopy structures of the {sigma}54 factor with progressively longer RNA, revealing the molecular mechanism of {sigma}54 displacement and promoter escape. Our data show that the initial instability is driven by DNA scrunching, and the final displacement steps are driven by both RNA extension and DNA scrunching.",

    "abstract": "Interaction between brain networks forms the functional unit that sustains cognition and behavior. It has been proposed that oscillatory activity can synchronize distant neuronal populations. One crucial aspect to elucidate brain function and its emergent properties is to understand how functional connectivity is modulated in different time scales according to environmental or physiological demand. Modulatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine have been implicated in changes in membrane excitability, modulation of oscillatory power, and coherence in crucial circuits for cognition, such as the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) pathway. However, it is not known how dopaminergic release modulates specifically the phase synchrony of HPC-PFC or which specific dopaminergic receptors are responsible for the effects. In this context, our objective was to investigate the influence of dopaminergic activity on HPC-PFC synchrony and to assess whether the observed effects are receptor-specific. Our results show that dopamine induces HPC-PFC theta synchrony dose-dependently. This effect is not reproduced by apomorphine unspecific agonism or by SKF and quinpirole agonists, which act respectively on D1- and D2-like receptors. Additionally, we observed a late effect with peak activity between 30 and 40 minutes after dopamine 100 nmol, apomorphine 0.75 mg/kg, or quinpirole administration in which the HPC-PFC delta synchrony increased. Together, these results evidence the participation of dopaminergic neurotransmission in regulating HPC-PFC oscillatory dynamics, Influencing the synchronization in slow frequency oscillation and long-distant brain communication.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the neural mechanisms of awareness is a fundamental task of cognitive neuroscience. There is an ongoing dispute regarding the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the emergence of awareness, which is partially raised by the confound between report-and awareness-related activity. To address this problem, we designed a visual awareness task that can minimize report-related confounding. Our results show that saccadic latency is significantly shorter in the aware trials than in the unaware trials. Local field potential (LFP) data from 6 patients consistently show early (200-300 ms) awareness-related activity in the PFC, including event-related potential and high-gamma activity. Moreover, the awareness state can be reliably decoded by the neural activity in the PFC since the early stage, and the neural pattern is dynamically changed rather than being stable during the representation of awareness. Furthermore, the enhancement of dynamic functional connectivity, through the phase modulation at low frequency, between the PFC and other brain regions in the early stage of the awareness trials may explain the mechanism of conscious access. And the spatiotemporal overlap between the awareness-related activity and the inter-regional connectivity in PFC suggested that conscious access and phenomenal awareness may be closely coupled. These results indicate that the PFC is critically involved in the emergence of awareness.",

The record of these interactions is recovered by next generation sequencing. Compared to other genomic assays, whose readout provides a snapshot at the time of harvest, Calling Cards enables correlation of historical molecular states to eventual outcomes or phenotypes. To achieve this, Calling Cards uses the piggyBac transposase to insert self-reporting transposon (SRT) \"Calling Cards\" into the genome, leaving permanent marks at interaction sites. Calling Cards can be deployed in a variety of in vitro and in vivo biological systems to study gene regulatory networks involved in development, aging, and disease. Out of the box, it assesses enhancer usage but can be adapted to profile specific transcription factor binding with custom transcription factor (TF)-piggyBac fusion proteins. The Calling Cards workflow has five main stages: delivery of Calling Card reagents, sample preparation, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis. Here, we first present a comprehensive guide for experimental design, reagent selection, and optional customization of the platform to study additional TFs. Then, we provide an updated protocol for the five steps, using reagents that improve throughput and decrease costs, including an overview of a newly deployed computational pipeline. This protocol is designed for users with basic molecular biology experience to process samples into sequencing libraries in 1-2 days. Familiarity with bioinformatic analysis and command line tools is required to set up the pipeline in a high-performance computing environment and to conduct downstream analyses.\n\nBasic Protocol 1: Preparation and delivery of Calling Cards reagents\nBasic Protocol 2: Sample preparation\nBasic Protocol 3: Sequencing library preparation\nBasic Protocol 4: Library pooling and sequencing\nBasic Protocol 5: Data analysis",

    "abstract": "Cultural exchange of fermentation techniques has driven the spread of Saccharomyces cerevisiae across the globe, establishing wild populations in many countries. Despite this, most modern commercial fermentations are inoculated using monocultures, rather than relying on natural populations, potentially impacting wild population diversity. Here we investigate the genomic landscape of 411 wild S. cerevisiae isolated from spontaneous grape fermentations in Australia across multiple locations, years, and grape cultivars. Spontaneous fermentations contained highly recombined mosaic strains that commonly exhibited aneuploidy of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 9. Assigning wild genomic windows to putative ancestral origin revealed that few closely related commercial lineages have come to dominate the genetic landscape, contributing most of the genetic variation. Fine-scale phylogenetic analysis of loci not observed in strains of commercial wine origin identified widespread admixture with the Beer2 clade along with three independent admixture events from potentially endemic Oceanic lineages that last shared an ancestor with modern East Asian S. cerevisiae populations. Our results illustrate how commercial use of microbes can affect local microorganism genetic diversity and demonstrates the presence of non-domesticated, non-European derived lineages of S. cerevisiae in Australian ecological niches that are actively admixing.",

However, the dose of ionizing radiation (IR) that the cells would receive during image acquisition is of concern as this is likely to affect essential cellular functions. The effect of IR on motility at the dose rates encountered in a synchrotron has never been assessed. Here, results are presented of analyzing the movement and viability of sperm cells exposed at varying durations at the TOMCAT beamline (Swiss Light Source (SLS)) which has the field of view and spatial resolution needed to reconstruct sperm cells coupled with sub-second exposure times.

    "abstract": "Addiction is characterized by continued drug use despite negative consequences. In an animal model, a subset of rats continues to self-administer cocaine despite footshock consequences, showing punishment resistance. We sought to test the hypothesis that punishment resistance arises from failure to exert goal-directed control over habitual cocaine seeking. While habits are not inherently permanent or maladaptive, continued use of habits under conditions that should encourage goal-directed control makes them maladaptive and inflexible. We trained male and female Sprague Dawley rats on a seeking-taking chained schedule of cocaine self-administration (2 h/day). We then exposed them to 4 days of punishment testing, in which footshock (0.4 mA, 0.3 s) was delivered randomly on one-third of trials, immediately following completion of seeking and prior to extension of the taking lever. Before and after punishment testing (4 days pre-punishment and [&ge;]4 days post-punishment), we assessed whether cocaine seeking was goal-directed or habitual using outcome devaluation via cocaine satiety. We found that punishment resistance was associated with continued use of habits, whereas punishment sensitivity was associated with increased goal-directed control. Although punishment resistance was not predicted by habitual responding pre-punishment, it was associated with habitual responding post-punishment. In parallel studies of food self-administration, we similarly observed that punishment resistance was associated with habitual responding post-punishment but not pre-punishment. These findings indicate that punishment resistance is related to habits that have become inflexible and persist under conditions that should encourage a transition to goal-directed behavior.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of comparative studies, fundamental questions remain about how brain and body size co-evolved. Divergent explanations exist concurrently in the literature for phenomena such as variation in brain relative to body size, variability in the scaling relationship across taxonomic levels and between taxonomic groups, and purported evolutionary trends. Here we resolve these issues using a comprehensive dataset of brain and body masses across the mammal radiation, and a method enabling us to study brain relative to body mass evolution while estimating their evolutionary rates along the branches of a phylogeny. Contrary to the rarely questioned assumption of a log-linear relationship, we find that a curvilinear model best describes the evolutionary relationship between log brain mass and log body mass. This model greatly simplifies our understanding of mammalian brain-body co-evolution: it can simultaneously explain both the much-discussed taxon-level effect and variation in slopes and intercepts previously attributed to complex scaling patterns. We also document substantial variation in rates of relative brain mass evolution, with bursts of change scattered through the tree. General trends for increasing relative brain size over time are found in only three mammalian orders, with the most extreme case being primates, setting the stage for the uniquely rapid directional increase that ultimately produced the computational powers of the human brain.",

Spatial image correlation spectroscopy showed that the size of blue-light-induced condensates of cryptochrome 2-derived oligomerization tag (CRY2olig) tagged with a red fluorescent protein in the nucleus was not different from that in the cytoplasm. Fluorescence intensity measurements showed that the condensates in the nucleus were more prone to accumulation than those in the cytoplasm.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the complex coordination of pro-inflammatory signaling and reactive microglia/macrophage on the formation Muller glial-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the retinas of fish, birds and mice. We generated scRNA-seq libraries to identify transcriptional changes in Muller glia (MG) that result from the depletion of microglia from the chick retina. We found significant changes in different networks of genes in MG in normal and damaged retinas when the microglia are ablated. We identified a failure of MG to upregulate Wnt-ligands, Heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), retinoic acid receptors and genes related to Notch-signaling. Inhibition of GSK3{beta}, to simulate Wnt-signaling, failed to rescue the deficit in formation of proliferating MGPCs in damaged retinas missing microglia. By comparison, application of HBEGF or FGF2 completely rescued the formation of proliferating MGPCs in microglia-depleted retinas. Similarly, injection of a small molecule inhibitor to Smad3 or agonist to retinoic acid receptors partially rescued the formation of proliferating MGPCs in microglia-depleted damaged retinas. According to scRNA-seq libraries, patterns of expression of ligands, receptors, signal transducers and/or processing enzymes to cell-signaling via HBEGF, FGF, retinoic acid and TGF{beta} are rapidly and transiently upregulated by MG after neuronal damage, consistent with important roles for these cell-signaling pathways in regulating the formation of MGPCs. We conclude that quiescent and activated microglia have a significant impact upon the transcriptomic profile of MG. We conclude that signals produced by reactive microglia in damaged retinas stimulate MG to upregulate cell signaling through HBEGF, FGF and retinoic acid, and downregulate signaling through TGF{beta}/Smad3 to promote the reprogramming on MG into proliferating MGPCs.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenge, particularly in patients who do not respond to traditional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of fedratinib, a semi selective JAK2 inhibitor and venetoclax, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, on human B-ALL using both single-agent and combinatorial treatments. The combination treatment of fedratinib and venetoclax improved killing of the human B-ALL cell lines RS4;11 and SUPB-15 in vitro over single-agent treatments. This combinatorial effect was not detected in the human B-ALL cell line NALM-6, which was less responsive to fedratinib due to the absence of Flt3 expression. The combination treatment induces a unique gene expression profile relative to single-agent treatment and with an enrichment in apoptotic pathways. Finally, the combination treatment was superior to single agent treatment in an in vivo xenograft model of human B-ALL with a two-week treatment regimen significantly improving overall survival. Overall, our data demonstrates the efficacy of a combinatorial treatment strategy of fedratinib and venetoclax against human B-ALL expressing high levels of Flt3.\n\nKey pointsO_LICombination fedratinib and venetoclax reduces the survival and proliferation of FLT3+ B-ALL in vitro.\nC_LIO_LIGene set enrichment analysis of RNA from B-ALL treated with fedratinib and venetoclax identified dysregulation of pathways associated with apoptosis, DNA repair and proliferation.\nC_LIO_LICombination fedratinib and venetoclax reduces the number of peripheral blood B-ALL blasts in vivo, improving overall survival while also increasing CD19 expression.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are a debilitating and persistent threat to the global elderly population carrying grim outcomes. Their genesis is often multifactorial, with a history of early exposure to xenobiotics like pesticides or diagnostic exposure to ionizing radiation. A holistic molecular insight into their mechanistic induction is still unclear upon single or combinatorial exposure to different toxicants. In the present study, one-month-old C57/BL-6J male mice were treated orally with malathion (MAL) (50mg/kg body wt. for 14 days) and/or a single whole-body radiation (IR) (0.5 Gy) on the 8th day. Post-treatment, behavioral assays were conducted to assess exploratory behavior, memory, and learning. Following sacrifice, brains were collected for histology, biochemical assays, and transcriptomic analysis. Differential expression analysis, Gene ontology, and pathway enrichment revealed several common and uniquely altered genes, biological processes, and pathways related to neurodegeneration, synaptic transmission and plasticity, neuronal survival, proliferation, and regulation of neuronal death. Increased astrogliosis was observed in the IR and co-exposure groups, with significant neuronal cell death and reduction in the expression of NeuN in all three groups. Sholl analysis and dendritic arborization/ spine density study revealed decreased total apical neuronal path length and dendritic spine density in all three groups. Decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes GST and GSH and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity were also detected. However, there were no changes in exploratory behavior or learning and memory. Thus, explicating the molecular mechanisms behind MAL and IR can provide novel insights into the genesis of environmental factor-driven neurodegenerative pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "1.Breast cancer incidence in men is statistically rare; however, given the lack of screening in males, more advanced stages at initial diagnosis results in lower 5-year survival rates for men with breast cancer compared to women. A sexual dimorphism, with respect to the effect of tumor growth on cachexia incidence and severity, has also been reported across cancer types. The purpose of this study was to examine the sexual dimorphism of breast cancer as it pertains to skeletal muscle function and molecular composition. Using female and male transgenic PyMT mice, we tested the hypothesis that isometric contractile properties and molecular composition of skeletal muscle would be differentially affected by breast tumors. PyMT tumor-bearing mice of each sex, corresponding to maximal tumor burden, were compared to their respective controls. RNA-sequencing of skeletal muscle revealed different pathway alterations that were exclusive to each sex. Further, differentially expressed genes and pathways were substantially more abundant in female tumor mice, with only minimal dysregulation in male tumor mice, each compared to their respective controls. These differences in the transcriptome were mirrored in isometric contractile properties, with greater tumor-induced dysfunction in females than male mice, as well as muscle wasting. Collectively, these data support the concept of sexually dimorphic responses to cancer in skeletal muscle and suggest these responses may be associated with the clinical differences in breast cancer between the sexes. The identified sex-dependent pathways within muscle of male and female mice provide a framework to evaluate therapeutic strategies targeting tumor-associated skeletal muscle alterations.\n\nStatement of significanceThe PyMT mouse model of breast cancer, which recapitulates clinical characteristics, exhibits differences in molecular and functional responses of skeletal muscle that are sex-dependent.",

Yet, this relationship remains unexplored in the lateral parietal cortex (LPC) and the lateral parieto-occipital junction (LPOJ). After defining thousands of sulci in a young adult cohort, we uncovered four previously unidentified small and shallow LPC/LOPJ sulci--one of which (ventral supralateral occipital sulcus, slocs-v) is present in nearly every hemisphere, and is morphologically, architecturally, and functionally dissociable from neighboring regions. A data-driven, model-based approach relating sulcal depth to behavior revealed that the morphology of only a subset of LPC/LPOJ sulci, including the slocs-v, is related to performance on a spatial orientation, but not a relational reasoning task.

    "abstract": "BackgroundA strong relationship exists between individual sensitivity to the aversive properties of ethanol and risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Despite this, our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying subjective response to ethanol is relatively poor. A major contributor to this is the absence of preclinical models that enable exploration of this individual variability similar to studies performed in humans.\n\nMethodsAdult male and female Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a novel tastant (saccharin) with acute exposure to either saline or ethanol (1.5 g/kg or 2.0 g/kg i.p.) over three conditioning days using a standard conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure. Variability in sensitivity to ethanol-induced CTA was phenotypically characterized using a median split across the populations studied.\n\nResultsWhen examining group averages, both male and female rats that had saccharin paired with either dose of ethanol exhibited reduced saccharin intake relative to saline controls of ethanol-induced CTA. Examination of individual data revealed a bimodal distribution of responses uncovering two distinct phenotypes present in both sexes. CTA-sensitive rats exhibited a rapid and progressive reduction in saccharin intake with each successive ethanol pairing. In contrast, saccharin intake was unchanged or maintained after an initial decrease from baseline levels in CTA-resistant rats. While CTA magnitude was similar between male and female CTA-sensitive rats, CTA-resistant females were more resistant to the development of ethanol-induced CTA than their male counterparts. Phenotypic differences were not driven by differences in baseline saccharin intake. CTA sensitivity correlated with behavioral signs of intoxication in only a subset of rats.\n\nConclusionsThese data parallel work in humans by revealing individual differences in sensitivity to the aversive properties of ethanol that emerge immediately after initial exposure to ethanol in both sexes. This model can be leveraged in future studies to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that confer risk for AUD.",

Stromal cell subtypes, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, establish a complex network of paracrine signaling pathways with tumor-infiltrating immune cells that drive effector cell tumor immune exclusion and inhibit the antitumor immune response. Single-cell transcriptomics of the HGSOC TME from public and in-house datasets revealed a distinct transcriptomic landscape for immune and non-immune cells in high-stromal vs. low-stromal tumors. High-stromal tumors had a lower fraction of certain T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages and increased expression of CXCL12 in epithelial cancer cells and cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs). Analysis of cell-cell communication indicated that epithelial cancer cells and CA-MSCs secreted CXCL12 that interacted with the CXCR4 receptor, which was overexpressed on NK and CD8+ T cells. CXCL12 and/or CXCR4 antibodies confirmed the immunosuppressive role of CXCL12-CXCR4 in high-stromal tumors.",

    "abstract": "The slightest touch to the skin initiates tactile perception that is almost immediate1. The extraordinary speed of touch perception is enabled by mechanically-activated ion channels, the opening of which excites the endings of sensory neurons innervating the skin to initiate sensation. Here we identify a new mechanically-activated ion channel, Elkin12, that, when ablated in mice, leads to a profound behavioural touch insensitivity. Touch insensitivity in Elkin1-/- mice was caused by a loss of mechanically-activated currents (MA-currents) in around half of all sensory neurons that are activated by light touch (low threshold mechanoreceptors, LTMRs). Reintroduction of Elkin1 into sensory neurons from Elkin1-/- mice acutely restored MA-currents. Piezo23-6 is an established mechanosensitive ion channel required for touch sensation. In mice genetic ablation of Piezo2 renders many, but not all, LTMRs insensitive to mechanical force4,5,7. Here we show that Elkin1 underpins PIEZO2-independent touch sensation. Additionally, we find that Elkin1 is present in many nociceptive sensory neurons which detect potentially damaging and painful mechanical force. These nociceptors depend on Elkin1 for effectively communicating information on sustained noxious mechanical forces. We further identified molecular and functional interactions between the known mechanotransduction protein Stoml38,9 and Elkin1 ion channels. Our data identify Elkin1 as a novel core component of touch transduction in mammals. The specific sensory deficits exhibited by Elkin1-/- mice make Elkin1 a highly desirable target that could be harnessed to treat somatic sensory disorders including pain.",

In the present studies, we evaluated the role of CK loss in active inflammation using the DSS colitis model. Mice lacking expression of CKB/CKMit (CKdKO) showed increased susceptibility to DSS colitis (weight loss, disease activity, permeability, colon length and histology). In a broad cytokine profiling, CKdKO mice expressed near absent IFN-{gamma} levels. We identified losses in IFN-{gamma} production from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from CKdKO mice. Addback of IFN-{gamma} during DSS treatment resulted in partial protection for CKdKO mice. We identified basal stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in CKdKO splenocytes and pharmacological stabilization of HIF resulted in reduced IFN-{gamma} production by control splenocytes. Thus, the loss of IFN-{gamma} production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in CKdKO mice resulted in increased colitis susceptibility and indicates that CK is protective in active mucosal inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Viral pneumonia is a global health burden with a high mortality rate, especially in the elderly and in patients with underlying diseases. Recent studies have found that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are abundant in these patient groups; however, their roles in the progression of viral pneumonia remain unclear. In this study, we observed a substantial increase in MDSCs in a mouse model of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and in older mice. When intranasal polyinosinic- polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) administration was used to mimic viral pneumonia, we found that mice with renal I/R injury exhibited more severe lung inflammation than sham mice when challenged with poly(I:C). In addition, MDSC depletion attenuated lung inflammation in mice with I/R injury. Similar results were obtained in older mice compared with those in young mice. Furthermore, we found that the adoptive transfer of in vitro-differentiated MDSCs exacerbated poly(I:C)-induced lung inflammation. Taken together, these experimental results suggest that the increased proportion of MDSCs in mice with renal I/R injury and in older mice exacerbates poly(I:C)-induced lung inflammation. These findings have important implications for the treatment and prevention of severe lung inflammation caused by viral pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Ascariasis (roundworm) is the most common parasitic helminth infection globally and can lead to significant morbidity in children including chronic lung disease. Children become infected with Ascaris spp. via oral ingestion of eggs. It has long been assumed that Ascaris egg hatching and larval translocation across the gastrointestinal mucosa to initiate infection occurs in the small intestine. Here, we show that A. suum larvae hatched in the host stomach in a murine model. Larvae utilize acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase; acid chitinase; Chia) from chief cells and acid pumped by parietal cells to emerge from eggs on the surface of gastric epithelium. Furthermore, antagonizing AMCase and gastric acid in the stomach decreases parasitic burden in the liver and lungs and attenuates lung disease. Given Ascaris eggs are chitin-coated, the gastric corpus would logically be the most likely organ for egg hatching, though this is the first study directly evincing the essential role of the host gastric corpus microenvironment. These findings point towards potential novel mechanisms for therapeutic targets to prevent ascariasis and identify a new biomedical significance of AMCase in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial species naturally take up DNA from their surroundings and recombine it into their chromosome through homologous gene transfer (HGT) to aid in survival and gain advantageous functions. Herein we present the first characterization of Type 4 pili mediated natural competence in Fusobacterium nucleatum, which are Gram-negative, anaerobic bacteria that participate in a range of infections and diseases including periodontitis, preterm birth, and cancer. We bioinformatically identified components of the Type 4 conjugal pilus machinery and show this is a conserved system within the Fusobacterium genus. We next validate Type 4 pili in natural competence in F. nucleatum strain 23726 and show that gene deletions in key components of pilus deployment (pilQ) and cytoplasmic DNA import (comEC) abolish DNA uptake and chromosomal incorporation. We next show that natural competence may require native F. nucleatum DNA methylation to bypass restriction modification systems and allow subsequent genomic homologous recombination. In summary, this proof of principle study provides the first characterization of natural competence in Fusobacterium nucleatum and highlights the potential to exploit this DNA import mechanism as a genetic tool to characterize virulence mechanisms of an opportunistic oral pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Plant genotype is recognized to contribute to variations in microbial community structure in the rhizosphere, soil adherent to roots. However, the extent to which the viral community varies has remained poorly understood and has the potential to contribute to variation in soil microbial communities. Here we cultivated replicates of two different genotypes of Zea mays parviglumis and Z. mays genotype B73 in a greenhouse and harvested the rhizobiome (rhizoplane and rhizosphere) to identify the abundance of cells and viruses as well as apply 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and genome resolved metagenomics to identify the rhizobiome microbial and viral community. Our results demonstrate that viruses exceeded microbial abundance in the rhizobiome of parviglumis and B73 with a significant variation in both, the microbial and viral community between the two genotypes. Of the viral contigs identified only 4.5% (n =7) of total viral contigs were shared between the two genotypes, demonstrating that plants even at the level of genotype can significantly alter the surrounding soil viral community. An auxiliary metabolic gene associated with glycoside hydrolase (GH5) degradation was identified in one viral metagenome-assembled genome (vMAG) identified in the B73 rhizobiome infecting Propionibacteriaceae (Actinobacteriota) further demonstrating the viral contribution in metabolic potential for carbohydrate degradation and carbon cycling in the rhizosphere. This variation demonstrates the potential of plant genotype to contribute to microbial and viral heterogeneity in soil systems and harbor genes capable of contributing to carbon cycling in the rhizosphere.",

    "abstract": "Membranes are a universal barrier to all cells. Phospholipids, essential bacterial membrane components, are composed of a polar head and apolar fatty acid (FA) chains. Most bacterial FA are synthesized by the FA synthesis pathway (FASII). In streptococcaceae, enterococci and Lactococcus lactis, a unique feedback mechanism controls the FASII gene expression. FabT, encoded in the FASII main locus, is the repressor and it is activated by acyl-ACP. Many Streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, but not L. lactis, possess two ACPS. AcpA encoding gene is within the FASII locus and is, to a certain extent, coregulated with the FASII genes. Acyl-AcpA is the end product of FASII. AcpB encoding gene is in operon with plsX. The role of AcpB as FabT corepressor is controversial. Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes a wide variety of diseases ranging from mild non-invasive to severe invasive infections, possesses AcpB. In this study, we show by comparing gene repression of FASII genes in wild-type, fabT mutant and acpB mutant strains grown in the presence and the absence of exogenous FAs, that AcpB is S. pyogenes FabT main co-repressor. Also, acpB deletion impacts the membrane FA composition and adhesion to eucaryotic cells, highlighting the role of AcpB.",

    "abstract": "The composition and seasonal patterns of airborne bacterial and fungal communities and how these are affected by atmospheric conditions (e.g., dry vs. rain), origin of air masses, and presence of air pollutants remain understudied, despite their obvious importance for public health. To provide insights into these questions, monthly dry air and rain samples were collected at the Environmental Science and Technology building rooftop on Georgia Techs campus (Metro Atlanta) between June 2017 and November 2019. The sampling included the remnants of Hurricane Irma and a Saharan dust event in 2020. Amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region showed that spore-forming bacteria and widespread fungi were enriched in dry samples, while photosynthetic bacteria and wood-decaying fungi were more abundant in rain samples, demonstrating the effect of sample type on bioaerosol composition. Further, higher relative abundance of fungal human pathogens and allergens were identified in the dry-air and Saharan dust samples, including Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium cladosporioides. Bacterial and fungal species richness and composition appeared to be relatively consistent between seasons for both sample types. Accordingly, sample type and seasonality explained [~]14% and [~]8.5% of the microbial diversity between samples, respectively, while presence of air pollutants and three-day back trajectory data were not significant. Collectively, our data indicates that dry air might represent a higher public health risk and provides a reference point for the long-term monitoring of airborne microbial communities in an urban Southeast US setting.\n\nImportanceIn the atmosphere, or in the air we breathe, bioaerosols are always present. Bioaerosols are biological particles (alive or dead) suspended in the air, being bacteria and fungi the most abundant. In addition, bioaerosols can potentially contribute to weather/climate patterns. Although and unfortunately, a clear biodiversity pattern from different atmospheric events (air, rain, snow, etc.) remains to be discovered, especially in urban areas, where bioaerosols can also have implications for public health. The role of airborne microbes and their diversity patterns in the atmosphere constitutes a significant gap in our understanding of their interactions with health, climate, and other ecosystems compared to other environments. Our research provides the first reference point for long-term monitoring of airborne microbial communities in an urban Southeast US setting. This research contributes novel knowledge about public health and insights for integrating biological information into weather and climate prediction models.",

    "abstract": "Marine macroalgae produce abundant and diverse polysaccharides which contribute substantially to the organic matter exported to the deep ocean. Microbial degradation of these polysaccharides plays an important role in the turnover of macroalgal biomass. Various members of the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydia (PVC) superphylum are degraders of recalcitrant polysaccharides in widespread anoxic environments. In this study, we isolated a novel anaerobic bacterial strain NLcol2T from microbial mats on the surface of marine sediments offshore Santa Barbara, California, USA. Based on 16S rRNA gene and phylogenomic analyses, strain NLcol2T represents a novel species within the Pontiella genus in the Kiritimaitellaeota phylum (within the PVC superphylum). Strain NLcol2T is able to utilize various monosaccharides, disaccharides, and macroalgal polysaccharides such as agar and iota-carrageenan. A near-complete genome also revealed an extensive metabolic capacity for anaerobic degradation of sulfated polysaccharides, as evidenced by 202 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and 165 sulfatases. Additionally, its ability of nitrogen fixation was confirmed by nitrogenase activity detected during growth on nitrogen-free medium, and the presence of nitrogenases (nifDKH) encoded in the genome. Based on the physiological and genomic analyses, this strain represents a group of bacteria that may play an important role in the degradation of macroalgal polysaccharides and with relevance to the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen in marine environments. Strain NLcol2T (= DSM 113125T = MCCC 1K08672) is proposed to be the type strain of a novel species in Pontiella genus, and the name Pontiella agarivorans sp. nov. is proposed.",

    "abstract": "The frequent exchange of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) between bacteria accelerates the spread of functional traits, including antimicrobial resistance, within the human microbiome. Yet, progress in understanding these intricate processes has been hindered by the lack of tools to map the spatial spread of MGEs in complex microbial communities, and to associate MGEs to their bacterial hosts. To overcome this challenge, we present an imaging approach that pairs single molecule DNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with multiplexed ribosomal RNA FISH, thereby enabling the simultaneous visualization of both MGEs and host bacterial taxa. We used this methodology to spatially map bacteriophage and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) plasmids in human oral biofilms, and we studied the heterogeneity in their spatial distributions and demonstrated the ability to identify their host taxa. Our data revealed distinct clusters of both AMR plasmids and prophage, coinciding with densely packed regions of host bacteria in the biofilm. These results suggest the existence of specialized niches that maintain MGEs within the community, possibly acting as local hotspots for horizontal gene transfer. The methods introduced here can help advance the study of MGE ecology and address pressing questions regarding antimicrobial resistance and phage therapy.",

    "abstract": "Probiotic bacteria confer multiple health benefits, including preventing the growth, colonisation, or carriage of harmful bacteria in the gut. Bacteriocins are antibacterial peptides produced by diverse bacteria and their production is tightly regulated and coordinated at the transcriptional level. A popular strategy for enhancing the antibacterial properties of probiotic bacteria is to retrofit them with the ability to overproduce heterologous bacteriocins. This is often achieved from non-native constitutive promoters or in response to host or pathogen signal from synthetic promoters. How the dysregulated overproduction of heterologous bacteriocins affects the fitness and antibacterial efficacy of the retrofitted probiotic bacteria is often overlooked. We have conferred the prototypical probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle (EcN) the ability to produce McC from the wild-type promoter and two mutant promoters that allow, relative to the wild-type promoter, high and low amounts of McC production. This was done by introducing specific changes to the sequence of the wild-type promoter driving transcription of the McC operon, whilst ensuring that the modified promoters respond to native regulation. By studying the transcriptomic responses and antibacterial efficacy of the retrofitted EcN bacteria in a Galleria mellonella infection model of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, we show that EcN bacteria that produce the lowest amount of McC display the highest antibacterial efficacy with little to none undesired collateral impact on their fitness. The results highlight considerations researchers may take into account when retrofitting probiotic bacteria with heterogenous gene products for therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic applications.\n\nIMPORTRANCEBacteria that resist killing by antibiotics are a major risk to modern medicine. The use of beneficial  probiotic bacteria as chassis to make antibiotic-like compounds at the site of infection in the body is emerging as a popular alternative to the use of conventional antibiotics. A potential drawback of engineering probiotic bacteria in this way is that producing antibiotic-like compounds could impart undesired side-effects on the performance of such bacteria and thereby compromise their intended use. This study highlights considerations researchers may take into account when engineering probiotic bacteria for therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic applications.",

    "abstract": "To cause infection, pathogens must overcome bottlenecks imposed by the host immune system. These bottlenecks restrict the inoculum and largely determine whether pathogen exposure results in disease. Infection bottlenecks therefore quantify the effectiveness of immune barriers. Here, using a model of Escherichia coli systemic infection, we identify bottlenecks that tighten or widen with higher inoculum sizes, revealing that the efficacy of innate immune responses can increase or decrease with pathogen dose. We term this concept \"dose scaling\". During E. coli systemic infection, dose scaling is tissue specific, dependent on the LPS receptor TLR4, and can be recapitulated by mimicking high doses with killed bacteria. Scaling is therefore due to sensing of pathogen molecules rather than interactions between the host and live bacteria. We propose that dose scaling quantitatively links innate immunity with infection bottlenecks and is a valuable framework for understanding how the inoculum size governs the outcome of pathogen exposure.",

To that end, our lab identified 2,3 cyclic-nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNP) as a late-stage inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication. We show that CNP inhibits the generation of new SARS-CoV-2 virions, reducing intracellular titers by over 10-fold without inhibiting viral structural protein translation. Additionally, we show that targeting of CNP to mitochondria is necessary for inhibition, implicating CNPs proposed role as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeabilization transition pore as the mechanism of virion assembly inhibition. We also demonstrate that adenovirus transduction of a dually over-expressing virus expressing human ACE2, in cis with either CNP or eGFP inhibits SARS-CoV-2 titers to undetectable levels in lungs of mice.

    "abstract": "One prerequisite for generating recombinant antibodies for therapeutic and non-therapeutic purposes from hybridoma clones is the reliable, efficient, and cost-effective sequencing of the hybridoma clone that produces the desired antibody. However, many hybridoma fusion partners produce aberrant endogenous mRNA transcripts most of which resemble kappa chains. These aberrant kappa chain mRNAs can interfere with or even prevent the determination of the functional murine antibody kappa chain cDNA sequences during the PCR amplification step. In this paper, we report the development of a rapid and cost-effective CRISPR/Cas9 based method to eliminate the aberrant endogenous sequence. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by significantly reducing the number of an endogenous aberrant kappa chain transcript known as the aberrant SP2/0 kappa chain. This transcript is produced by the commonly used fusion partner known as SP2/0 which is a myeloma-derived cell line. Here, we first cloned and sequenced two hybridoma clones using this method (clones A1E7 and A9E11). Our results showed a 24 to 25 percent reduction of the aberrant chain sequences (method 1) from the sequencing results. We then optimized this method (method 2) and used it to clone and sequence a third hybridoma clone (clone 262). This optimized method allowed us to achieve an 88% reduction of the aberrant kappa chain sequences.",

As the global bioeconomy expands, biofoundries will inevitably increase plastic consumption in-step with synthetic biology scaling. Decontamination and reuse of single-use plastics could increase sustainability and reduce recurring costs of biological research. However, throughput and variable cleaning quality make manual decontamination impractical in most instances. Automating single-use plastic cleaning with liquid handling robots makes decontamination more practical by offering higher throughput and consistent cleaning quality. However, open-source, validated protocols using low-cost lab robotics for effective decontamination of plasticware--facilitating safe reuse--have not yet been developed.

We tested a variety of cleaning solutions, contact times, and agitation methods with the aim of minimizing time and cost, while maximizing cleaning stringency and sustainability. We tested and validated these cleaning procedures by comparing fresh versus cleaned tips and plates for contamination with cells, DNA, or cleaning solutions. We assessed contamination by measuring colony forming units by plating, PCR efficiency and DNA concentration by qPCR, and event counts and debris by flow cytometry.

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is an established transcriptional master regulator of differentiation, maintenance, and metabolism. Polymorphisms in HNF4 are linked to several diseases in humans including diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Identifying novel regulation of lipid metabolism by HNF4 would inform on NAFLD development and progression. We directly assessed HNF4 activity through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and integration of untargeted lipidomics. Direct regulation by HNF4 can be difficult to assess due to the role of HNF4 in liver homeostasis; to rapidly disrupt activity, mice were exposed to cold stress which induces hepatic steatosis in several hours. Cold exposure shifted HNF4 activity with differential genome occupancy of more than 50% of HNF4 binding sites. Focusing on HNF4 binding to promoter with active transcription determined that HNF4 directly regulates fatty acid desaturation, ether lipid synthesis, and peroxisomal biogenesis in response to cold exposure. Integration of lipidomics found that cold exposure increases the very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of the hepatic lipid pool, including ether lipids, in an HNF4 dependent manner. Because portions of ether lipid synthesis are in the peroxisome and peroxisomal biogenesis is directly HNF4 regulated, we analyzed peroxisomal abundance and found increases with cold exposure that are ablated with loss of HNF4. This peroxisomal regulation was independent of PPAR-- a known regulator of peroxisomes and lipid metabolism--since loss of HNF4 was not rescued by PPAR overexpression. These data determined that regulation of hepatic steatosis by HNF4 is more complex than triglyceride accumulation and includes acyl chain modifications, ether lipid synthesis, and peroxisomal oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow. Inflammation plays a crucial role in AML progression, but excessive activation of cell-intrinsic inflammatory pathways can also trigger cell death. IRF2BP2 is a chromatin regulator implicated in AML pathogenesis, although its precise role in this disease is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IRF2BP2 interacts with the AP-1 heterodimer ATF7/JDP2, which is involved in activating inflammatory pathways in AML cells. We show that IRF2BP2 is recruited by the ATF7/JDP2 dimer to chromatin and counteracts its gene-activating function. Loss of IRF2BP2 leads to overactivation of inflammatory pathways, resulting in strongly reduced proliferation. Our research indicates that a precise equilibrium between activating and repressive transcriptional mechanisms creates a pro-oncogenic inflammatory environment in AML cells. The ATF7/JDP2-IRF2BP2 regulatory axis is likely a key regulator of this process and may therefore represent a promising therapeutic vulnerability for AML. Thus, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AML pathogenesis and identifies a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment.",

    "abstract": "Protein output of different mRNAs can vary by two orders of magnitude therefore it is critical to understand the processes that control gene expression that operate at the level of translation. Translatome-wide techniques such as polysome profiling and ribosome profiling are key methods for determining translations rates occurring on specific mRNAs. These techniques are now widely used in cell lines; however, they are underutilised in tissues and cancer models. Ribonuclease (RNase) expression is often found to be higher in complex primary tissues in comparison to cell lines. Methods used to preserve RNA during lysis often use denaturing conditions which needs to be avoided when requiring to maintain the interaction and position of the ribosome with the mRNA. Here we detail the cell lysis conditions that produce high quality RNA from several different tissues covering a range of endogenous RNase expression levels. We highlight the importance of RNA integrity for accurate determination of the global translation status of the cell as determined by polysome gradients and discuss key aspects to optimise for accurate assessment of the translatome from primary mouse tissue.",

    "abstract": "Differences in chromatin state inherited from the parental gametes influence the regulation of maternal and paternal alleles in offspring. This phenomenon, known as genomic imprinting, results in genes preferentially transcribed from one parental allele. While local epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation are known to be important for the establishment of imprinted gene expression, less is known about the mechanisms by which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) lead to differences in allelic expression across broad stretches of chromatin. Allele-specific higher-order chromatin structure has been observed at multiple imprinted loci, consistent with the observation of allelic binding of the chromatin-organizing factor CTCF at multiple DMRs. However, whether allelic chromatin structure impacts allelic gene expression is not known for most imprinted loci. Here we characterize the mechanisms underlying brain-specific imprinted expression of the Peg13-Kcnk9 locus, an imprinted region associated with intellectual disability. We performed region capture Hi-C on mouse brain from reciprocal hybrid crosses and found imprinted higher-order chromatin structure caused by the allelic binding of CTCF to the Peg13 DMR. Using an in vitro neuron differentiation system, we show that on the maternal allele enhancer-promoter contacts formed early in development prime the brain-specific potassium leak channel Kcnk9 for maternal expression prior to neurogenesis. In contrast, these enhancer-promoter contacts are blocked by CTCF on the paternal allele, preventing paternal Kcnk9 activation. This work provides a high-resolution map of imprinted chromatin structure and demonstrates that chromatin state established in early development can promote imprinted expression upon differentiation.",

    "abstract": "RationaleOver 200 mutations in the sarcomeric protein {beta}-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, different mutations in MYH7 lead to variable penetrance and clinical severity, and alter myosin function to varying degrees, making it difficult to determine genotype-phenotype relationships, especially when caused by rare gene variants such as the G256E mutation.\n\nObjectiveThis study aims to determine the effects of low penetrant MYH7 G256E mutation on myosin function. We hypothesize that the G256E mutation would alter myosin function, precipitating compensatory responses in cellular functions.\n\nMethodsWe developed a collaborative pipeline to characterize myosin function at multiple scales (protein to myofibril to cell to tissue). We also used our previously published data on other mutations to compare the degree to which myosin function was altered.\n\nResultsAt the protein level, the G256E mutation disrupts the transducer region of the S1 head and reduces the fraction of myosin in the folded-back state by 50.9%, suggesting more myosins available for contraction. Myofibrils isolated from hiPSC-CMs CRISPR-edited with G256E (MYH7WT/G256E) generated greater tension, had faster tension development and slower early phase relaxation, suggesting altered myosin-actin crossbridge cycling kinetics. This hypercontractile phenotype persisted in single-cell hiPSC-CMs and engineered heart tissues. Single-cell transcriptomic and metabolic profiling demonstrated upregulation of mitochondrial genes and increased mitochondrial respiration, suggesting altered bioenergetics as an early feature of HCM.\n\nConclusionsMYH7 G256E mutation causes structural instability in the transducer region, leading to hypercontractility across scales, perhaps from increased myosin recruitment and altered crossbridge cycling. Hypercontractile function of the mutant myosin was accompanied by increased mitochondrial respiration, while cellular hypertrophy was modest in the physiological stiffness environment. We believe that this multi-scale platform will be useful to elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships underlying other genetic cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are naturally occurring vesicles that have the potential to be manipulated to become promising drug delivery vehicles for on-demand in vitro and in vivo gene editing. Here, we developed the modular safeEXO platform, a prototype exosome delivery vehicle that is mostly devoid of endogenous RNA and can efficaciously deliver RNA and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to their intended intracellular targets manifested by downstream biologic activity. We also successfully engineered producer cells to produce safeEXO vehicles that contain endogenous Cas9 (safeEXO-CAS) to effectively deliver efficient ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated CRISPR genome editing machinery to organs or diseased cells in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed that safeEXO-CAS exosomes could co-deliver ssDNA, sgRNA and siRNA, and efficaciously mediate gene insertion in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated the potential to target safeEXO-CAS exosomes by engineering exosomes to express a tissue-specific moiety, integrin alpha-6 (safeEXO-CAS-ITGA6), which increased their uptake to lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. We tested the ability of safeEXO-CAS-ITGA6 loaded with EMX1 sgRNAs to induce lung-targeted editing in mice, which demonstrated significant gene editing in the lungs with no signs of morbidity or detectable changes in immune cell populations. Our results demonstrate that our modular safeEXO platform represents a targetable, safe and efficacious vehicle to deliver nucleic acid-based therapeutics that successfully reach their intracellular targets. Furthermore, safeEXO producer cells can be genetically manipulated to produce safeEXO vehicles containing CRISPR machinery for more efficient RNP-mediated genome editing. This platform has the potential to improve current therapies and increase the landscape of treatment for various human diseases using RNAi and CRISPR approaches.",
