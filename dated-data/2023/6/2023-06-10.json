    "abstract": "Total cellular transcriptome-size varies from cell-to-cell. However, the degree of such variations among diverse cell-types and their function in the body remains elusive. Moreover, such differential transcriptome-size is mostly ignored in the widely used single-cell analyses, veiling its functional importance. To overcome such limitations, currently available experimental approaches are insufficient. Hence, we developed and report a computational method to determine its body-wide variations. Using this method, we compute weighting-factors that account for the differences of the total cellular transcriptome-size for 76 cell-types across 10 organs. We demonstrate their validity by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of the whole-organ transcriptomics using their composite single-cell data weighted by these factors. Importantly, we also show such weighting-factors indeed recapitulate experimentally-determined differential total cellular transcriptome-size. Furthermore, we show that such body-wide variations accurately predict aging-progression. These results unveil the body-wide landscape of the cell type-specific total cellular transcriptome-size and their physiological importance.\n\nTeaserDifferential mRNA contents of 76 cell-types across 10 organs and their importance in aging are computationally determined.",

    "abstract": "Draft genome sequences of non-bilaterian species have provided important insights into the evolution of the metazoan gene repertoire. However, there is little information about the evolution of gene clusters, genome architectures and karyotypes during animal evolution. In this regard, slowly evolving anthozoan Cnidaria, the sister group of Bilateria, are particularly informative. Here we report chromosome-level genome assemblies of two related cnidarians, the sea anemones Nematostella vectensis and Scolanthus callimorphus. We find a robust set of 15 chromosomes with a clear one-to-one correspondence between the two species. Both sea anemone genomes show remarkable chromosomal conservation with other cnidarians, several bilaterians and the sponge Ephydatia muelleri, allowing us to reconstruct ancestral cnidarian and metazoan chromosomal blocks, consisting of at least 19 and 16 ancestral linkage groups, respectively. We show that, in contrast to Bilateria, the Hox and NK clusters of investigated cnidarians are largely disintegrated, despite the presence of staggered hox/gbx expression in Nematostella. This loss of microsynteny conservation may be facilitated by shorter distances between cis-regulatory sequences and their cognate transcriptional start sites. In line with that, we find no clear evidence for topologically associated domains, suggesting fundamental differences in long-range gene regulation compared to vertebrates. These data suggest that large sets of ancestral metazoan genes have been retained in ancestral linkage groups of some extant lineages, yet, higher order gene regulation with associated 3D architecture may have evolved only after the cnidarian-bilaterian split.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY The metabolic efficiency of mammalian cells depends on the ability of microRNA to attenuate intrinsic translation noise. We devised a metric of cellular metabolic rate (cMR), rMR optimally fit to the number of microRNA families (miRNA.Fam), that is robust to variation in mass and sensitive to body temperature, consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory of Speakman and Krol (2010). Relatively abrupt increases in miRNA.Fam and cMR in later-branching, permanently homeothermic Boreoeutheria led us to postulate the emergence of new optimum in the adaptive landscape. With miRNA.Fam as predictor, simulation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of stabilizing selection, together with an adaptive shift between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria, accounted for 95% of the variation in cMR. Branchwise rates of evolution of cMR, miRNA.Fam and body temperature concurrently increased 6- to 7-fold, independent of the evolution of mass. Cellular MR variation across placental mammals was also predicted by the energy spared by model conserved microRNA-target interactions, revealing an unexpected degree of integration of the microRNA-target apparatus into the energy economy of the mammalian cell.",

    "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common cause of hearing loss and one of the most prevalent conditions affecting the elderly worldwide. Despite evidence from our lab and others about its polygenic nature, little is known about the specific genes, cell types and pathways involved in ARHL, impeding the development of therapeutic interventions. In this manuscript, we describe, for the first time, the complete cell-type specific transcriptome of the aging mouse cochlea using snRNA-seq in an outbred mouse model in relation to auditory threshold variation. Cochlear cell types were identified using unsupervised clustering and annotated via a three-tiered approach - first by linking to expression of known marker genes, then using the NS-Forest algorithm to select minimum cluster-specific marker genes and reduce dimensional feature space for statistical comparison of our clusters with existing publicly-available data sets on the gEAR website (https://umgear.org/), and finally, by validating and refining the annotations using Multiplexed Error Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (MERFISH) and the cluster-specific marker genes as probes. We report on 60 unique cell-types expanding the number of defined cochlear cell types by more than two times. Importantly, we show significant specific cell type increases and decreases associated with loss of hearing acuity implicating specific subsets of hair cell subtypes, ganglion cell subtypes, and cell subtypes withing the stria vascularis in this model of ARHL. These results provide a view into the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for age-related hearing loss and pathways for therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges of magnetic drug targeting is to achieve efficient and accurate delivery of drug particles to the desired sites in complex physiological conditions. Though a majority of drugs are delivered through intravenous administration, until now, the kinematics and dynamics of drug particles influenced by the magnetic field, vascular topology and blood flows are still less understood. In this work, a multi-physics dynamical model which captures transient particle motions in both artificial and in vivo-like 3D vascular networks manipulated by the time-varying magnetic field is developed. Based on the model, it is found that particles which perform a random walk with correlated speed and persistence (RWSP motion) inspired by the migratory motion of immune and metastasis cells have higher mobility and navigation ability in both 2D and 3D tree-like and web-like networks. Moreover, to steer particles to perform the efficient RWSP motion, a stochastic magnetic steering strategy which uses time-varying gradient magnetic field is proposed. Parameters of the steering strategy is optimized and the capability of controlling particles to achieve fast spreading and transport in the vascular networks is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of heterogeneous flows in the vascular networks on the particle steering efficiency is discussed. Overall, the numerical model and the magnetic steering strategy can be widely used in the drug delivery systems for precise medicine research.",

    "abstract": "Radial spokes (RS) are T-shaped multiprotein complexes on the axonemal microtubules. Repeated RS1, RS2, and RS3 couple the central pair to modulate ciliary and flagellar motility. Despite the cell type specificity of RS3 substructures, their molecular components remain largely unknown. Here, we report that a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, LRRC23, is an RS3 head component essential for its head assembly and flagellar motility in mammalian spermatozoa. From infertile male patients with defective sperm motility, we identified a splice site variant of LRRC23. A mutant mouse model mimicking this variant produces a truncated LRRC23 at the C-terminus that fails to localize to the sperm tail, causing male infertility due to defective sperm motility. LRRC23 was previously proposed to be an ortholog of the RS stalk protein RSP15. However, we found that purified recombinant LRRC23 interacts with an RS head protein RSPH9, which is abolished by the C-terminal truncation. Evolutionary and structural comparison also shows that LRRC34, not LRRC23, is the RSP15 ortholog. Cryo-electron tomography clearly revealed that the absence of the RS3 head and the sperm-specific RS2-RS3 bridge structure in LRRC23 mutant spermatozoa. Our study provides new insights into the structure and function of RS3 in mammalian spermatozoa and the molecular pathogenicity of LRRC23 underlying reduced sperm motility in infertile human males.",

    "abstract": "For animals that synthesise their chemical compounds de novo, resources, particularly proteins, can influence investment in chemical defences and nitrogen-based wing colouration such as melanin. Competing for the same resources often leads to trade-offs in resource allocation. We manipulated protein availability in the larval diet of the wood tiger moth, Arctia plantaginis, to test how early life resource availability influences relevant life history traits, melanin production, and chemical defences. We expected higher dietary protein to result in more effective chemical defences and a higher amount of melanin in the wings. According to the resource allocation hypothesis, we also expected individuals with less melanin to have more resources to allocate to chemical defences. We found that protein-deprived moths had a slower larval development, and their chemical defences were less unpalatable for bird predators, but the expression of melanin in their wings did not differ from that of moths raised on a high-protein diet. The amount of melanin in the wings, however, unexpectedly correlated positively with chemical defences, irrespective of the diet they were raised on. Our findings demonstrate that the resources available in early life have an important role in the efficacy of chemical defences, but melanin-based warning colours are less sensitive to resource variability than other fitness-related traits.",

Focusing on young COPD should help to discover disease modifying therapies. We aimed to examine the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in young COPD from both human samples and murine models.\n\nMethodsBlood samples and lung tissues of young COPD patients and controls were obtained in order to analyse CXCL12 and CXCR4 levels. To generate a young COPD model, ten-week-old mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for 10 weeks and intranasal instillations of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) for the last 5 weeks to mimic exacerbations.\n\nResultsExposed mice presented mild airway obstruction, peri-bronchial fibrosis and right heart thickening. CXCR4 expressing cells number was increased in the blood of exposed mice, as well as in the blood of patients with COPD. Lung CXCL12 expression was higher in both exposed mice and young COPD patients. The density of fibrocytes expressing CXCR4 was increased in the bronchial submucosa of exposed mice. Conditional inactivation of CXCR4 at adult stage as well as pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 with plerixafor injections improved lung function, reduced inflammation and protected against CS and poly-(I:C)-induced airway and cardiac remodelling. CXCR4-/- and plerixafor-treated mice also had less CXCR4-expressing circulating cells and a lower density of peri-bronchial fibrocytes.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that targeting CXCR4 has beneficial effects in an animal model of young COPD and provide a framework to translate these preclinical findings to clinical settings in a drug repurposing approach.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock enables anticipation of the day/night cycle in animals ranging from cnidarians to mammals. Circadian rhythms are generated through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) involving negative and positive factors. CLOCK is a central conserved positive factor in the animal kingdom. However, the functional evolutionary origin and mechanism of action of CLOCK in basal animals are unknown. In cnidarians, the transcription of putative core clock genes, including Clock, is arrhythmic under constant conditions, and it is unclear how the TTFL model can regulate physiological rhythms. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate a Clock mutant (Clock-/-) in Nematostella vectensis. High-throughput video tracking of locomotor activity in Clock-/- adults revealed that light regulates rhythmic behavior, while CLOCK maintains a 24-hour circadian rhythm under constant light conditions, and even under a 6-hour cycle, reminiscent of the tidal rhythm. Transcriptome profiling identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes in Clock-/- adults, particularly genes involved in cell cycle and neural development. In accordance with the rhythmic behavioral profile, computational analysis revealed rhythmic and arrhythmic gene expression in wild-type and Clock-/- adults, respectively, under constant dark conditions. Notably, hierarchal light-and Clock-signaling is required to drive rhythmic transcription of the core clock genes. These findings demonstrate that CLOCK has evolved in cnidarians to maintain synchronized 24-hour rhythmic physiology and behavior despite the chaotic inputs of environmental cues.",

Recent approaches to this problem have attempted to extract information about tumour growth by integrating multiscale experimental measurements, such as longitudinal cell counts and gene expression data. In the present study, we investigated the performance of several mathematical models of tumour growth, including classical logistic, fractional and novel multiscale models, in terms of quantifying in-vitro tumour growth in the presence and absence of therapy. We further examined the effect of genes associated with changes in chemosensitivity in cell death rates. State-of-the-art Bayesian inference, likelihood maximisation and uncertainty quantification techniques allowed a thorough evaluation of model performance. The results suggest that the classical single-cell population model (SCPM) was the best fit for the untreated and low-dose treatment conditions, while the multiscale model with a cell death rate symmetric with the expression profile of OCT4 (SymSCPM) yielded the best fit for the high-dose treatment data. Further identifiability analysis showed that the multiscale model was both structurally and practically identifiable under the condition of known OCT4 expression profiles. Overall, the present study demonstrates that model performance can be improved by incorporating multiscale measurements of tumour growth.",

Originated from spatial cognition, the neural codes supporting representation and navigation of spatial cognitive map has been widely studied. Recent studies suggest similar neural mechanism subserves the map-like architecture in social cognition as well. Here we investigated how spatial codes operate beyond physical environment and support the representation and navigation of social cognitive map. We designed a social value space defined by two dimensions of competence and warmth. Behaviorally, participants were able to navigate to a learned location from random starting locations in this abstract social space. At neural level, we identified representation of distance in precuneus, fusiform gyrus and middle occipital gyrus. We also found grid-like representation patterns in medial prefrontal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Moreover, the intensity of grid-like response scaled with performance of navigating in social space and social avoidance trait scores.

    "abstract": "Throughout history, humans have relied on plants as a source of medication, flavoring, and food. Plants synthesize large chemical libraries and release many of these compounds into the rhizosphere and atmosphere where they affect animal and microbe behavior. To survive, nematodes must have evolved the sensory capacity to distinguish plant-made small molecules (SMs) that are harmful and must be avoided from those that are beneficial and should be sought. This ability to classify chemical cues as a function of their value is fundamental to olfaction, and represents a capacity shared by many animals, including humans. Here, we present an efficient platform based on multi-well plates, liquid handling instrumentation, low-cost optical scanners, and bespoke software that can efficiently determine the chemotaxis valence of single SMs in the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Using this integrated hardware-wetware-software platform, we screened 90 plant SMs and identified 37 that attracted or repelled wild-type animals, but had no effect on mutants defective in chemosensory transduction. Genetic dissection indicates that for at least 10 of these SMs, response valence emerges from the integration of opposing signals, arguing that olfactory valence is often determined by integrating chemosensory signals over multiple lines of information. This study establishes that C. elegans is an effective discovery engine for determining chemotaxis valence and for identifying natural products detected by the chemosensory nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Regulated cell death (RCD) has been reported to play a critical role in organ development. Despite apoptosis, the best known and most studied RCD in organogenesis, whether newly identified non-apoptotic cell death participates in the physiological process like development is barely understood. As a metabolic-related cell death pathway, ferroptosis, characterized by iron-dependent and lethal lipid peroxidation, was firstly described in 2012 and is now being wildly explored for its pathological function. Main factors of ferroptosis, lipid metabolism, ROS biology, and iron regulation, are also critically involved in developmental progress but hard to manipulate and investigate effectively in vivo through a high throughput way. Here in our study, an ex vivo culture model of tooth germ is applied to investigate the possible role of ferroptosis in organogenesis, since both RCD and risk factors of ferroptosis (lipid metabolism, ROS biology, and iron regulation) participate in tooth morphogenesis and the well-established ex vivo culture model enables effective manipulation of ferroptosis. To investigate whether ferroptotic stress exists and may influence tooth germ development, we detect the spatiotemporal expression of Gpx4, a core anti-lipid peroxidation enzyme in ferroptosis, in mouse development first molar and incisor. Morphological changes in each group with/without activation of ferroptosis are identified by gross anatomy, sequential HE staining, and related 3D reconstruction. Ferroptosis-related genes, lipid peroxidation, the morphology of mitochondria, and iron accumulation are detected to confirm the activation of ferroptosis. Inhibition of ferroptosis by DFO, Fer-1, and Lip-1, could partly rescue organogenesis of erastin-impaired tooth morphogenesis. Moreover, apoptosis is not significantly activated in erastin-impaired tooth germ indicated by cleavage of Caspase-3 and TUNEL staining. These results demonstrate that ferroptotic stress exists in tooth organogenesis but is well controlled by following upregulation of Gpx4; Overburdened ferroptotic stress cause by erastin significantly suppress tooth morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical transformation of tissue is not merely a symptom but a decisive driver in pathological processes. Comprising intricate network of cells, fibrillar proteins, and interstitial fluid, tissues exhibit distinct solid- (elastic) and liquid-like (viscous) behaviours that span a wide band of frequencies. Yet, characterization of wideband viscoelastic behaviour in whole tissue has not been investigated, leaving a vast knowledge gap in the higher frequency range that is linked to fundamental intracellular processes and microstructural dynamics. Here, we present wideband Speckle rHEologicAl spectRoScopy (SHEARS) to address this need. We demonstrate, for the first time, analysis of frequency-dependent elastic and viscous moduli up to the sub-MHz regime in biomimetic scaffolds and tissue specimens of blood clots, breast tumours, and bone. By capturing previously inaccessible viscoelastic behaviour across the wide frequency spectrum, our approach provides distinct and comprehensive mechanical signatures of tissues that may provide new mechanobiological insights and inform novel disease prognostication.",

    "abstract": "Plant phenological changes drive many ecosystem processes and are a key ecological indicator of climate change. Traditional models represent the onset of autumn leaf senescence, or color change, as a threshold response triggered by the accumulation of cold temperatures and declining day lengths, but the physiological mechanisms behind plant thermal memory and chilling thresholds remain elusive. Here we show that we can predict senescence in forest canopies by dynamically modeling daily greenness as the \"memoryless\" balance between chlorophyll synthesis, linearly-related to daily temperatures and day lengths, and breakdown. Indeed, summer-only data can be used to estimate breakdown and synthesis rates that in many cases successfully predict senescence at both calibration and validation sites. This mechanistic model shows that neither a trigger nor a physiological memory of coldness is necessary for senescence to start. These findings suggest that the start of senescence is not an irreversible transition, but a continuum of decreasing greenness where concurrent environmental conditions determine the rate of initial senescence. Furthermore, this emphasizes that in order to predict how senescence will shift in response to global change we likely need to focus on understanding the impacts on chlorophyll synthesis.\n\nSignificance statementPlant phenology is a leading ecological indicator of climate change and has wide-ranging ecological and climatological impacts. Our findings here contradict the key assumption that senescence in deciduous broadleaf trees is actively triggered only when a threshold of cumulative cooling in combination of other stressors is reached. Instead we show that canopy greenness can be modeled as a passive process - balancing chlorophyll breakdown and temperature- and photoperiod-controlled synthesis - and still predict a rapid decline in greenness during senescence. This work is particularly important because it emphasizes that in order to understand climate change induced shifts in senescence, we need to focus on impacts on chlorophyll synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Madagascar comprises one of the Earths biologically richest, but also one of most endangered, terrestrial ecoregions. Although it is obvious that humans substantially altered its natural ecosystems during the past decades, the timing of arrival of humans on Madagascar as well as their environmental impact is not well resolved. In this context, this research aims to study and compare the influence of early human impact and climate change on rain forests and wildlife in northern Madagascar during the past Millennia. By using palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from lake sediment cores in a montane environment (Montagne dAmbre), results indicate a major drought, starting approximately 1,100 years ago. This drought caused significant changes in lake levels and vegetation dynamics. Human impact, evidenced by fires, started a few decades later. Anthropogenic burning, limited to the low-altitude areas, was therefore not the driving force behind these early changes observed in the lake catchment areas. Although this does not dismiss the strong impacts humans had subsequently on these ecosystems, this work demonstrates that the late Holocene natural drought that intensified regionally about one thousand years ago, significantly impacted the ecosystems independently and prior to anthropogenic activities. At a regional scale, a review of demographic studies revealed a substantial number of inferred population bottlenecks in various wildlife species during the last millennia, likely resulting from this combination of both human-related impact and natural environmental changes (i.e., precipitation decline). This research highlights that the current state of ecosystems in northern Madagascar results from both human impact and natural climate changes. It also points to the importance of a multi-site and multi-proxy comparison for deciphering the nature and succession of past environmental changes.",

Here, we introduce fai and zol, which together enable large-scale comparative analysis of different types of gene clusters and mobile-genetic elements (MGEs), such as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) or viruses. Fundamentally, they overcome a current bottleneck to reliably perform comprehensive orthology inference at large scale across broad taxonomic contexts and thousands of genomes. First, fai allows the identification of orthologous or homologous instances of a query gene cluster of interest amongst a database of target genomes. Subsequently, zol enables reliable, context-specific inference of protein-encoding ortholog groups for individual genes across gene cluster instances. In addition, zol performs functional annotation and computes a variety of statistics for each inferred ortholog group. These programs are showcased through application to: (i) longitudinal tracking of a virus in metagenomes, (ii) discovering novel population-genetic insights of two common BGCs in a fungal species, and (iii) uncovering large-scale evolutionary trends of a virulence-associated gene cluster across thousands of genomes from a diverse bacterial genus.",

Recent advances in trace sample proteomics have enabled quantitative protein abundance datasets from single human MNs (Cong et al., 2020b). In this study, we leveraged laser capture microdissection (LCM) and nanoPOTS (Zhu et al., 2018c) single-cell mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to query changes in protein expression in single MNs from postmortem ALS and control donor spinal cord tissues, leading to the identification of 2515 proteins across MNs samples (>900 per single MN) and quantitative comparison of 1870 proteins between disease groups. Furthermore, we studied the impact of enriching/stratifying MN proteome samples based on the presence and extent of immunoreactive, cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions, allowing identification of 3368 proteins across MNs samples and profiling of 2238 proteins across TDP-43 strata. We found extensive overlap in differential protein abundance profiles between MNs with or without obvious TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions that together point to early and sustained dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, mRNA splicing and translation, and retromer-mediated vesicular transport in ALS. Our data are the first unbiased quantification of single MN protein abundance changes associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy and begin to demonstrate the utility of pathology-stratified trace sample proteomics for understanding single-cell protein abundance changes in human neurologic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in salt marsh sediments are major controllers of ecosystem-scale carbon cycling. Cross-site comparisons of S-cycling communities are difficult given the rampant uncultured microbial diversity in sediment, yet comparisons are essential for revealing biogeographic, phylogenetic and functionally significant variation. Here, we use deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing data to construct and compare metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of sulfur-cycling bacteria from Massachusetts and Alabama salt marshes that contrast in seasonality and sediment organic matter content. Samples were collected from sediments under Sporobolus alterniflorus and Sporobolus pumilus in separate MA vegetation zones, and under Sporobolus alterniflorus and Juncus roemerianus co-rooted in AL marsh. We grouped metagenomic data by plant species and site and identified 38 MAGs that included pathways for dissimilatory sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidation. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that 30 of the 38 were affiliated with uncultivated lineages. Read-mapping to MAGs showed significant differentiation of AL and MA samples, differentiation of samples taken in S. alterniflorus and S. pumilus vegetation zones in MA, but no differentiation of samples taken under S. alterniflorus and J. roemerianus that were rooted together in AL marsh. Pangenomic analyses of eight ubiquitous MAGs also detected site- and vegetation-specific genomic features, including varied sulfur-cycling operons, carbon fixation pathways, fixed single nucleotide variants, and active diversity-generating retroelements. This genetic diversity, detected at multiple scales even within uncultured groups, suggests evolutionary relationships affected by distance and local environment, and demonstrates differential microbial capacities for sulfur and carbon cycling in salt marsh sediments.\n\nImportanceSalt marshes are known for their significant carbon storage capacity, and sulfur cycling is closely linked with the ecosystem-scale carbon cycling in these ecosystems. Sulfate reducers are the major decomposers in salt marsh systems, and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria remove sulfide, a toxic byproduct of sulfate reduction, supporting the productivity of marsh plants. To date, the complexity of coastal environments, heterogeneity of the rhizosphere, high microbial diversity and uncultured majority hindered our understanding of the genomic diversity of sulfur-cycling microbes in salt marshes. Here we use comparative genomics to overcome these challenges and provide an in-depth characterization of microbial diversity in salt marshes. We characterize sulfur-cycling communities across distinct sites and plant species and uncover extensive genomic diversity at the taxon level and specific genomic features present in MAGs affiliated with sulfur-cycling uncultivated lineages. Our work provides insights into the partnerships in salt marshes and a roadmap for multiscale analyses of diversity in complex biological systems.",

In this study, ST901 were analyzed by whole genome sequencing in looking for both differences and similarities inside this ST and with other unrelated Legionella strains. To this aim core genome multi locus sequence type, single nucleotide polymorphisms and pangenome analyses were performed. ST901 resulted highly similar each other, characterized by I-C CRISPR-cas system, located on the chromosome and by a putative plasmid, highly similar to that found in Lp strain Lens, which contains I-F CRISPR-cas system. Accessory genomic islands, either already described or specifically found in ST901, were also shown.\n\nIn conclusion ST901 has been quite preserved over the time.

    "abstract": "Tau pathology is associated with many neurodegenetive disorders, including Alzheimers disease (AD), where the spatio-temporal pattern of tau neurofibrillary tangles strongly correlates with disease progression, which motivates therapeutics selective for misfolded tau. Here, we introduce a new avidity-enhanced, multi-epitope approach for protein misfolding immunogen design, which is predicted to mimic the conformational state of an exposed epitope in toxic tau oligomers. A predicted oligomer-selective tau epitope 343KLDFK347 was scaffolded by designing a {beta}-helix structure that incorporated multiple instances of the 16-residue tau fragment 339VKSEKLDFKDRVQSKI354. Largescale conformational ensemble analyses involving Jensen-Shannon Divergence and the embedding depth [D] showed that the multi-epitope scaffolding approach, employed in designing the {beta}-helix scaffold, was predicted to better discriminate toxic tau oligomers than other \"monovalent\" strategies utilizing a single instance of an epitope for vaccine immunogen design. Using Rosetta, 10,000 sequences were designed and screened for the linker portions of the {beta}-helix scaffold, along with a C-terminal stabilizing -helix that interacts with the linkers, to optimize the folded structure and stability of the scaffold. Structures were ranked by energy, and the lowest 1% (82 unique sequences) were verified using AlphaFold. Several selection criteria involving AlphaFold are implemented to obtain a lead designed sequence. The structure was further predicted to have free energetic stability by using Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The synthesized {beta}-helix scaffold showed direct binding in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to several antibodies that were raised to the structured epitope using a designed cyclic peptide. Moreover the strength of binding of these antibodies to in vitro tau oligomers correlated with the strength of binding to the {beta}-helix construct, suggesting that the construct presents an oligomer-like conformation and may thus constitute an effective oligomer-selective immunogen.",

    "abstract": "Starch is the major energy storage compound in plants. Whether it is transient or stored, it is accumulated in the form of insoluble, semi-crystalline granules. The structure of these granules is related to the structure of the main component: amylopectin. Amylopectin consists of linear polymers of glucose units linked by -1,4 bonds, forming double helices that combine to form the semi-crystalline lamellae of the granules, and -1,6 branching points that form the amorphous lamellae. This particular structure of amylopectin is linked to the action of isoamylases, which cut the excess of branching points and allow the granules to be structured. For a long time, it was thought that the action of these enzymes was responsible for the structuring of starch granules. Recently, two new proteins, LESV and ESV1, have been characterized and are involved in the phase transition of amylopectin (LESV) or in the maintenance of the granule structure (ESV1). These proteins share a tryptophan-rich domain folded into an antiparallel {beta}-sheet that is particularly well suited to bind amylopectin double helices. In this paper we present the structural study of these interactions using integrative structural biology approaches and show that LESV, in contrast to ESV1 can intervenes during amylopectin biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Amplification of MYCN is observed in high-risk neuroblastomas (NBs) and is associated with a poor prognosis. MYCN expression is directly regulated by multiple transcription factors, including OCT4, MYCN, CTCF, and p53 in NB. Our previous study showed that inhibition of p53 binding at the MYCN locus induces NB cell death. However, it remains unclear whether other transcription factors contribute to NB cell survival. In this study, we revealed that the inhibition of OCT4 binding at the MYCN locus, a critical site for the human-specific OCT4-MYCN positive feedback loop, induces caspase-2-mediated cell death in MYCN-amplified NB. We used the CRISPR/deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) technology to specifically inhibit transcription factors from binding to the MYCN locus in the MYCN-amplified NB cell lines CHP134 and IMR32. In both cell lines, the inhibition of OCT4 binding at the MYCN locus reduced MYCN activity. Differentially downregulated transcripts were associated with high-open reading frame (ORF) dominance score, which is associated with the translation efficiency of transcripts. These transcripts were enriched in splicing factors, including MYCN-target genes such as HNRNPA1 and PTBP1. Furthermore, transcripts with high-ORF dominance were significantly associated with genes whose high expression is associated with a poor prognosis of NB. In conclusion, the inhibition of OCT4 binding at the MYCN locus resulted in reduced MYCN activity, which in turn led to the downregulation of high-ORF dominance transcripts and subsequently induced caspase-2-mediated cell death in MYCN-amplified NB cells. Therefore, disruption of the human-specific OCT4-MYCN positive feedback loop may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for MYCN-amplified NB.\n\nContribution to the fieldNeuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood tumor. Amplification of MYCN is frequently observed in high-risk NBs and is linked to a poor prognosis. Multiple transcription factors, including OCT4, MYCN, CTCF, and p53, regulate MYCN expression by binding to the MYCN locus. This study investigated the contribution of these transcription factors in NB cell survival. We used CRISPR/deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) technology to specifically inhibit transcription factors from binding to the MYCN locus in MYCN-amplified NB cell lines. We found that the inhibition of OCT4 binding at the MYCN locus, a critical site for the human-specific OCT4-MYCN positive feedback loop, reduces MYCN activity and induces NB cell death. A detailed investigation of the molecular mechanisms of cell death revealed that the downregulated transcripts after suppressed MYCN activity were associated with high-open reading frame (ORF) dominance scores, which are associated with translation efficiency of transcripts. These transcripts were enriched in splicing factors, including MYCN-target genes such as HNRNPA1 and PTBP1. Reduced expression of these splicing factors altered the PKM mRNA splicing accompanied by the induction of p53-caspase-2-MDM2-mediated cell death. These findings suggest that disrupting the human-specific OCT4-MYCN positive feedback loop may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for MYCN-amplified NB.",

However, comprehensive integration of gene expression with epigenetic features that define regulatory elements remains a significant challenge. We measured dual single nucleus RNA expression and chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 histone modifications to decipher the chromatin landscape and gene regulation of the kidney in reference and adaptive injury states. We established a comprehensive and spatially-anchored epigenomic atlas to define the kidneys active, silent, and regulatory accessible chromatin regions across the genome. Using this atlas, we noted distinct control of adaptive injury in different epithelial cell types. A proximal tubule cell transcription factor network of ELF3, KLF6, and KLF10 regulated the transition between health and injury, while in thick ascending limb cells this transition was regulated by NR2F1. Further, combined perturbation of ELF3, KLF6, and KLF10 distinguished two adaptive proximal tubular cell subtypes, one of which manifested a repair trajectory after knockout.

    "abstract": "In vitro assays are crucial tools for gaining detailed insights into various biological processes, including metabolism. Cave morphs of the river-dwelling fish species, Astyanax mexicanus, have adapted their metabolism allowing them to thrive in the biodiversity-deprived and nutrient-limited environment of caves. Liver-derived cells from the cave and river morphs of Astyanax mexicanus have proven to be excellent in vitro resources to better understand the unique metabolism of these fish. However, the current 2D cultures have not fully captured the complex metabolic profile of the Astyanax liver. It is known that 3D culturing can modulate the transcriptomic state of cells when compared to its 2D monolayer culture. Therefore, in order to broaden the possibilities of the in vitro system by modeling a wider gamut of metabolic pathways, we cultured the liver-derived Astyanax cells of both surface and cavefish into 3D spheroids. We successfully established 3D cultures at various cell seeding densities for several weeks and characterized the resultant transcriptomic and metabolic variations. We found that the 3D cultured Astyanax cells represent a wider range of metabolic pathways, including cell cycle changes and antioxidant activities, associated with liver functioning as compared to its monolayer culture. Additionally, the spheroids also exhibited surface and cave-specific metabolic signatures, making it a suitable system for evolutionary studies associated with cave adaptation. Taken together, the liver-derived spheroids prove to be a promising in vitro model for widening our understanding of metabolism in Astyanax mexicanus and of vertebrates in general.",

    "abstract": "Senescence has both beneficial and detrimental roles across the tissues over time. This dual nature is mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Still, transient and persistent SASP secretion is poorly understood. There are some unknown mechanisms through which phenotypic transition takes place from beneficial helper (H) senescent cells to deleterious (D) senescent cell states. NOTCH1 is suggested to mediate switching between the different SASP secretomes. NOTCH1 also suppresses a transcription factor C/EBP{beta} during the SASP secretion. Therefore, a hypothesis is proposed about the existence of negative feedback from C/EBP{beta} to NOTCH1 together forming a senescence-switching circuit that might be mediating this phenotypic transition at the molecular level. Using a population dynamics model with competitive interaction to decipher the underlying transition mechanism between the senescent cell subtypes and a mechanistic model to explain the underlying molecular mechanisms of NOTCH1 signaling in modulating the two waves of SASP secretion. By designing effective senescence therapies with selective removal of deleterious senescent cells and maintaining sufficient helper senescent cells can enhance health span and reduce age-related effects.",

    "abstract": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major cause of respiratory illness in young children. The polymerase complex of HMPV consists of two obligate components, the L polymerase and its cofactor, the phosphoprotein P. During replication and transcription, the L/P complex traverses the viral RNA genome, which is encapsidated within multimerized N nucleoproteins. An essential interaction between N and a C-terminal region of P is required for tethering of the L/P polymerase to the RNA template. This N-P interaction is also involved in the formation of cytoplasmic viral factories in infected cells, called inclusion bodies. To define how L/P recognizes N-encapsidated RNA (N-RNA) we employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics simulations, coupled to polymerase activity assays and imaging of inclusion bodies in transfected cells. We report a 2.9 [A] resolution structure of a triple-complex between multimeric N, bound to both RNA and the C-terminal region of P. Furthermore, we also present cryo-EM structures of assembled N in different oligomeric states, highlighting the plasticity of N. Combined with our functional assays, these structural data delineate in molecular detail how P attaches to N-RNA whilst retaining substantial conformational dynamics. Moreover, the N-RNA-P triple complex structure provides a molecular blueprint for the design of therapeutics to potentially disrupt the attachment of L/P to its template.",

    "abstract": "ZNF750 is a nuclear transcription factor that activates skin differentiation and has tumor suppressor roles in several cancers. Unusually, ZNF750 has only a single zinc-finger (ZNF) domain, Z*, with an amino acid sequence that differs markedly from the CCHH family consensus. Because of its sequence differences Z* is classified as degenerate, presumed to have lost the ability to bind the zinc ion required for folding. AlphaFold predicts an irregular structure for Z* with low confidence. Low confidence predictions are often inferred to be intrinsically disordered regions of proteins, which would be the case if Z* did not bind Zn2+. We use NMR and CD spectroscopy to show that a 25-51 segment of ZNF750, corresponding to the Z* domain, folds into a well-defined antiparallel {beta}{beta} tertiary structure with a pM dissociation constant for Zn2+, and a thermal stability >80 {degrees}C. Of three alternative Zn2+ ligand sets, Z* uses a CCHC rather than the expected CCHH motif. The switch in the last ligand maintains the folding topology and hydrophobic core of the classical ZNF motif. CCHC ZNFs are associated with protein-protein interactions but Z* binds DNA. Since the metal chelating site is on the other side of the molecule, it suggests functional preferences are a result of divergent evolution rather than physical constraints on the structure. The structure of Z* provides a context for understanding the domains DNA-binding properties and mutations associated with cancers. We expect other ZNFs currently classified as degenerate, are CCHC-type structures like Z*.",

To adapt translation to specific needs during development, maternal mRNAs are translationally repressed by shortening the polyA tails. While mRNA deadenylation is associated with decapping and degradation in somatic cells, maternal mRNAs with short polyA tails are stable. Here we report an essential role for the germline-specific paralog of the mRNA cap-binding factor eIF4E, known as eIF4E1b, in the storage and repression of maternal mRNAs with short polyA tails. eIF4E1b binds to the mRNA cap and is targeted to ribonucleoprotein complexes through its direct interaction with eIF4ENIF1/4E-T. In early embryos, eIF4E1b binds to a specific set of translationally repressed mRNAs with short or no polyA tails, such as histone mRNAs, which are translated later on during embryogenesis. Consistent with an important role in maternal mRNA dormancy, mutation of eIF4E1b in zebrafish impairs female germline development. Understanding the mechanism and function of eIF4E1B provides new insights into fundamental post-transcriptional regulatory principles governing early vertebrate development.",

The signaling pathways of CMKLR1 can lead to both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the ligands and physiological contexts. To understand the molecular mechanisms of CMKLR1 signaling, we determined a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the CMKLR1-Gi signaling complex with chemerin9, a nanopeptide agonist derived from chemerin, which induced complex phenotypic changes of macrophages in our assays. The cryo-EM structure, together with molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis studies, revealed the molecular basis of CMKLR1 signaling by elucidating the interactions at the ligand-binding pocket and the agonist-induced conformational changes.

Unlike most prokaryotes, eukaryotic gene expression comes with an additional step called alternative splicing. During the maturation process, different combinations of exons are spliced out and joined together resulting in the formation of mRNA isoforms. After removal from pre-mRNA, introns may be degraded by cellular exonucleases or form long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), or temporarily retained in the nucleus for regulating gene expression. We asked: Do introns have an unutilized potential for encoding proteins? If introns had an opportunity of getting translated, what kind of peptides or proteins, would they make? This study is based on the hypothesis of making functional proteins from leftover introns and is an extension of the original work of making functional proteins from the E. coli intergenic sequences (Dhar et al., 2009). Here full-length introns were computationally translated into proteins to study their potential structural, physicochemical, functional, and cellular location properties. Experimental validation is underway for a detailed understanding of the biology of intronic proteins.

    "abstract": "Isolation of MHC ligands and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry is considered the gold standard for defining targets for TCR-T immunotherapies. However, as many targets of high tumor-specificity are only presented at low abundance on the cell surface of tumor cells, the efficient isolation of these peptides is crucial for their successful detection. Here, we demonstrate how different isolation strategies, which consider hydrophobicity and post-translational modifications, can improve the detection of MHC ligands, including cysteinylated MHC ligands from cancer germline antigens or point-mutated neoepitopes. Furthermore, we developed a novel MHC class I ligand prediction algorithm (ARDisplay-I) that outperforms the current state-of-the-art and facilitates the assignment of peptides to the correct MHC allele. The model has other applications, such as the identification of additional MHC ligands not detected from mass spectrometry or determining whether the MHC ligands can be presented on the cell surface via MHC alleles not included in the study. The implementation of these strategies can augment the development of T cell receptor-based therapies (i.a. TIL1-derived T cells, genetically engineered T cells expressing tumor recognizing receptors or TCR-mimic antibodies) by facilitating the identification of novel immunotherapy targets and by enriching the resources available in the field of computational immunology.\n\nSignificanceThis study demonstrates how the isolation of different tumor-specific MHC ligands can be optimized when considering their hydrophobicity and post-translational modification status. Additionally, we developed a novel machine-learning model for the probability prediction of the MHC ligands presentation on the cell surface. The algorithm can assign these MHC ligands to their respective MHC alleles which is essential for the design of TCR-T immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "The SAM1 and SAM2 genes encode for S-AdenosylMethionine (AdoMet) synthetase enzymes, with AdoMet serving as the main methyl donor. We have previously shown that independent deletion of these genes alters chromosome stability and AdoMet concentrations in opposite ways in S. cerevisiae. To characterize other changes occurring in these mutants, we grew wildtype, sam1{Delta}/sam1{Delta}, and sam2{Delta}/sam2{Delta} strains in 15 different Phenotypic Microarray plates with different components, equal to 1440 wells, and measured for growth variations. RNA-Sequencing was also carried out on these strains and differential gene expression determined for each mutant. In this study, we explore how the phenotypic growth differences are linked to the altered gene expression, and thereby predict the mechanisms by which loss of the SAM genes and subsequent AdoMet level changes, impact S. cerevisiae pathways and processes. We present six stories, discussing changes in sensitivity or resistance to azoles, cisplatin, oxidative stress, arginine biosynthesis perturbations, DNA synthesis inhibitors, and tamoxifen, to demonstrate the power of this novel methodology to broadly profile changes due to gene mutations. The large number of conditions that result in altered growth, as well as the large number of differentially expressed genes with wide-ranging functionality, speaks to the broad array of impacts that altering methyl donor abundance can impart, even when the conditions tested were not specifically selected as targeting known methyl involving pathways. Our findings demonstrate that some cellular changes are directly related to AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases and AdoMet availability, some are directly linked to the methyl cycle and its role is production of several important cellular components, and others reveal impacts of SAM gene mutations on previously unconnected pathways.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYS-AdenosylMethionine, or AdoMet, is the main methyl donor in all cells. Methylation reactions are used broadly and impact numerous processes and pathways. The SAM1 and SAM2 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are responsible for producing the enzymes called S-Adenosylmethionine synthetases, which make AdoMet from methionine and ATP. Our previous research showed that when these genes are deleted independently, they have opposite effects on AdoMet levels and chromosome stability. To advance our understanding of the wide array of changes going on in cells with these gene deletions we characterized our mutants phenotypically, growing in various different conditions to look for growth changes, and for their different gene expression profiles. In this study, we investigated how the differences in growth patterns are connected to the altered gene expression, and thereby were able to predict the mechanisms through which the loss of the SAM genes affects different pathways. Our investigations have uncovered novel mechanisms of sensitivity or resistance to many conditions and shown linkages to AdoMet availability, AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, methyl cycle compounds, or new connections to sam1 and sam2 gene deletions.",

    "abstract": "Malaria cases are frequently recorded in the Ethiopian highlands even at altitudes above 2,000 m. The epidemiology of malaria in the Ethiopian highlands, and in particular the role of importation by human migration from the highly endemic lowlands is not well understood. We characterized the parasite population structure and genetic relatedness by sequencing 159 P. falciparum samples from Gondar and an additional 28 samples from Ziway using a highly multiplexed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based amplicon deep sequencing method targeting 35 microhaplotypes and drug resistance loci. Diversity was moderate (mean HE: 0.54), and infection complexity was low (74.9% single clone infections). A significant percentage of infections shared genomic haplotypes, even across transmission seasons, indicating persistent local and focal transmission. Multiple clusters of clonal or near-clonal infections were identified, highlighting the overall high genetic relatedness. Frequently, infections from travelers were the earliest observed cases, suggesting that parasites may have been imported and then transmitted locally. We observed population structure between Gondar and Ziway, although some haplotypes were shared between sites. 31.1% of infections carried pfhrp2 deletions and 84.4% pfhrp3 deletions, and 28.7% pfhrp2/pfhrp3 double deletions. Parasites with pfhrp2/3 deletions and wild-type parasites were genetically distinct. Mutations associated with resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and lumefantrine were observed at near-fixation, but no mutations in pfk13 were found. In conclusion, genomic data corroborates local transmission and the importance of intensified control in the Ethiopian highlands.",

    "abstract": "Many studies in recent years have investigated the phenomenon of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in proteins. LLPS is reported in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or in proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) lacking a well-defined three-dimensional structure. However, the occurrence of LLPS in folded proteins, that lacks IDRs is not widely known. It is generally assumed that the compact structure and limited flexibility of folded proteins hinder their ability to establish weak and dynamic interactions crucial for LLPS. Contrary to the prevailing understanding, we present direct evidence of rapid phase separation of a globular protein, SUMO1, occurring under crowded conditions at physiological pH and room temperature. The protein molecules in the liquid droplets undergo conformational changes with time, monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. We also demonstrate the phase transition of SUMO1 droplets from liquid to solid state with maturation, ultimately leading to aggregation. The SUMO1 aggregates contain a significant amount of beta-sheet structure but have amorphous morphology, probed by several spectroscopic techniques (Thioflavin T fluorescence, Raman Spectroscopy, and TEM). Our findings provide insights into the behaviour of SUMO1 protein in crowded environment, albeit, the underlying mechanism is not well understood and may differ from those of IDPs. Furthermore, SUMO1 protein is known to colocalize in inclusion bodies of IDPs, and therefore, LLPS of SUMO1 may have important biological implications in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Super resolution detector acquisition for cryo-EM has been used to improve the clarity of cryo-EM reconstructions. Recent reports have demonstrated achieving resolutions beyond the physical Nyquist limit using super resolution acquisition. Here, we demonstrate exceeding the physical Nyquist limitation by pre-processing the raw micrograph movies from \"counting mode\" data which has already reached physical Nyquist reconstruction resolution. To demonstrate functionality, micrograph movies of five datasets were pre-processed and demonstrate that it is possible to exceed the physical Nyquist limit via pixel doubling before motion correction. We call this \"post-acquisition super resolution\", or PASR. While this was originally developed for processing of giant virus datasets, where acquiring at high magnification is not always possible or desirable, it is also shown to work for smaller objects such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) and apoferritin, both of which are still high symmetry, and jack bean urease, with lower symmetry. PASR could reduce the magnification required to achieve desired resolutions, which may increase collection efficiency. PASR can also be of use for in vivo tomography and facilities with high storage demands. However, this method should only be used for data which is able to achieve the Nyquist limit without PASR pre-processing. It will not improve attained resolutions of data which does not already reach the Nyquist limit.",

    "abstract": "Systems biology utilizes computational approaches to examine an array of biological processes, such as cell signaling, metabolomics and pharmacology. This includes mathematical modeling of CAR T cells, a modality of cancer therapy by which genetically engineered immune cells recognize and combat a cancerous target. While successful against hematologic malignancies, CAR T cells have shown limited success against other cancer types. Thus, more research is needed to understand their mechanisms of action and leverage their full potential. In our work, we set out to apply information theory on a mathematical model of cell signaling of CAR-mediated activation following antigen encounter. First, we estimated channel capacity for CAR-4-1BB-mediated NF{kappa}B signal transduction. Next, we evaluated the pathways ability to distinguish contrasting \"low\" and \"high\" antigen concentration levels, depending on the amount of intrinsic noise. Finally, we assessed the fidelity by which NF{kappa}B activation reflects the encountered antigen concentration, depending on the prevalence of antigen-positive targets in tumor population. We found that in most scenarios, fold change in the nuclear concentration of NF{kappa}B carries a higher channel capacity for the pathway than NF{kappa}Bs absolute response. Additionally, we found that most errors in transducing the antigen signal through the pathway skew towards underestimating the concentration of encountered antigen. Finally, we found that disabling IKK{beta} deactivation could increase signaling fidelity against targets with antigen-negative cells. Our information-theoretic analysis of signal transduction can provide novel perspectives on biological signaling, as well as enable a more informed path to cell engineering.",

    "abstract": "Glucose represents the principal brain energy source. Thus, not unexpectedly, genetic glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) deficiency (G1D) manifests with encephalopathy. G1D seizures, which constitute a prominent disease manifestation, often prove refractory to medications but may respond to therapeutic diets. These seizures are associated with aberrant thalamocortical oscillations as inferred from human electroencephalography and functional imaging. Mouse electrophysiological recordings indicate that inhibitory neuron failure in thalamus and cortex underlies these abnormalities. This provides the motivation to develop a neural circuit testbed to characterize the mechanisms of thalamocortical synchronization and the effects of known or novel interventions. To this end, we used mouse thalamocortical slices on multielectrode arrays and characterized spontaneous low frequency oscillations and less frequent 30-50 Hz or gamma oscillations under near-physiological bath glucose concentration. Using the cortical recordings from layer IV, we quantified oscillation epochs via an automated wavelet-based algorithm. This method proved analytically superior to power spectral density, short-time Fourier transform or amplitude-threshold detection. As expected from human observations, increased bath glucose reduced the lower frequency oscillations while augmenting the gamma oscillations, likely reflecting strengthened inhibitory neuron activity. This approach provides an ex vivo method for the evaluation of mechanisms, fuels, and pharmacological agents in a crucial G1D epileptogenic circuit.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of Nile tilapia with ozone nanobubbles (ONb) prior to vaccination with an immersible heat-killed Streptococcus agalactiae (Sa) vaccine has been reported to modulate and enhance both innate and specific immunity. The efficacy of this novel vaccination strategy is explored further in field trials. This strategy involved a short-term treatment of ONb to activate the fishs immunity prior to immersion vaccination during their transportation in oxygenated plastic bags (VAC in BAG), followed by two oral boosters during the grow-out stage mixing vaccine in feed (VAC in FEED). The field trial was conducted over 112 days in open cages, comprising four groups: normal aeration control (AC), normal aeration + vaccine (AV), ONb control (NC), and ONb + vaccine (NV). The efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated by measuring specific antibodies for S. agalactiae, monitoring expressions of IgM and IgT transcripts in the gills and head kidney every two weeks, and a laboratory pathogen challenge. Results found that fish in the NV group had significant increases in anti-S. agalactiae antibodies after the primary dose, whereas fish in the AV group required an oral booster dose to produce significant anti-S. agalactiae antibodies. In the vaccinated groups (AV and NV), only IgM was observed to be upregulated at 14 days post-immersion (dpi), while this gene was upregulated in both gills and head kidney in the NC group. No statistically significant upregulation of IgT was recorded in any group at any time point. Despite a decline in the levels of specific antibodies among the vaccinated groups at the time of challenge (88 dpi), the NV and AV groups demonstrated a relative percent survival (RPS) of 50% and 46.7%, respectively, following a relatively high injection dose of S. agalactiae injection (0.1 mL of 108 CFU/mL). In summary, this ONb, VAC in BAG and VAC in FEED vaccination strategy represents a promising alternative to the undesirable handling and costly injection approach used within the Nile tilapia industry.",

    "abstract": "Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America makes use of two pesticides: 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide, which are often co-applied. Sea lamprey appear to be vulnerable to these agents resulting from a lack of detoxification responses with evidence suggesting that lampricide mixtures produce a synergistic effect. However, there is a lack of information pertaining to the physiological responses of sea lamprey to niclosamide and TFM:niclosamide mixtures. Here, we characterized the transcriptomic responses of the sea lamprey to TFM, niclosamide, and a TFM:niclosamide (1.5%) mixture in the gill. Along with a control, larval sea lamprey were exposed to each treatment for 6 h, after which gill tissues were extracted for measuring whole-transcriptome responses using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression patterns were summarized, which included identifying the broad roles of genes and common expression patterns among the treatments. While niclosamide treatment resulted in no differentially expressed genes, TFM- and mixture-treated fish had several differentially expressed genes that were associated with the cell cycle, DNA damage, metabolism, immune function, and detoxification. However, there was no common differential expression among treatments. For the first time, we characterized the transcriptomic response of sea lamprey to niclosamide and a TFM:niclosamide mixture and identified that these agents impact mRNA transcript abundance of genes associated with the cell cycle and cellular death, and immune function, which are likely mediated through mitochondrial dysregulation. These results may help to inform the production of more targeted and effective lampricides in sea lamprey control efforts.",

    "abstract": "To maximize the impact of precision medicine approaches, it is critical to accurately identify genetic variants in cancer-associated genes with functional consequences. Yet, our knowledge of rare variants conferring clinically relevant phenotypes and the mechanisms through which they act remains highly limited. A tumor suppressor gene exemplifying the challenge of variant interpretation is VHL. VHL encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the cellular response to hypoxia. Germline pathogenic variants in VHL predispose patients to tumors including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and pheochromocytoma, and somatic VHL mutations are frequently observed in sporadic renal cancer. Here, we optimize and apply Saturation Genome Editing (SGE) to assay nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across VHLs coding sequence. To delineate mechanisms, we quantify mRNA dosage effects over time and compare effects in isogenic cell lines. Function scores for 2,268 VHL SNVs identify a core set of pathogenic alleles driving ccRCC with perfect accuracy, inform differential risk across tumor types, and reveal novel mechanisms by which variants impact function. These results have immediate utility for classifying VHL variants encountered in both germline testing and tumor profiling and illustrate how precise functional measurements can resolve pleiotropic and dosage-dependent genotype-phenotype relationships across complete genes.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are a diverse class of biomolecules responsible for wide-ranging cellular functions, from catalyzing reactions and recognizing pathogens to forming dynamic cellular structure. The ability to evolve proteins rapidly and inexpensively towards improved properties is a common objective for protein engineers. Powerful high-throughput methods like fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have dramatically improved directed evolution experiments. However, it is unclear how to best leverage this data to characterize protein fitness landscapes more completely and identify lead candidates. In this work, we develop a simple yet powerful framework to improve protein optimization by predicting continuous protein properties from simple directed evolution experiments using interpretable machine learning. Evaluated across five diverse protein engineering tasks, continuous properties are consistently predicted from readily available deep sequencing data. To prospectively test the utility of this approach, we generated a library of stapled peptides and applied the framework to predict and optimize both affinity and specificity. We coupled integer linear programming with the interpretable machine learning model coefficients to identify new variants from experimentally unseen sequence space that have desired properties. This approach represents a versatile tool for improved analysis and identification of protein variants across many domains of protein engineering.",

Kinesin-14 motors play vital roles in spindle assembly and maintenance by crosslinking antiparallel MTs at the spindle midzone and anchoring spindle MTs minus ends at the poles. We investigate the force generation and motility of the Kinesin-14 motors HSET and KlpA, revealing that both motors function as non-processive motors under load, producing single power strokes per MT encounter. Each homodimeric motor generates forces of [~]0.5 pN, but when assembled in teams, they cooperate to generate forces of 1 pN or more. Importantly, cooperative activity among multiple motors leads to increased MT-sliding velocities. Our findings deepen our understanding of the structure-function relationship of Kinesin-14 motors and underscore the significance of cooperative behavior in their cellular functions.",

Several point mutations in the KIF1A motor domain have been identified in patients with various motor neuron diseases. Recent studies have shown that these mutations affected the motor and cargo localization in cultured hippocampal and C.elegans neurons. However, a detailed analysis of these mutations on KIF1A motility, force generation, and cargo transport is largely unexplored. Here, we have analyzed the effect of 16 point mutations and showed that these mutations significantly decreased the motor velocity and landing rates compared to wild-type motors. Except for A255V, mutations V144F, V220I, and E233D mildly affected motor mechanical outputs. S58L, A202P, R216P, R216H, L249Q, T312M, and R316W mutants exhibited drastic impairments in the motility properties, force generation, and cargo transport. Notably, T46M, T99M, G102D, S215R, and E253K mutants showed strong microtubule binding, resulting in complete disruption of cargo transport. Our study provides the first comprehensive demonstration of KIF1A disease mutations at the molecular level.

Therefore, it is not surprising that microbiome research has found applications within the sports community, hoping to improve health and optimize performance. Every comparison study found new species or pathways that were more enriched in elites than in sedentary controls. In addition, sport-specific and performance-level-specific microbiome features have been identified. However, the results remain inconclusive and indicate the need for further assessment. In our study, we conducted two interventions, anaerobic (Wingate Anaerobic Tests (WAnTs)) and aerobic (Bruce Treadmill Test), on fit non-athletic but physically active controls and athletic strength (training professional sports which increase anaerobic efforts such as weightlifting, powerlifting, and bodybuilding) and endurance (training professional sports which increase aerobic efforts such as race walking, long-distance running, or ski running) individuals to compare sport-specific and training-specific responses. While we did not identify any differences in alpha and beta diversity or significant differential abundance of microbiome components at baseline, we noted that one-third of the species identified were unique to either group. Longitudinal analysis of samples (pre- and post-intervention) revealed an abundance of Alistipes communis in the strength group during the WAnT intervention and 88 species with notable differences between groups during the Bruce Test intervention. SparCC recognized Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, short-chain fatty acid producers with probiotic properties, as species strongly associated with VO2max. Ultimately, we identified several taxa with different baseline abundances and longitudinal changes when comparing individuals based on their VO2max, average power, and maximal power parameters. Our results confirmed the health status of the individuals involved in the study, based on previous assumptions about microbiome health. Furthermore, our findings indicate that microbiome features are associated with better performance measures previously identified in elite athletes.",

But, the research on how pH affects capsid stability is limited, and which protein plays an essential role in pH sensing remains unknown. In this study, we identified the main component of the ASFV capsid -- major capsid protein p72, as a pH sensitive residue abundance protein, and it is speculated that the conformational change of the p72 trimer is possibly responsible for the ASFV uncoating process. To test this speculation, we obtained recombinant p72 trimers, treated with the acidic environment that simulated endosomes and displayed structural analysis. The results showed that the p72 trimer depolymerized at low pH. The depolymerization of trimers rationally explains the disassembly mechanism of the ASFV icosahedral capsid in endosomes.",

Real-time smFRET measurements reveal the presence of significant heterogeneity in the timing of finger displacement and show that different {sigma}-finger conformations in single open transcription complexes are associated with substantially different kinetics in transcription initiation and promoter escape, potentially impacting gene regulation in bacteria.",

Our findings reveal that at the time of the formation, the terrestrial input of the Kap Kobenhavn site originated from a palustrine wetland, suggesting non-permafrost conditions. During this time, detection of methanogenic archaea and carbon processing pathways suggests a moderate strengthening of methane emissions through the northward expansion of wetlands. Intriguingly, we discover a remarkable sequence similarity (>98%) between pioneer methanogens and present-day thawing permafrost counterparts. This suggests that not all microbes respond uniformly to environmental change over geological timescales, but that some microbial taxas adaptability and resilience remain constant over time.

    "abstract": "We show that Zim3, when used as Zim3-KRAB-dCas9 effector in interference CRISPR, without any guide RNAs, paradoxically upregulates key cardiac ion channel genes in human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, responsible for healthy resting membrane potential, repolarization of the action potential and electrical transmission of signals. These were found to yield expected functional enhancements consistent with a more mature iPSC-CM phenotype, with anti-arrhythmic properties.",

    "abstract": "The recent advances in creating pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells and differentiating them into a variety of cell types is allowing us to study them without the caveats associated with disease related changes. We have generated induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) from eight Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and six controls and used lentiviral delivery to differentiate them into excitatory glutamatergic neurons. We have performed RNA sequencing on these neurons and compared the Alzheimers and control transcriptomes. We find that 621 genes show differences in expression levels at adjusted p<0.05 between the case and control derived neurons. These genes show significant overlap and direction concordance with genes reported from a Single cell transcriptome study of Alzheimers patients, they contain 5 genes implicated with AD from genome wide association studies and they appear to be part of a larger functional network as indicated by an excess of interactions between them observed in the protein-protein interaction database STRING. Exploratory analysis with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) suggests distinct clusters of patients, based on gene expression, who maybe clinically different. If confirmed this finding will to contribute to precision medicine approaches to subgroup Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Precise modulation of brain activity is fundamental for the proper establishment and maturation of the cerebral cortex. To this end, cortical organoids are promising tools to study circuit formation and the underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disease. However, the ability to manipulate neuronal activity with high temporal resolution in brain organoids remains limited. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a bioelectronic approach to control cortical organoid activity with the selective delivery of ions and neurotransmitters. Using this approach, we sequentially increased and decreased neuronal activity in brain organoids with the bioelectronic delivery of potassium ions (K+) and {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), respectively, while simultaneously monitoring network activity. This works highlights bioelectronic ion pumps as tools for high-resolution temporal control of brain organoid activity toward precise pharmacological studies that can improve our understanding of neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that RNA helicase DDX3X (DDX3) can be a therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma (EWS), but its role in EWS biology remains unclear. The present work demonstrates that DDX3 plays a unique role in DNA damage repair (DDR). We show that DDX3 interacts with several proteins involved in homologous recombination, including RAD51, RECQL1, RPA32, and XRCC2. In particular, DDX3 colocalizes with RAD51 and RNA:DNA hybrid structures in the cytoplasm of EWS cells. Inhibition of DDX3 RNA helicase activity increases cytoplasmic RNA:DNA hybrids, sequestering RAD51 in the cytoplasm, which impairs nuclear translocation of RAD51 to sites of double-stranded DNA breaks thus increasing sensitivity of EWS to radiation treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. This discovery lays the foundation for exploring new therapeutic approaches directed at manipulating DDR protein localization in solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease subtype with limited treatment options. Eribulin is a chemotherapeutic approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer that has been shown to elicit epigenetic changes. We investigated the effect of eribulin treatment on genome-scale DNA methylation patterns in TNBC cells. Following repeated treatment, The results showed that eribulin-induced changes in DNA methylation patterns evident in persister cells. Eribulin also affected the binding of transcription factors to genomic ZEB1 binding sites and regulated several cellular pathways, including ERBB and VEGF signaling and cell adhesion. Eribulin also altered the expression of epigenetic modifiers including DNMT1, TET1, and DNMT3A/B in persister cells. Data from primary human TNBC tumors supported these findings: DNMT1 and DNMT3A levels were altered by eribulin treatment in human primary TNBC tumors. Our results suggest that eribulin modulates DNA methylation patterns in TNBC cells by altering the expression of epigenetic modifiers. These findings have clinical implications for using eribulin as a therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "The experience of adversity in childhood can have life-long consequences on health outcomes. In search of mediators of this relationship, alterations of bio-behavioral and cellular regulatory systems came into focus, including those dealing with basic gene regulatory processes. Systems biology oriented approaches have been proposed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex multiple interrelations between and within layers of analysis. We used co-expression based, supervised and unsupervised single and multi-omics system approaches to investigate the influence of childhood adversity on gene expression, protein expression and DNA methylation in CD14+ monocytes of healthy adults before and after exposure to an experimental psychosocial stress protocol. Childhood adversity explained some variance at the single analyte level and within gene and protein co-expression structures. A single-omic, post stress gene expression model differentiated best between participants with a history of childhood adversity and controls in supervised analyses. In unsupervised analyses, a multi-omics based model showed best performance but separated participants based on sex only. Multi-omics analyses are a promising concept but might yield different results based on the specific approach taken and the omic-datasets supplied. Here, stress associated gene-expression pattern were most strongly associated with childhood adversity, and integrating multiple cellular layers did not results in better discriminatory performance. Currently, the capacity and yield of different omics-profiling methods might limit the full potential of integrative approaches.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress and elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GCs), the main stress hormones, accelerate Alzheimers disease (AD) onset and progression. A major driver of AD progression is the spreading of pathogenic Tau protein between brain regions, precipitated by neuronal Tau secretion. While stress and high GC levels are known to induce intraneuronal Tau pathology (i.e. hyperphosphorylation, oligomerization) in animal models, their role in trans-neuronal Tau spreading is unexplored. Here, we find that GCs promote secretion of full-length, vesicle-free, phosphorylated Tau from murine hippocampal neurons and ex vivo brain slices. This process occurs via type 1 unconventional protein secretion (UPS) and requires neuronal activity and the kinase GSK3{beta}. GCs also dramatically enhance trans-neuronal Tau spreading in vivo, and this effect is blocked by an inhibitor of Tau oligomerization and type 1 UPS. These findings uncover a potential mechanism by which stress/GCs stimulate Tau propagation in AD.",

    "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is widely expressed throughout the body and is comprised of receptors, ligands, and enzymes that maintain metabolic, immune, and reproductive homeostasis. Increasing interest in the endocannabinoid system has arisen due to these physiologic roles, policy changes leading to more widespread recreational use, and the therapeutic potential of Cannabis and phytocannabinoids. Rodents have been the primary preclinical model of focus due to their relative low cost, short gestational period, genetic manipulation strategies, and gold-standard behavioral tests. However, the potential for lack of clinical translation to non-human primates and humans is high as cross-species comparisons of the endocannabinoid system has not been evaluated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we evaluate the relative gene expression of 14 canonical and extended endocannabinoid receptors in seven peripheral organs of C57/BL6 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, and non-human primate rhesus macaques. Notably, we identify species- and organ-specific heterogeneity in endocannabinoid receptor distribution where there is surprisingly limited overlap among the preclinical models. Importantly, we determined there were only five receptors (CB2, GPR18, GPR55, TRPV2, and FAAH) that had identical expression patterns in mice, rats, and rhesus macaques. Our findings demonstrate a critical, yet previously unappreciated, contributor to challenges of rigor and reproducibility in the cannabinoid field, which has profound implications in hampering progress in understanding the complexity of the endocannabinoid system and development of cannabinoid-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in infectious, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases have established the presence of memory in innate immune cells. This \"trained immunity (TI)\" leads to an enhanced response to a second challenge. Monocytes in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), a common form of inflammatory arthritis, are known to be hyper-responsive to microbial stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We asked if TI is present in AS monocytes and, if so, how it contributes to disease pathology.\n\nUsing Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we identify a subset of monocytes from AS patients exhibiting features of trained immunity and being hyperresponsive to LPS stimulation. Surprisingly, both trained monocytes in AS and {beta}-glucan-trained monocytes from healthy donors are hyper-responsive to T-cell-induced activation. scRNA-seq of AS synovial mononuclear cells shows enrichment of a monocyte population with these/analogous features. Additionally, T cell-stimulated monocytes act back on T-cells to support Th17 responses (of established pathology in AS). Lastly, using genetic and chemical perturbations we show that ERN1, an AS risk gene enriched in this trained monocyte population, contributes to T-cell-induced monocyte activation.\n\nOur data provide strong evidence for the first time for the key role of TI in common human inflammatory arthritis.",
