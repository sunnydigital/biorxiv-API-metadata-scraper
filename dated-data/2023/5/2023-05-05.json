    "abstract": "The underlying biophysical principle governing the cytotoxicity of the oligomeric aggregates of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides has long been an enigma. Here we show that the size of A{beta}40 oligomers can be actively controlled by incubating the peptides in reverse micelles. Our approach allowed for the first time a detailed comparison of the structures and dynamics of two A{beta}40 oligomers of different size, viz., 10 and 23 nm, by solid-state NMR. From the chemical shift data, we infer that the conformation of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10-nm and 23-nm oligomers. We find that the 10-nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the molecular motions of their charged residues are more dynamic. Interestingly, the residue A21 exhibits an unusually high structural rigidity. Our data raise the interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A{beta}40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the charged residues.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cell cycle is regulated by a well-studied but complex biochemical reaction system. Computational models provide a particularly systematic and systemic description of the mechanisms governing mammalian cell cycle control. By combining both state-of-the-art multiplexed experimental methods and powerful computational tools, this work aims at improving on these models along four dimensions: model structure, validation data, validation methodology and model reusability.\n\nWe developed a comprehensive model structure of the full cell cycle that qualitatively explains the behaviour of human retinal pigment epithelial-1 cells. To estimate the model parameters, time courses of eight cell cycle regulators in two compartments were reconstructed from single cell snapshot measurements. After optimisation with a parallel global optimisation metaheuristic we obtained excellent agreements between simulations and measurements. The PEtab specification of the optimisation problem facilitates reuse of model, data and/or optimisation results.\n\nFuture perturbation experiments will improve parameter identifiability and allow for testing model predictive power. Such a predictive model may aid in drug discovery for cell cycle-related disorders.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhile there are numerous cell cycle models in the literature, mammalian cell cycle models typically suffer from four limitations. Firstly, the descriptions of biological mechanisms are often overly complicated yet insufficiently comprehensive and detailed. Secondly, there is a lack of experimental data to validate the model. Thirdly, inadequate parameter estimation procedures are used. Lastly, there is no standardized description of the model and/or optimization problem.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we combine best-in-class technology to address all four simultaneously. We use a rule-based model description to provide a concise and less error-prone representation of complex biology. By applying trajectory reconstruction algorithms to existing data from highly multiplexed immunofluorescence measurements, we obtained a rich dataset for model validation. Using a parallel global metaheuristic for parameter estimation allowed us to bring simulations and data in very good agreement. To maximize reproducibility and reusability of our work, the results are available in three popular formats: BioNetGen, SBML, and PEtab.\n\nOur model is generalizable to many healthy and transformed cell types. The PEtab specification of the optimization problem makes it straightforward to re-optimize the parameters for other cell lines. This may guide hypotheses on cell type-specific regulation of the cell cycle, potentially with clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive form of primary brain tumor in adults, which unfortunately has an abysmal prognosis and poor survival rates. Even though several FDA-approved multimodal treatments for targeting GBM are available, the effectiveness in most patients are not satisfactory. The reason behind this poor success rate is mainly attributed to insufficient drug distribution to the tumor site across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induction of resistance for single-drug based therapies. Chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ) having a median overall survival of around 12-15 months, envisages the urgent necessity for more effective treatment strategies. Based upon these facts, in this study, we have developed a novel approach for repurposing TMZ along with inhibition of EGFR, which overexpressed in GBM, to achieve our goal. PLGA-based nanoencapsulation of both TMZ and 3,3-diindoyl methane (DIM), an EGFR inhibitor, in a combinatorial approach enhances the delivery of them together. Their synergistic mode of actions, significantly enhances the cytotoxic effect of TMZ in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the dual-loaded nanoformulation works more efficiently than their individually packed nanoparticles on DNA damage and apoptosis, resulting in a several-fold reduction in tumor burden, systemic drug toxicity, and increased survival. These findings suggest the preclinical potential of this new treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Many sensory systems have evolved to optimally combine signals from multiple sensory modalities to improve perception. While theories have been proposed to explain how this process is accomplished through probabilistic inference using large neural populations in vertebrates, how animals with dramatically smaller nervous systems such as the Drosophila melanogaster larva achieve multisensory combination remains elusive. Here, we systematically characterize larval navigation in different configurations of odor and temperature gradients with optogenetically-controlled noise. Using a data-driven agent-based model, we find that larvae adapt to the reliability of individual sensory signals, and in some cases minimize the variance of the combined signal. Besides firmly establishing that probabilistic inference directs natural orientation behaviors in the Drosophila larva, our results indicate that the exact mechanism underlying the combination of sensory information may be modality-dependent. By underscoring that probabilistic inference is inherent to insect nervous systems, our work opens the way for studying its neural implementation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have implicated the ethanol metabolite, acetic acid, as neuroactive, perhaps even more so than ethanol itself. In this study, we investigated sex-specific metabolism of ethanol (1, 2, and 4g/kg) to acetic acid in vivo to guide electrophysiology experiments in the accumbens shell (NAcSh), a key node in the mammalian reward circuit. There was a sex-dependent difference in serum acetate production, quantified via ion chromatography only at the lowest dose of ethanol (males>females). Ex vivo electrophysiology recordings of NAcSh neurons in brain slices demonstrated that physiological concentrations of acetic acid (2 mM and 4 mM) increased NAcSh neuronal excitability in both sexes. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, AP5, and memantine robustly attenuated the acetic acid-induced increase in excitability. Acetic acid-induced NMDAR-dependent inward currents were greater in females compared to males. These findings suggest a novel NMDAR-dependent mechanism by which the ethanol metabolite, acetic acid, may influence neurophysiological effects in a key reward circuit in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons exhibit highly variable responses over trials and time. Theoretical works posit that this variability arises potentially from chaotic network dynamics of recurrently connected neurons. Here we demonstrate that chaotic neural dynamics, formed through synaptic learning, allow networks to perform sensory cue integration in a sampling-based implementation. We show that the emergent chaotic dynamics provide neural substrates for generating samples not only of a static variable but also of a dynamical trajectory, where generic recurrent networks acquire these abilities with a biologically-plausible learning rule through trial and error. Furthermore, the networks generalize their experience in the stimulus-evoked samples to the inference without partial or all sensory information, which suggests a computational role of spontaneous activity as a representation of the priors as well as a tractable biological computation for marginal distributions. These findings suggest that chaotic neural dynamics may serve for the brain function as a Bayesian generative model.",

    "abstract": "Childhood adversity is one of the strongest predictors of adolescent mental illness. Therefore, it is critical that the mechanisms that aid resilient functioning in individuals exposed to childhood adversity are better understood. Here, we examined whether resilient functioning was related to structural brain network topology. We quantified resilient functioning at the individual level as psychosocial functioning adjusted for the severity of childhood adversity in a large sample of adolescents (N=2406, aged 14-24). Next, we examined nodal degree (the number of connections that brain regions have in a network) using brain-wide cortical thickness measures in a representative subset (N=275) using a sliding window approach. We found that higher resilient functioning was associated with lower nodal degree of multiple regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (z > 1.645). During adolescence, decreases in nodal degree are thought to reflect a normative developmental process that is part of the extensive remodelling of structural brain network topology. Prior findings in this sample showed that decreased nodal degree was associated with age, as such our findings of negative associations between nodal degree and resilient functioning may therefore potentially resemble a more mature structural network configuration in individuals with higher resilient functioning.",

Neuronal hyper and hypoactivity are also observed in mouse models of amyloid pathology. Using multicolor two-photon microscopy, we test how amyloid pathology alters the structural dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and their homeostatic adaptation to altered experience-evoked activity in vivo in a mouse model. The baseline dynamics of mature excitatory synapses and their adaptation to visual deprivation are not altered in amyloidosis. Likewise, the baseline dynamics of inhibitory synapses are not affected. In contrast, despite unaltered neuronal activity patterns, amyloid pathology leads to a selective disruption of homeostatic structural disinhibition on the dendritic shaft. We show that excitatory and inhibitory synapse loss is locally clustered under the nonpathological state, but amyloid pathology disrupts it, indicating impaired communication of changes in excitability to inhibitory synapses.",

Mainstream approaches based on Optimal Control realize the mappings by minimizing cost functions, which is computationally demanding. Instead, Active Inference uses generative models to produce sensory predictions, which allows a cheaper inversion to the motor signals. However, devising generative models to control complex kinematic chains like the human body is challenging. We introduce a novel Active Inference architecture that affords a simple but effective mapping from extrinsic to intrinsic coordinates via inference and easily scales up to drive complex kinematic chains. Rich goals can be specified in both intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates using attractive or repulsive forces. The proposed model reproduces sophisticated bodily movements and paves the way for computationally efficient and biologically plausible control of actuated systems.",

Would any of these functions of sleep be relevant to an animal without a brain? The upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana, like other cnidarians, lacks a centralized nervous system, yet the animal sleeps [7]. By tracking the propensity of the radially spaced ganglia to initiate muscle contractions over several days we determined how neural activity changes between sleep and wake in a decentralized nervous system. Ganglia-network sleep/ wake activity patterns range from being highly specialized to a few ganglia, to being completely unspecialized. Ganglia specialization also changes over time, indicating a high degree of plasticity in the neural network. The ganglia that lead activity can persist or switch between sleep/wake transitions, signifying a level of local control of the behavioral state in a decentralized nervous system. Following sleep deprivation, ganglia usage becomes far more sleep specialized, demonstrating reduced network plasticity. Together, these findings identify a novel behavioral control system that is decentralized and yet displays temporal specialization and centralization, and show a role for sleep in maintaining neural network plasticity, revealing a conserved function of sleep in this brain-less animal.",

To establish the anatomical substrate for binocular integration, the presence of bilateral eyes and interaction of both optic nerves during retinotectal development play a key role. However, the extent to which embryonic monocularly derived visual circuits can convey visuomotor behaviors is unknown. In this study, we assessed the retinotectal anatomy and visuomotor performance of embryonically generated one-eyed tadpoles. In one-eyed animals, the axons of retinal ganglion cells from the singular remaining eye exhibited striking irregularities in their central projections in the brain, generating a non-canonical ipsilateral retinotectal projection. This data is indicative of impaired pathfinding abilities. We further show that these novel projections are correlated with an impairment of behavioral compensation for the loss of one eye.",

Upon skin injury, however, SG progenitors depart their niche, reepithelialize the wound, and are replaced by hair follicle-derived stem cells. Furthermore, following targeted genetic ablation of >99% of SGs from dorsal skin, these glands unexpectedly regenerate within weeks. This regenerative process is mediated by alternative stem cells originating from the hair follicle bulge, is dependent upon FGFR signaling, and can be accelerated by inducing hair growth. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that stem cell plasticity promotes SG durability following injury.",

In this study, we investigate temporal variation in intergroup aggression in a growing population of colobus monkeys to ask a novel question: \"Who stepped-up to produce these public goods when the competitive landscape changed?\". Both whole-group encounters and male incursions occurred more frequently as the population grew. Males and females were both more likely to participate in whole-group encounters when monopolizable food resources were available, indicating both sexes engaged in food defence. However, only females increasingly did so over time, suggesting that when intergroup competition intensified, it was females who increasingly invested in home range defence. Females were also more active in male incursions at high population densities, suggesting they also worked harder to maintain a safe and stable social environment over time. This is not to say that males were chronic free-riders when it came to maintaining public goods. Males consistently participated in the majority of intergroup interactions throughout the study period, indicating they may have lacked the capacity to invest more time and effort.",

    "abstract": "Striatal dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is critical for an array of reward-related behaviors and goal-directed motor control. In rodents, 95% of striatal neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that have been traditionally segregated into two subpopulations based on the expression of stimulatory DA D1-like receptors versus inhibitory D2-like receptors. However, emerging evidence suggests that striatal cell composition is anatomically and functionally more heterogenous than previously appreciated. The presence of MSNs that co-express multiple DA receptors offers a means to more accurately understand this heterogeneity. To dissect the precise nature of MSN heterogeneity, here we used multiplex RNAscope to identify expression of three predominantly expressed DA receptors in the striatum: DA D1 (D1R), D2 (D2R), and D3 (D3R) receptors. We report heterogenous subpopulations of MSNs that are distinctly distributed across the dorsal-ventral and rostral-caudal axes of the adult mouse striatum. These subpopulations include MSNs that co-express D1R and D2R (D1/2R), D1R and D3R (D1/3R), and D2R and D3R (D2/3R). Overall, our characterization of distinct MSN subpopulations informs our understanding of region-specific striatal cell heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Experimental rat models of stroke and hemorrhage are important tools to investigate cerebrovascular disease pathophysi- ology mechanisms, yet how significant patterns of functional impairment induced in various models of stroke are related to changes in connectivity at the level of neuronal populations and mesoscopic parcellations of rat brains remain unresolved. To address this gap in knowledge, we employed two middle cerebral artery occlusion models and one intracerebral hemorrhage model with variant extent and location of neuronal dysfunction. Motor and spatial memory function was assessed and the level of hippocampal activation via Fos immunohistochemistry. Contribution of connectivity change to functional impairment was analyzed for connection similarities, graph distances and spatial distances as well as the importance of regions in terms of network architecture based on the neuroVIISAS rat connectome. We found that functional impairment correlated with not only the extent but also the locations of the injury among the models. In addition, via coactivation analysis in dynamic rat brain models, we found that lesioned regions led to stronger coactivations with motor function and spatial learning regions than with other unaffected regions of the connectome. Dynamic modeling with the weighted bilateral connectome detected changes in signal propagation in the remote hippocampus in all 3 stroke types, predicting the extent of hippocampal hypoactivation and impairment in spatial learning and memory function. Our study provides a comprehensive analytical framework in predictive identification of remote regions not directly altered by stroke events and their functional implication.",

    "abstract": "Rodent behavioral studies have largely focused on male animals, which has limited the generalizability and conclusions of neuroscience research. Working with humans and rodents, we studied sex effects during interval timing that requires participants to estimate an interval of several seconds by making motor responses. Interval timing requires attention to the passage of time and working memory for temporal rules. We found no differences between human females and males in interval timing response times (timing accuracy) or the coefficient of variance of response times (timing precision). Consistent with prior work, we also found no differences between female and male rodents in timing accuracy or precision. In female rodents, there was no difference in interval timing between estrus and diestrus cycle stages. Because dopamine powerfully affects interval timing, we also examined sex differences with drugs targeting dopaminergic receptors. In both female and male rodents, interval timing was delayed after administration of sulpiride (D2-receptor antagonist), quinpirole (D2-receptor agonist), and SCH-23390 (D1-receptor antagonist). By contrast, after administration of SKF-81297 (D1-receptor agonist), interval timing shifted earlier only in male rodents. These data illuminate sex similarities and differences in interval timing. Our results have relevance for rodent models of both cognitive function and brain disease by increasing represenation in behavioral neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is seen in both neurons and glia in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). Disease progression involves non-cell autonomous interactions among multiple cell types, including neurons, microglia and astrocytes. We investigated the effects in Drosophila of inducible, glial cell type-specific TDP-43 overexpression, a model that causes TDP-43 protein pathology including loss of nuclear TDP-43 and accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions. We report that TDP-43 pathology in Drosophila is sufficient to cause progressive loss of each of the 5 glial sub-types. But the effects on organismal survival were most pronounced when TDP-43 pathology was induced in the perineural glia (PNG) or astrocytes. In the case of PNG, this effect is not attributable to loss of the glial population, because ablation of these glia by expression of pro-apoptotic reaper expression has relatively little impact on survival. To uncover underlying mechanisms, we used cell-type-specific nuclear RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptional changes induced by pathological TDP-43 expression. We identified numerous glial cell-type specific transcriptional changes. Notably, SF2/SRSF1 levels were found to be decreased in both PNG and in astrocytes. We found that further knockdown of SF2/SRSF1 in either PNG or astrocytes lessens the detrimental effects of TDP-43 pathology on lifespan, but extends survival of the glial cells. Thus TDP-43 pathology in astrocytes or PNG causes systemic effects that shorten lifespan and SF2/SRSF1 knockdown rescues the loss of these glia, and also reduces their systemic toxicity to the organism.",

    "abstract": "The underlying biological mechanisms that contribute to the heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) presentation remain poorly understood, highlighting the need for a conceptual framework that can explain this variability and bridge the gap between animal models and clinical endpoints. Here, we hypothesize that comparative analysis of molecular data from different experimental systems of chronic stress and MDD has the potential to provide insight into these mechanisms and address this gap. Thus, we compared transcriptomic profiles of brain tissue from postmortem MDD subjects and from mice exposed to chronic variable stress (CVS) to identify orthologous genes. Ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) were downregulated, and associated RP-pseudogenes were upregulated in both conditions. Analysis across independent cohorts confirmed that this dysregulation was specific to the prefrontal cortex of both species. A seeded gene co-expression analysis using altered RPGs common between the MDD and CVS groups revealed that downregulated RPGs homeostatically regulated the synaptic changes in both groups through a RP-pseudogene-driven mechanism. In-vitro and in-silico analysis further demonstrated that the inverse RPG/RP-pseudogene association was a glucocorticoid-driven endocrine response to stress that was reversed during remission from MDD. This study provides the first evidence that ribosomal dysregulation during stress is a conserved phenotype in human MDD and CVS exposed mouse. Our results establish a foundation for the hypothesis that stress-induced alterations in RPGs and, consequently, ribosomes contribute to the synaptic dysregulation underlying MDD and chronic stress-related mood disorders. We discuss a ribosome-dependent mechanism for the variable presentations of depression and other mood disorders.\n\nSignificance StatementThe presented study highlights the pressing need for a connection between animal models of depression and clinical endpoints. The lack of concordance between these two areas has hindered our understanding of MDDs biological underpinnings. The studys hypothesis that orthologous gene from experimental systems of chronic stress and MDD can bridge this gap is a major advance in this field. The study indicates that dysregulation of ribosomes in the synapse is a common feature in both human MDD and mice exposed to CVS. This dysregulation is a response to endocrine disturbances and is driven by mechanisms that involve pseudogenes. These findings support the hypothesis that stress-induced alterations in RPGs and, consequently, ribosomes may contribute to the variable presentations of depression.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of resting state (rs) neurophysiological dynamics relies on the control of sensory, perceptual, and behavioral environments to minimize variability and rule-out confounding sources of activation during testing conditions. Here, we investigated how temporally-distal environmental inputs, specifically metal exposures experienced up to several months prior to scanning, affect functional dynamics measured using rs functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We implemented an interpretable XGBoost-Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) model that integrated information from multiple exposure biomarkers to predict rs dynamics in typically developing adolescents. In 124 participants (53% females, ages: 13-25 years) enrolled in the Public Health Impact of Metals Exposure (PHIME) study, we measured concentrations of six metals (manganese, lead, chromium, cupper, nickel and zinc) in biological matrices (saliva, hair, fingernails, toenails, blood and urine) and acquired rs-fMRI scans. Using graph theory metrics, we computed global efficiency (GE) in 111 brain areas (Harvard Oxford Atlas). We used a predictive model based on ensemble gradient boosting to predict GE from metal biomarkers, adjusting for age and biological sex. Model performance was evaluated by comparing predicted versus measured GE. SHAP scores were used to evaluate feature importance. Measured versus predicted rs dynamics from our model utilizing chemical exposures as inputs were significantly correlated (p< 0.001, r = 0.36). Lead, chromium, and copper contributed most to the prediction of GE metrics. Our results indicate that a significant component of rs dynamics, comprising approximately 13% of observed variability in GE, is driven by recent metal exposures. These findings emphasize the need to estimate and control for the influence of past and current chemical exposures in the assessment and analysis of rs functional connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Hilar mossy cells (MCs) are principal excitatory neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) that play critical roles in hippocampal function and have been implicated in brain disorders such as anxiety and epilepsy. However, the mechanisms by which MCs contribute to DG function and disease are poorly understood. Expression from the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) gene (Drd2) promoter is a defining feature of MCs, and previous work indicates a key role for dopaminergic signaling in the DG. Additionally, the involvement of D2R signaling in cognition and neuropsychiatric conditions is well-known. Surprisingly, though, the function of MC D2Rs remain largely unexplored. In this study, we show that selective and conditional removal of Drd2 from MCs of adult mice impaired spatial memory, promoted anxiety-like behavior and was proconvulsant. To determine the subcellular expression of D2Rs in MCs, we used a D2R knockin mouse which revealed that D2Rs are enriched in the inner molecular layer of the DG, where MCs establish synaptic contacts with granule cells. D2R activation by exogenous and endogenous dopamine reduced MC to dentate granule cells (GC) synaptic transmission, most likely by a presynaptic mechanism. In contrast, removing Drd2 from MCs had no significant impact on MC excitatory inputs and passive and active properties. Our findings support that MC D2Rs are essential for proper DG function by reducing MC excitatory drive onto GCs. Lastly, impairment of MC D2R signaling could promote anxiety and epilepsy, therefore highlighting a potential therapeutic target.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEGrowing evidence indicates that hilar mossy cells (MCs) of the dentate gyrus play critical but incompletely understood roles in memory and brain disorders, including anxiety and epilepsy. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), implicated in cognition and several psychiatric and neurological disorders, are considered to be characteristically expressed by MCs. Still, the subcellular localization and function of MC D2Rs are largely unknown. We report that removing the Drd2 gene specifically from MCs of adult mice impaired spatial memory and was anxiogenic and proconvulsant. We also found that D2Rs are enriched where MCs synaptically contact dentate granule cells (GC) and reduce MC-GC transmission. This work uncovered the functional significance of MC D2Rs, thus highlighting their therapeutic potential in D2R- and MC-associated pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the wide adoption of wastewater surveillance, more research is needed to understand the fate and transport of viral genetic markers in wastewater. This information is essential for the interpretation of wastewater surveillance data and the development of mechanistic models that link wastewater measurements to the number of individuals shedding virus. In this study, we examined the solid-liquid partitioning behavior of four viruses in wastewater: SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and F+ coliphage/MS2. We used two approaches to achieve this: we (1) conducted laboratory partitioning experiments using lab-grown viruses and (2) examined the distribution of endogenous viruses in wastewater. Partition experiments were conducted at 4{degrees}C and 22{degrees}C; wastewater samples were spiked with varying concentrations of each virus and stored for three hours to allow the system to equilibrate. Solids and liquids were separated via centrifugation and viral RNA concentrations were quantified using reverse-transcription-digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR). For the distribution experiment, wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater treatment plants and processed without spiking exogenous viruses; viral RNA concentrations were measured in wastewater solids and liquid. Overall, RNA concentrations were higher in solids than the liquid fraction of wastewater by approximately 3-4 orders of magnitude. Partition coefficients (KF) from laboratory experiments were determined using the Freundlich model and ranged from 2,000-270,000 ml{middle dot}g-1 across viruses and temperature conditions. Distribution coefficients (Kd) determined from endogenous wastewater viruses were consistent with results from laboratory experiments.Further research is needed to understand how virus and wastewater characteristics might influence the partition of viral genetic markers in wastewater.\n\nSynopsisWe examined the solid-liquid partitioning behavior of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, RV, and F+coliphage/MS2 RNA in wastewater influent.

    "abstract": "Protein fold adaptation to novel enzymatic reactions is a fundamental evolutionary process. Cofactor-independent oxygenases degrading N-heteroaromatic substrates belong to the /{beta}-hydrolase (ABH) fold superfamily that typically does not catalyze oxygenation reactions. Here, we have integrated crystallographic analyses at normoxic and hyperoxic conditions with molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical calculations to investigate its prototypic 1-H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase (HOD) member. O2 localization to the \"oxyanion hole\", where catalysis occurs, is an unfavorable event and the direct competition between dioxygen and water for this site is modulated by the \"nucleophilic elbow\" residue. A hydrophobic pocket that overlaps with the organic substrate binding site can act as a proximal dioxygen reservoir. Freeze-trap pressurization allowed to determine the structure of the ternary complex with a substrate analogue and O2 bound at the oxyanion hole. Theoretical calculations reveal that O2 orientation is coupled to the charge of the bound organic ligand. When 1-H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine is uncharged, O2 binds with its molecular axis along the ligands C2-C4 direction in full agreement with the crystal structure. Substrate activation triggered by deprotonation of its 3-OH group by the His-Asp dyad, rotates O2 by approximately 60 degrees. This geometry maximizes the charge-transfer between the substrate and O2 thus weakening the double bond of the latter. Electron density transfer to the O2({pi}*) orbital promotes the formation of the peroxide intermediate via intersystem crossing that is rate-determining. Our work provides a detailed picture of how evolution has repurposed the ABH-fold architecture and its simple catalytic machinery to accomplish metal-independent oxygenation.\n\nSignificanceMany of the current O2-dependent enzymes have evolved from classes that existed prior to the switch from a reducing to an oxidative atmosphere and whose original functions are unrelated to dioxygen chemistry. A group of bacterial dioxygenases belong to the /{beta}-hydrolase (ABH) fold superfamily that typically does not catalyze oxygenation reactions. These enzymes degrade their N-heteroaromatic substrates in a cofactor-independent manner relying only on the simple nucleophile-histidine-acid ABH-fold catalytic toolbox. In this work we show how O2 localizes at the catalytic site by taking advantage of multiple strategies that minimize the strong competition by water, the co-substrate in the ancestral hydrolytic enzyme. We also show that substrate activation by the His-Asp catalytic dyad leads a ligand-O2 complex that maximizes the electron transfer from the organic substrate to O2, thus promoting intersystem crossing and circumventing the spin-forbiddeness of the reaction. Overall, our work explains how evolution has repurposed the ABH-fold architecture and its simple catalytic machinery to accomplish spin-restricted metal-independent oxygenation.",

    "abstract": "1 Mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) is an ultra-rare, recessively inherited lysosomal disorder resulting from inactivating mutations in MCOLN1, the gene encoding the lysosomal cation channel TRPML1. The disease primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS) and manifests in the first year with cognitive and motor developmental delay, followed by a gradual decline in neurological function across the second decade of life, blindness, and premature death in third or fourth decades. Brain pathology manifestations in MLIV are consistent with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy with brain iron accumulation. Presently, there are no approved or investigational therapies for MLIV, and pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. The MLIV mouse model, Mcoln1-/- mice, recapitulates all major manifestations of the human disease. Here, to better understand the pathological mechanisms in the MLIV brain, we performed cell type specific LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis in the MLIV mouse model and reconstituted molecular signatures of the disease in either freshly isolated populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neural stem cells, or whole tissue cortical homogenates from young adult symptomatic Mcoln1-/- mice. Our analysis confirmed on the molecular level major histopathological hallmarks of MLIV universally present in Mcoln1-/- tissue and brain cells, such as hypomyelination, lysosomal dysregulation, and impaired metabolism of lipids and polysaccharides. Importantly, pathway analysis in brain cells revealed mitochondria-related alterations in all Mcoln1-/- brain cells, except oligodendrocytes, that was not possible to resolve in whole tissue. We also report unique proteome signatures and dysregulated pathways for each brain cell population used in this study. These data shed new light on cell-intrinsic mechanisms of MLIV and provide new insights for biomarker discovery and validation to advance translational studies for this disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe availability of reliable biomarkers of Parkinsons disease (PD) progression is critical to the understanding of the disease and development of treatment options. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a promising source of PD biomarkers, however, neuroimaging results have been shown to be markedly sensitive to analytical conditions and population sampling, which motivates investigations of their robustness. This study is part of a project to investigate the replicability of 11 structural MRI measures of PD identified in a recent review.\n\nObjectiveThis paper attempts to reproduce (similar data, similar analysis) and replicate (variations in data and analysis) the design of the machine learning (ML) model described in [1] to predict PD progression from T1-weighted MRIs.\n\nMethodsWe used the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org) used in [1] and we followed as closely as possible the original methods. We also investigated slight methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction, ML model design, and evaluation techniques.\n\nResultsThe Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) achieved by our model closely reproducing the original study remained lower than 0.5. Across all tested models, we obtained a peak AUC of 0.685, which is better than chance performance but remained lower than the AUC value of 0.795 reported in [1].\n\nConclusionWe managed to train a model that predicts disease progression with a performance better than chance on a cohort extracted from the PPMI dataset, using methods adapted from [1]. However, the performance of this model remains substantially lower than the one reported in [1]. Our difficulties to reproduce or replicate the original work are likely explained by the relatively low sample size in the original study. We provide recommendations on how to improve the reproducibility of MRI-based ML models of PD in the future.",

As G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels rule synaptic plasticity that supports hippocampal-dependent memory, here we assessed their unknown role in hippocampal oscillatory activity in relation to synaptic plasticity induction.\n\nIn alert male mice, pharmacological GIRK modulation did not alter neural oscillations before long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. However, after an LTP generating protocol, both gain- and loss-of basal GIRK activity transformed LTP into long-term depression, but only specific suppression of constitutive GIRK activity caused a disruption of network synchronization ({delta}, , {gamma} bands), even leading to long-lasting ripples and fast ripples pathological oscillations.\n\nTogether, our data showed that constitutive GIRK activity plays a key role in the tuning mechanism of hippocampal oscillatory activity during long-term synaptic plasticity processes that underlies hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to fungicides is a global challenge as target proteins under selection can evolve rapidly, reducing fungicide efficacy. To manage resistance, detection technologies must be fast and flexible enough to cope with a rapidly increasing number of mutations. The most important agricultural fungicides are azoles that target the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51). Mutations associated with azole resistance in the Cyp51 promoter and coding sequence can co-occur in the same allele at different positions and codons, increasing the complexity of resistance detection. Resistance mutations arise rapidly and cannot be detected using traditional amplification-based methods if they are not known. To capture the complexity of azole resistance in two net blotch pathogens of barley we used the Oxford Nanopore MinION to sequence the promoter and coding sequence of Cyp51A. This approach detected all currently known mutations from biologically complex samples increasing the simplicity of resistance detection as multiple alleles can be profiled in a single assay. With the mobility and decreasing cost of long read sequencing, we demonstrate this approach is broadly applicable for characterizing resistance within known agrochemical target sites.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are polyphenolic phytochemicals abundant in plant-based, health-promoting foods. They are only partially absorbed in the small intestine, and gut microbiota plays a significant role in their metabolism. As flavonoids are not natural substrates of gut bacterial enzymes, reactions of flavonoid metabolism have been attributed to the ability of general classes of enzymes to metabolize non-natural substrates. To systematically characterize this promiscuous enzyme activity, we developed a prediction tool that is based on chemical reaction similarity. The tool takes a list of enzymes or organisms to match microbial enzymes with their non-native flavonoid substrates and orphan reactions. We successfully predicted the promiscuous activity of known flavonoid-metabolizing bacterial and plant enzymes.\n\nNext, we used this tool to identify the multiple taxa required to catalyze an entire metabolic pathway of dietary flavonoids. Tilianin is a flavonoid-O-glycoside having biological and pharmacological activities, including neuroprotection. Using our prediction tool, we defined a novel bacterial pathway of tilianin metabolism that includes O-deglycosylation to acacetin, demethylation of acacetin to apigenin, and hydrogenation of apigenin to naringenin. We predicted and confirmed using in vitro experiments and LC-MS techniques that Bifidobacterium longum subsp. animalis, Blautia coccoides and Flavonifractor plautii can catalyze this pathway. Prospectively, the prediction-validation methodology developed in this work could be used to systematically characterize gut microbial metabolism of dietary flavonoids and other phytochemicals.\n\nThe bioactivities of flavonoids and their metabolic products can vary widely. We used an in vitro rat neuronal model to show that tilianin metabolites exhibit protective effect against H2O2 through reactive oxygen species (Delepine et al.) scavenging activity and thus, improve cell viability, while the parent compound, tilianin, was ineffective. These results are important to understand the gut microbiota-dependent physiological effects of dietary flavonoids.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens that are known to cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae that has gained attention due to its global dissemination and its ability to cause invasive infections in community settings amongst immunocompetent individuals as well as its increasing levels of antibiotic resistance. Our study reports the first complete genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae provided valuable insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates belonged to emerging lineages with pathogenic potential, with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. Potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS could pose a putative risk to the immunocompromised crew. The presence of MGEs containing virulent loci could facilitate horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, potentially increasing their virulence. In addition, genetic divergence from their respective lineages for some Klebsiella genomes was predicted and hypothesized to be due to the unique spaceflight environmental pressures. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring problematic microbial communities in space to understand their surviving abilities and potential impact on human health.\n\nImportanceThe International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed environment that poses environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation While the adaptability of bacteria during spaceflight is not fully understood, recent research has suggested that it may be species and even clone specific. Given the spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, it is essential to understand the genomics of potential human pathogens in spaceflight. Such understanding could provide valuable insights into species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological importance. Here, we used hybrid assembly approaches and comparative genomics to provide the first comprehensive genomic characterisation of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our findings revealed that K. quasipneumoniae ST138 exhibits spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, with evidence of genomic divergence from the ST138 lineage on Earth. Additionally, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which encoded disinfectant and thermoresistance genes suggesting that these might aid adaptability. Furthermore, we identified an MGE containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the \"high risk\" ST101 clone. Our work provides valuable insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the behaviour of potential pathogenic bacteria in space.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids in variable positions of proteins may be correlated, with potential structural and functional implications. Here, we apply exact tests of independence in R x C contingency tables to examine noise-free associations between variable positions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, using as a paradigm sequences from Greece deposited in GISAID (N=6,683/1,078 full-length) for the period February 29, 2020 to April 26, 2021 that essentially covers the first three pandemic waves. We examine the fate and complexity of these associations by network analysis, using associated positions (exact p[&le;]0.001 and Average Product Correction [&ge;]2) as links and the corresponding positions as nodes . We found a temporal linear increase of positional differences and a gradual expansion of the number of position associations over time, represented by a temporally evolving intricate web, resulting in a non-random complex network of 69 nodes and 252 links. Overconnected nodes corresponded to the most adapted variant positions in the population, suggesting a direct relation between network degree and position functional importance. Modular analysis revealed 25 k-cliques comprising three to 11 nodes. At different k- clique resolutions, one to four communities were formed, capturing epistatic associations of circulating variants (Alpha, Beta, B.1.1.318), but also Delta, which dominated the evolutionary landscape later in the pandemic. Cliques of aminoacidic positional associations tended to occur in single sequences, enabling the recognition of epistatic positions in real-world virus populations. Our findings provide a novel way of understanding epistatic relationships in viral proteins with potential applications in the design of virus control procedures.\n\nImportancePaired positional associations of adapted amino acids in virus proteins may provide new insights for understanding virus evolution and variant formation. We investigated potential intramolecular relationships between variable SARS-CoV-2 spike positions by exact tests of independence in R x C contingency tables, having applied Average Product Correction (APC) to eliminate background noise. Associated positions (exact p[&le;]0.001 and APC[&ge;]2) formed a non- random, epistatic network of 25 cliques and 1-4 communities at different clique resolutions, revealing evolutionary ties between variable positions of circulating variants, and a predictive potential of previously unknown network positions. Cliques of different sizes represented theoretical combinations of changing residues in sequence space, allowing the identification of significant aminoacidic combinations in single sequences of real-world populations. Our analytic approach that links network structural aspects to mutational aminoacidic combinations in the spike sequence population offers a novel way to understand virus epidemiology and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the population dynamics of an infectious disease requires linking within-host dynamics and between-host transmission in a quantitative manner, but this is seldom done in practice. Here a simple phenomenological model for viral dynamics within a host is linked to between-host transmission by assuming that the probability of transmission is related to log viral titre. Data from transmission experiments for two viral diseases of livestock, foot-and- mouth disease virus in cattle and swine influenza virus in pigs, are used to parameterise the model and, importantly, test the underlying assumptions. The model allows the relationship between within-host parameters and transmission to be determined explicitly through their influence on the individual reproduction number and generation time. Furthermore, these critical within-host parameters (time and level of peak titre, viral growth and clearance rates) can be computed from more complex within-host models, raising the possibility of assessing the impact of within-host processes on between-host transmission in a more detailed quantitative manner.\n\nAuthor summaryFor a pathogen to be able to transmit between hosts it must replicate to a sufficiently high level within an infected host. Because of this linking the dynamics of a pathogen within a host to transmission between hosts is important for understanding an infectious disease and its control. In this study I develop a simple mathematical model for the within-host dynamics and combine it with a model relating the probability of transmission to the level of the pathogen. I use the model derive explicit relationships between parameters related to the within-host dynamics, such as viral growth and clearance rates, and summary transmission measures, such as the reproduction number and generation time. I test the assumptions in the underlying model and estimate parameters using data from transmission experiments for two important viral diseases, foot-and-mouth disease virus in cattle and swine influenza virus in pigs. Identifying the critical within host parameters that influence transmission allows the impact of within-host processes on between-host transmission to be investigated in a more detailed quantitative manner.",

    "abstract": "Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) in yeast drives the basal transcription of key proteostasis factors and its activity is induced as part of the core heat shock response. Exploring Hsf1 specific functions has been challenging due to the essential nature of the HSF1 gene and the extensive overlap of target promoters with environmental stress response (ESR) transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 (Msn2/4). In this study, we constructed a viable hsf1{Delta} strain by replacing the HSF1 open reading frame with genes that constitutively express Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90 from Hsf1-independent promoters. Phenotypic analysis showed that the hsf1{Delta} strain grow slowly, is sensitive to heat as well as protein misfolding and accumulates protein aggregates. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the transcriptional response to protein misfolding induced by azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is fully dependent of Hsf1. In contrast, the hsf1{Delta} strain responded to heat shock through the ESR. Following HS, Hsf1 and Msn2/4 showed functional compensatory induction with stronger activation of the remaining stress pathway when the other branch was inactivated. Thus, we provide a long overdue genetic test of the function of Hsf1 in yeast using the novel hsf1{Delta} construct. Our data highlight that the accumulation of misfolded proteins is uniquely sensed by Hsf1-Hsp70 chaperone titration inducing a highly selective transcriptional stress response.",

Fortunately, the field of biomaterials is constantly evolving and has a central role to play in the development of new technologies for conducting hypoxia-related research in several aspects of biomedical research, including tissue engineering, cancer modeling, and modern drug screening. In this perspective, we provide an overview of several strategies that have been investigated in the design and implementation of biomaterials for simulating or inducing hypoxic conditions--a prerequisite in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a master regulator of the cellular responses to low oxygen. To this end, we discuss various advanced biomaterials, from those that integrate hypoxia-mimetic agents to artificially induce hypoxia-like responses, to those that deplete oxygen and consequently create either transient (< 1 day) or sustained (> 1 day) hypoxic conditions. We also aim to highlight the advantages and limitations of these emerging biomaterials for biomedical applications, with an emphasis on cancer research.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genes are interrupted by introns that are removed from transcribed RNAs by splicing. The extent of alternative splicing is the best genomic predictor of developmental complexity, yet it is unclear what mediates change in patterns of splicing complexity between species. Here we show that variation in 5 splice site sequence preferences correlate with the presence of the U6 snRNA methyltransferase METTL16 and the splicing factor SNRNP27K. We used inter-species association mapping with Saccharomycotina species to correlate splicing phenotypes with the presence or absence of splicing factors. The greatest variation in 5 splice site sequence occurred at the +4 position and involved a preference switch between adenosine and uridine. Loss of METTL16 and SNRNP27K orthologs, or a single SNRNP27K methionine residue, was associated with a preference for +4U. These findings are consistent with splicing analyses of mutants defective in either METTL16 or SNRNP27K orthologs and models derived from spliceosome structures, demonstrating that inter-species association mapping is a powerful orthogonal approach to molecular studies. We conclude that variation in concerted processes of 5 splice site selection by U6 snRNA is crucial to evolutionary change in splicing complexity.",

    "abstract": "Safety learning is a critical function for behavioral adaptation, environmental fitness, and mental health. Animal models have implicated the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in safety learning. However, whether these regions differentially contribute to safety learning and how their contributions become affected by stress still remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated these issues using a novel semi-naturalistic mouse model for threat and safety learning. As mice navigated within a test arena, they learned that specific zones were associated with either noxious cold temperatures (\"threat\") or pleasant warm temperatures (\"safety\"). Optogenetic-mediated inhibition revealed critical roles for the IL and PL regions for selectively controlling safety learning during these naturalistic conditions. This form of safety learning was also highly susceptible to stress pre-exposure, and while IL inhibition mimicked the deficits produced by stress, PL inhibition fully rescued safety learning in stress-exposed mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that IL and PL bidirectionally regulate safety learning during naturalistic situations, with the IL region promoting this function and the PL region suppressing it, especially after stress. A model of balanced IL and PL activity is proposed as a fundamental mechanism for controlling safety learning.\n\nVisual Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=51 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539516v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b7bd5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f06849org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14e9848org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@efc491_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The insula is a portion of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus covered by the overlying opercula of the inferior frontal lobe and superior portion of the temporal lobe. The insula has been parsed into sub-regions based upon cytoarchitectonics and structural and functional connectivity with multiple lines of evidence supporting specific roles for each of these sub-regions in pain processing and interoception. In the past, causal interrogation of the insula was only possible in patients with surgically implanted electrodes. Here, we leverage the high spatial resolution combined with the deep penetration depth of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) to non-surgically modulate either the anterior insula (AI) or posterior insula (PI) in humans for effect on subjective pain ratings, electroencephalographic (EEG) contact head evoked potentials (CHEPs) and time-frequency power as well as autonomic measures including heart-rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal response (EDR). N = 23 healthy volunteers received brief noxious heat pain stimuli to the dorsum of their right hand during continuous heart-rate, EDR and EEG recording. LIFU was delivered to either the AI (anterior short gyrus), PI (posterior longus gyrus) or under an inert sham condition time-locked to the heat stimulus. Results demonstrate that single-element 500 kHz LIFU is capable of individually targeting specific gyri of the insula. LIFU to both AI and PI similarly reduced perceived pain ratings but had differential effects on EEG activity. LIFU to PI affected earlier EEG amplitudes around 300 milliseconds whereas LIFU to AI affected EEG amplitudes around 500 milliseconds. In addition, only LIFU to the AI affected HRV as indexed by an increase in standard deviation of N-N intervals (SDNN) and mean HRV low frequency power. There was no effect of LIFU to either AI or PI on EDR or blood pressure. Taken together, LIFU looks to be an effective method to individually target sub-regions of the insula in humans for site-specific effects on brain biomarkers of pain processing and autonomic reactivity that translates to reduced perceived pain to a transient heat stimulus. These data have implications for the treatment of chronic pain and several neuropsychological diseases like anxiety, depression and addiction that all demonstrate abnormal activity in the insula concomitant with dysregulated autonomic function.",

    "abstract": "Shigella is the second leading cause of diarrheal disease-related death in young children in low and middle income countries. The mechanism of protection against shigella infection and disease in endemic areas is uncertain. While historically LPS-specific IgG titers have been associated with protection in endemic settings, emerging deeper immune approaches have recently elucidated a protective role for IpaB-specific antibody responses in a controlled human challenge model in North American volunteers. To deeply interrogate potential correlates of immunity in areas endemic for shigellosis, here we applied a systems approach to analyze the serological response to shigella across endemic and non-endemic populations. Additionally, we analyzed shigella-specific antibody responses over time in the context of endemic resistance or breakthrough infections in a high shigella burden location. Individuals with endemic exposure to shigella possessed broad and functional antibody responses across both glycolipid and protein antigens compared to individuals from non-endemic regions. In high shigella burden settings, elevated levels of OSP-specific FcR binding antibodies were associated with resistance to shigellosis. OSP-specific FcR binding IgA found in resistant individuals activated bactericidal neutrophil functions including phagocytosis, degranulation and reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, IgA depletion from resistant serum significantly reduced binding of OSP-specific antibodies to FcR and antibody mediated activation of neutrophils and monocytes. Overall, our findings suggest that OSP-specific functional IgA responses contribute to protective immunity against shigella infection in high-burden settings. These findings will assist in the development and evaluation of shigella vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan (PG) layer is a mesh-like structure within the cell envelope essential for maintenance of cell shape and resistance to osmotic stress, and therefore is a primary target of many important and widely used antibiotics, such as {beta}-lactams. In Gram-negative bacteria, while signal transduction systems that monitor the state of the inner- and outer-membranes have been extensively studied and well understood, much less is known about how cells sense and respond to PG-targeting stresses. Here we show that a novel bacterial two-component system (PghKR) from Shewanella oneidensis is capable of sensing and responding to PG damage. This system is specifically activated in cells exposed to various PG-targeting antibiotics or carrying a defect in PG synthesis, resulting in induced expression of blaA and relV, which encode a {beta}-lactamase conferring resistance to {beta}-lactams and a small ppGpp synthetase responsible for antibiotic tolerance, respectively. Intriguingly, the PghKR homologs are widespread among several classes of Proteobacteria and the periplasmic domain of sensor kinase PghK contains a family 9 carbohydrate-binding module that is required for signal perception, implying that the signals could be the glycan fragments of PG. Overall, our results provide critical insights into the regulation of PG homeostasis in Gram-negative bacteria.",

This process is essential for facilitating enhancer communication and establishing cellular identity. However, how DNA sequence and transcription factor (TF) binding instruct the formation of such high RF environments is still poorly understood. To address this, we developed a novel approach leveraging enhancer-centric chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs) to nominate RF clusters genome-wide. By analyzing TF binding signatures within the context of caQTLs, we discovered a new class of TFs that specifically contributes to establishing cooperative environments. These \"context-only\" TFs bind promiscuously with cell type-specific pioneers, recruit coactivators, and, like super enhancers, render downstream gene expression sensitive to condensate-disrupting molecules. We further demonstrate that joint context-only and pioneer TF binding explains enhancer compatibility and provides a mechanistic rationale for how a loose TF syntax can still confer regulatory specificity.",

FAM237B (also known as NPGM) is a paralog of FAM237A that was previously reported as a weak agonist for GPR83 with approximately 100-fold lower activity in an inositol 1-phosphate accumulation assay. In the present study, we prepared mature human FAM237B via an intein-fusion approach and measured its activity towards human GPR83 via a NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT)-based ligand{square}receptor binding assay and a NanoBiT-based {beta}-arrestin recruitment assay. Mature FAM237B displayed moderately lower activity than its paralog FAM237A in these binding and activation assays, but could cause a significant activation effect at the nanomolar range (1{square}10 nM).

Thus, acquiring atomic-level ensemble models that accurately represent conformational heterogeneity is vital to deepen our understanding of how proteins work. Modeling ensemble information from X-ray diffraction data has been challenging, as traditional cryo-crystallography restricts conformational variability while minimizing radiation damage. Recent advances have enabled the collection of high quality diffraction data at ambient temperatures, revealing innate conformational heterogeneity and temperature-driven changes. Here, we used diffraction datasets for Proteinase K collected at temperatures ranging from 313 to 363K to provide a tutorial for the refinement of multiconformer ensemble models. Integrating automated sampling and refinement tools with manual adjustments, we obtained multiconformer models that describe alternative backbone and sidechain conformations, their relative occupancies, and interconnections between conformers. Our models revealed extensive and diverse conformational changes across temperature, including increased bound peptide ligand occupancies, different Ca2+ binding site configurations and altered rotameric distributions. These insights emphasize the value and need for multiconformer model refinement to extract ensemble information from diffraction data and to understand ensemble-function relationships.",

    "abstract": "The nutrient status of the tumor microenvironment has major impacts on cell growth. Under nutrient depletion, asparagine synthetase (ASNS)-mediated asparagine production increases to sustain cell survival. G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) signaling converges via cAMP/PI3K/AKT with KRAS signaling to regulate ASNS expression. However, the role of GPER1 in CRC progression is still debated, and the effect of nutrient supply on both ASNS and GPER1 relative to KRAS genotype is not well understood. Here, we modeled a restricted nutrient supply by eliminating glutamine from growing cancer cells in a 3D spheroid model of human female SW48 KRAS wild-type (WT) and KRAS G12A mutant (MT) CRC cells, to examine effects on ASNS and GPER1 expression. Glutamine depletion significantly inhibited cell growth in both KRAS MT and WT cells; however, ASNS and GPER1 were upregulated in KRAS MT compared to WT cells. When nutrient supply was adequate, ASNS and GPER1 were not altered between cell lines. The impact of estradiol, a ligand for GPER1, was examined for any additional effects on cell growth. Under glutamine deplete conditions, estradiol decreased the growth of KRAS WT cells but had no effect on KRAS MT cells; estradiol had no additive or diminutive effect on the upregulation of ASNS or GPER1 between the cell lines. We further examined the association of GPER1 and ASNS levels with overall survival in a clinical colon cancer cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Both high GPER1 and ASNS expression associated with poorer overall survival for females only in advanced stage tumors. These findings suggest that KRAS MT cells have mechanisms in place that respond to decreased nutrient supply, typically observed in advanced tumors, by increasing the expression of ASNS and GPER1 to drive cell growth. Furthermore, KRAS MT cells are resistant to the protective effects of estradiol under nutrient deplete conditions. ASNS and GPER1 may therefore be potential therapeutic targets that can be exploited to manage and control KRAS MT CRC.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder affecting brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) are associated with [~]20% of inherited and 1-2% of sporadic ALS cases. Much has been learned from mice expressing transgenic copies of mutant SOD1, which typically involve high-level transgene expression, thereby differing from ALS patients expressing one mutant gene copy. To generate a model that more closely represents patient gene expression, we created a knock-in point mutation (G85R, a human ALS-causing mutation) in the endogenous mouse Sod1 gene, leading to mutant SOD1G85R protein expression. Heterozygous Sod1G85R mutant mice resemble wild type, whereas homozygous mutants have reduced body weight and lifespan, a mild neurodegenerative phenotype, and express very low mutant SOD1 protein levels with no detectable SOD1 activity. Homozygous mutants exhibit partial neuromuscular junction denervation at 3-4 months of age. Spinal cord motor neuron transcriptome analyses of homozygous Sod1G85R mice revealed up-regulation of cholesterol synthesis pathway genes compared to wild type. Transcriptome and phenotypic features of these mice are similar to Sod1 knock-out mice, suggesting the Sod1G85R phenotype is largely driven by loss of SOD1 function. By contrast, cholesterol synthesis genes are down-regulated in severely affected human TgSOD1G93A transgenic mice at 4 months. Our analyses implicate dysregulation of cholesterol or related lipid pathway genes in ALS pathogenesis. The Sod1G85R knock-in mouse is a useful ALS model to examine the importance of SOD1 activity in control of cholesterol homeostasis and motor neuron survival.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating disease involving the progressive loss of motor neurons and motor function for which there is currently no cure. Understanding biological mechanisms leading to motor neuron death is critical for developing new treatments. Using a new knock-in mutant mouse model carrying a Sod1 mutation that causes ALS in patients, and in the mouse, causes a limited neurodegenerative phenotype similar to Sod1 loss-of-function, we show that cholesterol synthesis pathway genes are up-regulated in mutant motor neurons, whereas the same genes are down-regulated in transgenic SOD1 mice with a severe phenotype. Our data implicate dysregulation of cholesterol or other related lipid genes in ALS pathogenesis and provide new insights that could contribute to strategies for disease intervention.",
