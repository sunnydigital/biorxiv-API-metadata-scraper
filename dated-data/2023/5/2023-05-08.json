    "abstract": "The B-cell receptor (BCR) is essential for B-cell development and a crucial clinical target in immuno-oncology. However, therapeutic success against the BCR and downstream signaling pathways is hampered by enhanced NF-{kappa}B activation as a resistance mechanism. Using a multiomic approach, we discover the c-REL proto-oncogenic subunit of the NF-{kappa}B family as a key transcription factor regulating BCR subunit levels in B-cell lymphoma. Subsequent ChIP- seq, cell biology experiments, and patient data analysis reveal that OTUD4 is a critical deubiquitinase for inhibiting proteasomal degradation of c-REL and for stabilizing a multi-loop positive feedback of NF-{kappa}B to the BCR pathway. Remarkably, OTUD4 downregulation destabilizes c-REL and BCR levels and inhibits cell growth of B cell lymphoma. Thus, we shed light on the malignant potential of c-REL abundance, identify a positive feedback from c-REL to upstream BCR and present OTUD4 as a vulnerability to synergistically target NF-{kappa}B and BCR pathways in B-cell lymphoid malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the use of several drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes, many patients are unable to reach their target fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels. SGLT1 is the major intestinal transport transmembrane protein which functions in uptake of dietary glucose. If we antagonise the binding of dietary glucose to this transport protein, it is expected that blood glucose lowering will follow. We designed specific inhibitory avian antibodies (IgY) against the extracellular glucose binding domain of SGLT1 and tested their potential in glucose lowering. We demonstrate here the antibodies block uptake of glucose and improve the glycemic profile in vivo and represent a novel approach to inhibiting dietary glucose absorption as treatment for diabetes.",

    "abstract": "While the proteome of an organism is largely determined by the genome, the lipidome is shaped by a poorly understood interplay of environmental factors and metabolic processes. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the impacts of dietary lipid manipulations on the ocular proteome of Drosophila melanogaster. We manipulated the lipidome with synthetic food media that differed in the supplementation of an equal amount of saturated or polyunsaturated triacylglycerols. This allowed us to generate flies whose eyes had a highly contrasting length and unsaturation of glycerophospholipids, the major lipid class of biological membranes, while the abundance of other membrane lipid classes remained unchanged. By bioinformatically comparing the resulting ocular proteomic trends and contrasting them with the impacts of vitamin A deficiency, we identified ocular proteins whose abundances are differentially affected by lipid saturation and unsaturation. For instance, we unexpectedly identified a group of proteins that have muscle-related functions and increase their abundances in the eye upon lipidome unsaturation but are unaffected by lipidome saturation. Moreover, we identified two differentially lipid-responsive proteins involved in stress responses, Turandot A and Smg5, whose abundances decrease with lipid unsaturation. Lastly, we discovered that the ocular lipid class composition is robust to dietary changes and propose that this may be a general homeostatic feature of the organization of eukaryotic tissues, while the length and unsaturation of fatty acid moieties is more variable to compensate environmental challenges. We anticipate that these insights into the molecular responses of the Drosophila eye proteome to specific lipid manipulations will guide the genetic dissection of the mechanisms that maintain visual function when the eye is exposed to dietary challenges.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are potentially valuable for many of the challenges associated with MRS data. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the AGNOSTIC dataset, which contains 259,200 synthetic 1H MRS examples for training and testing neural networks. AGNOSTIC was intended to be acquisition-agnostic by using 270 basis sets that were simulated across 18 field strengths, 15 echo times, and a range of dwell times. The synthetic examples were produced to resemble healthy and clinical in vivo brain data with combinations of metabolite, macromolecule, residual water signals, and noise. To demonstrate the utility, we apply AGNOSTIC to train two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address out-of-voxel (OOV) echoes. A Detection Network was trained to identify the point-wise presence of OOV echoes, providing proof of concept for real-time detection. A Prediction Network was trained to reconstruct OOV echoes, allowing subtraction during post-processing. Complex OOV signals were mixed into 85% of synthetic examples to train two separate CNNs for the detection and prediction of OOV signals. AGNOSTIC is available through Dryad and all Python 3 code is available through GitHub. The Detection network was shown to perform well, identifying 95% of OOV echoes. Traditional modeling of these detected OOV signals was evaluated and may prove to be an effective method during linear-combination modeling. The Prediction Network greatly reduces OOV echoes within FIDs and achieved a median log10 normed-MSE of -1.79, an improvement of almost two orders of magnitude.",

Using genetic, anatomical, and behavioral analyses, we discovered a subset of highly lateralized vagal sensory neurons with distinct sensory responses to intestinal stimuli. Our results demonstrated that left vagal sensory neurons (LNG) are crucial for distension-induced satiety, while right vagal sensory neurons (RNG) mediate preference for nutritive foods. Furthermore, these lateralized neurons engage different central circuits, with LNG neurons recruiting brain regions associated with energy balance and RNG neurons activating areas related to salience, memory, and reward. Altogether, our findings unveil the diverse roles of asymmetrical gut-vagal-brain circuits in feeding behavior, offering new insights for potential therapeutic interventions targeting vagal nerve stimulation in metabolic and neuropsychiatric diseases.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLateralized gut-brain circuits respond to different sensory modalities and control distinct feeding behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The brain can learn to generate actions, such as reaching to a target, using different movement strategies. Understanding how different variables bias which strategies are learned to produce such a reach is important for our understanding of the neural bases of movement. Here we introduce a novel spatial forelimb target task in which perched head-fixed mice learn to reach to a circular target area from a set start position using a joystick. These reaches can be achieved by learning to move into a specific direction or to a specific endpoint location. We find that mice gradually learn to successfully reach the covert target. With time, they refine their initially exploratory complex joystick trajectories into controlled targeted reaches. The execution of these controlled reaches depends on the sensorimotor cortex. Using a probe test with shifting start positions, we show that individual mice learned to use strategies biased to either direction or endpoint-based movements. The degree of endpoint learning bias was correlated with the spatial directional variability with which the workspace was explored early in training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning model agents exhibit a similar correlation between directional variability during training and learned strategy. These results provide evidence that individual exploratory behavior during training biases the control strategies that mice use to perform forelimb covert target reaches.",

The approach is based on the recent discovery of discrete complex analysis on a triangular lattice, which allows constructing discrete epitomes of complex-analytic functions and making use of their inherent ability to attain maximal values at the boundaries of generic lattice domains. As it turns out, certain elements of the discrete-complex framework readily appear in the oscillatory models of grid cells. We demonstrate that these models can extend further, producing cells that increase their activity towards the frontiers of the navigated environments. We also construct a network model of neurons with border-bound firing that conforms with the oscillatory models.",

    "abstract": "Our muscles are the primary means through which we affect the external world, and the sense of agency (SoA) over the action through those muscles is fundamental to our self-awareness. However, SoA research to date has focused almost exclusively on agency over action outcomes rather than over the musculature itself, as it was believed that SoA over the musculature could not be manipulated directly. Drawing on methods from human-computer interaction and adaptive experimentation, we use human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization to tune the timing of electrical muscle stimulation so as to robustly elicit a sense of agency over electrically-actuated muscle movements in male and female human subjects. We use time-resolved decoding of subjects EEG to estimate the time course of neural activity which predicts reported agency on a trial-by-trial basis. Like paradigms which assess SoA over action consequences, we found that the late (post-conscious) neural activity predicts SoA. Unlike typical paradigms, however, we also find patterns of early (sensorimotor) activity with distinct temporal dynamics predicts agency over muscle movements, suggesting that the \"neural correlates of agency\" may depend on the level of abstraction (i.e., direct sensorimotor feedback vs. downstream consequences) most relevant to a given agency judgement. Moreover, fractal analysis of the EEG suggests that SoA-contingent dynamics of neural activity may modulate the sensitivity of the motor system to external input.\n\nSignificance StatementThe sense of agency - the feeling of \"I did that\" - when directing ones own musculature is a core feature of human experience. We show that we can robustly manipulate the sense of agency over electrically actuated muscle movements, and we investigate the time course of neural activity that predicts the sense of agency over these actuated movements. We find evidence of two distinct neural processes - a transient sequence of patterns that begins in the early sensorineural response to muscle stimulation and a later, sustained signature of agency. These results shed light on the neural mechanisms by which we experience our movements as volitional.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that can result in permanent loss of motor and sensory function. In recent years, transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for SCI. However, adult NSCs residing in the central nervous system (CNS) show promise for cell-replacement therapy in neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of transplanting autologous NSCs isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ-NSCs) into a spinal cord injury model in Rhesus monkeys. We induced SCI in eight Rhesus monkeys and then transplanted SVZ-NSCs into the injury site. Behavioral assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to evaluate the functional and structural recovery of the spinal cord. Histological analyses were also performed to assess the survival and differentiation of the transplanted cells. SVZ-NSCs were capable of expressing SOX2, Nestin, and GFAP in addition to self-renewing and spontaneous differentiation in vitro. The monkeys showed sensory and motor function recovery, spinal tract regeneration, and partial reconstruction of the spinal cord. Positive Reinforcement Training confirmed no adverse effects from the isolation procedure. Our findings suggest that NSCs transplantation could be a promising therapeutic approach for SCI in humans, and further studies are warranted to investigate its potential for clinical translation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539673v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (69K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9257forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cbd0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4ef324org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13ce48b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This approach, Photo-induced Modulation of G protein - Inhibition of Gq (PiGM-Iq), exhibited potent and selective inhibition of Gq signaling. We alter the behavior of C. elegans and Drosophila with outcomes consistent with GPCR-Gq disruption. PiGM-Iq also changes axon guidance in culture dorsal root ganglia neurons in response to serotonin.

Although stem cell abundance is a fundamental determinant of adaptive resizing, our understanding of its underlying mechanisms remains primarily limited to the regulation of stem cell division.

From lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify a subpopulation of enteroendocrine cells (EEs) that convert into functional intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in response to dietary glucose and amino acids by activating the JAK-STAT pathway. Genetic ablation of EE-derived ISCs severely impairs ISC expansion and midgut growth despite the retention of resident ISCs, and in silico modeling further indicates that EE dedifferentiation enables efficient increase in the midgut cell number while maintaining epithelial cell composition. Our findings uncover a physiologically-induced dedifferentiation that ensures ISC expansion during adaptive organ growth in concert with nutrient conditions.",

    "abstract": "The natural world is full of odours--blends of volatile chemicals emitted by potential sources of food, social partners, predators, and pathogens. Animals rely heavily on these signals for survival and reproduction. Yet we remain remarkably ignorant of the composition of the chemical world. How many compounds do natural odours typically contain? How often are those compounds shared across stimuli? What are the best statistical strategies for discrimination? Answering these questions will deliver crucial insight into how brains can most efficiently encode olfactory information. Here, we undertake the first large-scale survey of vertebrate body odours, a set of stimuli relevant to blood- feeding arthropods. We quantitatively characterize the odour of 64 vertebrate species (mostly mammals), representing 29 families and 13 orders. We confirm that these stimuli are complex blends of relatively common, shared compounds and show that they are much less likely to contain unique components than are floral odours--a finding with implications for olfactory coding in blood feeders and floral visitors. We also find that vertebrate body odours carry little phylogenetic information, yet show consistency within a species. Human odour is especially unique, even compared to the odour of other great apes. Finally, we use our newfound understanding of odour-space statistics to make specific predictions about olfactory coding, which align with known features of mosquito olfactory systems. Our work provides one of the first quantitative descriptions of a natural odour space and demonstrates how understanding the statistics of sensory environments can provide novel insight into sensory coding and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Histone post-translational modifications are critical for mediating persistent alterations in gene expression. By combining unbiased proteomics profiling, and genome-wide approaches, we uncovered a role for mono-methylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27me1) in the enduring effects of stress. Specifically, mice exposed to early life stress (ELS) or to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in adulthood displayed increased enrichment of H3K27me1, and transient decreases in H3K27me2, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain-reward region. Stress induction of H3K27me1 was mediated by the VEFS domain of SUZ12, a core subunit of the polycomb repressive complex-2, which is induced by chronic stress and controls H3K27 methylation patterns. Overexpression of the VEFS domain led to social, emotional, and cognitive abnormalities, and altered excitability of NAc D1 mediums spiny neurons. Together, we describe a novel function of H3K27me1 in brain and demonstrate its role as a \"chromatin scar\" that mediates lifelong stress susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Flexible and transparent microelectrodes can provide large-scale neural recordings with temporal and spatial resolution when used alongside functional calcium imaging. Patterned metal grids defined by direct laser writing (DWL) are a promising approach for these electrodes, as they resort to standard microfabrication processes and materials, allowing the possibility of mass production. For these reasons, a study exploring transparent grid-based electrodes using DWL for measuring electrocorticography signal was performed. Patterned metal grids with 1 m of linewidth and 22 m of spacing between lines showed a sheet resistance of 6 {Omega}/sq and a transmittance of 81% at 550 nm. The grids were transferred to a 5 m Parylene-C membrane using an optimized procedure that involves an oxygen plasma pre-treatment. This procedure ensures mechanical robustness and stability of the grids. Finally, a flexible and transparent prototype was fabricated with a microelectrode array composed by 16 electrodes with 500 m of diameter. These microelectrodes shown an impedance of 10 k{Omega} at 1 kHz in saline solution and they are highly conformal facilitating in vivo implantation and the recording of neural activity in the mouse cerebellum surface. To conclude, patterned metal grids based-electrodes exhibit a promising performance compared to transparent conductive oxides or graphene. Moreover, the introduction of DLW enables easy and fast manipulation of grid shape and dimensions without the need of physical masks, while keeping large scale compatibility, which is important for tools used in neuroscience community.",

    "abstract": "Bioenergetic deficits, such as mitochondrial impairments and dysfunction in glucose metabolism, have been identified as significant contributors to neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, identifying safe and effective means to address intracellular bioenergetic deficits remains a significant challenge. This work provides mechanistic insights into the bioenergetic metabolism-regulating function of a suspension of gold (Au) nanocrystals, referred to as CNM-Au8(R), that are synthesized electrochemically in the absence of any surface-capping organic ligands. When neurons are subjected to excitotoxic stressors or toxic peptides, treatment of neurons with CNM-Au8 results in dose-dependent neuronal survival and preservation of neurite networks across multiple neuronal subtypes. CNM-Au8 efficiently catalyzes the conversion of an energetic co-factor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH), into its oxidized, dehydrogenated counterpart (NAD+), which triggers an increase in energy production in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Detailed kinetic measurements reveal that CNM-Au8-catalyzed NADH oxidation obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics and exhibits pH-dependent kinetic profiles. CNM-Au8 functions as an NADH-dehydrogenase-mimicking nanozyme that effectively regulates intracellular bioenergetic metabolism. We further utilize photoexcited charge carriers and photothermal transduction, which can be generated through optical excitations of the plasmonic electron oscillations or the interband electronic transitions in CNM-Au8, as unique leverages to modulate reaction kinetics. Benefiting from their bio-compatibility, blood-brain barrier penetrance, tunable optical properties, and enzyme-mimicking functions, CNM-Au8 nanocrystals with deliberately tailored structures and surfactant-free clean surfaces hold great promise for developing next-generation therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The chronic consumption of caloric dense high-fat foods is a major contributor to increased body weight, obesity, and other chronic health conditions. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical in guiding decisions about food intake and is altered with diet-induced obesity. Obese rodents have altered morphological and synaptic electrophysiological properties in the lateral OFC. Yet the time course by which exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) induces these changes is poorly understood. Here mice are exposed to either short-(7 day) or long-term (90 day) HFD. Long-term HFD exposure increases body weight, and glucose signaling compared to short-term HFD or a standard chow control diet (SCD). Both short and long-term HFD exposure increased the excitability of lOFC pyramidal neurons. However, phasic and tonic GABAergic signalling was differentially altered depending on HFD exposure length, such that tonic GABAergic signaling was decreased with early exposure to the HFD and phasic signaling was changed with long-term diet exposure. Furthermore, alterations in the short-term diet exposure were transient, as removal of the diet restored electrophysiological characteristics similar to mice fed SCD whereas long-term HFD electrophysiological changes were persistent and remained after HFD removal. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in reward devaluation occur early with diet exposure. Together, these results suggest that the duration of HFD exposure differentially alters lOFC function and provides mechanistic insights into the susceptibility of the OFC to impairments in outcome devaluation.\n\nSignificant statementThis study provides mechanistic insight on the impact of short- and long-term high fat diet (HFD) exposure on GABAergic function in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), a region known to guide decision making. We find short-term HFD exposure induces transient changes in firing and tonic GABA action on lOFC pyramidal neurons, whereas long-term HFD induces obesity and has lasting changes on firing, tonic GABA and inhibitory synaptic transmission onto lOFC neurons. Given that GABAergic signaling in the lOFC can influence decision making around food, these results have important implications in present society as palatable energy dense foods are abundantly available.",

    "abstract": "Motor development in children and youth occurs non-linearly; improvements are rapid at younger ages and decrease as they reach adulthood. There is also evidence that performance variability changes as children and youth age. Accurate models of typical performance are necessary to identify deficits in motor performance and to track the efficacy of therapies. Robotic devices have been used previously to measure motor performance in children and youth, and produce models of typical performance; however, power analyses on these models have not been explored.\n\nAn algorithm was created to generate normative models of typical motor performance. The accuracy and repeatability of the algorithm were tested using simulated data that changed the number of data points, and the curvature and variability of the data. Two-hundred and eighty-eight participants who are typically developing (ages 5-18) completed a robotic point-to-point reaching task with the Kinarm Exoskeleton. Exponential curves were fit to reaction time measured by the Kinarm to model typical performance. The results of the simulations were used to generate confidence intervals on the models of typical performance.\n\nThe simulations showed that number of datapoints had the largest impact on accuracy and repeatability of the models, and that repeatability was age-dependent. The simulations with the uniform and non-uniform datasets generated different confidence intervals; however, these differences were minimal when the number of datapoints at each age were matched between the two datasets.\n\nTo ensure identification of deficits is accurately determined, there is a need to account for differences in repeatability when developing models of typical motor performance in children and youth. The results of our simulations can be used to assess repeatability of non-linear models of motor performance based on dataset size in the future.",

    "abstract": "When holding a coffee mug filled to the brim, we strive to avoid spilling the coffee. This ability relies on the neural processes underlying the control of finger forces on a moment-to-moment basis. The brain activity lateralized to the contralateral hemisphere averaged over a trial and across the trials is known to be associated with the magnitude of grip force applied on an object. However, the mechanistic involvement of the variability in neural signals during grip force control remains unclear. In this study, we examined the dependence of neural variability over the frontal, central, and parietal regions assessed using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) on grip force magnitude during an isometric force control task. We hypothesized laterally specific modulation in EEG variability with higher magnitude of the grip force exerted during grip force control. We utilized an existing EEG dataset (64 channel) comprised of healthy young adults, who performed an isometric force control task while receiving visual feedback of the force applied. The force magnitude to be exerted on the instrumented object was cued to participants during the task, and varied pseudorandomly among 5, 10, and 15% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) across the trials. We quantified neural variability via sample entropy (sequence-dependent measure) and standard deviation (sequence-independent measure) of the temporal EEG signal over the frontal, central, and parietal electrodes. The EEG sample entropy over the central electrodes showed lateralized, nonlinear, localized, modulation with force magnitude. Similar modulation was not observed over frontal or parietal EEG activity, nor for standard deviation in the EEG activity. Our findings highlight specificity in neural control of grip forces by demonstrating the modulation in sequence-dependent but not sequence-independent component of EEG variability. This modulation appeared to be lateralized, spatially constrained, and functionally dependent on the grip force magnitude. We discuss the relevance of these findings in scenarios where a finer precision is essential to enable grasp application, such as prosthesis and associated neural signal integration, and propose directions for future studies investigating the mechanistic role of neural entropy in grip force control.",

As these tools utilise light-activated ion fluxes, they afford new opportunities to examine the nature of transmembrane ion gradients. Traditional investigation into the equilibrium potential for chloride (ECl) has been limited to studying endogenous chloride-permeable receptors. Here we demonstrate the utility of using a light-activated chloride channel, stGtACR2, to probe somatic ECl in rodent. This agonist-independent optogenetic strategy is validated in vitro and in vivo, captures differences in ECl dynamics following manipulations of endogenous chloride fluxes, and reveals distinct resting ECl across genetically-defined neuronal subpopulations. Using this approach to challenge chloride homeostasis, we uncover cell-specific ECl dynamics that are supported by the differential expression of endogenous handling mechanisms.

    "abstract": "The ability to maintain events (i.e. interactions between/among objects) in working memory is crucial for our everyday cognition, yet the format of this representation is poorly understood. The current ERP study was designed to answer two questions: How is maintaining events (e.g., the tiger hit the lion) neurally different from maintaining item coordinations (e.g., the tiger and the lion)? That is, how is the event relation (present in events but not coordinations) represented? And how is the agent, or initiator of the event encoded differently from the patient, or receiver of the event during maintenance? We used a novel picture-sentence match-across-delay approach in which the working memory representation was  pinged during the delay, in two ERP experiments with Chinese and English materials. First, we found that maintenance of events elicited a long-lasting late sustained difference in posterior-occipital electrodes relative to non-events. This effect resembled the negative slow wave reported in previous studies of working memory, suggesting that the maintenance of events in working memory may impose a higher cost compared to coordinations. Second, in order to elicit a hallmark for agent vs. patient representation in working memory, we pinged agent or patient characters during the delay. Although planned comparisons did not reveal significant differences in the ERPs elicited by the agent pings vs. patient pings, we found that the ping appeared to dampen the ongoing sustained difference, suggesting a shift from sustained activity to activity silent mechanisms. These results represent one of the uses of ERPs to elucidates the format of neural representation for events in working memory.",

    "abstract": "The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is important in development and maintenance of neurons and their plasticity. Hippocampal BDNF has been implicated Alzheimers disease (AD) because hippocampal levels in AD patients and AD animal models are consistently downregulated, suggesting that reduced BDNF contributes to AD. However, the location where hippocampal BDNF protein is most highly expressed, the mossy fiber (MF) axons of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs), has been understudied, and never in controlled in vivo conditions. We examined MF BDNF protein in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Tg2576 and wild type (WT) mice of both sexes were examined at 2-3 months of age, when amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is present in neurons but plaques are absent, and 11-20 months of age, after plaque accumulation. As shown previously, WT mice exhibited high levels of MF BDNF protein. Interestingly, there was no significant decline with age in either genotype or sex. Notably, we found a correlation between MF BDNF protein and GC {Delta}FosB, a transcription factor that increases after 1-2 weeks of elevated neuronal activity. Remarkably, there was relatively little evidence of A{beta} in GCs or the GC layer even at old ages. Results indicate MF BDNF is stable in the Tg2576 mouse, and MF BDNF may remain unchanged due to increased GC neuronal activity, since BDNF expression is well known to be activity-dependent. The resistance of GCs to long-term A{beta} accumulation provides an opportunity to understand how to protect other vulnerable neurons from increased A{beta} levels and therefore has translational implications.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDeclining hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, few studies have examined where hippocampal BDNF protein has its highest concentration, and plays a critical role in memory, the dentate gyrus granule cell (GC) axons (mossy fibers; MFs). Using a well-established mouse model of cerebral amyloid overexpression, the Tg2576 mouse model of AD, we found that MF BDNF did not decline with age, suggesting a notable exception to the idea that reduced hippocampal BDNF contributes to AD pathobiology. We also identified that Tg2576 GC activity correlates with MF BDNF protein based on GC expression of the transcription factor {Delta}FosB. These data are consistent with the activity-dependence of MF BDNF. In addition, we found that Tg2576 GCs were relatively resistant to accumulation of amyloid-b, providing insight into AD resilience, which has strong therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Attractors play a key role in a wide range of processes including learning and memory. Due to recent innovations in recording methods, there is increasing evidence for the existence of attractor dynamics in the brain. Yet, our understanding of how these attractors emerge or disappear in a biological system is lacking.\n\nBy following the spontaneous network bursts of cultured cortical networks, we are able to define a vocabulary of spatiotemporal patterns and show that they function as discrete attractors in the network dynamics. We show that electrically stimulating specific attractors eliminates them from the spontaneous vocabulary, while they are still robustly evoked by the electrical stimulation. This seemingly paradoxical finding can be explained by a Hebbian-like strengthening of specific pathways into the attractors, at the expense of weakening non-evoked pathways into the same attractors. We verify this hypothesis and provide a mechanistic explanation for the underlying changes supporting this effect.\n\nAuthor summaryThere are many hints that could evoke the same memory. There are many chains of evidence that could lead to the same decision. The mathematical object describing such dynamics is called an attractor, and is believed to be the neural basis for many cognitive phenomena. In this study, we aimed to deepen our understanding of the existence and plasticity of attractors in the dynamics of a biological neural network. We explored the spontaneous activity of cultured neural networks and identified a set of patterns that function as discrete attractors in the network dynamics. To understand how these attractors evolve, we stimulated the network to repeatedly visit some of them. Surprisingly, we observed that the stimulated patterns became less common in the spontaneous activity, while still being reliably evoked by the stimulation. This paradoxical finding was explained by the strengthening of specific pathways leading to these attractors, alongside the weakening of other pathways. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying attractor plasticity in biological neural networks.",

Past studies suggest that REM sleep may contribute to the beneficial effect of reactivating memories during NREM sleep, but the relationship between REM sleep and induced reactivations in NREM remains unclear. We investigated whether a naturally ensuing REM sleep episode is necessary for prior NREM targeted memory reactivation (TMR) to exert a beneficial effect on memory consolidation. Results disclosed better name recognition for words reactivated during NREM TMR followed by REM sleep, as compared to NREM-TMR without subsequent REM sleep. Sleep spindle activity increased only when NREM TMR preceded REM sleep, and associations with subsequent REM theta activity and memory benefits were contingent upon the level of relatedness with prior knowledge for the learned material.

    "abstract": "Collaborative neuroimaging research is often hindered by technological, policy, administrative, and methodological barriers, despite the abundance of available data. COINSTAC is a platform that successfully tackles these challenges through federated analysis, allowing researchers to analyze datasets without publicly sharing their data. This paper presents a significant enhancement to the COINSTAC platform: COINSTAC Vaults (CVs). CVs are designed to further reduce barriers by hosting standardized, persistent, and highly-available datasets, while seamlessly integrating with COINSTACs federated analysis capabilities. CVs offer a user-friendly interface for self-service analysis, streamlining collaboration and eliminating the need for manual coordination with data owners. Importantly, CVs can also be used in conjunction with open data as well, by simply creating a CV hosting the open data one would like to include in the analysis, thus filling an important gap in the data sharing ecosystem. We demonstrate the impact of CVs through several functional and structural neuroimaging studies utilizing federated analysis showcasing their potential to improve the reproducibility of research and increase sample sizes in neuroimaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Motor learning involves plasticity in a network of brain areas across the cortex and cerebellum. Such traces of learning have the potential to affect subsequent learning of other tasks. In some cases, prior learning can interfere with subsequent learning, but it may be possible to potentiate learning of one task with a prior task if they are sufficiently different. Because prism adaptation involves extensive neuroplasticity, we reasoned that the elevated excitability of neurons could increase their readiness to undergo structural changes, and in turn, create an optimal state for learning a subsequent task. We tested this idea, selecting two different forms of learning tasks, asking whether exposure to a sensorimotor adaptation task can improve subsequent de novo motor skill learning. Participants first learned a new visuomotor mapping induced by prism glasses in which prism strength varied trial-to-trial. Immediately after and the next day, we tested participants on a mirror tracing task, a form of de novo skill learning. Prism-trained and control participants both learned the mirror tracing task, with similar reductions in error and increases in distance traced. Both groups also showed evidence of offline performance gains between the end of day 1 and the start of day 2. However, we did not detect differences between groups. Overall, our results do not support the idea that prism adaptation learning can potentiate subsequent de novo learning. We discuss factors that may have contributed to this result.",

    "abstract": "Early life stress can have significant effects on the developing brain and lead to changes in the structure and function of brain regions involved in stress regulation, emotion and cognitive control. Here, we used the social instability stress (SIS) protocol to understand the impact of social stress during mild (PND30) and late (PND45) adolescence. Our results revealed that SIS can compromise the dominance-subordination coping strategy but does not affect social recognition and motivation in rats. Moreover, SIS can lead to subtle modifications at the molecular level that hamper normal development of the prefrontal cortex in a sex- and age-dependent manner. Understanding the impact of early life stress on brain organization is crucial for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. By identifying those who are most vulnerable to the effects of stress and providing targeted support and resources, it may be possible to mitigate the negative consequences of early adversity and promote healthy brain development.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental diagnoses. Although incompletely understood, structural and functional network alterations are increasingly recognized to be at the core of the condition. We utilized multimodal imaging and connectivity modeling to study structure-function coupling in ASD, and probed mono- and polysynaptic mechanisms on structurally-governed network function. We examined multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data in 47 ASD and 37 neurotypical controls from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) II initiative. We predicted intrinsic functional connectivity from structural connectivity data in each participant using a Riemannian optimization procedure that varies the times that simulated signals can unfold along tractography-derived personalized connectomes. In both ASD and neurotypical controls, we observed improved structure-function prediction at longer diffusion time scales, indicating better modeling of brain function when polysynaptic mechanisms are accounted for. Prediction improvements were marked in transmodal association systems, such as the default mode network, in both controls and ASD. Improvements were, however, lower in ASD in a polysynaptic regime at higher simulated diffusion times. Regional differences followed a sensory-to-transmodal cortical hierarchy, with an increased gap between groups in transmodal compared to sensory/motor systems. Multivariate associative techniques revealed that structure-function differences reflected inter-individual differences in autistic symptoms and verbal as well as non-verbal intelligence. Our network modeling approach sheds light on atypical structure-function coupling in autism, and suggests that polysynaptic network mechanisms are implicated in the condition and can help explain its wide range of associated symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The 2022 mpox virus outbreak was sustained by efficient human-to-human transmission and spread predominantly through sexual networks of men who have sex with men (MSM). It is currently unclear what combination of factors resulted in the enhanced transmission. To investigate this, we established the peridomestic African rodent Mastomys natalensis as a new rodent model susceptible to infection after intraperitoneal, rectal, vaginal, and transdermal inoculation with an early 2022 human outbreak isolate (Clade IIb). Route-dependent shedding and tissue replication occurred in the presence of self-resolving localized skin, reproductive tract, or rectal lesions. Mucosal inoculation via both the rectal and vaginal route led to increased shedding compared to skin inoculation, and increased replication and a proinflammatory T-cell profile. Contact transmission was higher in rectally inoculated animals. This suggests that the spread in MSM communities may have been enhanced by increased susceptibility of the anal and genital mucosae for infection and subsequent virus release.",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental mechanisms developed by the host to contain the highly infectious and rapidly proliferating SARS coronavirus is elevation of body temperature, a natural fallout of which is Heat Shock Protein (HSP) over-expression. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus exploits the host Hsp70 chaperone for its entry and propagation and blocking it can combat the infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as febrile temperature enhanced Hsp70 overexpression in host Vero E6 cells. In turn, Hsp70 overexpression elevated the host cell autophagic response that is a prerequisite for viral propagation. Suppressive and prophylactic treatment of Vero E6 cells with HSP70 inhibitor PES-Cl, a small molecule derivative of Pifithrin , abrogated viral infection more potently than the currently used drug Remdesivir by suppressing host HSP70 and autophagic response. In conclusion, our study not only provides a fundamental insight into the role of host Hsp70 in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it paves the way for the development of potent and irresistible anti-viral therapeutics.",

However, the mechanisms underlying this loss of ovarian NAD+ are unclear. Here, we show that CD38, a NAD+ consuming enzyme, is expressed in the ovarian extrafollicular space, primarily in immune cells, and its levels increase with reproductive age. Reproductively young mice lacking CD38 exhibit larger primordial follicle pools, elevated ovarian NAD+ levels, and increased fecundity relative to wild type controls. This larger ovarian reserve results from a prolonged window of follicle formation during early development. However, the beneficial effect of CD38 loss on reproductive function is not maintained at advanced age. Our results demonstrate a novel role of CD38 in regulating ovarian NAD+ metabolism and establishing the ovarian reserve, a critical process that dictates a females reproductive lifespan.",

Appropriately designed mucosal boosters could overcome the shortcomings of parenteral vaccines and enhance pre- existing systemic immunity.

Mice receiving IM-Prime PUUC+CpG PAL- NPs, followed by an IN-Boost, developed high levels of IgA, IgG, and cellular immunity in the lung, and showed robust systemic humoral immunity. Interestingly, as a purely intranasal vaccine (IN-Prime/IN-Boost), PUUC+CpG PAL-NPs induced stronger lung-specific T cell immunity than IM-Prime/IN-Boost, and a comparable IgA and neutralizing antibodies, although with a lower systemic antibody response, indicating that a fully mucosal delivery route for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may also be feasible.

However, detecting changing cell types is challenging due to individual-to-individual and cohort-to-cohort variability and naive approaches based on current computational tools lead to false positive findings. To address this, we propose a computational tool, scDist, based on a mixed-effects model that provides a statistically rigorous and computationally efficient approach for detecting transcriptomic differences. By accurately recapitulating known immune cell relationships and mitigating false positives induced by individual and cohort variation, we demonstrate that scDist outperforms current methods in both simulated and real datasets, even with limited sample sizes. Through the analysis of COVID-19 and immunotherapy datasets, scDist uncovers transcriptomic perturbations in dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and FCER1G+NK cells, that provide new insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses. As single-cell datasets continue to expand, our faster and statistically rigorous method offers a robust and versatile tool for a wide range of research and clinical applications, enabling the investigation of cellular perturbations with implications for human health and disease.",

The two helices have a tilt angle of only 6{degrees}, resulting in an extended interface dominated by Leu and Val sidechains.

    "abstract": "The soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a model organism with a set of diverse behaviors. These behaviors include the starvation-induced multicellular development program, in which cells move collectively to assemble multicellular aggregates. After initial aggregates have formed, some will disperse, with smaller aggregates having a higher chance of dispersal. Initial aggregation is driven by two changes in cell behavior: cells slow down inside of aggregates and bias their motion by reversing direction less frequently when moving towards aggregates.\n\nHowever, the cell behaviors that drive dispersal are unknown. Here we use fluorescent microscopy to quantify changes in cell behavior after initial aggregates have formed. We observe that after initial aggregate formation, cells adjust the bias in reversal timings by initiating reversals more rapidly when approaching unstable aggregates. Using agent-based modeling, we then show dispersal is predominantly generated by this change in bias, which is strong enough to overcome slowdown inside aggregates. Notably, the change in reversal bias is correlated with the nearest aggregates size, connecting cellular activity to previously observed correlations between aggregate size and fate. To determine if this connection is consistent across strains, we analyze a second M. xanthus strain with reduced levels of dispersal. We find that far fewer cells near smaller aggregates modified their bias. This implies that aggregate dispersal is under genetic control, providing a foundation for further investigations into the role it plays in the life cycle of M. xanthus.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the processes behind bacterial biofilm formation, maintenance, and dispersal is essential for addressing their effects on health and ecology. Within these multicellular communities, various cues can trigger differentiation into distinct cell types, allowing cells to adapt to their specific local environment. The soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus forms biofilms in response to starvation, marked by cells aggregating into mounds. Some aggregates persist as spore-filled fruiting bodies, while others disperse after initial formation for unknown reasons. Here, we use a combination of cell tracking analysis and computational simulations to identify behaviors at the cellular level that contribute to aggregate dispersal. Our results suggest that cells in aggregates actively determine whether to disperse or persist and undergo a transition to sporulation based on a self-produced cue related to the aggregates size. Identifying these cues is an important step in understanding and potentially manipulating bacterial cell-fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Predicting evolution in microbial communities is critical for problems from human health to global nutrient cycling. Understanding how species interactions impact the distribution of fitness effects for a focal population would enhance our ability to predict evolution. Specifically, it would be useful to know if the type of ecological interaction, such as mutualism or competition, changes the average effect of a mutation (i.e., the mean of the distribution of fitness effects). Furthermore, how often does increasing community complexity alter the impact of species interactions on mutant fitness? To address these questions, we created a transposon mutant library in Salmonella enterica and measured the fitness of loss of function mutations in 3,550 genes when grown alone versus competitive co-culture or mutualistic co-culture with Escherichia coli and Methylorubrum extorquens. We found that mutualism reduces the average impact of mutations, while competition had no effect. Additionally, mutant fitness in the 3-species communities can be predicted by averaging the fitness in each 2-species community. Finally, the fitness effects of several knockouts in the mutualistic communities were surprising. We discovered that S. enterica is obtaining a different source of carbon and more vitamins and amino acids than we had expected. Our results suggest that species interactions can predictably impact fitness effect distributions, in turn suggesting that evolution may ultimately be predictable in multi-species communities.",

Serious infections have recently been related to contamination of preservative-free eyedrops with extensively drug resistant (XDR) isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, already resulting in three deaths. These drug-resistant isolates cannot be managed with most conventional antibiotics. We sought to identify alternatives to conventional antibiotics for lysis of these XDR isolates, and identified multiple bacteriophages (viruses that attack bacteria) that killed them efficiently. We found both jumbo phages (>200kb in genome size) and non-jumbo phages that were active against these isolates, the former killing more efficiently. Jumbo phages effectively killed the 3 separate XDR P. aeruginosa isolates both on solid and liquid medium.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacillus subtilis has been established as model microorganism for fundamental research in the laboratory on protein production/secretion and sporulation and as model bacterium for controlling spoilage in the food industry. It has also been used for production of (commercial) enzymes and several secondary metabolites such as vitamins. However, this doesnt fully reflect the potential of B. subtilis as a cell-factory. Here, various strains of B. subtilis, including food-grade, spore-deficient strains and industrially used strains, were compared for their growth and metabolic potential. Industry-relevant parameters were analyzed for all strains under various aeration regimes, under anaerobic conditions, in various nutritious and nutrient-limited cultivation media, with and without organic nitrogen sources, and with and without sugar.\n\nResultsPractical experiments were conducted to compare industrial relevant properties like growth rates, intracellular components and extracellular metabolite profile of different B. subtilis strains. Based on growth flexibility in different media, we found that some strains like NCIB3610 and DSM1092 are adapted to inorganic or organic nitrogen source utilization, which is highly relevant when considering a biorefinery approach using various cheap and abundant waste/sidestreams. Secondly, spore-deficient strains such as 3NA, 168S and PY79S, showed advantages in microbial protein and acetolactate pathway expression, which is associated with applications in food industry for protein supplement and diacetyl production. Lastly, WB800 and PY79S exhibited potential for fermentative production of Dipicolinic acid, 2,3-Butanediol and Lactic acid that could serve as precursors for biopolymers.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the broad potential for more extensive industrial use of Bacillus subtilis in the (bio-based) chemical industry for use of sidestreams, in the personal care industry, in the food industry for food additive production, and in the bio-sustainable industry for biofuel and bio-degradable plastic precursors production. In addition, selecting different B. subtilis strains for specific purposes makes full use of the diversity of this species and increases the potential of B. subtilis in its contribution to the bio-based economy.",

    "abstract": "Fluid flow is thought to prevent bacterial adhesion, but some bacteria use adhesins with catch bond properties to enhance adhesion under high shear forces. However, many studies on bacterial adhesion either neglect the influence of shear force or use shear forces that are not typically found in natural systems. In this study, we use microfluidics and single-cell imaging to examine how the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa interacts with surfaces when exposed to shear forces typically found in the human body (0.1 pN to 10 pN). Through cell tracking, we demonstrate that the angle between the cell and the surface predicts if a cell will depart the surface. We discover that at lower shear forces, type IV pilus retraction tilts cells away from the surface, promoting surface departure. Conversely, we show that higher shear forces counterintuitively enhance adhesion by counteracting type IV pilus retraction-dependent cell tilting. Thus, our results reveal that P. aeruginosa exhibits behavior reminiscent of a catch bond, without having a specific adhesin that is enhanced by force. Instead, P. aeruginosa couples type IV pilus dynamics and cell geometry to tune adhesion to its mechanical environment, which likely provides a benefit in dynamic host environments.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli K-12 is a model organism for bacteriology and has served as a workhorse for molecular biology and biochemistry for over a century since its first isolation in 1922. However, Escherichia coli K-12 strains are phenotypically devoid of an O antigen (OAg) since early reports in the scientific literature. Recent studies reported the presence of independent mutations that abolish OAg biogenesis in E. coli K-12 strains from the same original source, suggesting unknown evolutionary forces have selected for loss of OAg during the early propagation of K-12. Here, we show for the first time that restoration of OAg in E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 synergistically sensitises bacteria to vancomycin with bile salts (VBS). Suppressor mutants surviving lethal doses of VBS mostly contained disruptions in OAg biogenesis. We present data supporting a model where the transient presence and accumulation of lipid-carried OAg intermediates in the bacterial periplasm interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis, causing growth defects that are synergistically enhanced by bile salts. Lastly, we demonstrate that continuous bile salt exposure of OAg-producing MG1655 in the laboratory, can recreate a scenario where OAg disruption is selected for. Hence our work provides a likely explanation for the long-held mystery of how E. coli K-12 lost its OAg production and opens new avenues for exploring long-standing questions on the intricate network coordinating the synthesis of different cell envelope components in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nSignificance statementEscherichia coli K-12 is the most studied microorganism, widely used in laboratories for studying bacteriology and as a tool for molecular biology. The reason why it is devoid of O antigen remains a long-standing question. Our work has uncovered a previously unknown selection pressure of bile salts on bacterial O antigen biogenesis, which provides a plausible scenario for how the early propagation of E. coli K-12 strains in bile salt containing media could have led to loss of O antigen in K-12. Our results also suggest that the accumulation of O antigen intermediates in the bacterial periplasm may interfere with bacterial cell wall synthesis, which paves a new research direction into the interplay of different cell envelope component synthesis pathways.",

    "abstract": "Omicron emerged following COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, displaced previous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern worldwide, and gave rise to lineages that continue to spread. Here, we show that Omicron exhibits increased infectivity in primary adult upper airway tissue. Using recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 and nasal epithelial cells cultured at the liquid-air interface, enhanced infectivity maps to the step of cellular entry and evolved recently through mutations unique to Omicron Spike. Unlike earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron enters nasal cells independently of serine transmembrane proteases and instead relies upon matrix metalloproteinases to catalyze membrane fusion. This entry pathway unlocked by Omicron Spike enables evasion of interferon-induced factors that restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry following attachment. Therefore, the increased transmissibility exhibited by Omicron in humans may be attributed not only to its evasion of vaccine-elicited adaptive immunity, but also to its superior invasion of nasal epithelia and resistance to the cell-intrinsic barriers present therein.",

Conversely, unloading of PCNA from chromatin is a crucial step for the maintenance of genome stability. Cells defect of the PCNA unloader ATAD5/Elg1-RFC exhibit a high level of chromatin-bound PCNA, delayed S phase progression, abnormal association/dissociation of chromatin-bound proteins, and aberrant chromosome structures, but exhibit dissociation of PCNA from chromatin in mitosis. Here, we found that TRAIP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays critical roles in the removal of PCNA from chromatin during mitosis. TRAIP-depleted cells exhibited chromatin-bound PCNA even during mitosis and delayed mitotic progression and mitotic exit. Although TRAIP-depleted cells with chromatin-bound PCNA progressed into the next G1 phase, they showed reduced levels of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 and impaired S phase entry. These results demonstrate that TRAIP functions independently of ATAD5/Elg1-RFC for the removal of PCNA from chromatin during mitosis, and is required for precise cell cycle progression from mitosis to G1 phase, as well as for pre-RC formation for faithful initiation of DNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Oxidants have a profound impact on biological systems in physiology and under pathological conditions. Oxidative post-translational modifications of protein thiols are well-recognized as a readily occurring alteration of proteins. Changes in protein thiol redox state can modify the function of proteins and thus can control cellular processes. However, chronic oxidative stress causes oxidative damage to proteins with detrimental consequences for cellular function and organismal health. The development of techniques enabling the site-specific and quantitative assessment of protein thiol oxidation on a proteome-wide scale significantly expanded the number of known oxidation-sensitive protein thiols. However, lacking behind are large-scale data on the redox state of proteins during ageing, a physiological process accompanied by increased levels of endogenous oxidants. Here, we present the landscape of protein thiol oxidation in chronologically aged wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a time-dependent manner. Our data determine early oxidation targets in key biological processes governing the de novo production of proteins, folding, and protein degradation. Comparison to existing datasets reveals evolutionary conservation of early oxidation targets. To facilitate accessibility and cross-species comparison of the experimental data obtained, we created the OxiAge Database, a free online tool for the research community that integrates current datasets on thiol redoxomes in aged yeast, nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse Mus musculus.

In Aquilaria plants, wounding and fungal invasion results in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites as a defence response which with due course develop into agarwood. During pathogen invasion, Aquilaria tree accumulate ROS species through the action of Rboh enzymes. Although in agarwood formation role of Rboh gene family has been implicated, an comprehensives study on Rboh gene family and information of its role during agarwood formation in missing. In this study, seven Rboh genes were identified from the genomes of two Aquilaria species viz., Aquilaria agallocha and Aquilaria sinensis and phylogenetically classified into five groups.\n\nStress response, hormone regulation, and development related regulatory elements were identified in the promoter regions. The protein sequences comprised of four conserved domains, an EF-hand domain, and a transmembrane region which they probably utilise for MAPK signaling, plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction pathways. Expression analyses revealed that among the seven members, AaRbohA and AaRhobC were involved in generation of ROS species, and also probably play role in agarwood formation. These findings provide valuable information regarding the Rboh members of A. agallocha which can be further used for functional analyses for in-depth understanding of ROS mediated signalling and regulation of agarwood formation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539809v1_figu1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169f501org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1541667org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ad549org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b8b7b2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Dictyostelium discoideum dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DdDyP) is a newly discovered peroxidase, which belongs to a unique class of heme peroxidase family that lacks homology to the known members of plant peroxidase superfamily. DdDyP catalyzes the H2O2-dependent oxidation of a wide-spectrum of substrates ranging from polycyclic dyes to lignin biomass, holding promise for potential industrial and biotechnological applications. To study the molecular mechanism of DdDyP, highly pure and functional protein with a natively incorporated heme is required, however, obtaining a functional DyP-type peroxidase with a natively bound heme is challenging and often requires addition of expensive biosynthesis precursors. Alternatively, a heme in vitro reconstitution approach followed by a chromatographic purification step to remove the excess heme is often used. Here, we show that expressing the DdDyP peroxidase in 2xYT enriched medium at low temperature (20 {degrees}C), without adding heme supplement or biosynthetic precursors, allows for a correct native incorporation of heme into the apo-protein, giving rise to a stable protein with a strong Soret peak at 402 nm. Further, we crystallized and determined the native structure of DdDyP at a resolution of 1.95 [A], which verifies the correct heme binding and its geometry. The structural analysis also reveals a binding of two water molecules at the distal site of heme plane bridging the catalytic residues (Arg239 and Asp149) of the GXXDG motif to the heme-Fe(III) via hydrogen bonds. Our results provide new insights into the geometry of native DdDyP active site and its implication on DyP catalysis.",

    "abstract": "NMR studies of large biomolecular machines and highly repetitive proteins remain challenging due to the difficulty of assigning signals to individual nuclei. Here, we present an efficient strategy to address this challenge by engineering a Pyrococcus horikoshii tRNA/alanyl-tRNA synthetase pair that enables the incorporation of up to three isotopically labeled alanine residues in a site-specific manner using in vitro protein expression. We have demonstrated the general applicability of this approach for NMR assignment by introducing isotopically labeled alanines into four proteins, including the 300-kDa molecular chaperone ClpP and the alanine-rich Phox2B transcription factor. For large protein assemblies, our labeling approach enables unambiguous assignments, while avoiding potential artefacts induced by site-specific mutations. When applied to Phox2B, which contains two poly-alanine tracts of nine and twenty alanines, we observe that the helical stability is strongly dependent on the homorepeat length, demonstrating structural cooperativity. The capacity to selectively introduce alanines with distinct labeling patterns is a powerful tool to probe structure and dynamics of biomolecular systems that are out of the reach of traditional structural biology methods.",

    "abstract": "Liquid phase electron microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for in-situ observation of material formation in liquid. However, the interaction of electrons with an aqueous environment leads to the decomposition of water molecules into multiple radicals (radiolysis), which can affect the formation process. Graphenes ultra-conductive properties have made it an efficient way to mitigate this problem, as it acts as an electron scavenger when used as a window material. However, finding accessible and reliable protocols for the formation of graphene liquid cell (GLC) has been an enormous challenge. Even though loop-assisted transfer has recently been demonstrated as an effective method, the liquid cells are randomly formed and the process of interest is initiated when the GLCs are sealed. This means that the process cannot be imaged at early timepoints, because searching for their location is a time-consuming effort during which the sample is exposed to electrons.\n\nHere we report a novel cryogenic/liquid phase correlative light/electron microscopy workflow that addresses some of the limitations of the graphene liquid cells, combining the advantages of fluorescence and electron microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) is used to locate the GLCs without exposure to electrons and electron microscopy to capture dynamics with nanoscale resolution. This workflow allows imaging to be initiated at a predetermined space and time by vitrifying and thawing at the moment of interest. We demonstrate the workflow by observing non-classical crystallization pathways, but also highlight its potential application in biological systems.",

The activation of CRISPR in response to RNA biomarkers holds the potential for controlling CRISPR activity with spatiotemporal precision. This would enable the restriction of CRISPR activity to specific cell types expressing RNA biomarkers of interest, while preventing unwanted activity in other cells. Here, we present a simple and specific platform for modulating CRISPR activity in response to RNA detection through engineering Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). sgRNAs are engineered to fold into complex secondary structures that, in the ground state, inhibit their activity. Upon recognizing complementary RNAs, the engineered sgRNAs become activated, enabling Cas9 to perform its function. Our approach enables CRISPR activation in response to RNA detection in both HEK293T cells and zebrafish embryos. Iterative design optimizations allowed the development of computational tools for generating sgRNAs capable of detecting RNA sequences of choice. Mechanistic investigations reveal that engineered sgRNAs are cleaved during RNA detection, and we identify key positions that benefit from chemical modifications to improve the stability of engineered sgRNAs in vivo. Our sensors open up novel opportunities for the development of new research and therapeutic applications using CRISPR activation in response to endogenous RNA biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks, which control gene expression patterns in development and in response to stimuli, use regulatory logic modules to coordinate inputs and outputs. One example of a regulatory logic module is the gene regulatory cascade (GRC), where a series of transcription factor genes turn on in order. Synthetic biologists have derived artificial systems that encode regulatory rules, including GRCs. Furthermore, the development of single-cell approaches has enabled the discovery of gene regulatory modules in a variety of experimental settings. However, the tools available for validating these observations remain limited. Based on a synthetic GRC using DNA cutting-defective Cas9 (dCas9), we designed and implemented an alternative synthetic GRC utilizing DNA cutting-defective Cas12a (dCas12a). Comparing the ability of these two systems to express a fluorescent reporter, the dCas9 system was initially more active, while the dCas12a system was more streamlined. Investigating the influence of individual components of the systems identified nuclear localization as a major driver of differences in activity. Improving nuclear localization for the dCas12a system resulted in 1.5-fold more reporter-positive cells and a 15-fold increase in reporter intensity relative to the dCas9 system. We call this optimized system the \"Synthetic Gene Regulatory Network\" (SGRN, pronounced \"sojourn\").",

    "abstract": "Unchecked chronic inflammation is the underlying cause of many diseases, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity and neurodegeneration. Given the deleterious nature of unregulated inflammation, it is not surprising that cells have acquired a diverse arsenal of tactics to limit inflammation. IL-10 is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine that can limit immune cell activation and cytokine production in innate immune cell types; however, the exact mechanism by which IL-10 signaling subdues inflammation remains unclear. Here, we find that IL-10 signaling constrains sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, we find increased saturated very long chain (VLC) ceramides are critical for the heightened inflammatory gene expression that is a hallmark of IL-10-deficient macrophages. Genetic deletion of CerS2, the enzyme responsible for VLC ceramide production, limited exacerbated inflammatory gene expression associated with IL-10 deficiency both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that \"metabolic correction\" is able to reduce inflammation in the absence of IL-10. Surprisingly, accumulation of saturated VLC ceramides was regulated by flux through the de novo mono-unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) synthesis pathway, where addition of exogenous MUFAs could limit both saturated VLC ceramide production and inflammatory gene expression in the absence of IL-10 signaling. Together, these studies mechanistically define how IL-10 signaling manipulates fatty acid metabolism as part of its molecular anti-inflammatory strategy and could lead to novel and inexpensive approaches to regulate aberrant inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a competent vector of multiple pathogens including dengue, Zika, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Mayaro viruses. Ae. aegypti is highly invasive and is currently present in the Americas, Oceania, Asia, and Europe, but its distribution and the pathogens it transmits are expected to change due to climate change. Relative humidity is an environmental variable that affects mosquito biology and distribution and can differ between location, habitat, and season, with mosquitoes facing significant variation in relative humidity during their lifespan. Low relative humidity can induce dehydration in mosquitoes, leading to alterations in physiological and behavioral responses relevant for pathogen transmission such as bloodfeeding and host-seeking behavior. In this study, we evaluated the short and long-term effects of dehydration stress on mortality and Mayaro virus vector competence in Ae. aegypti. Our results show that exposure to dehydration does not impact viral titers, nor infection, dissemination and transmission rates, in mosquitoes infected with Mayaro virus. However, we detected a significant effect of dehydration on mosquito mortality and blood feeding frequency regardless of infection status. The previously observed effects of higher feeding during dehydration and the current observation of altered survival along with no impact on vector competence suggest that the impact of dehydration on viral transmission in mosquitoes will likely be complex.",

    "abstract": "Incorporation of histone variant H3.3 comprises active territories of chromatin. Exploring the function of H3.3 in prostate cancer (PC), we found that knockout (KO) of H3.3 chaperone HIRA suppresses PC growth in vitro and in xenograft settings, deregulates androgen-induced gene expression and alters androgen receptor (AR) binding within enhancers of target genes. H3.3 affects transcription in multiple ways, including activation of p300 by phosphorylated H3.3 at Ser-31 (H3.3S31Ph), which results in H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at enhancers. In turn, H3K27Ac recruits bromodomain protein BRD4 for enhancer-promoter interaction and transcription activation. We observed that HIRA KO reduces H3.3 incorporation, diminishes H3.3S31Ph and H3K27Ac, modifies recruitment of BRD4. These results suggest that H3.3-enriched enhancer chromatin serves as a platform for H3K27Ac-mediated BRD4 recruitment, which interacts with and retains AR at enhancers, resulting in transcription reprogramming. AR KO reduced levels of H3.3 at enhancers, indicating feedback mechanism. In addition, HIRA KO deregulates glucocorticoid-driven transcription, suggesting a common H3.3/HIRA-dependent mechanism of nuclear receptors function. Expression of HIRA complex proteins is increased in PC compared with normal prostate tissue, especially in high-risk PC groups, and is associated with a negative prognosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate function of HIRA-dependent H3.3 pathway in regulation of nuclear receptors activity.\n\nKey points*H3.3 at enhancers promotes acetylation of H3K27Ac and retention of AR/BRD4 complex for transcription regulation\n\n*Knockout of H3.3 chaperone HIRA suppresses PC cells growth and deregulates androgen-induced transcription\n\n*H3.3/HIRA pathway regulates both AR and GR, suggesting a common HIRA/H3.3 mechanism of nuclear receptors function",

    "abstract": "RNA:DNA hybrids such as R-loops affect genome integrity and DNA replication fork progression. The overall impacts of naturally occurring RNA:DNA hybrids on genome integrity, and the relative contributions of ribonucleases H to mitigating the negative effects of hybrids, remain unknown. Here, we investigate the contributions of RNases HII (RnhB) and HIII (RnhC) to hybrid removal, DNA replication, and mutagenesis genome-wide. Deletion of either rnhB or rnhC triggers RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation, but with distinct patterns of mutagenesis and hybrid accumulation. Across all cells, hybrids accumulate most strongly in non-coding RNAs and 5'-UTRs of coding sequences. For {Delta}rnhB, hybrids accumulate preferentially in untranslated regions and early in coding sequences. Hybrid accumulation is particularly sensitive to gene expression in {Delta}rnhC; in cells lacking RnhC, DNA replication is disrupted leading to transversions and structural variation. Our results resolve the outstanding question of how hybrids in native genomic contexts interact with replication to cause mutagenesis and shape genome organization.",

    "abstract": "E. coli is the host of choice to produce a wide variety of chemicals and proteins. Overflow metabolism is considered as the widespread and major obstacle in microbial synthesis, and overcoming this common bottleneck may enable a universal chassis. Here, we constructed an E. coli universal chassis (ABKS strain) with significantly suppressed overflow metabolism, presenting similar growth rate, decreased glucose consumption, and increased production of desired chemicals and proteins when compared with wild-type BL21(DE3) strain. Furthermore, we demonstrated that metabolic flux of ABKS strain was reprogrammed from TCA cycle to glyoxylate bypass at isocitrate node via the synergistic effect of multi-layer regulation in gene transcription and protein modification. This metabolic reconfiguration alleviates overflow metabolism, avoids CO2 release in TCA cycle, finally improving the carbon atom economy in bioprocess. Our chassis has widespread and practical use for elevating the production and yield of multiple desired chemicals and proteins from different carbon source. The metabolic reconfiguration also provides theoretical basis for rational design of efficient bioproduction strains.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the extent of prediction in language by reanalysing Nieuwland and colleagues (2018) replication of DeLong et al. (2005). Participants (n = 356) viewed sentences containing articles and nouns of varying predictability, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. We measured pre-stimulus and N400 event-related activity and calculated lexical surprisal using Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) models. Results demonstrate increases in N400 amplitude as article surprisal increased, supporting DeLong et al.s (2005) findings. Strikingly, N400 amplitudes for surprising articles were reduced when prior word surprisal was high, suggesting that surprising input reduces prediction precision for upcoming words. The magnitude of prediction error effects was additionally modulated by inter-individual differences (individual alpha frequency and aperiodic slope of resting EEG). These findings indicate that prediction in language is a flexible mechanism that is adaptive across contexts and individuals. They further support the assumption that prediction is a unified mechanism of cognition.",

    "abstract": "Tunicates are marine, non-vertebrate chordates that comprise the sister group to the vertebrates. Most tunicates have a biphasic lifecycle that alternates between a swimming larva and a sessile adult. Recent advances have shed light on the neural basis for the tunicate larvas ability to sense a proper substrate for settlement and initiate metamorphosis. Work in the highly tractable laboratory model tunicate Ciona robusta suggests that sensory neurons embedded in the anterior papillae of transduce mechanosensory stimuli to trigger larval tail retraction and initiate the process of metamorphosis. Here, we take advantage of the low-cost and simplicity of Ciona by using tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to screen for genes potentially involved in mechanosensation and metamorphosis, in the context of an undergraduate \"capstone\" research course. This small screen revealed at least one gene, Vamp1/2/3, that appears crucial for the ability of the papillae to trigger metamorphosis. We also provide step-by-step protocols and tutorials associated with this course, in the hope that it might be replicated in similar CRISPR-based laboratory courses wherever Ciona are available.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian brains are larger and more densely packed with neurons than reptiles, but the genetic mechanisms underlying the increased connection complexity amongst neurons are unclear. The expression diversity of clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs), which is controlled by CTCF and cohesin, is crucial for proper dendritic arborization and cortical connectivity in vertebrates. Here, we identify a highly-conserved and mammalian-restricted protein, ZFP661, that binds antagonistically at CTCF barriers at the Pcdh locus, preventing CTCF from trapping cohesin. ZFP661 balances the usage of Pcdh isoforms and increases Pcdh expression diversity. Loss of Zfp661 causes cortical dendritic arborization defects and autism-like social deficits in mice. Our study reveals both a novel mechanism that regulates the trapping of cohesin by CTCF and a mammalian adaptation that promoted Pcdh expression diversity to accompany the expanded mammalian brain.\n\nOne sentence summaryZFP661 blocks cohesin trapping by CTCF and increases protocadherin diversity for proper cortical dendritic arborization.",
