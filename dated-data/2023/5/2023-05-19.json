    "abstract": "We present an approach for modeling single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data using quaternions. Quaternions are four dimensional hypercomplex numbers that, along with real numbers, complex numbers and octonions, represent one of the four normed division algebras. Quaternions have been primarily employed to represent three-dimensional rotations in computer graphics with most biomedical applications focused on problems involving the structure and orientation of biomolecules, e.g., protein folding, chromatin conformation, etc. In this paper, we detail an approach for mapping the cells/locations in a scRNA-seq/ST data set to quaternions. According to this model, the quaternion associated with each cell/location represents a vector in [R]3 with vector length capturing sequencing depth and vector direction capturing the relative expression profile. Assuming that biologically interesting features of an scRNA-seq/ST data set are preserved within a rank three reconstruction of the unnormalized counts, this representation has several benefits for data analysis. First, it supports a novel approach for scRNA-seq/ST data visualization that captures cell state uncertainty. Second, the model implies that transformations between cell states can be viewed as three-dimensional rotations, which have a corresponding representation as rotation quaternions. The fact that these rotation quaternions can be interpreted as cells enables a novel approach for characterizing cell state transitions with specific relevance to the analysis of pseudo-temporal ordering trajectories. Most importantly, a quaternion representation supports the genome-wide spectral analysis of scRNA-seq/ST data relative to a single variable, e.g., pseudo-time, or two variables, e.g., spatial coordinates, using a one or two-dimensional hypercomplex discrete Fourier transform. An R package supporting this model and the hypercomplex Fourier analysis of ST data along with several example vignettes is available at https://hrfrost.host.dartmouth.edu/QSC.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of fitness effects is a key property in evolutionary genetics as it has implications for several evolutionary phenomena including the evolution of sex and mating systems, the rate of adaptive evolution, and the prevalence of deleterious mutations. Despite the distribution of fitness effects being extensively studied, the effects of strongly deleterious mutations are difficult to infer since such mutations are unlikely to be present in samples of haplotypes, so genetic data may contain very little information about them. Recent work has attempted to correct for this issue by expanding the classic gamma-distributed model to explicitly account for strongly deleterious mutations. Here, we use simulations to investigate one such method, adding a parameter (plth) to capture the proportion of strongly deleterious mutations. We show that plth can improve the model fit when applied to individual species but can underestimate the true proportion of strongly deleterious mutations. The parameter can also artificially maximize the likelihood when used to jointly infer a distribution of fitness effects from multiple species. As plth and related parameters are used in current inference algorithms, our results are relevant with respect to avoiding model artifacts and improving future tools for inferring the distribution of fitness effects.",

    "abstract": "AI-based methods such as AlphaFold have revolutionized structural biology, often making it possible to predict protein structures with high accuracy. The accuracies of these predictions vary, however, and they do not include ligands, covalent modifications or other environmental factors. Here we focus on very-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions, evaluating how well they can be expected to describe the structure of a protein in a particular environment. We compare predictions with experimental crystallographic maps of the same proteins for 102 crystal structures. In many cases, those parts of AlphaFold predictions that were predicted with very high confidence matched experimental maps remarkably closely. In other cases, these predictions differed from experimental maps on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation, and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. Overall, C atoms in very-high-confidence parts of AlphaFold predictions differed from corresponding crystal structures by a median of 0.6 [A], and about 10% of these differed by more than 2 [A], each about twice the values found for pairs of crystal structures containing the same components but determined in different space groups. We suggest considering AlphaFold predictions as exceptionally useful hypotheses. We further suggest that it is important to consider the confidence in prediction when interpreting AlphaFold predictions and to carry out experimental structure determination to verify structural details, particularly those that involve interactions not included in the prediction.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus executes crucial functions from declarative memory to adaptive behaviors associated with cognition and emotion. However, the mechanisms of how morphogenesis and functions along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis are differentiated and integrated are still largely unclear. Here, we show that Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 genes are distinctively expressed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, respectively. The loss of Nr2f2 results in ectopic CA1/CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. The deficiency of Nr2f1 leads to the failed specification of dorsal CA1, among which there are place cells. The deletion of both Nr2f genes causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus with abnormalities of trisynaptic circuit and adult neurogenesis. Moreover, Nr2f1/2 may cooperate to guarantee appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the Lhx5-Lhx2 axis. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism that Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 converge to govern the differentiation and integration of distinct characteristics of the hippocampus in mice.",

We employed single-cell sequencing to investigate host transcriptomic response to ancestral and Alpha-strain SARS-CoV-2 infections within air-liquid-interface human nasal epithelial cells from adults and adolescents. Strong innate immune responses were observed across lowly-infected and bystander cell-types, and heightened in Alpha-infection. Contrastingly, the innate immune response of highly-infected cells was like mock-control cells. Alpha highly-infected cells showed increased expression of protein refolding genes compared with ancestral-strain-infected adolescent cells. Oxidative phosphorylation- and translation-related genes were down-regulated in bystander cells versus infected and mock-control cells, suggesting that the down-regulation is protective and up-regulation supports viral activity. Infected adult cells revealed up-regulation of these pathways compared with infected adolescents, implying enhanced pro-viral states in infected adults. Overall, this highlights the complexity of cell-type-, age- and viral-strain-dependent host epithelial responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the value of air-liquid-interface cultures.",

    "abstract": "Secondary and tertiary RNA structures play key roles in genome replication of single stranded positive sense RNA viruses. Complex, functional structures are particularly abundant in the untranslated regions of picornaviruses, where they are involved in initiation of translation, priming of new strand synthesis and genome circularisation. The 5' UTR of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is predicted to include a c. 360 nucleotide-long stem-loop, termed the short (S) fragment. This structure is highly conserved and essential for viral replication, but the precise function(s) are unclear. Here, we used selective 2' hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) to experimentally-determine aspects of the structure, alongside comparative genomic analyses to confirm structure conservation from a wide range of field isolates. To examine its role in virus replication, we introduced a series of deletions to the distal and proximal regions of the stem loop. These truncations affected genome replication in a size-dependent and, in some cases, host cell-dependent manner. Furthermore, during passage of viruses incorporating the largest tolerated deletion from the proximal region of the S fragment stem loop, an additional mutation was selected in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3Dpol, which influenced the function of the enzyme. These data suggest that the S fragment and 3Dpol interact in the formation of the FMDV replication complex.",

    "abstract": "1Genetic improvements of discrete characteristics such as flower color, the genetic improvements are obvious and easy to demonstrate; however, for characteristics that are measured on continuous scales, the genetic contributions are incremental and less obvious. Reliable and accurate methods are required to disentangle the confounding genetic and non-genetic components of quantitative traits. Stochastic simulations of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) breeding programs were performed to evaluate models to estimate the realized genetic gain (RGG) from 30 years of multi-environment trials (MET). True breeding values were simulated under an infinitesimal model to represent the genetic contributions to soybean seed yield under various MET conditions. Estimators were evaluated using objective criteria of bias and linearity. Results indicated all estimation models were biased. Covariance modeling as well as direct versus indirect estimation resulted in substantial differences in RGG estimation. Although there were no unbiased models, the three best-performing models resulted in an average bias of {+/-}7.41 kg/ha-1/yr-1 ({+/-}0.11 bu/ac-1/yr-1). Rather than relying on a single model to estimate RGG, we recommend the application of multiple models and consider the range of the estimated values. Further, based on our simulations parameters, we do not think it is appropriate to use any single models to compare breeding programs or quantify the efficiency of proposed new breeding strategies. Lastly, for public soybean programs breeding for maturity groups II and III in North America from 1989 to 2019, the range of estimated RGG values was from 18.16 to 39.68 kg/ha-1/yr-1 (0.27 to 0.59 bu/ac-1/yr-1).",

    "abstract": "The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a severe agricultural crop pest that has developed resistance to most current control methods, requiring the urgent development of novel strategies. Plant proteinase inhibitors (PINs) are small proteins that protect plants against pathogens and/or herbivores, likely by preventing efficient protein digestion. We identified 67 protease genes in the transcriptomes of three M. persicae lineages (USDA-Red, G002, and G006). Comparison of gene expression levels in aphid guts and whole aphids showed that several proteases, including a highly expressed serine protease, are significantly overexpressed in the guts. Furthermore, we identified three genes encoding serine protease inhibitors (SerPIN-II1, 2, and 3) in Nicotiana benthamiana, which is a non-preferred host for M. persicae. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) with a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vector and overexpression with a turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) vector, we demonstrated that N. benthamiana SerPIN-II1 and SerPIN-II2 cause reduced survival and growth, but do not affect aphid protein content. Similarly, SerPIN-II3 overexpression reduced survival and growth, and serpin-II3 knockout mutations, which we generated using CRISPR/Cas9, increased survival and growth. Whereas protein content was significantly increased in aphids fed on SerPIN-II3 overexpressing plants, it was decreased in aphids fed on serpin-II3 mutants. Together, our results show that three PIN-IIs from N. benthamiana, a non-preferred host plant, effectively inhibit M. persicae survival and growth, thereby representing a new resource for the development of aphid-resistant crop plants.",

    "abstract": "Adipokinetic hormone/corazonin-related peptide (ACP) and adipokinetic hormone (AKH) are two neuropeptides that demonstrate homology to the vertebrate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Despite the structural similarity and the close evolutionary relationship between the ACP and the AKH, their signaling systems function independently. To date, the role of ACP and its receptor (ACPR) remains unclear in the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) are often carried out on peptide ligands to determine critical residues for bioactivity and receptor activation; however, residues and features necessary for ligand binding and specificity in the receptors themselves are less studied. Herein, this study focuses on the ACP and AKH signaling systems and examines structural features of their receptors critical for conferring activation and ligand specificity. Firstly, to determine the specific ACPR regions most critical for ligand fidelity and specificity, ACPR chimeras were created by singly replacing each of the three ACPR extracellular loops (ECLs) in their entirety and incorporating the corresponding ECLs from the AKH receptor (AKHR). Heterologous functional assays determined that the three ACPR ECL chimera receptors with complete replacement of full individual ECLs showed no response to either ACP or AKH. These results suggest that the complete replacement of each individual extracellular loop is detrimental to ligand binding and recognition. Secondly, through a more targeted approach, we aimed to determine specific residues critical for functional ligand-binding by substituting only select highly conserved residues within the three ECLs of the ACPR with those from the AKHR. Modifications of specific and highly conserved residues in these ACPR ECLs chimeras suggest that the third extracellular loop contains the most critical residues necessary for ACP binding and receptor activation. In addition, the combination of two selectively-modified ACPR ECLs demonstrated a significant decrease in response to ACP compared to the native ACPR response. Interestingly, combining all of the ACPR ECLs chimeras together resulted in a significant decrease in response to ACP compared to native ACPR. Relatedly, a significantly increased response to AKH was observed in the receptor chimera combining selected modifications in all three ECLs compared to native ACPR. Hence, the particular residues essential for ACP ligand interaction were identified due to the detrimental effect that occurred in ACPR activation after the selective modification of crucial residues localized within the three extracellular domains of the receptor. These data provide key insight into how these two closely related neuropeptidergic systems maintain functional independence in the mosquito A. aegypti as well as other insects.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) requires a complex network of proteins that detect DNA damage, promote repair, and coordinate DNA repair with the cell cycle. The SQEF/Y C-terminal motif of histone H2A.X is rapidly phosphorylated ({gamma}H2A.X) upon induction of DNA damage. However, readers of this modification in plants have remained elusive. In animals mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) binds {gamma}H2A.X through a BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal (BRCT) domain. Individual BRCT domains or tandem BRCT domains (tBRCT) bind phosphorylated peptides and are predominantly associated with proteins involved in the DDR. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of BRCT domain proteome in Arabidopsis. Among 21 BRCT domain proteins, we identified BCP4 as a candidate ortholog of human MDC1. The C-terminal tBRCT domain of BCP4 bound {gamma}H2A.X in vitro and BCP4 localized into DNA damage-induced foci that were H2A.X dependent. We also show that although BCP1 has a dual tBRCT domain protein, it does not bind to {gamma}H2A.X, but co-localizes with {gamma}H2A.X in DNA damage-induced foci suggesting its function downstream of {gamma}H2A.X recognition. This along with tBRCT sequence similarities makes BCP1 functionally related to human PAXIP1. BCP1 and BCP4 are conserved in multicellular plants, and their evolution in Archaeplastida coincides with the acquisition of H2A.X in multicellular streptophytes. We conclude that BCP1 and BCP4 in plants and PAXIP1 and MDC1 in metazoa evolved independently from common ancestors with tBRCT domains.",

    "abstract": "Motile cells moving in multicellular organisms encounter microenvironments of locally heterogeneous mechanochemical composition. Individual compositional parameters like chemotactic signals, adhesiveness, and pore sizes are well known to be sensed by motile cells, providing individual guidance cues for cellular pathfinding. However, motile cells encounter diverse mechanochemical signals at the same time, raising the question of how cells respond to locally diverse and potentially competing signals on their migration routes. Here, we reveal that motile amoeboid cells require nuclear repositioning, termed nucleokinesis, for adaptive pathfinding in heterogeneous mechanochemical microenvironments. Using mammalian immune cells and the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we discover that frequent, rapid and long-distance nucleokinesis is a basic component of amoeboid pathfinding, enabling cells to reorientate quickly between locally competing cues. Amoeboid nucleokinesis comprises a two-step cell polarity switch and is driven by myosin II-forces, sliding the nucleus from a  losing to the  winning leading edge to re-adjust the nuclear to the cellular path. Impaired nucleokinesis distorts fast path adaptions and causes cellular arrest in the microenvironment. Our findings establish that nucleokinesis is required for amoeboid cell navigation. Given that motile single-cell amoebae, many immune cells, and some cancer cells utilize an amoeboid migration strategy, these results suggest that amoeboid nucleokinesis underlies cellular navigation during unicellular biology, immunity, and disease.",

GCA or PMR artery culture supernatants were applied to primary skin fibroblasts with or without IL-6 blocking agent to explore the induction of IL-6 associated cellular senescence.\n\nResultsSenescent cells were mainly present in GCA arteries at higher proportion compared to PMR (9.50% vs 2.66% respectively, p<0.0001) and were mainly originated from fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells. IL-6 was expressed by senescent fibroblasts and macrophages while MMP-9 by fibroblasts only. IL-6 positive senescent cells were associated with the extension of vascular inflammation (adventitial limited disease vs transmural inflammation: 10.02% vs 4.37% respectively, p<0.0001). GCA but not PMR artery culture supernatant could induce IL-6-associated senescence that was partially inhibited by IL-6 blockade.\n\nConclusionsSenescent cells with inflammatory phenotype are present in GCA arteries and are associated with the tissue inflammatory bulk. These findings might suggest a potential implication in disease pathogenesis by perpetuating inflammation and affecting vascular remodeling via IL-6 dependent mechanisms.",

Here we devised a genetically encoded mTORC1 inhibition reporter termed mTIR that exhibits a highly contrasted fluorescence puncta pattern in response to mTORC1 inhibition. mTIR specifically senses physiological, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in living cells and tissues. Importantly, mTIR can be applied as an powerful tool for imaging-based visual screening of mTORC1 inhibitors. By this method, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) that selectively inhibit mTORC1 by inducing nutrient-sensing gene expression. Thus, mTIR is a unique living cell reporter efficiently detecting the inhibition of mTORC1 activity, and the HDACi Panobinostat transcriptionally target mTORC1 signaling via amino acids sensing.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTHere we describe a novel class of pan-RAS inhibitor with highly potent and selective anticancer activity by killing cancer cells harboring mutations in RAS or with constitutively activated RAS resulting from mutations in upstream signaling components. A lead compound from this chemical family, ADT-007, binds RAS when in a nucleotide free transitional state to block loading of GTP, thereby interfering with RAS activation and disruption of binding to effectors such as RAF and PI3K to suppress MAPK and AKT signaling. ADT-007 potently inhibits the growth of cultured human and murine cancer cell lines with single-digit nM IC50 values irrespective of specific RAS isozyme or mutational codon. ADT-007 also inhibits tumor growth in vivo through inhibition of RAS-MAPK signaling in syngeneic, immune competent and xenogeneic, immune deficient mouse models of colon and pancreatic cancer. In RAG 1 -/- mice the activity of ADT-007 is partially inhibited indicating a role for the adaptive immune system in ADT-007-mediated tumor growth inhibition. Ex vivo analyses of tumor infiltrating leukocytes, reveals that ADT-007 enhances T cell functions in the pancreatic and colorectal tumor immune microenvironment.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEADT-007 represents a 1st-in-class pan-RAS inhibitor with broad anticancer activity across all RAS driven cancers and unique chemical selectivity to allow normal cells to be spared from pan-RAS inhibition. ADT-007 also has the potential to modulate the adaptive immune response in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). These data support future clinical trials of an orally bioavailable prodrug of ADT-007 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with CRC or PDAC regardless of the underlying mutation or in combination with immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "TREM2, a myeloid cell-specific signaling molecule, controls essential functions of microglia and impacts on the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. TREM2 is also highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and plays detrimental roles in an experimental mouse sarcoma model. Here we studied whether TREM2 influences glioma progression. We found a sex- dependent effect of TREM2: the glioma volume is significantly attenuated in TREM2- deficient male but not female mice injected with GL261-EGFP glioma cells. The accumulation of glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs) and vascularization is reduced in male TREM2-deficient mice. A transcriptomic analysis of glioma tissue revealed that TREM2 deficiency suppresses angiogenic genes and MHC clusters. In an organotypic slice model devoid of functional vascularization, the tumor size was not affected by TREM2-deficiency. In human resection samples from glioblastoma, TREM2 is upregulated in GAMs. Based on the TCGA and CGGA databases, the TREM2 expression levels are negatively correlated with survival. Thus, the TREM2-dependent crosstalk between GAMs and the vasculature formation promotes glioma growth.\n\nGraphic abstractTREM2-dependent crosstalk between glioma-associated microglia/macrophages and the vasculature formation promotes glioma growth in male glioma mouse model.

    "abstract": "To cope with novel virus infections to which no prior adaptive immunity exists, the body strongly relies on the innate immune system. In such cases, including infections with SARS-CoV-2, children tend to fair better than adults. In the context of COVID-19, it became evident that a rapid interferon response at the site of primary infection is key for successful control of the virus and prevention of severe disease. The airway epithelium of children was shown to exhibit a primed state already at homeostasis and to respond particularly well to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanism for this priming remained elusive. Here we show that interactions between airway mucosal immune cells and epithelial cells are stronger in children, and via cytokine-mediated signaling lead to IRF-1-dependent upregulation of the viral sensors RIG-I and MDA5. Based on a cellular in vitro model we show that stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can induce a robust interferon-beta response towards SARS-CoV-2 in a lung epithelial cell line otherwise unresponsive to this virus. This is mediated by type I interferon, interferon-gamma and TNF, and requires induction of both, RIG-I and MDA5. In single cell-analysis of nasal swab samples the same cytokines are found to be elevated in mucosal immune cells of children, correlating with elevated epithelial expression of viral sensors. In vitro analysis of PBMC derived from healthy adolescents and adults confirm that immune cells of younger individuals show increased cytokine production and potential to prime epithelial cells. In co-culture with SARS-CoV-2-infected A549 cells, PBMC from adolescents significantly enhance the antiviral response. Taken together, our study suggests that higher numbers and a more vigorous activity of innate immune cells in the airway mucosa of children tune the set-point of the epithelial antiviral system. This likely is a major contributor to the robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children. Our findings shed light on the molecular underpinnings of the stunning resilience of children towards severe COVID-19, and may propose a novel concept for immunoprophylactic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) modulates cellular metabolism to support productive infection, and the HCMV UL38 protein drives many aspects of this HCMV-induced metabolic program. However, it remains to be determined whether virally-induced metabolic alterations might induce novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in virally infected cells. Here, we explore how HCMV infection and the UL38 protein modulate cellular metabolism and how these changes alter the response to nutrient limitation. We find that expression of UL38, either in the context of HCMV infection or in isolation, sensitizes cells to glucose limitation resulting in cell death. This sensitivity is mediated through UL38s inactivation of the TSC complex subunit 2 (TSC2) protein, a central metabolic regulator that possesses tumor-suppressive properties. Further, expression of UL38 or the inactivation of TSC2 results in anabolic rigidity in that the resulting increased levels of fatty acid biosynthesis are insensitive to glucose limitation. This failure to regulate fatty acid biosynthesis in response to glucose availability sensitizes cells to glucose limitation, resulting in cell death unless fatty acid biosynthesis is inhibited. These experiments identify a regulatory circuit between glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis that is critical for cell survival upon glucose limitation and highlight a metabolic vulnerability associated with viral infection and the inactivation of normal metabolic regulatory controls.\n\nImportanceViruses modulate host cell metabolism to support the mass production of viral progeny. For Human Cytomegalovirus, we find that the viral UL38 protein is critical for driving these pro-viral metabolic changes. However, our results indicate that these changes come at a cost, as UL38 induces an anabolic rigidity that leads to a metabolic vulnerability. We find that UL38 decouples the link between glucose availability and fatty acid biosynthetic activity. Normal cells respond to glucose limitation by down-regulating fatty acid biosynthesis. Expression of UL38 results in the inability to modulate fatty acid biosynthesis in response to glucose limitation, which results in cell death. We find this vulnerability in the context of viral infection, but this linkage between fatty acid biosynthesis, glucose availability, and cell death could have broader implications in other contexts or pathologies that rely on glycolytic remodeling, for example, oncogenesis.",

We sought to develop in vitro co-culture systems to identify interactions and study biofilm formation by these two opportunistic pathogens. We found that VRE quickly acidifies media containing glucose, fructose and trehalose to a pH that is not compatible with growth of C. difficile. Acidification was necessary and sufficient for VRE-mediated suppression of C. difficile and this mechanism is conserved among a panel of enterococci and Clostridia. Robust co-culture conditions and biofilm formation were achieved by managing the available carbon source.\n\nImportanceThe steady state pH of the colon in humans and mice is below the growth limiting pH for C. difficile found in this study and others. Following treatment with antibiotics, pH of the colon rises to neutral or slightly alkaline, which correlates with the loss of colonization resistance to C. difficile. These data suggest that manipulation of pH by managing the available carbon source may affect colonization by pathogenic and commensal Clostridioides.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an adaptable human pathogen causing life-threatening endocarditis and bacteraemia. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is alarmingly common, and treatment is confined to last-line antibiotics. Vancomycin is the treatment of choice for MRSA bacteraemia and vancomycin treatment failure is often associated with vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains termed VISA. The regulatory 3 UTR of vigR mRNA contributes to vancomycin tolerance in the clinical VISA isolate JKD6008 and upregulates the lytic transglycosylase IsaA. Using MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS), we find that the vigR 3 UTR also interacts with mRNAs involved in carbon metabolism, amino acid biogenesis, cell wall biogenesis, and virulence. The vigR 3 UTR was found to repress dapE, a succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase required for lysine and cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis, suggesting a broader role in controlling cell wall metabolism and vancomycin tolerance. Deletion of the vigR 3 UTR increased VISA virulence in a wax moth larvae model, and we find that an isaA mutant is completely attenuated in the larvae model. Sequence and structural analysis of the vigR 3 UTR indicates that the UTR has expanded through the acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus repeat insertions (STAR repeats) that partly contribute sequence for the isaA interaction seed and may functionalise the 3 UTR. Our findings reveal an extended regulatory network for vigR, uncovering a novel mechanism of regulation of cell wall metabolism and virulence in a clinical S. aureus isolate.",

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are crucial components of cell membranes. Sphingolipid {Delta}8-unsaturation is more specific to plants and is involved in the regulation of stress responses. The structure and functions of sphingolipids in microalgae are still poorly understood. Ostreococus tauri is a minimal microalga at the base of the green lineage, and is therefore a key organism for understanding lipid evolution. The present work reports the characterisation as well as the temperature regulation of sphingolipids and {Delta}8-sphingolipid desaturase from O. tauri. Complex sphingolipids are glycosylceramides with unique glycosyl moieties encompassing hexuronic acid residues, reminiscent of bacterial glucuronosylceramides, with up to three additional hexose residues. In contrast, the ceramide backbones show limited variety, with dihydroxylated C18/C18:1E{Delta}8 sphingoid bases and C16:0 fatty-acyl chain being the main compounds.\n\nThe sphingolipid {Delta}8-desaturase from O. tauri, although phylogenetically related to plant homologues has a substrate preference similar to the diatom homologue. Both sphingolipid {Delta}8-desaturase transcripts and sphingolipid {Delta}8-unsaturation are regulated in a temperature- dependent manner being higher at 14{degrees}C than 24{degrees}C. Overexpressing the sphingolipid {Delta}8- desaturase in O. tauri at 24{degrees}C results in higher sphingolipid unsaturation and impairs the increase in cell size, structure and chlorophyll. In particular, the cell-size defect is not detected in cells acclimated to 14{degrees}C and is furthermore suppressed upon transfer from 24{degrees}C to 14{degrees}C. Our work provides the first functional evidence for the involvement of sphingolipid {Delta}8-unsaturation for temperature acclimation in microalgae, suggesting that this function is an ancestral feature in the green lineage.",

Suffering from a poor prognosis and limited treatment options, tumor recurrences are virtually inevitable. Additionally, treatment resistance is very common for this disease and worsens the prognosis. These and others factors are hypothesized to be largely due to the fact that glioblastoma cells are known to be able to obtain stem-like traits and thereby driving these phenotypes. Recently, we could show that the in vitro and ex vivo treatment of glioblastoma stem-like cells with the hormonally active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol (1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3) can block stemness in a subset of cell lines and reduce tumor growth. Here, we expanded our cell panel to over 40 different cultures and can show that, while half of the tested cell lines are sensitive, a quarter can be classified as high-responders. Using genetic and proteomic analysis, we further determined that treatment success can be partially explained by specific polymorphism of the Vitamin D3 receptor and that high-responders display a proteome suggestive of blockade of stemness, as well as migratory potential.",

Using homology modelling, we generated PS1- and PS2-{gamma}-secretase models bound to substrates in the A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 generation pathways and Notch1 S3 and S4 cleavage site substrates. Metadynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations were used to explore conformational ensembles and substrate preferences. PS2-{gamma}-secretase exhibited increased conformational flexibility and preferential binding energy for initiating the A{beta}42 pathway compared to PS1-{gamma}-secretase. Additionally, Notch1 exhibits a preference for binding to PS2-{gamma}-secretase over PS1-{gamma}-secretase. This study provides valuable insights into the conformational dynamics of {gamma}-secretase bound to different substrates within a cleavage pathway, improving our understanding of substrate processivity.

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in working-age populations. FTO is an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase that participates in various biological events, while its role in DR remains elusive. Herein, we detected elevated FTO expression in retinal proliferative membranes of DR patients. FTO promoted endothelial cell (EC) cell cycle progression and tip cell formation to facilitate angiogenesis in vitro, in mice and in zebrafish. FTO also regulated EC-pericyte crosstalk to trigger diabetic microvascular leakage, and mediated EC-microglia interactions to induce retinal inflammation and neurodegeneration in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, FTO affected EC features via modulating CDK2 mRNA stability in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. FTO up-regulation under diabetic conditions was driven by lactate mediated histone lactylation. FB23-2, an inhibitor to FTOs m6A demethylase activity, suppressed angiogenic phenotypes in vivo and in vitro. Noteworthy, we developed a nanoplatform encapsulating FB23-2 for systemic administration, and confirmed its targeting and therapeutic efficiencies in mice. Collectively, our study demonstrated that FTO coordinates EC biology and retinal homeostasis in DR, providing a promising nanotherapeutic approach for DR.",

    "abstract": "Polarised epithelial cell divisions represent a fundamental mechanism for tissue maintenance and morphogenesis; their dysregulation often leads to developmental disorders and cancer. Morphological and mechanical changes in the plasma membrane influence the organisation and crosstalk of microtubules and actin at the cell cortex, thereby regulating the mitotic spindle machinery and chromosome segregation. Yet, the precise mechanisms linking plasma membrane remodelling to cell polarity and cortical cytoskeleton dynamics to ensure accurate execution of mitosis in mammalian epithelial cells remain poorly understood. Here we experimentally manipulated the density of mammary epithelial cells in culture, which led to several mitotic defects. We found that perturbation of cell-cell adhesion integrity impairs the dynamics of the plasma membrane during mitosis, affecting the shape and size of mitotic cells and resulting in defects in mitosis progression and generating daughter cells with aberrant cytoarchitecture. In these conditions, F-actin-astral microtubule crosstalk is impaired leading to mitotic spindle misassembly and misorientation, which in turn contributes to chromosome mis-segregation. Mechanistically, we identify the S100 Ca2+-binding protein A11 (S100A11) as a key membrane-associated regulator that forms a complex with E-cadherin and LGN to coordinate plasma membrane remodelling with E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and LGN-dependent mitotic spindle machinery. We conclude that plasma membrane-mediated maintenance of mammalian epithelial cell identity is crucial for correct execution of polarised cell divisions, genome maintenance and safeguarding tissue integrity.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells are the first point of contact for bacteria entering the respiratory tract. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an obligate human pathobiont of the nasal mucosa, carried asymptomatically but also the cause of severe pneumonia. The role of the epithelium in maintaining homeostatic interactions or mounting an inflammatory response to invasive S. pneumoniae is currently poorly understood. However, studies have shown that chromatin modifications, at the histone level, induced by bacterial pathogens interfere with the host transcriptional program and promote infection. In this study, we demonstrate that S. pneumoniae actively induces di-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2), which persists for at least 9 days upon clearance of bacteria with antibiotics. We show that infection establishes a unique epigenetic program affecting the transcriptional response of epithelial cells, rendering them more permissive upon secondary infection. Our results establish H3K4me2 as a unique modification induced by infection, distinct from H3K4me3, which localizes to enhancer regions genome-wide. Therefore, this study reveals evidence that bacterial infection leaves a memory in epithelial cells after bacterial clearance, in an epigenomic mark, thereby altering cellular responses for subsequent infection.",

    "abstract": "Human neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold a great potential to study (dys)functional human skeletal muscle (SkM) in vitro. The three-dimensional (3D) self-assembly of NMOs leads to the generation of spheroids, whose 3D organization cannot be controlled. Indeed, proper development, maturation and function of the innervated SkM require a well-defined multiscale 3D organization of the cells in a tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) context. We hypothesized that extracellular structural imprinting along with hiPSC small-molecule-based differentiation could provide self-assembly guidance driving NMO morphogenesis and promoting the maturation and function of the human neuronal-coupled SkM in vitro models. We found that SkM ECM, provided as decellularized skeletal muscle, is able to reproducibly guide the morphogenesis of differentiating hiPSC toward multiscale structured tissue-like NMOs (t-NMOs). T-NMOs show contractile activity and possess functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), with mature neuromuscular system upon 30 days of hiPSC differentiation. We found that t-NMO could mimic altered muscle contraction upon administration of neurotoxins that act at NMJ level. Finally, we used hiPSCs derived from patients affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to produce DMD t-NMOs that, upon neuronal stimulation, were able to mimic the altered SkM contractility and calcium dynamics typical of the disease. Altogether, our data confirm the ability of t-NMO platform to model in vitro human neuromuscular system (patho)physiology.",

Current models posit that AVE differentiation is promoted globally by epiblast-derived Nodal signals, and spatially restricted by a BMP gradient established by the extraembryonic ectoderm. Here, we report spatially restricted AVE differentiation in bilayered embryo-like aggregates made from mouse embryonic stem cells that lack an extraembryonic ectoderm. Notably, clusters of AVE cells also form in pure visceral endoderm cultures upon activation of Nodal signaling, indicating that tissue-intrinsic factors restrict AVE differentiation. We identify Wnt signaling as a tissue-intrinsic factor that antagonizes AVE-inducing Nodal signals. Together, our results suggest that interactions between epiblast and visceral endoderm alone enable local AVE differentiation in the absence of graded BMP signals. This may be a flexible solution for axis patterning in a wide range of embryo geometries.",

    "abstract": "The zoo soundscape has a number of important implications for animal welfare, management, and conservation. However, despite its importance, the zoo soundscape is yet to be examined in depth using multiple measures. Consistent human presence can influence the zoo soundscape. However, it is difficult to determine the specific impact of human presence, as visitors are usually present during the day when animals are active. The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 provided a unique opportunity to study zoo soundscapes in the absence of visitors. We compared the sound environment during the 2020 closure period to a comparable open period in 2019 across three zoo aviaries, examining broad band frequency measures of sound pressure levels, sound pressure levels in defined frequency bands, and acoustic indices (Acoustic Complexity Index and Normalized Difference Soundscape Index) to describe the zoo soundscape. Acoustic indices have not, to our knowledge, previously been used in the zoo setting, although they may provide a useful metric to assess sound disturbance. Therefore, we also used this natural experiment to explore how successful these measures may be in assessing disturbances in captive environments. We found a significant effect of human presence on the sound environment; aviaries were generally quieter with less low frequency noise and with a greater proportion of biotic sound during the 2020 zoo closure period. We argue that NDSI could be a useful index for determining anthropogenic disturbance in zoos, although further information on how it is influenced by additional factors, such as human speech, would be beneficial. The use of multiple measures to assess the sound environment in zoos can provide additional information beyond  loudness, such as frequencies where sound energy is concentrated and characteristics of the soundscape, which could be used to better target management and mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Actin filament turnover plays a central role in shaping actin networks, yet the feedback mechanism between network architecture and filament assembly dynamics remains unclear. The activity of ADF/cofilin, the main protein family responsible for filament disassembly, has been mainly studied at the single filament level. Here, we report that fascin, by crosslinking filaments into bundles, strongly slows down filament disassembly by cofilin. We show that this is mainly due to a slower nucleation of the first cofilin clusters, which occurs up to 100-fold slower on large bundles compared to single filaments. In contrast, severing at cofilin cluster boundaries is unaffected by fascin bundling. After the nucleation of an initial cofilin cluster on a filament of a bundle, we observe the local removal of fascin. Surprisingly, the nucleation of cofilin clusters on adjacent filaments is highly enhanced, locally. We propose that this inter-filament cooperativity in cofilin binding arises from the local propagation of the cofilin-induced change in helicity from one filament to the other filaments of the bundle. Taken together, these observations reveal the molecular events explaining why, despite inter-filament cooperativity, fascin crosslinking protects actin filaments from cofilin-induced disassembly. These findings highlight the important role played by crosslinkers in organizing actin networks and modulating the activity of other regulatory proteins.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has marked the spread of a novel human coronavirus. While the viral life cycle is well understood, most of the interactions at the virus-host interface remain elusive. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms behind disease severity and immune evasion are still largely unknown. Conserved elements of the viral genome such as secondary structures within the 5- and 3-untranslated regions (UTRs) serve as attractive targets of interest and could prove crucial in furthering our understanding of virus-host interactions. It has been proposed that microRNA (miR) interactions with viral components could be used by both the virus and host for their own benefit. Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome 3-UTR has revealed the potential for host cellular miR binding sites, providing sites for specific interactions with the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 genome 3-UTR binds the host cellular miRNAs miR-760-3p, miR-34a-5p, and miR-34b-5p, which have been shown to influence translation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), as well as progranulin (PGRN), respectively, proteins that have roles in the host immune response and inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, recent work suggests the potential of miR-34a-5p and miR-34b-5p to target and inhibit translation of viral proteins. Native gel electrophoresis and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the binding of these miRs to their predicted sites within the SARS-CoV-2 genome 3-UTR. Additionally, we investigated 2-fluoro-D-arabinonucleic acid (FANA) analogs of these miRNAs as competitive binding inhibitors for these miR binding interactions. The mechanisms detailed in this study have the potential to drive the development of antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provide a potential molecular basis for cytokine release syndrome and immune evasion which could implicate the host-virus interface.\n\nAuthor SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now plagued the world for over three years. In this time, scientific advancements have allowed for the development of mRNA vaccines and targeted antiviral drugs. However, many mechanisms of the viral life cycle, as well as the interactions at the host-virus interface, remain unknown. The host immune response is of particular interest in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection, with observed dysregulation in both severe and mild cases of infection. To uncover the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed immune dysregulation, we investigated host microRNAs associated with the immune response, particularly miR-760-3p, miR-34a-5p, and miR-34b-5p and emphasize them as targets of binding by the viral genome 3-UTR. We utilized biophysical methods to characterize the interactions between these miRs and the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome 3-UTR. Lastly, we introduce 2-fluoro-D-arabinonucleic acid analogs of these microRNAs as disruptors of the binding interactions, with intent of therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses that encode core replication proteins and accessory factors involved in nucleotide metabolism and DNA repair. Mammalian Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UNG) excise deleterious uracil residues from their genomic DNA. Each herpesvirus UNG studied to date has demonstrated conservation of the enzymatic function to excise uracil residues from DNA. We previously reported that a murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV68) with a stop codon in ORF46 (ORF46.stop) that encodes for vUNG was defective in lytic replication and latency in vivo. However, a mutant virus that expressed a catalytically inactive vUNG (ORF46.CM) had no replication defect, unless coupled with additional mutations in the catalytic motif of the viral dUTPase (ORF54.CM). The disparate phenotypes observed in the vUNG mutants led us to explore the non-enzymatic properties of vUNG. Immunoprecipitation of vUNG followed by mass spectrometry in MHV68-infected fibroblasts identified a complex comprised of the cognate viral DNA polymerase, vPOL encoded by ORF9, and the viral DNA polymerase processivity factor, vPPF encoded by ORF59. MHV68 vUNG colocalized with vPOL and vPPF in subnuclear structures consistent with viral replication compartments. In reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations, the vUNG formed a complex with the vPOL and vPPF upon transfection with either factor alone, or in combination. Last, we determined that key catalytic residues of vUNG are not required for interactions with vPOL and vPPF upon transfection or in the context of infection. We conclude that the vUNG of MHV68 associates with vPOL and vPPF independently of its catalytic activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEGammaherpesviruses encode a uracil-DNA glycosylase (vUNG) that is presumed to excise uracil residues from viral genomes. We previously identified the vUNG enzymatic activity, but not the protein itself, as dispensable for gammaherpesvirus replication in vivo. In this study, we report a non-enzymatic role for the viral UNG of a murine gammaherpesvirus to form a complex with two key components of the viral DNA replication machinery. Understanding the role of the vUNG in this viral DNA replication complex may inform the development of antiviral drugs that combat gammaherpesvirus associated cancers.",

    "abstract": "Enterococci are commensal gut microbes of most land animals. They diversified over hundreds of millions of years adapting to evolving hosts and host diets. Of over 60 known enterococcal species, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium uniquely emerged in the antibiotic era among leading causes of multidrug resistant hospital-associated infection. The basis for the association of particular enterococcal species with a host is largely unknown. To begin deciphering enterococcal species traits that drive host association, and to assess the pool of Enterococcus-adapted genes from which known facile gene exchangers such as E. faecalis and E. faecium may draw, we collected 886 enterococcal strains from nearly 1,000 specimens representing widely diverse hosts, ecologies and geographies. This provided data on the global occurrence and host associations of known species, identifying 18 new species in the process expanding genus diversity by >25%. The novel species harbor diverse genes associated with toxins, detoxification, and resource acquisition. E. faecalis and E. faecium were isolated from a wide diversity of hosts highlighting their generalist properties, whereas most other species exhibited more restricted distributions indicative of specialized host associations. The expanded species diversity permitted the Enterococcus genus phylogeny to be viewed with unprecedented resolution, allowing features to be identified that distinguish its four deeply rooted clades as well as genes associated with range expansion, such as B-vitamin biosynthesis and flagellar motility. Collectively, this work provides an unprecedentedly broad and deep view of the genus Enterococcus, potential threats to human health, and new insights into its evolution.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEEnterococci, host-associated microbes that are now leading drug-resistant hospital pathogens, arose as animals colonized land over 400 million years ago. To globally assess the diversity of enterococci now associated with land animals, we collected 886 enterococcal specimens from a wide range of geographies and ecologies, ranging from urban environments to remote areas generally inaccessible to humans. Species determination and genome analysis revealed host associations from generalists to specialists, and identified 18 new species, increasing the genus by over 25%. This added diversity provided greater resolution of the genus clade structure, identifying new features associated with species radiations. Moreover, the high rate of new species discovery shows that tremendous genetic diversity in Enterococcus remains to be discovered.",

The mammalian Rb family comprises Rb, p107, and p130, with overlapping and unique roles in gene regulation. Drosophila experienced an independent gene duplication event, leading to the Rbf1 and Rbf2 paralogs. To uncover the significance of paralogy in the Rb family, we used CRISPRi. We engineered dCas9 fusions to Rbf1 and Rbf2, and deployed them to gene promoters in developing Drosophila tissue to study their relative impacts on gene expression. On some genes, both Rbf1 and Rbf2 mediate potent repression, in a highly distance-dependent manner. In other cases, the two proteins have different effects on phenotype and gene expression, indicating different functional potential. In a direct comparison of Rb activity on endogenous genes and transiently transfected reporters, we found that only qualitative, but not key quantitative aspects of repression were conserved, indicating that the native chromatin environment generates context-specific effects of Rb activity. Our study uncovers the complexity of Rb-mediated transcriptional regulation in a living organism, which is clearly impacted by the different promoter landscapes and the evolution of the Rb proteins themselves.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic infections are a global occurrence and impact the health of many species. Coinfections, where two or more species of parasite are present in a host, are a common phenomenon across species. Coinfecting parasites can interact directly, or indirectly via their manipulation of (and susceptibility to) the immune system of their shared host. Helminths, such as the cestode Schistocephalus solidus, are well known to suppress immunity of their host (threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus), potentially facilitating other parasite species. Yet, hosts can evolve a more robust immune response (as seen in some stickleback populations), potentially turning facilitation into inhibition. Using wild-caught stickleback from 21 populations with non-zero S. solidus prevalence, we tested an a priori hypothesis that S. solidus infection facilitates infection by other parasites. Consistent with this hypothesis, individuals with S. solidus infections have 18.6% higher richness of other parasites, compared to S. solidus-uninfected individuals from the same lakes. This facilitation-like trend is stronger in lakes where S. solidus is particularly successful but is reversed in lakes with sparse and smaller cestodes (indicative of stronger host immunity). These results suggest that a geographic mosaic of host-parasite coevolution might lead to a mosaic of between-parasite facilitation/inhibition effects.",

    "abstract": "The explosive adaptive radiation of Haplochromine cichlids in Lake Victoria, East Africa, produced 500 endemic species within only 15,000 years. A paedophage or an egg-eater is considered a unique example of trophic adaptation. Many field studies reported that more than 200 cichlids have extinct due to the upsurge of Nile perch, a carnivorous species introduced to the lake in the 1950s. Especially, piscivorous cichlids like paedophages were critically damaged by Nile perch predation. Here, we performed a genome-wide evolutionary study of the paedophages in Lake Victoria to understand their past demographic events and phylogenetic relationships. We discovered evidence of a recent, short-period, and severe bottleneck in a paedophage \"matumbi hunter\". Interestingly, the signature of a strong bottleneck, as observed in matumbi hunter, was not detected in other species including paedophagus species. In addition, it was revealed that the population size of matumbi hunter started to decline 30 years ago and recover from 20 to 10 years ago, corresponding to the time of both disappearance and resurgence of Lake Victoria Haplochromines were reported. Although population structure analyses showed that matumbi hunter is composed of a unique genetic component, phylogenetic analyses supported its strong monophyly with other paedophagus species. These results suggest that the paedophages originated only once in Lake Victoria followed by the decline of genetic diversity in matumbi hunter. This study succeeded to demonstrate the demographic events triggered by invasive species and associated genomic consequences of the unique trophic group, promoting a holistic understanding of adaptive radiation.",

    "abstract": "The expansion and intensification of livestock production is predicted to promote the emergence of pathogens. As pathogens sometimes jump between species this can affect the health of humans as well as livestock. Here we investigate how livestock microbiota can act as a source of these emerging pathogens through analysis of Streptococcus suis, a ubiquitous component of the respiratory microbiota of pigs that is also a major cause of disease on pig farms and an important zoonotic pathogen. Combining molecular dating, phylogeography and comparative genomic analyses of a large collection of isolates, we find that several pathogenic lineages of S. suis emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, during an early period of growth in pig farming. These lineages have since spread between countries and continents, mirroring trade in live pigs. They are distinguished by the presence of three genomic islands with putative roles in metabolism and cell adhesion, and an ongoing reduction in genome size, which may reflect their recent shift to a more pathogenic ecology. Reconstructions of the evolutionary histories of these islands reveal constraints on pathogen emergence that could inform control strategies, with pathogenic lineages consistently emerging from one subpopulation of S. suis and acquiring genes through horizontal transfer from other pathogenic lineages. These results shed light on the capacity of the microbiota to rapidly evolve to exploit changes in their host population and suggest that the impact of changes in farming on the pathogenicity and zoonotic potential of S. suis is yet to be fully realised.",

    "abstract": "Chemokine signalling performs key functions in cell migration via chemoattraction, such as attracting leukocytes to the site of infection during host defence. The system consists of a ligand, the chemokine, usually secreted outside the cell, and a chemokine receptor on the surface of a target cell that recognises the ligand. A number of non-canonical components interact with the system. While canonical components have been described in vertebrate lineages, the distribution of the non-canonical components is less clear. Uncertainty over the relationships between canonical and non-canonical components hampers our understanding of the evolution of the system. We used phylogenetic methods, including gene-tree to species-tree reconciliation to untangle the relationships between canonical and non-canonical components, identify gene duplication events and clarify the origin of the system. We found that unrelated ligand groups independently evolved chemokine-like functions. We found non-canonical ligands outside vertebrates, such as TAFA \"chemokines\" found in urochordates. In contrast, all receptor groups are vertebrate-specific and all - except ACKR1 - originated from a common ancestor in early vertebrates. Both ligand and receptor copy numbers expanded through gene duplication events at the base of jawed vertebrates, with subsequent waves of innovation occurring in bony fish and mammals.",

We revisit mosquito collections of varying ages; some made by early tropical medicine pioneers over 100 years ago.

    "abstract": "Sterol intermediates of cholesterol synthesis are largely dedicated to cholesterol. Here we assess how they influence downstream gene regulatory pathways by developing knockouts (KOs) for consecutive enzymes of cholesterol synthesis. Depletion of CYP51, DHCR24 and SC5D resulted in accumulation of specific sterols. The overlap of deregulated genes was only 9% in terms of steroid metabolism and proliferation control, with majority of pathways changed in just one KO. The CYP51 KO with highly elevated 24,25-dihydrolanosterol showed significantly higher proportion of cells in the G2+M phase, in line with enriched cancer and cell cycle pathways, and elevated LEF1 by activation of WNT/NFKB/SMAD signalling. In contrast, SC5D and DHCR24 KOs (with elevated lathosterol or desmosterol) slowed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis with downregulated E2F, mitosis, cell cycle transition, and enriched HNF1A tumor suppressor. These findings demonstrate that sterols from cholesterol synthesis control distinct gene regulatory pathways, and only early sterols promote cell proliferation.",

In this work, using human embryonic stem cell derived optogenetic neurons, we report the in-situ formation of the NTMs on a 2-dimensional micro electrode array with an intimate electrical contact between the electrodes and the tissue. These NTMs were optimized during the differentiation phase of the cells to enrich for neuronal populations that expressed receptors responsible for activating spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Using an optical stimulation regiment with millisecond temporal and micrometer spatial resolution, we were able to program the otherwise omnidirectional spontaneous firing in the NTMs to demonstrate directional firing across different shapes of the NTMs. Our work can pave the way for developing cellular based computational devices, bio-processors, and biological memories.",

    "abstract": "In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro- and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and therefore a bottleneck towards creating physiologically relevant models. Addressing this limitation, we introduced a novel technique, termed Embedded Extrusion-Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion-bioprinting and layer-less, ultra-fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing to spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light-responsive microgels were developed as permissive microenvironment for cell homing and self-organization, and as bioresins ({micro}Resins) for light-based bioprinting. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of these gelatin-based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. {micro}Resins can then be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimetre-scale, granular hydrogel-based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids within microgels enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof-of-concept, EmVP was applied to create complex synthetic biology-inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic-engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with enhanced functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.",

Applying a multimodal array of immunologic, genomic, and microbiological assays, we find more overlap than expected between populations. The key TFs play different roles, some essential for subset identity, others driving functional gene signatures. Functional divergence was clearest under challenge. Single-cell genomics revealed a spectrum of phenotypes between the Helios+ and Ror{gamma}+ poles, different Treg-inducing bacteria inducing the same Treg phenotypes to varying degrees, not distinct populations. TCR clonotypes in monocolonized mice revealed that Helios+ and Ror{gamma}+ Tregs are related, and cannot be uniquely equated to tTreg and pTreg.

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (FLUAV) of the H9N2 subtype are zoonotic pathogens that cause significant economic damage to the poultry industry. Vaccination to prevent and control H9N2 infections in poultry is widely employed in the Middle East and Asia. We used phylogenetics and antigenic analysis to study the antigenic properties of the H9 hemagglutinin (HA) using sera produced in Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). Consensus HA1 sequences were generated to capture antigenic diversity among isolates. We constructed chimeric H9N2 viruses containing the HA1 of each consensus sequence on a constant isogenic backbone. The resulting viruses were used to generate antisera from quail, a common and significant minor poultry species whose anti-HA response profiles remain poorly defined. Antigenic maps were generated by plotting the cross-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) data from the panel of quail sera against the chimeric constructs and 51 H9 field isolates. The chimeric antigens were divided into four different antigenic profiles (cyan, blue, orange, and red). Site-directed mutagenesis analysis showed 9 amino acid positions of antigenic relevance. Substitutions at amino acid positions 149, 150, and 180 (H9 HA numbering) had relatively significant impact on HI activity using quail sera. Substitutions E180A and R131K/E180A led to the most significant antigenic change transitions. This study provides insights into the antigenic profile of H9 FLUAVs, with important implications for understanding antigenic drift and improving vaccine development for use in minor poultry species.\n\nIMPORTANCEDetermining the relevant amino acids involved in antigenic drift on the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) is critical to understand influenza virus evolution and efficient assessment of vaccine strains relative to current circulating strains. We used antigenic cartography to generate an antigenic map of the H9 HA using sera produced in one of the most relevant minor poultry species, Japanese quail. Key antigenic positions were identified and tested to confirm their impact on the antigenic profile. This work provides a better understanding of the antigenic diversity of the H9 HA as it relates to reactivity to quail sera and will facilitate a rational approach for selecting more efficacious vaccines against poultry-origin H9 influenza viruses in minor poultry species.",

    "abstract": "Assimilation of sulfur is vital to all organisms. In S. cerevisiae, inorganic sulfate is first reduced to sulfide, which is then reacted to an organic carbon backbone by the Met17 enzyme. The resulting homocysteine can then be converted to all other essential organosulfurs such as methionine, cysteine, and glutathione. This pathway has been known for nearly half a century, and met17 mutants have long been classified as organosulfur auxotrophs which are unable to grow on sulfate as the sole sulfur source. Surprisingly, we found that met17{Delta} could grow on sulfate, albeit only at sufficiently high cell densities. We show that the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide gas underpins this density-dependent growth of met17{Delta} on sulfate, and that the locus YLL058W (HSU1) enables met17{Delta} cells to assimilate hydrogen sulfide. Hsu1 protein is induced during sulfur starvation and under exposure to high sulfide in wildtype cells, suggesting multiple functions of this gene. In a mathematical model, the low efficiency of sulfide assimilation in met17{Delta} can explain the observed density-dependent growth of met17{Delta} on sulfate. Thus, having uncovered and explained the paradoxical growth of a commonly used \"auxotroph\", our findings may impact the design of future studies in yeast genetics, metabolism, and volatile-mediated microbial interactions.",

It is encoded by the large invasion plasmid, pINV, and is thought to counteract the transcriptional silencing mediated by the nucleoid structuring protein, H-NS. Mutations in virB lead to loss of virulence. Studies suggest that VirB binds to specific DNA sequences, remodels the H-NS nucleoprotein complexes, and changes DNA supercoiling. VirB belongs to the superfamily of ParB proteins which are involved in plasmid and chromosome partitioning often as part of a ParABS system. Like ParB, VirB forms discrete foci in Shigella flexneri cells harbouring pINV. Our results reveal that purified preparations of VirB specifically bind the ribonucleotide CTP. We show that VirB slowly but detectably hydrolyses CTP, which is mildly stimulated by the virS targeting sequences found on pINV. CTP and DNA binding promote VirB clamp closure. Curiously, DNA stimulation of clamp closure appears efficient even without virS sequences. These findings suggest that VirB acts as a CTP-dependent DNA clamp and may indicate that so far elusive factors might prevent offsite DNA clamping in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Insects have various strategies like mimicry or camouflage to avoid predation. Swallowtail butterfly larvae switch from a black and white pattern mimicking bird droppings to a green camouflage pattern in the fifth (final) instar. This larval pattern switch is regulated during the juvenile hormone (JH)-sensitive period, when JH titer declines rapidly, and clawless (cll), abdominal-A (abd-A), and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) function during this period. However, the molecular mechanism behind the background green color, a crucial aspect of the camouflage pattern, remains poorly understood. Here, we used Papilio memnon, which switches to the camouflage pattern in the fifth instar but is greenish from the third instar, to investigate the mechanism of camouflage pattern formation, particularly the larval green coloration.\n\nThrough RNA sequencing, we found that BBPs forming a gene cluster are upregulated in the green regions of P. memnon larvae during the fourth instar, whereas P. xuthus larvae, which have not yet turned green, showed minimal BBPs expression. When BBP1 and BBP2, which were particularly highly expressed, were knocked down by RNAi, there was a phenotypic change in green to yellow in both fourth and fifth instar larvae. Expression analysis and knockdown experiments were conducted also for JHBP, which had been previously reported, and confirmed that it is involved in the synthesis of yellow pigment. Furthermore, knockdown of Ubx resulted in no phenotypic change in fourth instar larvae, but in fifth instar larvae, the eyespots pattern characteristic of the camouflage pattern almost entirely disappeared, suggesting that Ubx is also functional only during JH-sensitive period.\n\nOur results indicate that the switch from mimetic to camouflage patterns resulted from the function of cll, abd-A, Abd-B, and Ubx prepatterning genes during the JH-sensitive period. And the increased expression of BBPs and JHBPs, independent of the JH-sensitive period, contributed to the development of green coloration.",

    "abstract": "Anthocyanins are pigments and nutrients in red pears regulated by BBX family genes. Herein, we characterized a 14-nucleotide deletion mutation in the coding region of the PpBBX24 gene from  Red Zaosu pear (Pyrus pyrifolia White Pear Group), named Ppbbx24-del. Genetic and biochemical approaches were used to compare the roles of PpBBX24 and Ppbbx24-del in anthocyanin accumulation. Ppbbx24-del played a positive role in anthocyanin biosynthesis of the  Red Zaosu pear peel by light treatment. Functional analyses based on overexpression in tobacco and transient overexpression in pear fruit peels showed that Ppbbx24-del promoted anthocyanin accumulation. Cyanidin and peonidin were major differentially expressed anthocyanins, and transcript levels of some structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were significantly increased. Protein interaction assays showed that PpBBX24 was located in the nucleus and interacted with PpHY5, whereas Ppbbx24-del was colocalized in the nucleoplasm and did not interact with PpHY5. PpHY5 and Ppbbx24-del had positive regulatory effects on the expression of PpCHS, PpCHI, and PpMYB10 when acting alone, but had cumulative effects on gene activation when acting simultaneously. Alone, PpBBX24 had no significant effect on the expression of PpCHS, PpCHI, or PpMYB10, whereas it inhibited the activation effects of PpHY5 on downstream genes when it existed with PpHY5. Our study demonstrated that mutant Ppbbx24-del positively regulates the anthocyanin accumulation in pear. The results of this study clarify the mechanism and enrich the regulatory network of anthocyanin biosynthesis, which lays a theoretical foundation for Ppbbx24-del use to create red pear cultivars.",

    "abstract": "The replication of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) is suppressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by the Trim28-SETDB1 complex. The chromatin remodeler Smarcad1 interacts with Trim28 and was suggested to enable the deposition of histone variant H3.3. However, the role of Trim28, H3.3, and Smarcad1 in the repression of MLV in ESCs is not fully understood.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the role of Smarcad1 in the silencing of incoming MLV retroviruses, specifically focusing on the role of the chromatin structure. We found that Smarcad1 binds to proviral DNA and that Smarcad1 depletion leads to up-regulation of retroviral expression. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that Smarcad1 is necessary to properly recruit Trim28 and deposition of H3.3 on the MLV provirus and other Trim28-repressed genomic loci. Finally, we also show that the mutual depletion of Smarcad1 and Trim28 results in enhanced de-repression of the MLV provirus, indicating that these two proteins may also function independently to maintain repressive chromatin states.\n\nOur results provide evidence for the crucial role of Smarcad1 in the silencing of retroviral elements in embryonic stem cells.

    "abstract": "In this study we investigated how RNA viral populations evolve, interact and adapt to epigenetically-controlled plant defense mechanisms. We have evolved five independent lineages of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in a set of Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes carrying mutations that influence important elements of two main epigenetic pathways. All evolved lineages showed adaptation to the lack of epigenetically-regulated responses through significant increases in infectivity, virulence and viral load although the magnitude of the improvements strongly depended on the plant genotype. In early passages, these traits evolved more rapidly, but the rate of evolution flattened out in later ones. Viral load was positively correlated with different measures of virulence, though the strength of the associations changed from the ancestral to the evolved viruses. High-throughput sequencing was used to evaluate the viral diversity of each lineage, as well as characterizing the nature of fixed mutations, evolutionary convergences and potential targets of TuMV adaptation. Within each lineage, we observed a net increase in genome-wide genetic diversity, with some instances where nonsynonymous alleles experienced a transient rise in abundance before being displaced by the ancestral allele. Viral VPg protein has been shown as a key player in the adaptation process, even though no obvious association between fixed alleles and host genotype was found.\n\nLayman SummaryEpigenetic factors influence the expression of defense genes in plants, allowing for phenotypic rapid responses to infections by pathogens. The role of epigenetics in shaping the coevolution between host and pathogens has received very little attention. Here, we explored how RNA viruses interact and adapt to plant defense mechanisms that are controlled by epigenetic factors. We conducted evolution experiments on turnip mosaic virus using Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes with mutations that affect epigenetic pathways. We found that all evolved viral lineages adapted to the alteration of epigenetically-regulated responses by becoming more infectious, virulent, and having a higher viral load. The improvements varied depending on the plant genotype. The study also found that viral load was positively correlated with virulence, but the associations changed from the original to the evolved viruses. We used high-throughput sequencing to evaluate viral diversity and found an increase in each evolving lineage. We found that virus adaptation primarily targeted viral VPg, despite no obvious association between fixed alleles and host genotype being found.\n\nTeaser TextDiscover how RNA viruses adapt and evolve to plant defense mechanisms controlled by epigenetic factors. This research found that epigenetic regulation of defense genes modulates viral evolution. Viral lineages became more infectious, virulent, and had a higher viral load.

    "abstract": "BackgroundOpsins are the primary proteins responsible for light detection in animals. Cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, corals) have diverse visual systems that have evolved in parallel with bilaterians (squid, flies, fish) for hundreds of millions of years. Medusozoans (e.g. jellyfish, hydroids) have evolved eyes multiple times, each time independently incorporating distinct opsin orthologs. Anthozoans (e.g. corals, sea anemones,) have diverse light-mediated behaviors and, despite being eyeless, exhibit more extensive opsin duplications than medusozoans. To better understand the evolution of photosensitivity in animals without eyes we increased anthozoan representation in the phylogeny of animal opsins and investigated the large but poorly characterized opsin family in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis.\n\nResultsWe analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 16 species of cnidarians to generate a large opsin phylogeny (708 sequences) with the largest sampling of anthozoan sequences to date. We identified 29 opsins from N. vectensis (NvOpsins) with high confidence, using transcriptomic and genomic datasets. We found that lineage-specific opsin duplications are common across Cnidaria, with anthozoan lineages exhibiting among the highest numbers of opsins in animals. To establish putative photosensory function of NvOpsins, we identified canonically conserved protein domains and amino acid sequences essential for opsin function in other animal species. We show high sequence diversity among NvOpsins at sites important for photoreception and transduction, suggesting potentially diverse functions. We further examined the spatiotemporal expression of NvOpsins and found both dynamic expression of opsins during embryonic development and sexually dimorphic opsin expression in adults.\n\nConclusionsThese data show that lineage-specific duplication and divergence has led to expansive diversity of opsins in eyeless cnidarians, suggesting opsins from these animals may exhibit novel biochemical functions. The variable expression patterns of opsins in N. vectensis suggest opsin gene duplications allowed for a radiation of unique sensory cell types with tissue-and stage-specific functions. This diffuse network of distinct sensory cell types could be an adaptive solution for varied sensory tasks experienced in distinct life history stages in Anthozoans.",

    "abstract": "Anthelmintic drugs are used to treat parasitic roundworm and flatworm infections in humans and other animals. Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model to investigate anthelmintics used to treat roundworms. In this study, we use C. elegans to examine the mode of action and the mechanisms of resistance against the flatworm anthelmintic drug praziquantel (PZQ), used to treat trematode and cestode infections. We found that PZQ inhibited development and that this developmental delay varies by genetic background. Interestingly, both enantiomers of PZQ are equally effective against C. elegans, but only the left-handed PZQ (S-PZQ) is effective against schistosome infections. We conducted a genome-wide association mapping with 74 wild C. elegans strains to identify a region on chromosome IV that is correlated with differential PZQ susceptibility. Five candidate genes in this region: cct-8, znf-782, Y104H12D.4, Y104H12D.2, and cox-18, might underlie this variation. The gene cct-8, a subunit of the protein folding complex TRiC, has variation that causes a putative protein coding change (G226V), which is correlated with reduced developmental delay. Gene expression analysis suggests that this variant correlates with slightly increased expression of both cct-8 and hsp-70. Acute exposure to PZQ caused increased expression of hsp-70, indicating that altered TRiC function might be involved in PZQ responses. To test if this variant affects development upon exposure to PZQ, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce the V226 allele into the N2 genetic background (G226) and the G226 allele into the JU775 genetic background (V226). These experiments revealed that this variant was not sufficient to explain the effects of PZQ on development. Nevertheless, this study shows that C. elegans can be used to study responses to PZQ to identify mode of action and resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we show that the TRiC complex requires further evaluation for PZQ responses in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) has pervasive effects on gene expression and associations with ageing-related traits. Here we describe monocyte DNAm responses to inflammatory stimuli across 192 individuals. We find that, unlike the similarly widespread changes in gene expression elicited by LPS and IFN{gamma}, DNAm is markedly more sensitive to LPS. Exposure to LPS caused differential methylation at 20,858 immune-modulated CpGs (imCpGs) which display distinct genomic localisation and transcription factor usage, dependent upon whether methylation is lost or gained. Demethylated imCpGs are profoundly enriched for enhancers, and are over-represented by genes implicated in human diseases, most notably cancer. We find LPS-induced demethylation follows hydroxymethylation and for most sites the degree of demethylation correlates with baseline signal. Notably, we find LPS exposure triggers gain in epigenetic age by approximately 6 months, identifying a potential cause of accelerated epigentic aging which has diverse negative health associations. Finally, we explore the effect of genetic variation on LPS-induced changes in DNAm, identifying 209 imCpGs under genetic control. Exploring shared causal loci between LPS-induced DNAm responses and human disease traits highlights examples of human disease associated loci that also modulate imCpG formation.\n\nIn summary, our findings suggest innate immune activity continually remodels DNAm in a highly punctate, enhancerenriched fashion that is under tight genetic control and predominantly involves genes commonly mutated in cancer.",

Here, we employ adeno-associated viral vectors to deliver optimized intein-split prime editors into the brain of mice. Delivery into newborn pups via intracerebroventricular injection resulted in up to 44.0% editing at the Dnmt1 locus in the cortex (on average 34.8{+/-}9.8% after 6 months).

The introduced Adrb1A187V mutation is a naturally occurring variant of the {beta}1-adrenergic receptor, which has previously been linked to increased activity and natural short sleep7.

Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is an attractive bacterial host for valorizing biogenic feedstocks but lacks a xylose utilization pathway. While several attempts to engineer P. putida for growth on xylose have been reported, a comprehensive understanding of xylose metabolism in this bacterium is lacking, hindering its further improvement and rational tailoring for specific biotechnological purposes. In this study, we elucidated the xylose metabolism in the genome-reduced P. putida strain, EM42, endowed with xylose isomerase pathway (xylAB) and transporter (xylE) from Escherichia coli and used the obtained knowledge in combination with adaptive laboratory evolution to accelerate the bacteriums growth on the pentose sugar. Carbon flux analyses, targeted gene knock-outs, and in vitro enzyme assays portrayed xylose assimilation in P. putida and confirmed a partially cyclic upper xylose metabolism. Deletion of the local transcriptional regulator gene hexR de-repressed genes of several key catabolic enzymes and reduced the lag phase on xylose. Guided by metabolic modeling, we augmented P. putida with additional heterologous pentose phosphate pathway genes and subjected rationally prepared strains to adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) on xylose. The descendants showed accelerated growth and reduced growth lag. Genomic and proteomic analysis of engineered and evolved mutants revealed the importance of a large genomic re-arrangement, transaldolase overexpression, and balancing gene expression in the synthetic xylABE operon. Importantly, omics analyses found that similar growth characteristics of two superior mutants were achieved through distinct evolutionary paths. This work provides a unique insight into how cell metabolism adjusts to a non-native substrate; it highlights the remarkable genomic and metabolic plasticity of P. putida and demonstrates the power of combining knowledge-driven engineering with ALE in generating desirable microbial phenotypes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIElucidated xylose catabolism via exogenous isomerase pathway in P. putida EM42.\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of transcriptional regulator HexR improved growth on xylose.\nC_LIO_LIKnowledge-guided interventions and adaptive evolution accelerated growth.\nC_LIO_LIOmics analyses of selected mutants highlighted the genomic and metabolic plasticity of P. putida.\nC_LIO_LITwo mutants with superior characteristics emerged from distinct evolutionary paths.\nC_LI",

Heat capacity (CV) analysis at low temperature for these hexapeptides reveals that the low energy structures contributing to the first heat capacity feature above a threshold temperature exhibit a variety of backbone conformations for amyloid forming monomers. The corresponding control sequences do not exhibit such structural polymorphism, as diagnosed via end-to-end distance and a dihedral angle defined for the monomer. A similar heat capacity analysis for dimer conformations obtained using basin-hopping global optimisation, shows clear features in end-to-end distance versus dihedral correlation plots, where amyloid-forming sequences exhibit a preference for larger end-to-end distances and larger positive dihedrals. These results hold for sequences taken from tau, amylin, insulin A chain, a de-novo designed peptide, and various control sequences. While there is a little overall correlation between the aggregation propensity and the temperature at which the low-temperature CV feature occurs, further analysis suggests that the amyloid forming sequences exhibit the key CV feature at a lower temperature compared to control sequences derived from the same protein.",

We here present a model creation pipeline that not only generates new models quickly, but also only requires data from one easily measurable spatio-temporal variable. These data may, for instance, be an optical voltage mapping recording of the electrical waves in cardiac muscle tissue controlling the heart beat. We use exponential moving averages and compute standard deviations to extract additional states from this one variable to span a sparse discretised state space. The standard deviation in a neighbourhood can be used as a proxy for the gradient. To this augmented state space, we fit a simple polynomial model to predict the evolution of this one state variable. For optical voltage mapping data of human atrial myocyte monolayers electrically stimulated by stochastic burst pacing, the data-driven model is able to describe the excitation and recovery of the system, as well as wave propagation. The data-driven model is also able to predict spiral waves only based on data from focal waves.

However, these studies often use simple stimuli and little is known about how aging influences visual attention in 3D environments that are more representative of real-world visual complexity. We asked young and older adults to complete a virtual reality-based visual search task with three levels of increasing visual complexity. As the visual complexity of the environment increased, all participants took longer to complete the task, in part because they increased the time spent re-fixating task-relevant objects and the time spent fixating task-irrelevant objects. We also found that older adults took longer to complete the task and spent more time re-fixating task-relevant objects and fixating task-irrelevant objects. In addition, we found that short-term and working memory capacities were related to multiple measures of performance in the visual search task. These results demonstrate the importance of assessing the effects of aging on the control of visual attention using tasks and environments that better capture features of the real world.",

    "abstract": "Interoception, the perception of the internal state of the body, has been shown to be closely linked to emotions and mental health. Of particular interest are interoceptive learning processes that capture associations between environmental cues and body signals as a basis for making homeostatically relevant predictions about the future. Here we extended an interoceptive Breathing Learning Task (BLT) to incorporate continuous measures of prediction certainty, and tested its application using a Rescorla Wagner (RW) associative learning model. Sixteen healthy participants completed the continuous version of the BLT, where they were asked to predict the likelihood of breathing resistances. The task was modified from a previous version and required continuous, rather than binary predictions, in order to include a more precise measure of prediction certainty. The RW model was used to fit a learning rate to each participants continuous and binarised predictions, and was additionally extended to test whether learning rates differed according to stimuli valence. The empirical task data demonstrated excellent replicability compared to previously collected data using binary predictions, and the continuous model fits closely captured participant behaviour at the group level. The model extension to estimate different learning rates for negative (i.e. breathing resistance) and positive (i.e. no breathing resistance) trials indicated that learning rates did not significantly differ according to stimuli nature. Furthermore, examining the relationship between estimates of prediction certainty and learning rates with interoceptive and mental health questionnaires demonstrated that fatigue severity was related to both prediction certainty and learning rate, and anxiety sensitivity was related to prediction certainty. The updated task and model show promise for future investigations into interoceptive learning and potential links to mental health.",

    "abstract": "Many autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are characterized by persistence of autoreactive B cell responses which is often directly implicated in disease pathogenesis. How and why these cells are generated or how they are maintained for years is largely unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis is among the most common AIDs and characterized by autoantibodies recognizing proteins with post-translational modifications (PTMs). This PTM-directed, autoreactive B cell compartment is ill defined. Here, we visualized the B cell response against the three main types of PTM antigens implicated in RA by spectral flow cytometry. Our results show extensive cross-reactivity of autoreactive B cells against all three PTM antigens (citrulline, homocitrulline and acetyllysine). Unsupervised clustering revealed several distinct memory B cell (mBC) populations. Autoreactive cells clustered with the most recently activated, class-switched mBC phenotype, expressing high CD80, low CD24 and low CD21. Notably, patients also harbored large fractions of autoreactive plasmablasts (PB). Both PTM-directed mBC and PB showed high expression of CXCR3, a receptor for chemokines abundantly present in arthritic joints. Together, our data provide novel, detailed insight into the biology of B cell autoreactivity and its remarkable, seemingly exhaustless persistence in a prominent human AID.",

    "abstract": "Quarantine has been long used as a public health response to emerging infectious diseases, particularly at the onset of an epidemic when the infected proportion of a population remains identifiable and logistically tractable. In theory, the same logic should apply to low-incidence infections; however, the application and impact of quarantine in low prevalence settings appears less common and lacks a formal analysis. Here, we present a quantitative framework using a series of progressively more biologically realistic models of canine rabies in domestic dogs and from dogs to humans, a suitable example system to characterize dynamical changes under varying levels of dog quarantine. We explicitly incorporate health-seeking behaviour data to inform the modelling of contact-tracing and exclusion of rabies suspect and probable dogs that can be identified through bite-histories of patients presenting at anti-rabies clinics. We find that a temporary quarantine of rabies suspect and probable dogs provides a powerful tool to curtail rabies transmission, especially in settings where optimal vaccination coverage is yet to be achieved, providing a critical stopgap to reduce the number of human and animal deaths due to rabid bites. We conclude that whilst comprehensive measures including sensitive surveillance and large-scale vaccination of dogs will be required to achieve disease elimination and sustained freedom given the persistent risk of rabies re-introductions, quarantine offers a low-cost community driven solution to intersectoral health burden.\n\nAuthor summaryCanine rabies remains a human health risk in many countries around the world, particularly in lower and middle income settings where many dogs are free roaming and able to interact more easily with other dogs and humans. In this paper, we present results from a mathematical model that simulates the spread of rabies both between dogs and from dogs to humans and investigate the impact of quarantine and vaccination at reducing transmission. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of quarantining both infected and exposed dogs - we observe that quarantine can have a substantial effect on reducing the number of new animals subsequently infected and thereby lowering the risk of humans being exposed to infection. Such a policy can have significant benefits, particularly in settings where access to vaccinations is challenging and resources are limited. Our research can therefore help to inform policy makers in countries where canine rabies is circulating to develop appropriate strategies to reduce the human health risks associated with canine rabies in the future.",

    "abstract": "The animal germline lineage needs to be maintained along generations. However, some Caenorhabditis elegans wild isolates display a mortal germline phenotype, whereby the lineage becomes sterile after several generations at 25{degrees}C. We used a genome-wide association approach to study the genetic basis for this phenotype in C. elegans populations. We detected a significant peak on chromosome III around 5 Mb, which was confirmed using introgression lines. These results indicate that a seemingly deleterious genotype is maintained at intermediate frequency in the species. Environmental rescue is a likely explanation and we indeed find that naturally associated bacteria and microsporidia suppressed the phenotype. The tested bacteria also suppressed the temperature-sensitive mortal germline phenotype of mutants in small RNA inheritance (nrde-2) and histone modifications (set-2). Even Escherichia coli strains of the K-12 lineage suppressed the phenotype compared to B strains. By shifting a strain cultured on E. coli K-12 back to E. coli B, we found that C. elegans can keep over several generations the memory of the suppressing conditions. Thus, the mortal germline phenotype of wild C. elegans is lin part revealed by laboratory conditions and may represent variation in epigenetic inheritance and environmental interactions. This study also points to the importance of non-genetic memory in the face of environmental variation.",

    "abstract": "Somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) are a predominant type of oncogenomic alterations that affect a large proportion of the genome in the majority of cancer samples. Current technologies allow high-throughput measurement of such copy number aberrations, generating results consisting of frequently large sets of SCNA segments. However, the automated annotation and integration of such data are particularly challenging because the measured signals reflect biased, relative copy number ratios. In this study, we introduce labelSeg, an algorithm designed for rapid and accurate annotation of CNA segments, with the aim of enhancing the interpretation of tumor SCNA profiles. Leveraging density-based clustering and exploiting the length-amplitude relationships of SCNA, our algorithm proficiently identifies distinct relative copy number states from individual segment profiles. Its compatibility with most CNA measurement platforms makes it suitable for large-scale integrative data analysis. We confirmed its performance on both simulated and sample-derived data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reference dataset, and we demonstrated its utility in integrating heterogeneous segment profiles from different data sources and measurement platforms. Our comparative and integrative analysis revealed common SCNA patterns in cancer and protein-coding genes with a strong correlation between SCNA and mRNA expression, promoting the investigation into the role of SCNA in cancer development.",

Here we describe our Non-Stiff Dynamic Invertible Model of CO-Regulatory Networks (NS-DIMCORN) to define the genetic nexus underpinning specific cellular functions using invertible warping of flexible multivariate Gaussian distributions by neural Ordinary differential equations. Our results yield a generative model with unbiased density estimation from RNA-seq read-count data only. This resulted in scalable time-flexible sampling of each genes expression level thence allowing ab initio assembly of gene regulatory networks in specific cells. We demonstrate our proposed methodology is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in accurately recovering genome-wide functional interactions, whether from synthetic or empirical data. We optimized our algorithm for GPU-based implementation thereby further enhancing the utility of our proposed methodology in comparison to the ten benchmarked methods.",

Inflammatory, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and estrogen responsiveness pathways show circadian modulation. Among tumors, clock correlation analysis demonstrates subtype-specific changes in circadian organization. Luminal A organoids and informatic ordering of Luminal A samples exhibit continued, albeit disrupted rhythms. However, CYCLOPS magnitude, a measure of global rhythm strength, varied widely among Luminal A samples. Cycling of EMT pathway genes was markedly increased in high-magnitude Luminal A tumors. Patients with high-magnitude tumors had reduced 5-year survival. Correspondingly, 3D Luminal A cultures show reduced invasion following molecular clock disruption.

Skewing is instead related to intrinsic twist due to cell file rotation. Numerical investigations are outfitted with an analytical framework that consistently relates transitions between straight, waving, coiling and skewing patterns with tilt angle.

Identifying functional foods which provide vital health beneficial components in addition to the nutrients is of immense health relevance. Microgreens are edible seedlings enriched with concentrated minerals and phytochemicals whose dietary potential as functional foods needs evaluation. In this study, comprehensive biochemical, mineral, metabolic, and fatty acid profiles of four Brassicaceae microgreens - mustard (Brassica juncea), pak choi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis), radish pink (Raphanus sativus), and radish white (Raphanus ruphanistrum) was investigated. The biochemical and mineral profiling confirmed their promising nutritional and antioxidant nature and as excellent sources of minerals. Mineral profiling using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) exhibited promising levels of Fe, Mn, Mg, K, and Ca in microgreens. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolite profiling highlighted a range of phytochemicals-sugars, amino acids, organic acids, amines, fatty acids, phenol, and other molecules. Fatty acid profiling established promising levels of Oleic acid (C18:1; Monounsaturated fatty acids-MUFA) and linoleic acids (C18:2; omega-6 Poly unsaturated fatty acid-PUFA), which are health beneficial. It is estimated that fresh microgreens (100 g) can meet about 20 % to 50 % recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of macro- and micro-minerals along with providing useful fatty acids and antioxidants. Overall, the study highlighted Brassicaceae microgreens as an excellent nutrient source that can act as functional foods with promising potential to overcome \"hidden hunger\".\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541100v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d3b9c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a7604org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8a164corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be187b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIBrassicaceae microgreens are rich in molecules with relevance to nutrition and health\nC_LIO_LIThe biochemical analysis supported the antioxidant nature of microgreens\nC_LIO_LIComprehensive metabolite profiles of edible microgreens of Brassica juncea (Mustard), Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis (Pak Choi), Raphanus sativus (Radish Pink), and Raphanus ruphanistrum (Radish white) using GC-MS are reported\nC_LIO_LIIonomics analysis using the Brassicaceae microgreens exhibited promising levels of microminerals Fe, Mn, Mg, K, and Ca\nC_LIO_LIFatty acid profiles show promising levels of Linoleic acid and Oleic acid, which have health relevance\nC_LI",

Individuals with more cerebellar-occipital connectivity performed better on the social attention task, suggesting more efficient social information processing. Then, we estimated latent communities of autistic and socially anxious traits using exploratory graph analysis to decompose heterogeneity in social functioning between individuals. Connectivity strength within the identified social attention network was associated with social skills, such that more temporal-parietal connectivity predicted fewer challenges with social communication and interaction. These findings demonstrate that individual differences in functional connectivity strength during a selective social attention task are related to varying levels of self-reported social skill.",

    "abstract": "Social grouping increases survival in many species, including humans1,2. By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (loneliness) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion3-5. The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social drive, similar to that observed for physiological needs such as hunger, thirst or sleep3,6. In this study, we assessed social responses in multiple mouse strains and identified the FVB/NJ line as exquisitely sensitive to social isolation. Using FVB/NJ mice, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during social isolation and social rebound and that orchestrate the behavior display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations of opposite function and with brain areas associated with social behavior, emotional state, reward, and physiological needs, and showed that animals require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfill their social need, thus revealing a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis. These findings offer mechanistic insight into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context.",

    "abstract": "Plane-form enamel hypoplasia (PFEH) is a severe dental defect in which large areas of the crown are devoid of enamel. This condition is rare in humans and rarer in wild primates. The etiology of PFEH has been linked to exposure to severe disease, malnutrition, environmental toxins, and other systemic conditions. Similar defects have also been associated with genetic conditions such as amelogenesis imperfecta. In this study, we examined the prevalence of all types of enamel hypoplasia in several populations of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with the aim of providing context for the severe defects found in macaques from Yakushima Island. We found that macaques from other islands and from the mainland of Japan have low prevalence of the more common types of enamel hypoplasia and none exhibit PFEH. In contrast, 10 of the 21 individuals (48%) from Yakushima Island displayed uniform and significant PFEH, with all 10 living in two adjacent locations in the south of the island. All permanent teeth were affected to varying degrees except for first molars, and the mineral content of the remaining enamel in teeth with PFEH is normal (i.e., no hypo- or hyper mineralization). Given that the affected individuals have smaller first molars compared to non-affected macaques, and that they all underwent dental development during a period of substantial human-related habitat change, we conclude that the PFEH likely resulted from environmental stress. Extreme weather events on the island may also have influenced the formation of these defects. Additionally, it is plausible that a documented recent population bottleneck could have heightened the susceptibility of these macaques to PFEH. Further research on living primate populations is needed to better understand the causes of PFEH in wild primates and to evaluate whether such features can be used to assess the impact of human-related disturbance.",

    "abstract": "The origin and evolution of cell types has emerged as a key topic in evolutionary biology. Driven by rapidly accumulating single-cell datasets, recent attempts to infer cell type evolution have largely been limited to pairwise comparisons because we lack approaches to build cell phylogenies using model-based approaches. Here we approach the challenges of applying explicit phylogenetic methods to single-cell data by using principal components as phylogenetic characters. We infer a cell phylogeny from a large, comparative single-cell data set of eye cells from five distantly-related mammals. Robust cell type clades enable us to provide a phylogenetic, rather than phenetic, definition of cell type, allowing us to forgo marker genes and phylogenetically classify cells by topology. We further observe evolutionary relationships between diverse vessel endothelia and identify the myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells as sister cell types. Finally, we examine principal component loadings and describe the gene expression dynamics underlying the function and identity of cell type clades that have been conserved across the five species. A cell phylogeny provides a rigorous framework towards investigating the evolutionary history of cells and will be critical to interpret comparative single-cell datasets that aim to ask fundamental evolutionary questions.",

This grain legume is also valued for it seeds which have one of the highest contents of proteins amongst all grain legumes. This plant can be a rich source of genomic resources, which can be applied to improve abiotic stress response in allied grain legumes and also help understand the biological processes governing their overall development. Here we generate a de novo genome assembly of Vigna aconitifolia using PacBio High-Fidelity reads and Hi-C sequencing data, with a total size of 409 Mb and contig N50 of more than 30Mb. We also annotated the genome for repeat sequences, found that the moth bean genome comprises of about 54% of repetitive sequences, and predicted 36950 protein-coding genes. Using the available RNA-Seq data for moth bean, we have developed a differential expression profile for various tissues of moth bean using the whole genome as a reference and identified simple sequence repeats that could be developed into viable molecular markers. This nascent study will provide insight into the identification of agronomically important genes and accelerate the genetic improvement of moth bean as well as other legume crops.",

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that a massively parallel reporter assay, mSTARR-seq, could be used to simultaneously test for both enhancer-like activity and DNA methylation-dependent enhancer activity for millions of loci in a single experiment (Lea et al., 2018). Here we apply mSTARR-seq to query nearly the entire human genome, including almost all CpG sites profiled either on the commonly used Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array or via reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We show that fragments containing these sites are enriched for regulatory capacity, and that methylation-dependent regulatory activity is in turn sensitive to the cellular environment. In particular, regulatory responses to interferon alpha (IFNA) stimulation are strongly attenuated by methyl marks, indicating widespread DNA methylation-environment interactions. In agreement, methylation-dependent responses to IFNA identified via mSTARR-seq predict methylation-dependent transcriptional responses to challenge with influenza virus in human macrophages. Our observations support the idea that pre-existing DNA methylation patterns can influence the response to subsequent environmental exposures--one of the tenets of biological embedding. However, we also find that, on average, sites previously associated with early life adversity are not more likely to functionally influence gene regulation than expected by chance.",

In some cases, the predicted structure can be compared to the already-known distribution if there is information from classic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, or electron microscopy (EM). However, challenges arise when the proteins are not abundant, their structure is heterogeneous, and protein sample preparation is difficult. To determine the level of confidence that supports the prediction, different metrics are provided. These values are important in two ways: they offer information about the strength of the result and can supply an overall picture of the structure when different models are combined. This work provides an overview of the different deep-learning methods used to predict protein folding and the metrics that support their outputs. The confidence of the model is evaluated in detail using two proteins that contain four domains of unknown function.",

Spineless, the Drosophila homolog of AHR, has only been studied in the context of development but not in the adult intestine. Here, we show that spineless is upregulated in the adult intestinal epithelium after infection with Pseudomonas entomophila (P.e.). Spineless knockdown increased stem cell proliferation following infection-induced injury. Spineless overexpression limited intestinal stem cell proliferation and reduced survival after infection. In two tumour models, using either Notch RNAi or constitutively active Yorkie, Spineless suppressed tumour growth and doubled the lifespan of tumour-bearing flies. At the transcriptional level it reversed the gene expression changes induced in Yorkie tumours, counteracting cell proliferation and altered metabolism. These findings demonstrate a new role for Spineless in the adult Drosophila midgut and highlight the evolutionarily conserved functions of AHR/Spineless in the control of proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been utilized extensively for various applications owing to their distinctive chemical properties. They exhibit high persistence in the environment and accumulate within the human body, necessitating toxicity assessments. However, the consequences of prolonged, low-level exposure to PFAS and concurrent exposure to multiple PFAS have not been explored. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice (aged 8 weeks) were exposed to a composite of nine PFAS, which include long-chain PFAS (e.g. perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and short-chain PFAS (e.g. perfluorobutanoic acid and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid) at concentrations equivalent to the estimated daily human intake in the composition reported (1 {micro}g/L [sum of the nine compounds], the maximum reported exposure concentration) via drinking water. Histological examination revealed vacuolization of hepatocytes and irregular arrangement of hepatocyte cords, suggesting that exposure to low levels of the PFAS mixture causes morphological changes in liver tissues. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PFAS exposure mainly altered a group of genes related to metabolism and chemical carcinogenesis. Machine learning analysis of the liver metabolome showed a typical concentration-independent alteration upon PFAS exposure, and in addition to known substances such as glutathione, a compound with unknown biological function; 2,5-dihydro-2,4-dimethyloxazole was found. This study demonstrates that daily exposure to PFAS leads to morphological changes in liver tissues and alters the expression of metabolism-and cancer-related genes as well as phospholipid metabolism. Future studies are required to evaluate the chronic toxicity of prolonged, low-level exposure to PFAS mixtures and to investigate the health effects of PFAS.",

    "abstract": "Ripe fruits are more susceptible to necrotrophic pathogens than unripe fruits. Although this phenomenon is widespread across different fruit species and results in substantial economic losses, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. Previous studies revealed that ethylene (ET) is a key signal controlling climacteric fruit ripening and that jasmonate (JA) regulates plant resistance to necrotrophs. We investigated the function of tomato cytochrome P450 94 (CYP94) family genes in JA signaling and report here that ET-mediated ripening suppresses JA-mediated defense by promoting the deactivation of bioactive JA-Ile. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3)/EIN3-LIKE (EIL) transcription factors directly activated CYP94C1 to convert JA-Ile to its inactive form 12-COOH-JA-Ile, thereby terminating JA signaling during fruit ripening. Mutation of CYP94C1 led to increased resistance of ripe fruits to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea without affecting the ripening process. Additionally, the master transcription factor MYC2 directly activated two other CYP94 members CYP94B1 and CYP94B2 to convert JA-Ile to its less active form 12-OH-JA-Ile, thereby attenuating JA signaling in wounded leaves. Simultaneous mutation of CYP94B1 and CYP94B2 increased the resistance of leaves to B. cinerea. Thus, differences in the expression and enzymatic activities of CYP94 family gene members precisely control JA-mediated defense responses in tomato.",

This diversity contributes to the regulation of myelination and conduction velocity along axons, which is critical for proper nervous system function. Despite this importance, technical challenges have limited our understanding of mechanisms controlling axon diameter growth, preventing systematic dissection of how manipulating diameter affects conduction along individual axons. Here, we establish zebrafish as system to investigate the regulation of axon diameter and axonal conduction in vivo. We identify a role for importin 13b specifically in axon diameter growth, that is independent of axonal length and overall cell size. Impairment of diameter growth along individual myelinated axons reduced conduction velocity in proportion to the diameter, but had no effect on the precision of action potential propagation or ability to fire at high frequencies. This work highlights an axon diameter-specific mechanism of growth that regulates conduction speeds along myelinated axons.",

The score based on the 78 genes expression is high correlation with the cell cycle and cell proliferation activity. Based on the median of score, the lung adenocarcinoma patients were divided into two cohorts which presents different prognosis, tumorigenesis-related pathways activity. The high score group was enriched in the E2F target, mtorc1 signaling and MYC targets. The low score group can be identified as better prognosis subtype. Also, we used the GDSC data to predicted the PIM inhibitor (AZD1208) as the effective compounds for high score group patients, which is supported by a higher PIM1 and PIM2 expression in the score group. An integrative analysis of multi-omics data identified ECT2 as key nodes in a regulatory network related to the prognostic phenotype.

These two populations were developed by the USDA-ARS in Fort Collins, CO, derived from unreleased USDA-ARS Salinas germplasm lines. Multiple field and greenhouse trials for Fusarium yellows and nematode resistance confirmed the uniform phenotypes of both lines for each disease. To enable molecular breeders to rapidly screen proprietary markers in silico, gene space assemblies for each line were also developed. Genome sequencing of individual plants from each line, as well as pooled sequencing of sub-populations of both lines indicated fixation of a previously reported genetic variant linked to sugar beet cyst nematode resistance in FC308. However, two previously reported variants linked to Fusarium resistance appear to be unlinked to the resistance found in FC309. Collectively, these two new genetic stocks should prove useful as sources of resistance to Fusarium yellows and sugar beet cyst nematode, as model genetic backgrounds for studying plant-pathogen interactions, and for mapping the resistance genes present in these lines.",
