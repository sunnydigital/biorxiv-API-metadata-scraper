    "abstract": "Microbial consortia have been utilised for centuries to produce fermented foods and have great potential in applications such as therapeutics, biomaterials, fertilisers, and biobased production. Working together, microbes become specialized and perform complex tasks more efficiently, strengthening both cooperation and stability of the microbial community. However, imbalanced proportions of microbial community members can lead to unoptimized and diminished yields in biotechnology. To address this, we developed a burden-aware RNA-based multicellular feedback control system that stabilises and tunes coculture compositions. The system consists of three modules: a quorum sensing-based communication module to provide information about the densities of cocultured strains, an RNA-based comparator module to compare the ratio of densities of both strains to a pre-set desired ratio, and a customisable growth module that relies either on heterologous gene expression or on CRISPRi knockdowns to tune growth rates. We demonstrated that heterologous expression burden could be used to stabilise composition in a two-member E. coli coculture. This is the first coculture composition controller that does not rely on toxins or syntrophy for growth regulation and uses RNA sequestration to stabilise and control coculture composition. This work provides a fundamental basis to explore burden-aware multicellular feedback control strategies for robust stabilisation of synthetic community compositions.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are a siege of complex metabolic interactions such as cooperation and competition for resources. Methods to control such interactions could lead to major advances in our ability to engineer microbial consortia for bioproduction and synthetic biology applications. Here, we used optogenetics to control invertase production in yeast, thereby creating landscapes of cooperator and cheater cells. Yeast cells behave as cooperators (i.e., transform sucrose into glucose, a public \"good\") upon blue light illumination or cheaters (i.e., consume glucose produced by cooperators to grow) in the dark. We show that cooperators benefit best from the hexoses they produce when their domain size is constrained between two cut-off length-scales. From an engineering point of view, the system behaves as a band pass filter. The lower limit is the trace of cheaters competition for hexoses, while the upper limit is defined by cooperators competition for sucrose. Hence, cooperation mostly occurs at the frontiers with cheater cells, which not only compete for hexoses but also cooperate passively by letting sucrose reach cooperators. We anticipate that this optogenetic method could be applied to shape metabolic interactions in a variety of microbial ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "GABA synthesis in astrocytes mediates tonic inhibition to regulate patho-physiological processes in various brain regions. Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) has been known to be the most important metabolic enzyme for synthesizing GABA from the putrescine degradation pathway. MAO-B converts N1-acetylputrescine to N1-acetyl-{gamma}-aminobutyraldehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Putrescine acetyltransferase (PAT), also known as spermidine and spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), has been thought to be a feasible candidate enzyme for converting putrescine to N1-acetylputrescine. However, it has not been rigorously investigated or determined whether PAT/SAT1 contributes to GABA synthesis in astrocytes. To investigate the contribution of PAT/SAT1 to GABA synthesis in astrocytes, we conducted sniffer patch and whole-cell patch experiments with gene silencing of PAT/SAT1 by Sat1 shRNA expression. Our results showed that the gene silencing of PAT/SAT1 significantly decreased the MAO-B-dependent GABA synthesis, which was induced by putrescine incubation, leading to decreased Ca2+-dependent release of GABA in vitro. Additionally, we found that, from the brain slice ex vivo, putrescine incubation induces tonic GABA inhibition in dentate gyrus granule cells, which can be inhibited by MAO-B inhibitor, selegiline. Consistent with our in vitro results, astrocytic gene silencing of PAT/SAT1 significantly reduced putrescine incubation-induced tonic GABA current, possibly by converting putrescine to N1-acetylputrescine, a substrate of MAO-B. Our findings emphasize a crucial role of PAT/SAT1 in MAO-B-dependent GABA synthesis in astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease of the vascular wall driven by lipid accumulation and inflammation in the intimal layer of arteries [1], [2], and its main complications, myocardial infarction and stroke, are the leading cause of mortality worldwide [3]. Recent studies have identified Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a lipid-sensing receptor regulating several key myeloid cell functions [4], as a highly expressed marker of macrophage foam cells in experimental and human atherosclerosis [5]. However, the function of TREM2 in the development of atherosclerosis is unknown. Here, we show that hematopoietic or global TREM2 deficiency increases necrotic core formation in early experimental atherosclerosis. We further demonstrate that TREM2 is essential for the efferocytosis capacities of macrophages, and to the survival of lipid-laden macrophages, altogether indicating a crucial role of TREM2 in maintaining the balance between foam cell death and their clearance in atherosclerotic lesions, thereby controlling plaque necrosis.",

Further to these, we previously demonstrated that HIC1 provides a significant contribution to the function and development of regulatory T (Treg) cells. However, the mechanism by which it regulates these processes was not apparent. To address this question, we used affinity-purification mass spectrometry to characterize the HIC1 Interactome in human Treg cells. Altogether 61 high-confidence interactors were identified, including IKZF3, which is a key transcription factor in the development of Treg cells. The biological processes associated with these interacting proteins include protein transport, mRNA processing, non-coding (ncRNA) transcription and RNA metabolism. The results revealed that HIC1 is part of a FOXP3-RUNX1-CBFB protein complex that regulates Treg signature genes thus improving our understanding of HIC1 function during early Treg cell differentiation.\n\nHighlightsO_LISystematic characterization of HIC1 interactome in regulatory T cells by Affinity Purification-Mass Spectrometry\nC_LIO_LIHIC1 binds to the RUNX1 promoter and regulates its expression\nC_LIO_LIHIC1-a part of FOXP3-RUNX1-CBFB transcriptional complex\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=37 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540505v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fcb119org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf1397org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f512forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ae94e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Long-chain fatty acids with antimicrobial properties are abundant on the skin and mucosal surfaces, where they are essential to restrict the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. These antimicrobial fatty acids (AFAs) elicit bacterial adaptation strategies, which have yet to be fully elucidated. Characterizing the pervasive mechanisms used by S. aureus to resist AFAs could open new avenues to prevent pathogen colonization. Here, we identify the S. aureus lipase Lip2 as a novel resistance factor against AFAs. Lip2 detoxifies AFAs via esterification with cholesterol. This is reminiscent of the activity of the fatty acid-modifying enzyme (FAME), whose identity has remained elusive for over three decades. In vitro, Lip2-dependent AFA-detoxification was apparent during planktonic growth and biofilm formation. Our genomic analysis revealed that prophage-mediated inactivation of Lip2 was more common in blood and nose isolates than in skin strains, suggesting a particularly important role of Lip2 for skin colonization. Accordingly, in a mouse model of S. aureus skin colonization, bacteria were protected from sapienic acid - a human-specific AFA - in a cholesterol- and lipase-dependent manner. These results suggest Lip2 is the long-sought FAME that exquisitely manipulates environmental lipids to promote bacterial growth. Our data support a model in which S. aureus exploits and/or exacerbates lipid disorders to colonize otherwise inhospitable niches.",

    "abstract": "Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that, together with a rather characteristic neurocognitive profile, presents a strong cardiovascular phenotype. The cardiovascular features of WBS are mainly related to a gene dosage effect due to hemizygosity of the elastin (ELN) gene; however, the phenotypic variability between WBS patients indicates the presence of important modulators of the clinical impact of elastin deficiency. Recently, two genes within the WBS region have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Numerous cardiovascular diseases are related to mitochondrial dysfunction; therefore, it could be a modulator of the phenotype present in WBS. Here, we analyze mitochondrial function and dynamics in cardiac tissue from a WBS complete deletion (CD) model. Our research reveals that cardiac fiber mitochondria from CD animals have altered mitochondrial dynamics, accompanied by respiratory chain dysfunction with decreased ATP production, reproducing alterations observed in fibroblasts from WBS patients. Our results highlight two major factors; on the one hand, that mitochondrial dysfunction is probably a relevant mechanism underlying several risk factors associated with WBS disease; on the other, the CD murine model mimics the mitochondrial phenotype of WBS and could be a great model for carrying out preclinical tests on drugs targeting the mitochondria.",

Elucidating the receptor function that defines its role in metabolic health is the objective of this work.\n\nMethodsCombining in vivo metabolic studies in SORCS2-deficient mouse models with ex vivo structural and functional analyses as well as single-cell transcriptomics of murine pancreatic tissues, we studied the pathophysiological consequences of receptor dysfunction for metabolism.\n\nResultsOur studies identified an important role for SORCS2 in islet stress response essential to sustain glucose-stimulated insulin release. In detail, we show that SORCS2 is predominantly expressed in islet alpha cells. Loss of receptor expression coincides with the inability of these cells to produce osteopontin, a secreted factor that facilitates insulin release from beta cells under stress. In line with diminished osteopontin levels, beta cells in SORCS2- deficient islets show changes in gene expression patterns related to aggravated ER stress, protein misfolding, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction; and they exhibit defects in insulin granule maturation and a blunted response to glucose stimulation in vivo and ex vivo. Impaired glucose tolerance in receptor mutant mice coincides with alterations in body weight and composition.\n\nConclusionOur data identified a novel concept in protective islet stress response involving the alpha cell receptor SORCS2 and provide experimental support for association of SORCS2 with metabolic control in humans.",

    "abstract": "Cardiopharyngeal mesoderm contributes to the formation of the heart and head muscles. However, the mechanisms governing cardiopharyngeal mesoderm specification remain unclear. Indeed, there is a lack of an in vitro model replicating the differentiation of both heart and head muscles to study these mechanisms. Such models are required to allow live-imaging and high throughput genetic and drug screening. Here, we show that the formation of self-organizing or pseudo-embryos from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), also called gastruloids, reproduces cardiopharyngeal mesoderm specification towards cardiac and skeletal muscle lineages. By conducting a comprehensive temporal analysis of cardiopharyngeal mesoderm establishment and differentiation in gastruloids and comparing it to mouse embryos, we present the first evidence for skeletal myogenesis in gastruloids. By inferring lineage trajectories from the gastruloids single-cell transcriptomic data, we further suggest that heart and head muscles formed in gastruloids derive from cardiopharyngeal mesoderm progenitors. We identify different subpopulations of cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscles, which most likely correspond to different states of myogenesis with \"head-like\" and \"trunk-like\" skeletal myoblasts. These findings unveil the potential of mESC-derived gastruloids to undergo specification into both cardiac and skeletal muscle lineages, allowing the investigation of the mechanisms of cardiopharyngeal mesoderm differentiation in development and how this could be affected in congenital diseases.",

Our study aims to identify possible stress factors that induced seedling mortality and investigate how different ecological factors influence early-stage safe site requirements of the seedlings. We focused on the effect of large-scale climatic variables, small-scale microhabitat conditions, and biotic interactions on seedling survival and establishment by applying seasonal seedling survival monitoring and establishment survey on both regional and local scale. We identified two alternative ways of seedling death, by environmental-induced mortality and by herbivory. Opposite effects of the same environmental factors on different causes of mortality showed that seedlings might need to balance the risks posed by both causes to optimize their growing conditions. On a regional scale, we observed limited effect of regional climatic variables (namely fog frequency) on seedlings establishment and survival but noted a similar seasonal survival pattern among regions. We hypothesize that short-duration droughts during the transition from Plum rain to typhoon season is one of the key mechanisms of environmental-induced mortality. On a local scale, we found that decayed coarse wood debris (CWD) facilitates seedling establishment by providing a \"safe site\", likely due to increased colonization of small-stature bryophytes and decreased litterfall accumulation. The effect of bryophytes on seedling establishment varies depending on their thickness, with thicker ones having stronger negative effects. Aside from the bryophytes, the accumulation of litter significantly hindered seedling establishment. We argue that to safeguard the regeneration of Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana population, preserving CWD in the forest floor as a safe site for the seedlings after tree-replacing disturbance in natural forests is essential, particularly under ongoing climate change where more frequent and prolonged drought events are predicted.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOn a local scale, decayed coarse wood debris (CWD) provides \"safe site\" for the establishment of Chamaecypairs obtusa var. formosana seedlings.\nC_LIO_LIRegional climatic variables had limited effects on seedlings, but all regions had similar seasonal patterns of seedling mortatlity.\nC_LIO_LIFacilitation effect of small-stature bryophytes and litterfall avoidance might be the underlying mechanisms behind CWD safe sites.\nC_LIO_LIPreserving CWD for seedlings is important in the context of predicted prolong drought events under ongoing climate change.\nC_LI",

Estimating the core ranges of species from 5% and 95% quantiles of bioclimatic variables, the algorithm remains widely used even when more sophisticated methods of species distribution modelling have become popular. Where sufficient representative observations are available, I expect that BIOCLIM correctly identifies locations that would not be suitable in a future climate. To accommodate climate change investigations based on BIOCLIM for 48,129 tree species (a substantial subset of known tree species), I developed the TreeGOER (Tree Globally Observed Environmental Ranges) database, providing information on environmental ranges for 38 bioclimatic, 8 soil and 3 topographic variables. The database can be accessed from: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7922928. Statistics that include 5% and 95% quantiles were estimated for a cleaned and taxonomically standardized occurrence data set with different methods of outlier detection, with estimates for roughly 45% of species being based on 20 or more observation records. Inferred core bioclimatic ranges of species along global temperature and moisture index gradients and across continents follow the known global distribution of tree diversity such as its highest levels in moist tropical forests and the  odd man out pattern of lower levels in Africa. To demonstrate how global analyses for large numbers of tree species can easily be done in R with TreeGOER, here I present two case studies. The first case study investigated latitudinal trends of tree vulnerability and compared these with previous results obtained for urban trees. The second case study focused on tropical areas, compared trends in different longitudinal zones and investigated patterns for the moisture index. TreeGOER is expected to benefit researchers conducting biogeographical and climate change research for a wide range of tree species at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.",

    "abstract": "Domains as functional protein units and their rearrangements along the phylogeny can shed light on the functional changes of proteomes associated with the evolution of complex traits like eusociality. This complex trait is associated with sterile soldiers and workers, and long-lived, highly fecund reproductives. Unlike in Hymenotpera (ants, bees, and wasps), the evolution of eusociality within Blattodea, where termites evolved from within cockroaches, was accompanied by a reduction in proteome size, raising the question of whether functional novelty was achieved with existing rather than novel proteins. To address this, we investigated the role of domain rearrangements during the evolution of termite eusociality. Analysing domain rearrangements in the proteomes of three solitary cockroaches and five eusocial termites, we inferred more than 5000 rearrangements over the phylogeny of Blattodea. The 90 novel domain arrangements that emerged at the origin of termites were enriched for several functions related to longevity, such as protein homeostasis, DNA repair, mitochondrial activity, and nutrient sensing. Many domain rearrangements were related to changes in developmental pathways, important for the emergence of novel castes. Along with the elaboration of social complexity, including permanently sterile workers and larger, foraging colonies, we found 110 further domain arrangements with functions related to protein glycosylation and ion transport. We found an enrichment of caste-biased expression and splicing within rearranged genes, highlighting their importance for the evolution of castes. Furthermore, we found increased levels of DNA methylation among rearranged compared to non-rearranged genes suggesting fundamental differences in their regulation. Our findings indicate an importance of domain rearrangements in the generation of functional novelty necessary for termite eusociality to evolve.",

    "abstract": "To prevent cell division in the presence of a DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), cell cycle progression is arrested by the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) to allow more time for repair. In budding yeast, a single irreparable DSB arrests cells for about 12 h - 6 normal doubling times - after which cells adapt to the damage and resume the cell cycle. In contrast, 2 DSBs provoke permanent G2/M arrest. While activation of the DDC is well-understood, how it is maintained remains unclear. To address this question, key checkpoint proteins were inactivated by auxin-inducible degradation 4 h after damage induction. Degradation of Ddc2ATRIP, Rad9, Rad24, or Rad53CHK2 resulted in resumption of cell cycle, indicating that these checkpoint factors are required both to establish and to maintain DDC arrest. However, when Ddc2 is inactivated 15 h after inducing 2 DSBs, cells remain arrested. This continued arrest depends on the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins Mad1, Mad2, and Bub2. Although Bub2 acts with Bfa1 to regulate mitotic exit, inactivation of Bfa1 did not trigger checkpoint release. These data suggest that prolonged cell cycle arrest in response to 2 DSBs is achieved by a handoff from the DDC to specific components of the SAC.",

    "abstract": "During the recent avian influenza epizootics that occurred in France in 2020/21 and 2021/22, the virus was so contagiousness that it was impossible to control its spread between farms. The preventive slaughter of millions of birds consequently was the only solution available. In an effort to better understand the spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in a rapid and innovative manner, we established an amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow for the rapid genetic typing of circulating AIV strains.\n\nAn amplicon-based MinION sequencing workflow based on a set of PCR primers targeting primarily the hemagglutinin gene but also the entire influenza virus genome was developed. Thirty field samples from H5 HPAIV outbreaks in France, including environmental samples, were sequenced using the MinION MK1C. A real-time alignment of the sequences with MinKNOW software allowed the sequencing run to be stopped as soon as enough data were generated. The consensus sequences were then generated and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish links between the outbreaks.\n\nThe whole sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was obtained for the 30 clinical samples of H5Nx HPAIV belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b. The consensus sequences comparison and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated links between some outbreaks.\n\nWhile several studies have shown the advantages of MinION for avian influenza virus sequencing, this workflow has been applied exclusively to clinical field samples, without any amplification step on cell cultures or embryonated eggs. As this type of testing pipeline requires only a short amount of time to link outbreaks or demonstrate a new introduction, it could be applied to the real-time management of viral epizootics.",

    "abstract": "Human death marks the end of organismal life under conditions such that the components of the human body continue to be alive. Such postmortem cellular survival depends on the nature (Hardy scale of slow-fast death) of human death. Slow and expected death typically results from terminal illnesses and includes a prolonged terminal phase of life. As such organismal death process unfolds, do cells of the human body adapt for postmortem cellular survival? Organs with low energy cost-of-living, such as the skin, are better suited for postmortem cellular survival. In this work, the effect of different durations of terminal phase of human life on postmortem changes in cellular gene expression was investigated using RNA sequencing data of 701 human skin samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. Longer terminal phase (slow-death) was associated with a more robust induction of survival pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling) in postmortem skin. Such cellular survival response was associated with the upregulation of embryonic developmental transcription factors such as FOXO1, FOXO3, ATF4 and CEBPD. Upregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling was independent of sex or duration of death-related tissue ischemia. Analysis of single nucleus RNA-seq of post-mortem skin tissue specifically identified the dermal fibroblast compartment to be most resilient as marked by adaptive induction of PI3K-Akt signaling. In addition, slow death also induced angiogenic pathways in the dermal endothelial cell compartment of postmortem human skin. In contrast, specific pathways supporting functional properties of the skin as an organ were downregulated following slow death. Such pathways included melanogenesis and those representing the skin extracellular matrix (collagen expression and metabolism). Efforts to understand the significance of death as a biological variable (DABV) in influencing the transcriptomic composition of surviving component tissues has far-reaching implications including rigorous interpretation of experimental data collected from the dead and mechanisms involved in transplant-tissue obtained from dead donors.",

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rdh54 is a known target of the Mec1/Rad53 signaling axis, which globally protects genome integrity during DNA metabolism. While phosphorylation of DNA repair proteins by Mec1/Rad53 is critical for HR progression little is known about how specific post translational modifications alter HR reactions. Phosphorylation of Rdh54 is linked to protection of genomic integrity but the consequences of modification remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the Rdh54 C-terminus by the effector kinase Rad53 regulates Rdh54 clustering activity as revealed by single molecule imaging. This stems from phosphorylation dependent and independent interactions between Rdh54 and Rad53. Genetic assays reveal that loss of phosphorylation leads to phenotypic changes resulting in loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) outcomes. Our data highlight Rad53 as a key regulator of HR intermediates through activation and attenuation of Rdh54 motor function.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades, commonly known as  waterbears, are eight-legged microscopic invertebrates renowned for their ability to withstand extreme stressors, including high osmotic pressure, freezing temperatures, and complete desiccation. Limb retraction and expelling their internal water stores results in the tun state, greatly increasing their ability to survive. Emergence from the tun state and/or activity regain follows stress removal, where resumption of life cycle occurs as if stasis never occurred. However, the mechanism(s) through which tardigrades initiate tun formation is yet to be uncovered. Herein, we use chemobiosis to demonstrate that tardigrade tun formation is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We further reveal that tuns are dependent on reversible cysteine oxidation, and that this reversible cysteine oxidation is facilitated by the release of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). We provide the first empirical evidence of chemobiosis and map the initiation and survival of tardigrades via osmobiosis, chemobiosis, and cryobiosis. In vivo electron paramagnetic spectrometry suggests an intracellular release of reactive oxygen species following stress induction; when this release is quenched through the application of exogenous antioxidants, the tardigrades can no longer survive osmotic stress. Together, this work suggests a conserved dependence of reversible cysteine oxidation across distinct tardigrade cryptobioses.",

    "abstract": "Aliphatic carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones play diverse roles in microbial adaptation to their microenvironment, from excretion as toxins to adaptive metabolites for membrane fluidity. However, the spatial distribution of these molecules throughout biofilms, and how microbes in these environments exchange these molecules remains elusive for many of these bioactive species due to inefficient molecular imaging strategies. Herein, we apply on-tissue chemical derivatization (OTCD) using 4-(2-((4-bromophenethyl)dimethylammonio)ethoxy)benzenaminium bromide (4-APEBA) on a co-culture of a soil bacterium (Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610) and fungus (Fusarium sp. DS 682) grown on agar as our model system. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), we spatially resolved more than 300 different metabolites containing carbonyl-groups within this model system. Various spatial patterns are observable of these species, which indicate possible extracellular or intercellular processes of the metabolites, and their up or down regulation during microbial interaction. The unique chemistry of our approach allowed us to bring additional confidence in accurate carbonyl identification, especially when multiple isomeric candidates were possible, and this provided the ability to generate hypotheses about the potential role of some aliphatic carbonyls in this B. subtilis/Fusarium sp. interaction. The results shown here demonstrate the utility of 4-ABEBA-based OCTD MALDI-MSI in probing interkingdom interactions directly from microbial co-cultures, and these methods will enable future microbial interactions studies with expanded metabolic coverage.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe metabolic profiles within microbial biofilms and interkingdom interactions are extremely complex and serve a variety of functions, which include promoting colonization, growth, and survival within competitive and symbiotic environments. However, measuring and differentiating many of these molecules, especially in an in-situ fashion, remains a significant analytical challenge. We demonstrate a chemical derivatization strategy that enabled highly sensitive, multiplexed mass spectrometry imaging of over 300 metabolites from a model microbial co-culture. Notably, this approach afforded us to visualize over two dozen classes of ketone-, aldehyde-, and carboxyl-containing molecules, which were previously undetectable from colonies grown on agar. We also demonstrate that this chemical derivatization strategy can enable discrimination of isobaric and isomeric metabolites, without the need for orthogonal separation (e.g., online chromatography or ion mobility). We anticipate this approach will further enhance our knowledge of metabolic regulation within microbiomes and microbial systems used in bioengineering applications.",

Here, we determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a hyperstable disease-associated mtHsp60 mutant, V72I, at three stages in this cycle. Unexpectedly, client density is identified in all states, revealing interactions with mtHsp60s apical domains and C-termini that coordinate client positioning in the folding chamber. We further identify a striking asymmetric arrangement of the apical domains in the ATP state, in which an alternating up/down configuration positions interaction surfaces for simultaneous recruitment of mtHsp10 and client retention. Client is then fully encapsulated in mtHsp60/mtHsp10, revealing prominent contacts at two discrete sites that potentially support maturation. These results identify a new role for the apical domains in coordinating client capture and progression through the cycle, and suggest a conserved mechanism of group I chaperonin function.",

Interpretable features describing the shape, size, color, and texture of each nucleus were extracted from model predictions. These quantitative nuclear features were compared to available metrics, including measurements of genomic instability, gene expression, and prognosis.\n\nResultsThe nuclear segmentation and classification model trained herein performed comparably to previously reported models. Features extracted from the model revealed differences sufficient to distinguish between BRCA, LUAD, and PRAD. Furthermore, cancer cell nuclear area was associated with increased genomic instability, as measured by aneuploidy score and homologous recombination deficiency. In BRCA, increased fibroblast nuclear area was indicative of poor progression-free and overall survival and was associated with gene expression signatures related to extracellular matrix remodeling and anti-tumor immunity.\n\nConclusionsWe developed a powerful pan-tissue approach for nucleus segmentation and featurization, enabling the construction of predictive models and the identification of features linking nuclear morphology with clinically-relevant prognostic biomarkers across multiple cancer types.",

    "abstract": "People rarely walk in straight lines. Instead, we make frequent turns or other maneuvers. Spatiotemporal parameters fundamentally characterize gait. For straight walking, these parameters are well-defined for that task of walking on a straight path. Generalizing these concepts to non-straight walking, however, is not straightforward. People also follow non-straight paths imposed by their environment (store aisle, sidewalk, etc.) or choose readily-predictable, stereotypical paths of their own. People actively maintain lateral position to stay on their path and readily adapt their stepping when their path changes. We therefore propose a conceptually coherent convention that defines step lengths and widths relative to known walking paths. Our convention simply re-aligns lab-based coordinates to be tangent to a walkers path at the mid-point between the two footsteps that define each step. We hypothesized this would yield results both more correct and more consistent with notions from straight walking. We defined several common non-straight walking tasks: single turns, lateral lane changes, walking on circular paths, and walking on arbitrary curvilinear paths. For each, we simulated idealized step sequences denoting \"perfect\" performance with known constant step lengths and widths. We compared results to path-independent alternatives. For each, we directly quantified accuracy relative to known true values. Results strongly confirmed our hypothesis. Our convention returned vastly smaller errors and introduced no artificial stepping asymmetries across all tasks. All results for our convention rationally generalized concepts from straight walking. Taking walking paths explicitly into account as important task goals themselves thus resolves conceptual ambiguities of prior approaches.",

Since the activation of dopamine (DA) receptors regulates dopamine synthesis and they can signal through the {beta}-arrestin pathway and GSK3{beta}, we decided to check the effect of GSK3{beta} inhibitors (CHIR99021, SB216763 and lithium ion) in the control of DA synthesis. Using ex vivo experiments with minces from rat brain striatum, we observed that CHIR99021, but not SB216763 nor lithium, causes a complete abrogation of DA synthesis and accumulation at low {micro}M concentrations, pointing to off-target effects of CHIR99021. This decrease can be attributed to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inhibition since the accumulation of L-DOPA in the presence of a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor was similarly decreased. On the other hand, CHIR99021 caused a dramatic increase in the DOPAC / DA ratio, an indicator of DA metabolization, and hindered DA incorporation into striatum tissue to the same extent as tetrabenazine, thus pointing to some effect on DA storage that triggers DA feedback inhibition of TH. In addition, CHIR99021 or SB216763, but not lithium, decreased TH phosphorylation in Ser19, but not in Ser31 or Ser40. These results demonstrate that CHIR99021 can lead to TH inactivation and DA depletion in brain striatum, opening the possibility of its use in DA-related disorders, and shows effects to be considered in future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are important cells for in vitro drug screening and the cell-based therapy for brain-related disorders, which requires well-defined and reproducible culture systems. Current strategy the use of protein growth factors presents challenges in terms of reproducibility and cost. In this study, we have developed a novel DNA-based modulator to regulate FGFR signaling of NPCs, enabling maintenance of the stemness over 50 passages and neurogenesis towards neurons. The DNA-based FGFR-agonist effectively promoted FGFR1 phosphorylation and activated the downstream ERK signaling pathway in FGFR1-positive cells. Using human embryonic stem cell lines, we differentiated them into NPCs and replaced basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the regulator culture medium with DNA-based FGFR-agonist for artificially elicited FGFR signaling. The results demonstrated that the FGFR-agonist could promote NPCs proliferation and neurosphere formation, recapitulating the function of bFGF. Notably, transcriptomic analysis revealed that FGFR-agonist could customize the stemness-associated transcription program, while decouples the neuronal differentiation program, highly resembling that the native ligand, bFGF. Moreover, our culture condition facilitated the successful propagation of NPCs for over 50 passages, while retaining their ability to efficiently differentiate into neurons. Overall, our approach provides a highly effective method for expanding NPCs, offering new opportunities for disease-in-dish research and drug screening for neural degeneration.",

Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a negative regulator of LDL-C metabolism, have emerged as promising approaches for reducing elevated LDL-C levels. Here, we evaluated the cholesterol lowering efficacy of virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines that target epitopes found within the LDL receptor (LDL-R) binding domain of PCSK9. In both mice and non-human primates, a bivalent VLP vaccine targeting two distinct epitopes on PCSK9 elicited strong and durable antibody responses and lowered cholesterol levels. In macaques, a VLP vaccine targeting a single PCSK9 epitope was only effective at lowering LDL-C levels in combination with statins, whereas immunization with the bivalent vaccine lowered LDL-C without requiring statin co-administration. These data highlight the efficacy of an alternative, vaccine-based approach for lowering LDL-C.",

Clovibactin efficiently kills drug-resistant bacterial pathogens without detectable resistance. Using biochemical assays, solid-state NMR, and atomic force microscopy, we dissect its mode of action. Clovibactin blocks cell wall synthesis by targeting pyrophosphate of multiple essential peptidoglycan precursors (C55PP, Lipid II, LipidWTA). Clovibactin uses an unusual hydrophobic interface to tightly wrap around pyrophosphate, but bypasses the variable structural elements of precursors, accounting for the lack of resistance. Selective and efficient target binding is achieved by the irreversible sequestration of precursors into supramolecular fibrils that only form on bacterial membranes that contain lipid-anchored pyrophosphate groups. Uncultured bacteria offer a rich reservoir of antibiotics with new mechanisms of action that could replenish the antimicrobial discovery pipeline.",

Here, we devised a microscopy method to simultaneously measure transient TF binding at a single locus and the effect of these binding events on transcription. We show that DNA binding of the yeast TF Gal4 activates transcription of a target gene within a few seconds, with at least [~]20% efficiency and with a high initiation rate of [~]1 RNA/s. Gal4 DNA dissociation decreases transcription rapidly. Moreover, at a gene with multiple binding sites, individual Gal4 molecules only rarely stay bound throughout the entire burst, but instead frequently exchange during a burst to increase the transcriptional burst duration. Our results suggest a mechanism for enhancer regulation in more complex eukaryotes, where TF cooperativity and exchange enable robust transcription activation.",

    "abstract": "Exploring how organisms overcome geographical barriers to dispersal is a fundamental question in biology. Passive long-distance dispersal events, although infrequent and unpredictable, have a considerable impact on species range expansions. Despite limited active dispersal capabilities, many stick insect species have vast geographical ranges, indicating that passive long-distance dispersal is vital for their distribution. A potential mode of passive dispersal in stick insects is via the egg stage within avian digestive tracts, as suggested by experimental evidence. However, detecting such events under natural conditions is challenging due to their rarity. To indirectly assess the importance of historical avian-mediated dispersal, we examined the population genetic structure of the flightless stick insect Ramulus mikado based on a multifaceted molecular approach (COI haplotypes, nuclear SSR markers, and genome-wide SNPs). Subsequently, we identified unique phylogeographic patterns, including the discovery of identical COI genotypes spanning considerable distances, which substantiates the notion of passive long-distance genotypic dispersal. Overall, all the molecular data revealed low and mostly non-significant genetic differentiation among populations, with identical or very similar genotypes across distant populations. We propose that long-distance dispersal facilitated by birds is the most plausible explanation for the unique phylogeographic pattern observed in this flightless stick insect.",

We conducted the first-ever comprehensive bench-marking study of association testing methods for low multiplicity-of-infection single-cell CRISPR screens, applying six leading methods to analyze six diverse datasets. We found that existing methods exhibit varying degrees of miscalibration, suggesting that results obtained using these methods may contain excess false positives. Next, we conducted an extensive empirical investigation to understand why existing methods demonstrate miscalibration. We identified three core analysis challenges: sparsity, confounding, and model misspecification. Finally, we developed a new association testing method based on the novel and statistically principled technique of permuting negative binomial score statistics, adding this method to our SCEPTRE software package (katsevich-lab.github.io/sceptre). This methodology addresses the core analysis challenges both in theory and in practice, demonstrating markedly improved calibration and power across datasets.",

The UBXD1 adapter localizes with p97 in critical mitochondria and lysosome clearance pathways and contains multiple p97-interacting domains. We identify UBXD1 as a potent p97 ATPase inhibitor and report structures of intact p97:UBXD1 complexes that reveal extensive UBXD1 contacts across p97 and an asymmetric remodeling of the hexamer. Conserved VIM, UBX, and PUB domains tether adjacent protomers while a connecting strand forms an N-terminal domain lariat with a helix wedged at the interprotomer interface. An additional VIM-connecting helix binds along the second AAA+ domain. Together these contacts split the hexamer into a ring-open conformation. Structures, mutagenesis, and comparisons to other adapters further reveal how adapters containing conserved p97-remodeling motifs regulate p97 ATPase activity and structure.",

Starting with a data-specific metabolic network we utilize linear models between substrates and products of a metabolic reaction to approximate deviations in activity. The obtained estimates can subsequently be used for network enrichment and integration with other omics data. By applying mantra to untargeted metabolomics measurements of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer biopsies, we show that it can accurately pinpoint biomarkers. On a dataset of stool metabolomics from Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, we demonstrate that predictions on our proposed reaction metric generalize to an independent validation cohort and that it can be used for multiomics network integration.

    "abstract": "Admixture, the exchange of genetic information between distinct source populations, is thought to be a major source of adaptive novelty. Unlike mutation events, which periodically generate single alleles, admixture can introduce many selected alleles simultaneously. As such, the effects of linkage between selected alleles may be especially pronounced in admixed populations. However, existing tools for identifying selected mutations within admixed populations only account for selection at a single site, overlooking phenomena such as interference among proximal selected alleles. Here, we develop and extensively validate a method for identifying and quantifying the individual effects of multiple linked selected sites on a chromosome in admixed populations. Our approach numerically calculates the expected local ancestry landscape in an admixed population for a given multi-locus selection model, and then maximizes the likelihood of the model. After applying this method to admixed populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we found that the impacts between linked sites may be an important contributor to natural selection in admixed populations. Furthermore, for the situations we considered, the selection coefficients and number of selected sites are overestimated in analyses that do not consider the effects of linkage among selected sites. Our results imply that linkage among selected sites may be an important evolutionary force in admixed populations. This tool provides a powerful generalized method to investigate these crucial phenomena in diverse populations.",

The recent discovery of a large bone tool assemblage at the Neanderthal site of Chagyrskaya (Altai, Siberia, Russia) and the increasing discoveries of isolated finds of bone tools in various Mousterian sites across Eurasia stimulate the debate. Assuming that the isolate finds may be the tip of the iceberg and that the Siberian occurrence did not result from a local adaptation of easternmost Neanderthals, we looked for evidence of a similar industry in the Western side of their spread area. We assessed the bone tool potential of the Quina bone-bed level currently under excavation at chez Pinaud site (Jonzac, Charente-Maritime, France) and found as many bone tools as flint ones: not only the well-known retouchers but also beveled tools, retouched artifacts and a smooth-ended rib. Their diversity opens a window on a range of activities not expected in a butchering site and not documented by the flint tools, all involved in the carcass processing. The re-use of 20% of the bone blanks, which are mainly from large ungulates among faunal remains largely dominated by reindeer, raises the question of blank procurement and management. From the Altai to the Atlantic shore, through a multitude of sites where only a few objects have been reported so far, evidence of a Neanderthal bone industry is emerging which provides new insights on Middle Paleolithic subsistence strategies.",

Here, we test whether this also extends to non-linguistic stimuli, specifically music. We used a hierarchical model of musical syntax to continuously quantify two types of expert-annotated harmonic dependencies throughout a piece of Western classical music: prolongation and preparation. Prolongations can roughly be understood as a musical analogue to linguistic coordination between constituents that share the same function (e.g.,  pizza and  pasta in  I ate pizza and pasta). Preparation refers to the dependency between two harmonies whereby the first implies a resolution towards the second (e.g., dominant towards tonic; similar to how the adjective implies the presence of a noun in  I like spicy...). Source reconstructed MEG data of sixty-eight participants listening to the musical piece was then analysed. We used Bayesian Mixed Effects models to predict theta envelope in the brain, using the number of open prolongation and preparation dependencies as predictors whilst controlling for audio envelope. We observed that prolongation and preparation both carry independent and distinguishable predictive value for theta band fluctuation in key linguistic areas such as the Angular, Supramarginal, Superior Temporal and Heschls Gyri, or their right-lateralised homologues, with preparation showing additional predictive value for areas associated with the reward system and prediction. Musical expertise further mediated these effects in language-related brain areas. Results show that predictions of precisely formalised music-theoretical models are reflected in the brain activity of listeners.",

    "abstract": "Visual speech plays a powerful role in facilitating auditory speech processing and has been a publicly noticed topic with the wide usage of face masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a previous magnetoencephalography (MEG) study we showed that occluding the mouth area significantly impairs neural speech tracking. To rule out the possibility that this deterioration is due to degraded sound quality, in the present follow-up study, we presented participants with audiovisual (AV) and audio-only (A) speech. We further independently manipulated the trials by adding a face mask and a distractor speaker. Our results clearly show that face masks only affect speech tracking in AV conditions, not in A conditions. This shows that face masks indeed primarily impact speech processing by blocking visual speech and not by acoustic degradation. Furthermore, we observe differences in the speech features that are used for visual speech processing. On the one hand, processing in clear speech, but not in noisy speech, is profiting more from lexical unit features (phonemes and word onsets) hinting at improved phoneme discrimination. On the other hand, we observe an improvement in speech tracking driven by the modulations of the lip area in clear speech and conditions with a distractor speaker, which might aid by providing temporal cues for subsequent auditory processing. With this work, we highlight the effects of face masks in AV speech tracking and show two separate ways how visual speech might support successful speech processing.",

Precise perception of these subdivisions is essential for discerning nuances in rhythmic patterns. While musical rhythm typically comprises sound elements with a variety of timbres or spectral cues, the impact of such spectral variations on the perception of rhythmic patterns remains unclear. Here, we show that consistency in spectral cues affects perceptual accuracy in discriminating subdivided rhythmic patterns. We conducted online experiments using rhythmic sound sequences consisting of band-passed noise bursts to measure discrimination accuracy. Participants were asked to discriminate between a swing-like rhythm sequence, characterized by a 2:1 interval ratio, and its more or less exaggerated version. This task was also performed under two additional rhythm conditions: inversed-swing rhythm (1:2 ratio) and regular subdivision (1:1 ratio). The center frequency of the band noises was either held constant or alternated between two values. Our results revealed a significant decrease in discrimination accuracy when the center frequency was alternated, irrespective of the rhythm ratio condition. This suggests that rhythm perception is not only shaped by temporal structure but also affected by spectral properties.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUntranslated regions (UTRs) are important mediators of post-transcriptional regulation. The length of UTRs and the composition of regulatory elements within them are known to vary substantially across genes, but little is known about the reasons for this variation in humans. Here, we set out to determine whether this variation, specifically in 5UTRs, correlates with gene dosage sensitivity.\n\nResultsWe investigated 5UTR length, the number of alternative transcription start sites, the potential for alternative splicing, the number and type of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and the propensity of 5UTRs to form secondary structures. We explored how these elements vary by gene tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF; using the LOEUF metric), and in genes where changes in dosage are known to cause disease. We show that LOEUF correlates with 5UTR length and complexity. Genes that are most intolerant to LoF have longer 5UTRs (P<1x10-15), greater TSS diversity (P<1x 10-15), and more upstream regulatory elements than their LoF tolerant counterparts. We show that these differences are evident in disease gene-sets, but not in recessive developmental disorder genes where LoF of a single allele is tolerated.\n\nConclusionsOur results confirm the importance of post-transcriptional regulation through 5UTRs in tight regulation of mRNA and protein levels, particularly for genes where changes in dosage are deleterious and lead to disease. Finally, to support gene-based investigation we release a web-based browser tool, VuTR (https://vutr.rarediseasegenomics.org/), that supports exploration of the composition of individual 5UTRs and the impact of genetic variation within them.",
