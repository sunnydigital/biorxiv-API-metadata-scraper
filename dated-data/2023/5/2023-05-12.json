    "abstract": "Advanced image processing methods have shown promise in computational pathology, including the extraction of crucial microscopic features from histology images. Accurate detection and classification of cell nuclei from whole-slide images (WSI) play a crucial role in capturing the molecular and morphological landscape of the tissue sample. They enable widespread downstream applications, including cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and discovery of novel markers. Robust nuclei detection and classification are challenging due to the high intra-class variability and inter-class similarity of the microscopic morphological features. This is further compounded by the domain shift arising due to the variability in tissue types, staining protocols, and image acquisition. Motivated by the ability of the recent deep learning techniques to learn complex patterns in a biasfree manner, we develop a novel and robust deep learning model TransNuc, based on vision transformers, for simultaneous detection and classification of cell nuclei from H&E stained WSI. We benchmarked TransNuc on the comprehensive Open Pan-cancer Histology Dataset (PanNuke), sampled from over 20,000 WSI, comprising 19 different tissue types and five clinically important cell classes, namely, Neoplastic, Epithelial, Inflammatory, Connective, and Dead cells. TransNuc exhibited superior performance compared to the state-of-theart, including Hover-Net and Micro-Net. TransNuc was able to learn robust feature representations and thereby perform consistently better for the abundant classes such as neoplastic, and the under-represented classes such as dead cells. Similar performance gains were also obtained for epithelial and connective classes that have a significant inter-class morphological similarity.",

    "abstract": "Organophosphate (OP) compounds are highly toxic and include household, industrial, agricultural, and chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNA). OP exposure inhibits acetylcholinesterase enzyme, causing cholinergic overstimulation that can evolve into status epilepticus (SE) and produce lethality. Furthermore, OP-SE survival is associated with mood and memory dysfunction and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Here we assessed hippocampal pathology and chronic SRS following SE induced by OP agents in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 1.5x LD50 of various OP agents, followed by atropine and 2-PAM. At 1-h post-OP-SE onset, midazolam was administered to control SE. Approximately 6 months following OP-SE, SRS were evaluated using continuous video-EEG monitoring. Histopathology was conducted using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), while silver sulfide (Timm) staining was utilized to assess Mossy Fiber Sprouting (MFS). Over 60% of OP-SE surviving rats developed SRS with varying seizure frequencies, durations, and Racine severity scores. H&E staining revealed a significant hippocampal neuronal loss, while Timm staining revealed extensive MFS within the inner molecular region of the dentate gyrus of SRS-expressing OP-SE rats. This study demonstrates that OP-SE is associated with hippocampal neuronal loss, extensive MFS, and SRS, all hallmarks of chronic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous diversity and complexity of life forms, there are certain forms of life that are never observed. Organisms like angels might not emerge because of developmental biases that restrict how organisms can evolve, or because they have low fitness in any environment yet available on Earth. Given that both developmental bias and selection may create similar phenotypes, it is difficult to distinguish between the two causes of evolutionary stasis among related taxa. For example, remarkably invariant traits are observed spanning million years, such as wing shape in Drosophila wherein qualitative differences are rare within genera. We thus ask whether the absence of combinations of traits, indicated by genetic correlation, reflects developmental bias limiting the possibility of change. However, much confusion and controversy remain over definitions of developmental bias and quantifying it is challenging. We present a novel approach aiming to estimate developmental bias by leveraging a common but under-utilized type of data: recombinant genetic mapping populations. We reason that information rendered by such mild perturbations captures inherent interdependencies between traits - developmental bias. Through empirical analyses, we find that our developmental bias metric is a strong indicator of genetic correlation stability across conditions. Our framework presents a feasible way to quantify developmental bias between traits and opens up the possibility to dissect patterns of genetic correlation.\n\nSignificance StatementGenetic correlation represents an important class of evolutionary constraint, which are themselves evolvable. Empirical studies have found mixed results on whether such evolutionary constraint changes rapidly or slowly. This uncertainty challenges our ability to predict the outcome of selection. Here, we propose a framework to dissect genetic correlation in a genetic mapping population and show that consistency of pleiotropic effects of loci across the genome, which we termed as developmental bias, is an indicator of genetic correlation stability. Our novel method empowers readily accessible QTL mapping data to understand complex genetic architecture underlying pleiotropy, mechanisms causing genetic correlation and, ultimately, long-term evolutionary divergence.",

    "abstract": "Although the challenge of gene regulatory network inference has been studied for more than a decade, it is still unclear how well network inference methods work when applied to real data. Attempts to benchmark these methods on experimental data have yielded mixed results, in which sometimes even the best methods fail to outperform random guessing, and in other cases they perform reasonably well. So, one of the most valuable contributions one can currently make to the field of network inference is to benchmark methods on experimental data for which the true underlying network is already known, and report the results so that we can get a clearer picture of their efficacy. In this paper, we report results from the first, to our knowledge, benchmarking of network inference methods on single cell E. coli transcriptomic data. We report a moderate level of accuracy for the methods, better than random chance but still far from perfect. We also find that some methods that were quite strong and accurate on microarray and bulk RNA-seq data did not perform as well on the single cell data. Additionally, we benchmark a simple network inference method (Pearson correlation), on data generated through computer simulations in order to draw conclusions about general best practices in network inference studies. We predict that network inference would be more accurate using proteomic data rather than transcriptomic data, which could become relevant if highthroughput proteomic experimental methods are developed in the future. We also show through simulations that using a simplified model of gene expression that skips the mRNA step tends to substantially overestimate the accuracy of network inference methods, and advise against using this model for future in silico benchmarking studies.",
