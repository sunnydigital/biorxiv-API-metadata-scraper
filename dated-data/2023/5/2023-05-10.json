    "abstract": "Vesicles carry out many essential functions within cells through the processes of endocytosis, exocytosis, and passive and active transport. This includes transporting and delivering molecules between different parts of the cell, and storing and releasing neurotransmitters in neurons. To date, computational simulation of these key biological players has been rather limited and has not advanced at the same pace as other aspects of cell modeling. As computational power advances and researchers want to add new realism to their models an important advance in the field of computational biology is to simulate vesicles in a realistic yet efficient manner. We describe a general vesicle modeling tool that has been designed for wide application to a variety of cell models, implemented within our voxel-based approach to modeling reaction-diffusion processes in realistic mesh reconstructions of cell tissue in our software STEPS. The implementation is validated in an extensive test suite, parallel performance demonstrated in a realistic synaptic bouton model, and example models are visualized in a Blender extension module.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial species are able to coordinate population-wide phenotypic responses through the exchange of diffusible chemical signals, a behavior known as quorum sensing. A quorum sensing bacterium may employ multiple types of chemical signals and detect them using inter-connected pathways that crosstalk with each other. While there are many hypotheses for the advantages of sensing multiple signals, the prevalence and functional significance of crosstalk between the sensing pathways are much less understood. Here we explore the effect of intra-cellular signal crosstalk on a simple model of a quorum sensing circuit. The model captures key aspects of typical quorum sensing pathways, including detection of multiple signals that crosstalk at the receptor and promoter levels, positive feedback, and hierarchical positioning of sensing pathways. We find that a variety of behaviors can be tuned by modifying crosstalk and feedback strengths. These include activation or inhibition of one output by the non-cognate signal, broadening of dynamic range of the outputs, and the ability of either the upstream or downstream branch to modulate the feedback circuit of the other branch. Our findings show how crosstalk between quorum sensing pathways can be viewed not solely as a detriment to the flow of information but also as a mechanism that enhances the functional range of the full regulatory system: When positive feedback systems are coupled through crosstalk, several new modes of activation or deactivation become possible.",

    "abstract": "The Sable Island Sweat Bee (Lasioglossum (Dialictus) sablense Gibbs, 2010) is endemic to Sable Island, an isolated sandbar located about 160 km east of Nova Scotia. L. sablense is classified as Threatened due to its restricted geographic distribution, so promoting its conservation requires detailed information about nesting phenology and behaviour. We combined measurements and dissections of adult females collected in 2016 and 2017 with behavioural observations of nests and foragers on the grounds of the Sable Island Station in 2019 and 2022, to compile the first description of flight phenology and social status. Like many members of its subgenus, L. sablense exhibits a diphasic life history. Phase 1 begins when large adult females emerge from hibernation, begin burrow and brood cell construction, and forage to provision Brood 1, which comprises both daughters and sons. Most, but not all, nests initiated during Phase 1, reactivate during Phase 2, as adult Brood 1 daughters emerge from their nests and initiate foraging to provision Brood 2. This suggests a mix of univoltine (single generation) and bivoltine (two generation) reproductive strategies. Behavioural observations at nest entrances demonstrated that during Phase 2, reactivated nests sometimes contained multiple adult females, suggesting the potential for colonies to become social. Comparisons of body size and ovarian status of Phase 1 and 2 females collected from flowers, showed Phase 2 foragers were significantly smaller than Phase 1 foragers and had somewhat lower levels of ovarian development, as expected if Phase 2 females were workers from eusocial nests. However, five large females collected during Phase 2, which had high levels of wear, likely were Phase 1 foundresses that resumed foraging during Phase 2. Taken together, these observations suggest a mix of phenological and social strategies, including both univoltine and bivoltine life histories, and a mix of solitary and social behaviour among reactivated colonies in Phase 2.",

    "abstract": "Animals exhibit rich diversity in form, including in tissues whose function depends on deforming. In fluidic locomotion, deformations contribute to aspects of performance ranging from propulsive efficiency to environmental navigation, but it is challenging to quantify and compare dynamic morphological variation. There are many possible ways to quantify morphology but their correspondence to dynamic variation among distinct behaviours is unclear. We contrasted dynamic wing shape variation of hoverfeeding hummingbirds during distinct flight challenges to assess how morphological plasticity contributes to their aerial agility. We sought to quantify the principal axes of shape variation (shape variables) and their relationships to conventional descriptors of wing shape like wing twist and area. The first four shape variables collectively explained >95% of the dynamical variation in wing shape and decomposed shape changes into a frequency spectrum of in- and out-of-plane deformation components. To varying degrees, these shape variables were interpretable as aspects of conventional two- and three-dimensional morphology, particularly the dominant contributions of wing twisting ([~]80% of shape variation) and area changes ([~]10% of shape variation). However, variation in wing morphology among behaviours was not predicted by each shape variables explained variance, but instead by stroke cycle subintervals associated with specific shape changes. We identified pronounced out-of-plane deformations throughout the stroke cycle while hoverfeeding in front of a visual barrier, whereas in-plane deformations during the upstroke and pronation were especially prominent during submaximum load lifting. Our study highlights the complexity of shape changes in biological tissues during active behaviour, and how dynamic morphology contributes to agile fluidic locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease (PD) has been associated with greater total power in canonical frequency bands (i.e., alpha, beta) of the resting electroencephalogram (EEG). However, PD has also been associated with a reduction in the proportion of total power across all frequency bands. This discrepancy may be explained by aperiodic activity (exponent and offset) present across all frequency bands. Here, we examined differences in the eyes-open and eyes-closed resting EEG of PD participants (N = 26) on and off medication, and age-matched controls (CTL; N = 26). We extracted power from canonical frequency bands using traditional methods (total alpha and beta power) and extracted separate parameters for periodic (parameterized alpha and beta power) and aperiodic activity (exponent and offset). Cluster-based permutation tests over spatial and frequency dimensions indicated that total alpha and beta power, and aperiodic exponent and offset were greater in PD participants, independent of medication status. After removing the exponent and offset, greater alpha power in PD (vs. CTL) was only present in eyes-open recordings and no reliable differences in beta power were observed. Differences between PD and CTLs in the resting EEG are likely driven by aperiodic activity, suggestive of greater relative inhibitory neural activity and greater neuronal spiking. Our findings suggest that resting EEG activity in PD is characterized by medication-invariant differences in aperiodic activity which is independent of the increase in alpha power with EO. This highlights the importance of considering aperiodic activity contributions to the neural correlates of brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Preterm children show developmental cognitive and language deficits that can be subtle and sometimes undetectable until later in life. Studies of brain development in children who are born preterm have largely focused on vascular and gross anatomical characteristics rather than pathophysiological processes that may contribute to these developmental deficits. Neural encoding of speech as reflected in EEG recordings is predictive of future language development and could provide insights into those pathophysiological processes. We recorded EEG from 45 preterm ([&le;] 34 weeks of gestation) and 45 full-term ([&ge;] 38 weeks) Chinese-learning infants 0 to 12 months of (corrected) age during natural sleep. Each child listened to three speech stimuli that differed in lexically meaningful pitch (2 native and 1 non-native speech categories). EEG measures associated with synchronization and gross power of the frequency following response (FFR) were examined. ANCOVAs revealed no main effect of stimulus nativeness but main effects of age, consistent with earlier studies. A main effect of prematurity also emerged, with synchronization measures showing stronger group differences than power. By detailing differences in FFR measures related to synchronization and power, this study brings us closer to identifying the pathophysiological pathway to often subtle language problems experienced by preterm children.",

    "abstract": "Adult stem cells play a critical role in tissue repair and maintenance. In tissues with slow turnover, including skeletal muscle, these cells are maintained in a mitotically quiescent state yet remain poised to re-enter the cell cycle to replenish themselves and regenerate the tissue. Using a multiomics approach we identify the PAX7/NEDD4L axis as a checkpoint against muscle stem cell activation in homeostatic skeletal muscle. Our findings demonstrate that PAX7 transcriptionally activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L and that the conditional genetic deletion of Nedd4L impairs muscle stem cell quiescence, with an upregulation of cell cycle and myogenic differentiation genes. Loss of Nedd4L in muscle stem cells results in the expression of DCX which is only expressed during their in vivo activation. Together, this data establishes that the ubiquitin proteasome system, mediated by Nedd4L, is a key regulator of the muscle stem cell quiescent state in non-injured skeletal muscle.\n\nHighlights- General inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system with MG132 results in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) breaking quiescence.\n- The E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L is a transcriptional target of Pax7.\n- The Pax7/Nedd4l axis restricts MuSC activation in homeostatic skeletal muscle.\n- Genetic deletion of Nedd4L induces MuSCs transition towards activation.",

While the morphological changes associated with the transition are well-characterized, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the maturation process are not fully understood. Here, we leverage intestinal organoid cultures to profile transcriptional, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and 3D chromatin conformation landscapes defining fetal and adult epithelial cells. We observed prominent differences in gene expression and enhancer activity, accompanied by changes in 3D organization and local changes in DNA accessibility and methylation, between the two cellular states. Using integrative analyses, we identified sustained YAP transcriptional activity as a major gatekeeper of the immature fetal state. We found the YAP-associated transcriptional network to be regulated at various levels of chromatin organization, and likely to be coordinated by changes in extracellular matrix composition. Altogether, our work highlights the value of unbiased profiling of regulatory landscapes for the identification of key mechanisms underlying tissue maturation.",

We validate ECLiPSE through unsupervised and supervised classification on a dataset featuring five distinct cellular structures, achieving exceptionally high classification accuracies nearing 100%. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to two novel biological applications: quantifying the clearance of tau protein aggregates, a critical marker for neurodegenerative diseases, and differentiating between two distinct morphological features (morphotypes) of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathy, potentially associated to different TDP-43 strains, each exhibiting unique seeding and spreading properties. We anticipate that this versatile approach will significantly enhance the way we study cellular structures across various biological contexts, elucidating their roles in disease development and progression.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, the timing of events at the cellular level must be coordinated across multiple length scales to ensure the formation of a well-proportioned body plan. This is clear during somitogenesis, where the progenitors must be allocated to the axis over time whilst maintaining a progenitor population for continued elaboration of the body plan. However, the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic signals in timing progenitor addition at the single cell level is not yet understood. Heterochronic grafts from older to younger embryos have suggested a level of intrinsic timing whereby later staged cells contribute to more posterior portions of the axis. To determine the precise step at which cells are delayed, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis on heterochronic grafts of somite progenitors in the chicken embryo. This revealed a previously undescribed cell state within which heterochronic grafted cells are stalled, post-ingression through the primitive streak. The delayed exit of older cells from this state correlates with expression of posterior Hox genes. Using grafting and explant culture, we find that both Hox gene expression and the migratory capabilities of progenitor populations are intrinsically regulated at the population level. Therefore, we demonstrate that cell dispersion is controlled by a population intrinsic timer to control progenitor addition to the presomitic mesoderm.",

The shortwave spectral reflectance of leaves is a promising tool for rapidly identifying species at different taxonomic ranks. However, the spectral reflectance of leaves changes in response to biotic and abiotic conditions. This investigation asked how this variability affects the accuracy of methods used to predict plant taxonomies and what factors most influence the spectral signature of leaves. To answer these questions, we measured the reflectance of leaves of 62 woody species from the living collection at the NYBG twice in two pairwise samplings. We found that PLS-DA accuracy improved when we used a larger sample of natural variance in the classification model. Finally, to evaluate whether there was an influence of the species relatedness or the growing environment on structural and biochemical traits predicted from the leaf reflectance, we ran a phylogenetic signal analysis and a series of mixed effects model analyses that showed no phylogenetic but an environmental influence. We found that the increase in temperature and relative humidity variability explained the increment of predicted carotene and the decrease of Nitrogen content for the first pairwise analysis. For the second pairwise analysis, we found that the reduction of relative humidity variability explained leaf water and Nitrogen content decrease, and relative humidity decrease combined with day length decrease explained a decline in LMA.",

    "abstract": "Future climate projections predict a more variable world. Understanding how populations respond to increasing variability is a major focus for modelers and natural resource managers attempting to predict extinction risk. Current theory of extinction risk is based on models that assume populations reach a stable, deterministic equilibrium in the absence of environmental variation. The lesson from these models is clear: Increasing environmental variability increases population size variability and extinction risk. Although useful, these models fail to describe a broad class of empirically observed dynamics, namely cycles. We develop new theory for the effects of environmental variability on the dynamics of cycling populations. We find that when populations are driven by endogenous cycles, increasing environmental variability can reduce population size variability, contrary to all prior expectations that populations fluctuate more in more variable environments. This result relies on strong density-dependent feedback and represents a novel mechanism by which stochastic variation interacts with density-dependence. Moreover, these results highlight that theories of extinction and stability must be expanded to include more complex forms of the interactions between density-dependence and stochasticity.",

To overcome this limitation, we develop ProteinGenerator, a sequence space diffusion model based on RoseTTAfold that simultaneously generates protein sequences and structures. Beginning from random amino acid sequences, our model generates sequence and structure pairs by iterative denoising, guided by any desired sequence and structural protein attributes. To explore the versatility of this approach, we designed proteins enriched for specific amino acids, with internal sequence repeats, with masked bioactive peptides, with state dependent structures, and with key sequence features of specific protein families. ProteinGenerator readily generates sequence-structure pairs satisfying the input conditioning (sequence and/or structural) criteria, and experimental validation showed that the designs were monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), had the desired secondary structure content by circular dichroism (CD), and were thermostable up to 95{degrees}C. By enabling the simultaneous optimization of both sequence and structure, ProteinGenerator allows for the design of functional proteins with specific sequence and structural attributes, and paves the way for protein function optimization by active learning on sequence-activity datasets.",

    "abstract": "From mathematical models of growth to computer simulations of pigmentation, the study of shell formation has given rise to an abundant number of models, working at various scales. Yet, attempts to combine those models have remained sparse, due to the challenge of combining categorically different approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework to streamline the process of combining the molecular and tissue scales of shell formation. We choose these levels as a proxy to link the genotype level, which is better described by molecular models, and the phenotype level, which is better described by tissue-level mechanics. We also show how to connect observations on shell populations to the approach, resulting in collections of molecular parameters that may be associated with different populations of real shell specimens.\n\nThe approach is as follows: we use a Quality-Diversity algorithm, a type of black-box optimization algorithm, to explore the range of concentration profiles emerging as solutions of a molecular model, and that define growth patterns for the mechanical model. At the same time, the mechanical model is simulated over a wide range of growth patterns, resulting in a variety of spine shapes. While time-consuming, these steps only need to be performed once and then function as look-up tables. Actual pictures of shell spines can then be matched against the list of existing spine shapes, yielding a potential growth pattern which, in turn, gives us matching molecular parameters. The framework is modular, such that models can be easily swapped without changing the overall working of the method. As a demonstration of the approach, we solve specific molecular and mechanical models, adapted from available theoretical studies on molluscan shells, and apply the multiscale framework to evaluate the characteristics of spines from three distinct populations of Turbo sazae.\n\nAuthor summaryConnecting genotype to phenotype is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. While many studies examine this link in model organisms for which gene regulatory networks are well known, for non-model organisms, different techniques are required, and multiscale computational modeling offers a promising direction. In this paper, we develop a framework linking molecular-scale interactions to tissue-level growth and mechanics to organism-level characteristics in order to investigate spine formation in T. sazae, a species of mollusc that displays remarkable phenotypic plasticity in spine form. Our analysis uncovers a subtle but statistically significant difference in spine form between shell specimens collected from three different localities in Japan. Moreover, by tracing the difference in form through parametric differences in the multiscale framework, we provide mechanistic insight as to how environmental differences may translate to a change in form. The methodology we present may readily be extended to more detailed modeling of this system, and the conceptual framework is amenable for multiscale analysis in other systems.",

    "abstract": "More than half of all brain tumour survivors experience debilitating and often progressive cognitive decline after treatment with radiotherapy. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the brain, have been implicated in this decline. In response to various insults microglia can develop innate immune memory (IIM), which can either enhance (priming) or repress (tolerance) the response to subsequent inflammatory challenges. Here, we investigated whether radiation affects the IIM of microglia by irradiating the brains of rats and later exposing them to a secondary inflammatory stimulus. Comparative transcriptomic profiling and protein validation of microglia isolated from irradiated rats showed a stronger immune response to a secondary inflammatory insult demonstrating that radiation can lead to long-lasting molecular reprogramming of microglia. Transcriptomic analysis of post-mortem normal-appearing non-tumour brain tissue of glioblastoma patients indicates that radiation-induced microglial priming is conserved in humans. Targeting microglial priming after radiotherapy or avoiding further inflammatory insults could decrease radiotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Numerous intracellular bacterial pathogens interfere with macrophage function, including macrophage polarization, to establish a niche and persist. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage polarization during infection within host remain to be investigated. Here, we implement a model of persistent Salmonella Typhimurium infection in zebrafish, which allows visualization of polarized macrophages and bacteria in real time at high-resolution. While macrophages polarize toward M1-like phenotype to control early infection, during later stages, Salmonella persists inside non-inflammatory clustered macrophages. Transcriptomic profiling of macrophages confirmed a highly dynamic signature during infection characterized by a switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory/pro-regenerative status and revealed a shift in adhesion program. In agreement with this specific adhesion signature, macrophage trajectory tracking identifies motionless macrophages as a permissive niche for persistent Salmonella. Our results demonstrate that zebrafish model provides a unique platform to explore, in a whole organism, the versatile nature of macrophage functional programs during bacterial acute and persistent infections.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate diagnostics of bacterial infections are necessary for efficient treatment of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Cultivation-based methods, such as antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), are slow, resource-demanding, and can fail to produce results before the treatment needs to start. This increases patient risks and antibiotic overprescription. Here, we present a deep-learning method that uses transformers to merge patient data with available AST results to predict antibiotic susceptibilities that have not been measured. The method is combined with conformal prediction (CP) to enable the estimation of uncertainty at the patient-level. After training on three million AST results from thirty European countries, the method made accurate predictions for most antibiotics while controlling the error rates, even when limited diagnostic information was available. We conclude that transformers and CP enables confidence-based decision support for bacterial infections and, thereby, offer new means to meet the growing burden of antibiotic resistance.",

While transported by kinesin-2 on anterograde IFT trains, the dynein-2 motor adopts an autoinhibitory conformation until it needs to be activated at the ciliary tip to power retrograde IFT. Growing evidence has linked the IFT-A complex to retrograde IFT; however, its roles in this process remain unknown.\n\nHere, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing to disable the dynein-2 autoinhibition mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans, and assessed its impact on IFT with high-resolution live imaging and photobleaching analyses. Remarkably, this dynein-2 \"hot-wiring\" approach reignites retrograde motility inside IFT-A-deficient cilia, without triggering tug-of-war events. In addition to providing functional evidence that multiple mechanisms maintain dynein-2 inhibited during anterograde IFT, our data uncover key roles for IFT-A in: mediating motor-train coupling during IFT turnaround; promoting retrograde IFT initiation; and modulating dynein-2 retrograde motility.\n\nHighlights- Hot-wiring mutations enable dynein-2 to undergo retrograde movement in IFT-A-deficient cilia\n- Disabling dynein-2 autoinhibition reveals that multiple mechanisms restrain dynein-2 activity during anterograde IFT\n- IFT-A promotes retrograde IFT initiation and efficient dynein-2 motility\n- IFT-A mediates dynein-2 coupling to retrograde IFT trains",

    "abstract": "Over the past ten years, many studies demonstrated the crucial role of the tick microbiome in tick biology. The soft tick Ornithodoros moubata is a hematophagous ectoparasite of Suidae particularly known to transmit the African swine fever virus. Its bacterial microbiota is characterized by a high prevalence of Francisella-like and Rickettsia endosymbionts. The present study aims to better understand the potential influence of the microbiota on the reproductive fitness of O. moubata. A total of 132 adult female ticks were treated using gentamycin or rifampicin added to the blood meal. Half of the ticks also received a supplementation with B vitamins to address the nutritional role of endosymbionts. Over two periods of 50 days, several traits related to the reproductive fitness were monitored to investigate the importance of Francisella and Rickettsia for those traits. It appeared that most of the considered reproductive parameters were not affected. However, antibiotic treatments induced an increase in the tick survival indicating a potential fitness cost of harboring endosymbionts for ticks during the reproduction period. Similarly, 366 first stage nymphs of Ornithodoros moubata were exposed to the same treatments for molecular quantification of both endosymbionts. Results from qPCR suggested that treatments produced a bacteriostatic effect on endosymbionts without fully eliminating Francisella or Rickettsia.",

    "abstract": "Coding variants that have significant impact on function can provide insights into the biology of a gene but are typically rare in the population. Identifying and ascertaining the frequency of such rare variants requires very large sample sizes. Here, we present the largest catalog of human protein-coding variation to date, derived from exome sequencing of 985,830 individuals of diverse ancestry to serve as a rich resource for studying rare coding variants. Individuals of African, Admixed American, East Asian, Middle Eastern, and South Asian ancestry account for 20% of this Exome dataset. Our catalog of variants includes approximately 10.5 million missense (54% novel) and 1.1 million predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants (65% novel, 53% observed only once). We identified individuals with rare homozygous pLOF variants in 4,874 genes, and for 1,838 of these this work is the first to document at least one pLOF homozygote. Additional insights from the RGC-ME dataset include 1) improved estimates of selection against heterozygous loss-of-function and identification of 3,459 genes intolerant to loss-of-function, 83 of which were previously assessed as tolerant to loss-of-function and 1,241 that lack disease annotations; 2) identification of regions depleted of missense variation in 457 genes that are tolerant to loss-of-function; 3) functional interpretation for 10,708 variants of unknown or conflicting significance reported in ClinVar as cryptic splice sites using splicing score thresholds based on empirical variant deleteriousness scores derived from RGC-ME; and 4) an observation that approximately 3% of sequenced individuals carry a clinically actionable genetic variant in the ACMG SF 3.1 list of genes. We make this important resource of coding variation available to the public through a variant allele frequency browser. We anticipate that this report and the RGC-ME dataset will serve as a valuable reference for understanding rare coding variation and help advance precision medicine efforts.",

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) mimic this protective environment in ex vivo co-cultures with leukemic cells obtained from children with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL. We examined the potential mechanisms of this protection by RNA sequencing of flow-sorted MSCs after co-culture with BCP-ALL cells. Leukemic cells induced an interferon (IFN)-related gene signature in MSCs, which was partially dependent on cell-cell signaling by tunneling nanotubes. The signature was selectively induced by BCP-ALL cells, most profoundly by ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL cells, as co-culture of MSCs with healthy immune cells did not provoke a similar IFN signature. Leukemic cells and MSCs both secreted IFN and IFN{beta}, but no IFN{gamma}. In line, the IFN-gene signature was sensitive to blockade of IFN/{beta} signaling, but less to that of IFN{gamma}. The viability of leukemic cells and level of resistance to three chemotherapeutic agents was not affected by interference with IFN signaling using selective IFN/{beta} inhibitors or silencing of IFN-related genes. Taken together, our data suggest that the leukemia-induced expression of IFN/{beta}-related genes by MSCs does not support survival of BCP-ALL cells but may serve a different role in the pathobiology of BCP-ALL.",

This is both due to the desire to obtain a wider variety of flavours in the product and to reduce the final alcohol content. Given the metabolic differences between the yeast species, we wanted to account for some of the differences by using in silico models.\n\nResultsWe created and studied genome-scale metabolic models of five different non-Saccharomyces species using an automated processes. These were: Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Lachancea thermotolerans, Hanseniaspora osmophila and Kluyveromyces lactis. Using the models, we predicted that M. pulcherrima, when compared to the other species, conducts more respiration and thus produces less fermentation products, a finding which agrees with experimental data. Complex I of the electron transport chain was to be present in M. pulcherrima, but absent in the others. The predicted importance of Complex I was diminished when we incorporated constraints on the amount of enzymatic protein, as this shifts the metabolism towards fermentation.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that Complex I in the electron transport chain is a key differentiator between Metschnikowia pulcherrima and the other yeasts considered. Yet, more annotations and experimental data have the potential to improve model quality in order to increase fidelity and confidence in these results. Further experiments should be conducted to confirm the in vivo effect of Complex I in M. pulcherrima and its respiratory metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Cells live and interact in three-dimensional (3D) cellular neighborhoods. However, histology and spatial omics methods mostly focus on 2D tissue sections. Here we present a 3D spatial atlas of a routine clinical sample, an aggressive human lung carcinoma, by combining in situ quantification of 960 cancer-related genes across [~]340,000 cells with measurements of tissue-mechanical components. 3D cellular neighborhoods subdivided the tumor microenvironment into tumor, stromal, and immune multicellular niches. Interestingly, pseudotime analysis suggested that pro-invasive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), detected in stroma-infiltrating tumor cells, already occurred in one region at the tumor surface. There, myofibroblasts and macrophages specifically co-localized with pre-invasive tumor cells and their multicellular molecular signature identified patients with shorter survival. Moreover, cytotoxic T-cells did not infiltrate this niche but colocalized with inhibitory dendritic and regulatory T cells. Importantly, systematic scoring of cell-cell interactions in 3D neighborhoods highlighted niche-specific signaling networks accompanying tumor invasion and immune escape. Compared to 2D, 3D neighborhoods improved the characterization of immune niches by identifying dendritic niches, capturing the 3D extension of T-cell niches and boosting the quantification of niche-specific cell-cell interactions, including druggable immune checkpoints. We believe that 3D communication analyses can improve the design of clinical studies investigating personalized, combination immuno-oncology therapies.",

    "abstract": "Brain age is an estimate of chronological age obtained from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (T1w MRI) and represents a simple diagnostic biomarker of brain ageing and associated diseases. While the current best accuracy of brain age predictions on healthy subject T1w MRIs is from two to three years, comparing results from different studies is challenging due to differences in datasets, T1w preprocessing pipelines, and performance metrics used. This paper investigates the impact of T1w image preprocessing on the performance of four deep learning-based brain age models presented in recent literature. Four preprocessing pipelines were evaluated, differing in terms of registration, grayscale correction, and software implementation. The results showed that the choice of software implementation can significantly affect the prediction error, with a maximum increase of 0.7 years in mean absolute error (MAE) for the same model and dataset. While grayscale correction had no significant impact on MAE, the affine registration, compared to the rigid registration of T1w images to brain atlas was shown to statistically significantly improve MAE. Models trained on 3D images with isotropic 1 mm3 resolution were less sensitive to T1w preprocessing than 2D models or models trained on downsampled 3D images. Contrary to the indications from research literature that models trained on less preprocessed T1w scans are better suited for age predictions on T1w images from new scanners, not seen in model training, our results show that extensive T1w preprocessing in fact improves the MAE when new dataset is used. Regardless of model or T1w preprocessing used, we show that to enable generalization of models performance on a new dataset with either the same or different T1w preprocessing than the one applied in model training some form of bias correction should be applied.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThis study involved a thorough and reproducible quantitative assessment of the impact of four T1w preprocessing variants on brain age prediction accuracy using four recent deep learning-based model architectures.\nC_LIO_LIRepeated model training with random initialization and use of linear mixed-effects models enabled the statistical analysis of the effect of various confounding factors on brain age prediction accuracy.\nC_LIO_LIThe choice of T1w preprocessing software implementation resulted in statistically significant increase in mean absolute error of up to 0.7 years for the same model and dataset.\nC_LIO_LIOur results show that extensive T1w preprocessing, with higher degree of freedom in T1w to atlas registration and extensive grayscale corrections, and bias correction improve the generalization of brain age models performances when applied on new unseen datasets.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, olfactory receptors localize on multiple cilia elaborated on dendritic knobs of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Although olfactory cilia dysfunction can cause anosmia, how their differentiation is programmed at the transcriptional level has remained largely unexplored. We discovered in zebrafish and mice that Foxj1, a forkhead domain-containing transcription factor linked with motile cilia biogenesis, is expressed in OSNs and required for olfactory epithelium (OE) formation. In keeping with the immotile nature of olfactory cilia, we observed that ciliary motility genes are repressed in zebrafish, mouse, and human OSNs. Strikingly, we also found that besides ciliogenesis, Foxj1 controls the differentiation of the OSNs themselves by regulating their cell type-specific gene expression, such as that of olfactory marker protein (omp) involved in odor-evoked signal transduction. In line with this, response to bile acid, an odor detected by OMP-positive OSNs, was significantly diminished in foxj1 mutant zebrafish. Taken together, our findings establish how the canonical Foxj1-mediated motile ciliogenic transcriptional program has been repurposed for the biogenesis of immotile olfactory cilia and for development of the OSNs.",

    "abstract": "Successful extraction of tactile and kinematic information is crucial for appropriate motor actions in daily life. To achieve this objective, sensory signals should be effectively regulated during motor actions. This regulation is understood both empirically and conceptually, but it is not well known where and how it is implemented in the central nervous system. Here, we show that, during voluntary movement, sensory signals are already attenuated in the primate cuneate nucleus, an early processing site in the ascending lemniscus pathway. The degree of suppression was comparable with the one reported in the cortex, suggesting that psychological attenuation of somatosensation could be ascribed to the cuneate. The results also revealed that this sensory attenuation was of descending origin, suggesting that cortical sensory prediction signals could regulate cuneate sensory transmission for extracting meaningful, and attenuate unnecessary, signals for movement regulation. This recurrent sensory modulation mechanism between cortical and subcortical areas may generalize to other sensory modalities and cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. Importantly, non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes also play significant roles in disease pathogenesis. However, mechanisms of astrocyte contribution to ALS remain incompletely understood. Astrocyte involvement suggests that transcellular signaling may play a role in disease. We examined contribution of transmembrane signaling molecule ephrinB2 to ALS pathogenesis, in particular its role in driving motor neuron damage by spinal cord astrocytes. In symptomatic SOD1G93A mice (a well-established ALS model), ephrinB2 expression was dramatically increased in ventral horn astrocytes. Reducing ephrinB2 in these cervical spinal cord astrocytes via viral-mediated shRNA delivery reduced motor neuron loss and preserved respiratory function by maintaining phrenic motor neuron innervation of diaphragm. EphrinB2 expression was also elevated in human ALS spinal cord. These findings implicate ephrinB2 upregulation as both a transcellular signaling mechanism underlying astrocyte pathogenicity in mutant SOD1-associated ALS and a promising therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Chronically high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) can compromise healthy ageing and lifespan at individual level. Elevated oxidative stress can play a central role in hyperglycaemia-induced pathologies. Nevertheless, the lifespan of birds shows no species-level association with blood glucose. This suggests that the potential pathologies of high blood glucose levels can be avoided at the macroevolutionary scale by adaptations in oxidative physiology. However, this hypothesis remains unexplored. Here we examined this hypothesis using comparative analyses controlled for phylogeny, allometry and fecundity based on data from 51 songbird species. We measured blood glucose at baseline and after stress stimulus and computed glucose stress reactivity as the magnitude of change between the two time points. We also measured three parameters of non-enzymatic antioxidants (uric acid, total antioxidants and glutathione) and a marker of oxidative lipid damage (malondialdehyde). We found no or weak evidence for blood glucose concentration coevolving with either antioxidant or lipid damage levels. The only exceptions were the moderate evidence for species with a stronger stress-induced increase in blood glucose concentration evolving moderately lower investment into antioxidant defence (uric acid and glutathione). Neither baseline nor stress-induced glucose levels were associated with oxidative physiology. Our findings essentially support the hypothesis that birds evolved adaptations preventing the putative (glyc)oxidative costs of high blood glucose. Such adaptations may explain the decoupled evolution of glycaemia and lifespan in birds, and possibly the paradoxical combination of long lifespan and high blood glucose levels in birds relative to mammals.\n\nSummary statementHigh blood glucose levels can harm organisms by causing oxidative stress. We show that birds defy this expectation. Avian physiology could provide solutions for diabetes treatment.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are ubiquitous and inhabit every known terrestrial habitat. Pathogenic fungi are highly diverse, and recent years have seen an uprise in the emergence of new pathogens on crops, animals and humans. The order Trichosporonales (Tremellomycetes, Agaricomycotina, Basidiomycota) harbours saprobic and a few opportunistic human pathogenic species. These emerging pathogens cause superficial skin irritations, as well as invasive life-threatening infections. Yet, little is known about their evolution, ecology, virulence mechanisms and transition to pathogenic lifestyles. In this study we aimed to determine genomic signatures associated with lifestyle transitions, virulence and host/substrate specialization among 30 Trichosporonales species from a total of 41 genome sequences. We used comparative analyses of genome content, including gene functional categories, repetitive element content and tRNA composition among saprotrophic and reported opportunistic human pathogens. A genome-scale phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that even though the different genera are monophyletic, opportunistic pathogenic species are present in distantly-related clades. Statistical analyses showed that differences in genome structure among species did not correlate with predicted lifestyles. Intriguingly, we found that tRNA content varied widely across species (from 51 to 1455 manually curated tRNA genes). The expansion was independent from the phylogenetic structure. Opportunistic pathogenic species showed an overall increased efficiency in the translation of genes associated with host colonization (i.e. lipid metabolism), while exclusively saprotrophic species showed an increase translation efficiency for genes associated with a saprotrophic lifestyle (i.e. carbohydrate metabolism). This pattern was consistent among distantly-related saprotrophic and pathogenic Cryptococcus species (order Tremellales). In conclusion, our analyses link genomic information with ecology and fungal lifestyles across an entire order. We find evidence for an evolutionary scenario where distinct habitats select for an optimized translation of genes involved in successful proliferation in the respective habitat. We predict that lifestyles are not strictly defined by gene repertoires, but also by expression profiles in fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Cellular Raman spectra are optical signatures reflecting comprehensive molecular composition of cells. It has been shown recently that condition-dependent cellular transcriptome profiles are inferable from the changes in cellular Raman spectra. However, it remains elusive whether the other layers of omics are also inferable from Raman spectra and what constraints in gene expression profiles enable such inference. Here we show that proteome profiles of Escherichia coli across diverse conditions are predictable from cellular Raman spectra using simple ordinary linear regression. Employing methods in graph theory, we characterize core and peripheral stoichiometrically-conserved groups in the proteomes and reveal that major changes in cellular Raman spectra reflect low-dimensional proteome structure constructed from the global stoichiometry conservation relations. Mathematical analysis suggests a proportionality between stoichiometry conservation strength and condition-specificity of gene expression, which turns out universal across omics classes and organisms. Furthermore, stoichiometry conservation strength correlates with the essentiality and evolutionary conservation of each gene. These results provide an omics-level interpretation of cellular Raman spectra and uncover an architectural principle of global omics profiles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer-testis (CT) genes are targets for tumor antigen-specific immunotherapy given that their expression is normally restricted to the immune-privileged testis in healthy individuals with aberrant expression in tumor tissues. While they represent targetable germ-tissue antigens and play important functional roles in tumorigenesis, there is currently no standardized approach for identifying clinically relevant CT genes. Optimized algorithms and validated methods for accurate prediction of reliable CT antigens with high immunogenicity are also lacking.\n\nMethodsSequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) databases was utilized for the development of a bioinformatic pipeline to identify CT exclusive genes. A CT germness score was calculated based on the number of CT genes expressed within a tumor type and their degree of expression. The impact of tumor germness with clinical outcome was evaluated using healthy GTEx and GDC tumor samples. We then used a triple-negative breast cancer mouse model to develop and test an algorithm that predicts epitope immunogenicity based on the identification of germline sequences with strong MHCI and MHCII binding affinities. Germline sequences for CT genes were synthesized as long synthetic peptide vaccines and tested in the 4T1 triple-negative model of invasive breast cancer with Poly(I:C) adjuvant. Vaccine immunogenicity was determined by flow cytometric analysis of in vitro and in vivo T cell responses. Primary tumor growth and lung metastasis was evaluated by histopathology, flow cytometry and colony formation assay.\n\nResultsWe developed a new bioinformatic pipeline to reliably identify CT exclusive genes as immunogenic targets for immunotherapy. We identified CT genes that are exclusively expressed within the testis, lack detectable thymic expression, and are significantly expressed in multiple tumor types. High tumor germness correlated with tumor progression but not with tumor mutation burden, supporting CT antigens as appealing targets in low mutation burden tumors. Importantly, tumor germness also correlated with markers of anti-tumor immunity. Vaccination of 4T1 tumor bearing mice with Siglece and Lin28a antigens resulted in increased T cell anti-tumor immunity and reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastases.\n\nConclusionOur results present a novel strategy for the identification of highly immunogenic CT antigens for the development of targeted vaccines that induce anti-tumor immunity and inhibit metastasis.",

Although ligands bind to EGFR while the receptor is exposed on the plasma membrane, EGFR incorporation into endosomes following receptor internalization is an important aspect of EGFR signaling, with EGFR internalization behavior dependent upon the type of ligand bound. We develop quantitative modeling, both kinetic and with spatial details, for EGFR recruitment to and internalization from clathrin domains and competition with ligand unbinding from EGFR. We find that a combination of spatial and kinetic proofreading leads to enhanced EGFR internalization ratios in comparison to unbinding differences between ligand types. Various stages of the EGFR internalization process, including recruitment to and internalization from clathrin domains, modulate the internalization differences between receptors bound to different ligands. Our results indicate that following ligand binding, EGFR may encounter multiple clathrin domains before successful recruitment and internalization.

    "abstract": "Diuresis refers to increase in the rate of urine flow and sodium excretion from the system via the urine. It is a necessary excretory process that may prove difficult for some disease systems e.g. enlarged prostates. Hypertension occurs as a result of systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg. It is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting more a billion people worldwide. A high dietary sodium intake is one of the factors associated with the development of hypertension. Clerodendrum chinensis is used by local communities in West Africa for its diuretic and anti-hypertensive properties. We analyse the phytochemical properties of the mixed leaf, root and stem aqueous extract of the plant and investigate its anti-hypertensive and diuretic activity in Sodium chloride diet induced hypertensive rats. The anti-hypertensive effect of extract at different concentrations (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) was studied and compared with known drug compound; Furosemide. Treated animal urine was analyzed for urinary excretion and diuretic action. The anti-hypertensive effect was statistically significant when compared with the control p < 0.001. The extract at 100mg/kg demonstrated the best systolic and diastolic blood pressure lowering potential as compared to other concentrations. The diuretic action of the plant extract at the lowest dose (100 mg/kg) was high and quantitatively similar to the standard drug. The combined powdered leaf, stem and roots aqueous extract of C. chinense possesses anti-hypertensive and diuretic potential in salt loaded hypertensive rats.",

Here, we report a population of immunomodulatory leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing barrier cells which ensheath sympathetic axon bundles in adipose tissues. These LepR-expressing Sympathetic Perineurial Cells (SPCs) produce IL33, a factor for maintenance and recruitment of regulatory T cell (Treg) and eosinophils in AT. Brown adipose tissues (BAT) of mice lacking IL33 in SPCs (SPCIL33cKO) have fewer Treg and eosinophils, resulting in increased BAT inflammation. SPCIL33cKO mice are more susceptible to diet-induced obesity, independently of food intake. Furthermore, SPCIL33cKO mice have impaired adaptive thermogenesis, and are unresponsive to leptin-induced rescue of metabolic adaptation. We, therefore, identify LepR-expressing SPCs as a source of IL33 which orchestrate an anti-inflammatory environment in BAT, preserving sympathetic-mediated thermogenesis and body weight homeostasis.

    "abstract": "Dysbiosis is characterized by a perturbed microbiota associated with host disease. In both plants and animals, the innate immune system contributes to maintain microbiota homeostasis in healthy organisms, with NADPH oxidases playing a crucial role. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the absence of NADPH oxidase RBOHD can lead to an altered leaf microbiota, including an enrichment of opportunistic Xanthomonas pathogens. It is currently unclear whether the microbiota change occurs independently of the opportunistic pathogens or is caused by the latter, and which virulence factors of Xanthomonas are essential for its opportunistic lifestyle. Here, we found that the opportunistic Xanthomonas strains secrete a cocktail of cell wall degrading enzymes via the type-2 secretion system (T2SS) that degrade leaf tissue and promote Xanthomonas growth during plant infection. Both disease severity and leaf degradation activity were increased in rbohD compared to Col-0 plants, attesting to the opportunistic behaviour of the Xanthomonas strains on immune compromised plants. Using gnotobiotic plant experiments with a synthetic bacterial community of more than 100 commensal strains and drop-in of Xanthomonas wildtype or mutant strains revealed that T2SS-dependent virulence is required for plant disease and for the shift in microbiota composition. Overall, our data indicate that a single opportunistic pathogen can drive community shifts, here caused by tissue damage in leaves, creating an environment in which specific commensal bacteria can thrive.",

    "abstract": "Despite the plant health-promoting effects of plant microbiota, these assemblages also comprise potentially detrimental microbes. How plant immunity controls its microbiota to promote plant health under these conditions remains largely unknown. We found that commensal bacteria isolated from healthy Arabidopsis plants trigger diverse patterns of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via the NADPH oxidase RBOHD that selectively inhibited specific commensals, notably Xanthomonas L148. Through random mutagenesis, we found that L148 gspE, encoding a type II secretion system (T2SS) component, is required for the damaging effects of Xanthomonas L148 on rbohD mutant plants.

    "abstract": "Brain mechanisms of error processing have often been investigated using response interference tasks and focusing on the posterior medial frontal cortex, which is also implicated in resolving response conflict in general. Thereby, the role other brain regions may play has remained undervalued. Here, activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses were used to synthesize the neuroimaging literature on brain activity related to committing errors versus responding successfully in interference tasks and to test for commonalities and differences. The salience network and the temporoparietal junction were commonly recruited irrespective of whether responses were correct or incorrect, pointing towards a general involvement in coping with situations that call for increased cognitive control. The dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, posterior thalamus, and left superior frontal gyrus showed error-specific convergence, which underscores their consistent involvement when performance goals are not met. In contrast, successful responding revealed stronger convergence in the dorsal attention network and lateral prefrontal regions. Underrecruiting these regions in error trials may reflect failures in activating the task-appropriate stimulus-response contingencies necessary for successful response execution.",

    "abstract": "Although we can quickly locate a familiar person even in a crowd, the underlying neuronal mechanism remains unclear. Recently, we found that the striatum tail (STRt), which is part of the basal ganglia, is sensitive to long-term reward history. Here, we show that long-term value-coding neurons are involved in the detection of socially familiar faces. Many STRt neurons respond to facial images, especially to those of socially familiar persons. Additionally, we found that these face-responsive neurons also encode the stable values of many objects based on long-term reward experiences. Interestingly, the strength of neuronal modulation of social familiarity bias (familiar or unfamiliar) and object value bias (high-valued or low-valued) were positively correlated. These results suggest that both social familiarity and stable object-value information are mediated by a common neuronal mechanism. This mechanism may contribute to the rapid detection of familiar faces in real-world contexts.\n\nTeaserThe common mechanism mediating social familiarity and stable object-value information may contribute to rapid detection of familiar faces.",

Meanwhile, some patients with strong PD-L1 expression remain immune checkpoint resistant. To better understand the molecular processes that influence the immune environment, there is an urgent need to characterize the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and identify biomarkers to predict patient survival outcomes.\n\nPatients and methodsOur study analyzed RNA-sequencing data from 178 GBM samples. Their unique gene expression patterns in the tumor microenvironment were analyzed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Through these expression patterns, a panel of T-cell exhaustion signatures, immunosuppressive cells, and clinical features correlates with immunotherapy response. The presence or absence of immune status and prognostic signatures was then validated with the test dataset.\n\nResults38.2% of GBM patients showed increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, significant enrichment of T cell exhaustion signals, higher proportion of immunosuppressive cells (macrophages and CD4 regulatory T cells) and nine inhibitory checkpoints (CTLA4, PDCD1, LAG3, BTLA, TIGIT, HAVCR2, IDO1, SIGLEC7, and VISTA). The immunodepleted class (IDC) was used to classify these immunocompromised individuals. Despite the high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes shown by IDC, such patients have a poor prognosis. Although PD-L1 was highly expressed in IDC, it suggested that there might be ICB resistance. There are many IDC predictive signatures to discover.\n\nConclusionPD-1 is strongly expressed in a novel immunosuppressive class of GBM, but this cluster may be resistant to ICB therapy. A comprehensive description of this drug-resistant tumor microenvironment could provide new insights into drug resistance mechanisms and improved immunotherapy techniques.",

    "abstract": "O_LIGas withdrawal from subterranean layers may generate land subsidence with consequences for soil micro-structure, hydrology, and ultimately local biological communities. In intertidal environments, land subsidence may change the local flooding regime and sediment composition, two main drivers of the macrozoobenthic community structure. In the Dutch Wadden Sea, a UNESCO world heritage site, gas extraction has resulted in an average subsidence of up to 2 mm y-1, of sand dunes, salt marshes and intertidal mudflats. These mudflats support a highly productive macrozoobenthic community, which offers important feeding grounds for birds and fishes. To what extent land subsidence due to gas extraction affects the macrozoobenthos remains unknown and increasingly important given sea level rise.\nC_LIO_LITaking advantage of an extensive monitoring program of the macrozoobenthic community, we evaluated the effect of anthropogenically caused land subsidence on sediment composition and intertidal macrozoobenthos. Nearly 4600 points were sampled yearly (2008-2020) across the Dutch Wadden Sea, allowing us to compare sediment composition and macrozoobenthos biomass within and outside the subsidence area while controlling for the main drivers of these variables. With an INLA-spde approach we could account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. We also compared population trends within and outside subsidence area for 31 species with different habitat use in terms of depth and sediment composition.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that median grain size of the sediment has decreased in the subsided area at 1 m y-1 while on average remaining constant in the rest of the intertidal mudflats. Mud fraction was 3% higher within the subsided area throughout the studied period. This had no effect on the total biomass of macrozoobenthos. However, the biomass of species that prefer deeper areas increased within the subsidence area compared to the area outside the subsidence area, and the opposite was true for species that prefer shallower places.\nC_LIO_LIPolicy implications: studies suggest that the present subsidence will not result in the drowning of the mudflat. However, we show that changes in sediment- and macrozoobenthic community composition might be happening.

The homozygous genome could exacerbate inbreeding depression by introducing homozygous deleterious alleles in the population. However, purging of inbreeding loads as they become homozygotes in small populations could alleviate the depression. The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is typically exists in small population living in forests in Northeast Asia and is among the most endangered animals on the planet with great symbolic significance of conservation. By comparing with captive individuals, we revealed substantially higher and more extensive inbreeding in the wild Amur tiger population (FROH=0.51) than in captive Amur tigers (FROH=0.26). We further found much less mutational loads in wild populations when compared with captive Amur tigers. However, the frequency of loss of function and deleterious nonsynonymous mutations inside ROH regions are much lower than that in non-ROH regions in both wild and captive Amur tigers, indicating the purging may had occurred in both populations but much effective in the wild population. In addition, we found the average frequency of deleterious alleles was much lower than that of neutral alleles in the wild population, indicating that the purifying selection contributed to the purging of mutational loads in the wild Amur tigers. These findings provide valuable genome-wide evidence to support the making of future conservation plans of wild Amur tigers.",

However, there is currently a lack of optimal tools for creating simulated data from  third-generation nanopore sequencing devices, which measure DNA or RNA molecules in the form of time-series current signal data. Here, we introduce Squigulator, a fast and simple tool for simulation of realistic nanopore signal data. Squigulator takes a reference genome, transcriptome or read sequences and generates corresponding raw nanopore signal data. This is compatible with basecalling software from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and other third-party tools, thereby providing a useful substrate for testing, debugging, validation and optimisation of nanopore analysis methods. The user may generate noise-free  ideal data, realistic data with noise profiles emulating specific ONT protocols, or they may deterministically modify noise parameters and other variables to shape the data to their needs. To highlight its utility, we use Squigulator to model the degree to which different types of noise impact the accuracy of ONT basecalling and downstream variant detection, revealing new insights into the properties of ONT data.

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, serotonergic signaling modulates sleep, mood, and cognitive control. During neuronal transmission, the synaptic concentration of serotonin is tightly controlled in a spatial and temporal manner by the serotonin transporter (SERT). Dysregulation of serotonergic signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of major-depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and autism-spectrum disorders, which makes SERT a primary target for prescription therapeutics, most notably selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). S-palmitoylation is an increasingly recognized dynamic post-translational modification, regulating protein kinetics, trafficking, and localization patterns upon physiologic/cellular stimuli. In this study, we reveal that human SERTs are a target for palmitoylation, and using the irreversible palmitoyl acyl-transferase inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (2BP) we have identified several associated functions. Using a lower dose of 2BP in shorter time frames, inhibition of palmitoylation was associated with reductions in SERT Vmax, without changes in Km or surface expression. With higher doses of 2BP for longer time intervals, inhibition of palmitoylation was consistent with the loss of cell surface and total SERT protein, suggesting palmitoylation is an important mechanism in regulating SERT trafficking and maintenance of SERT protein through biogenic or anti-degradative processes. Additionally, we have identified that treatment with the SSRI escitalopram decreases SERT palmitoylation analogous to 2BP, reducing SERT surface expression and transport capacity. Ultimately, these results reveal palmitoylation is a major regulatory mechanism for SERT kinetics and trafficking and may be the mechanism responsible for escitalopram-induced internalization and loss of total SERT protein.",

    "abstract": "Dormancy is a significant adaptation that enables organisms to overcome unfavorable seasons for survival and reproduction. Therefore, understanding the origin of dormancy is critical to comprehend the adaptation of tropical organisms to cold climates at high latitudes, limiting factors of their distribution. The great orange-tip butterfly Hebomoia glaucippe and its subspecies in East Asia exhibit various dormancy features and thus offer a suitable model for exploring seasonal adaptations in animals. Here, we investigated the dormancy of three subspecies of H. glaucippe in Japan: shirozui, liukiuensis, and cincia. Our rearing experiments indicate that shirozui and liukiuensis enter dormancy during the pupal stage under low temperatures and short-day conditions. Conversely, ssp. cincia does not exhibit dormancy even under similar conditions. Although Crateva religiosa, the only host plant in Japan, is deciduous, our field survey revealed that typhoon disturbances in autumn induce Lammas growth, and the following secondary shoots are used as a food source during winter in Yaeyama Islands, where ssp. cincia is distributed. Analyzing 10-year population dynamics and meteorological data, we demonstrated the seasonal occurrence of ssp. liukiuensis in Okinawa Island but not that of ssp. cincia in Ishigaki Island. By employing a non-linear time series causal inference framework, we discovered that temperature was causally related to butterfly occurrence on Okinawa Island, whereas maximum wind speed and precipitation had a causal relationship to butterfly occurrence on Ishigaki Island. The optimal time lag for both environmental factors that affect the population was approximately 60 days on Ishigaki Island, corresponding to the time from egg to adult in H. glaucippe. Collectively, these environmental factors are likely to determine the dynamics of the next generation of the Ishigaki population. Our findings suggest that frequent typhoons disturb seasonal defoliation cycles of the host plant and accompany Lammas growth in the Ryukyu Islands, reducing the selection pressure in the adaptation of H. glaucippe for cyclically-changing seasons, leading to the absence of dormancy in ssp. cincia.\n\nSignificanceMany organisms have evolved adaptive life histories to respond to seasonal and periodic environmental fluctuations. On the other hand, random environmental disturbances such as hurricanes and wildfires often occur on Earth, and these unpredictable events are likely to impact the life histories of organisms. Through comprehensive investigation using long-term time-series data, we proposed that typhoon-generated environmental disturbances may counteract the acquisition of dormancy by Hebomoia glaucippe in Japan. Our study highlights the significant impact of environmental disturbances on population dynamics and emphasizes that these frequent disturbances may obscure the influence of seasonal environmental changes, thereby promoting multifarious life-cycle evolution.",

    "abstract": "In Streptomyces scabiei, the main causative agent of common scab disease of root and tuber crops, the interaction between the substrate-binding protein (SBP) CebE (CebEscab) and cellotriose released by the plant host (KD in the nanomolar range) is the first event for the onset of its pathogenic lifestyle. Here we report the structure of CebEscab in complex with cellotriose at a 1.55 [A] resolution, adopting a general fold of the B subcluster of SBPs. The interaction between CebEscab and cellotriose involves multiple direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, the glucose monomer at the non-reducing end occupying the most conserved part of the substrate-binding cleft. As main interactions between the two domains of CebE involve cellotriose itself, the closed conformational state of CebE is performed via an induced-fit ligand binding mechanism where cellotriose binding triggers the domain movement. Analysis of regulon predictions revealed that the signaling pathway from the CebE-mediated cellotriose transport to the transcriptional activation of thaxtomin phytotoxin biosynthesis is conserved in Streptomyces spp causing common scab, except for Streptomyces ipomoeae that specifically colonizes sweet potatoes and responds to other and yet unknown virulence elicitors. Interestingly, strains belonging to pathogenic species turgidiscabies and caniscabies have a cellotriose-binding protein orthologous to the CebE protein of the saprophytic species Streptomyces reticuli with lower affinity for its substrate (KD in the micromolar range), suggesting higher cellotriose concentrations for perception of their host. Our work also provides the structural basis for the uptake of cellobiose and cellotriose by non-pathogenic cellulose-decomposing Streptomyces species.\n\nImportanceCommon scab is a disease caused by few Streptomyces species that affects important root and tuber crops including potato, beet, radish, and parsnip, resulting in major economic losses worldwide. In this work we unveiled the molecular basis of host recognition by these pathogens by solving the structure of the sugar-binding protein CebE of S. scabiei in complex with cellotriose, the main elicitor of the pathogenic lifestyle of these bacteria. We further revealed that the signaling pathway from CebE-mediated transport of cellotriose is conserved in all pathogenic species except S. ipomoeae that causes soft rot disease on sweet potatoes. Our work also provides the structural basis of the uptake of cellobiose and cellotriose in saprophytic Streptomyces species, the first step activating the expression of the enzymatic system degrading the most abundant polysaccharide on earth, cellulose.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/540135v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1915dd1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a65aaforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18bc293org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@937d2f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LICellotriose uptake triggers common scab in tuber/root crops by Streptomyces scabiei\nC_LIO_LICrystal structure of CebE of S. scabiei interacting with cellotriose is solved\nC_LIO_LICellotriose triggers the closed conformational state of CebE\nC_LIO_LIThe CebE/cellotriose route to pathogenicity is conserved in Streptomyces species\nC_LIO_LICebE-type background may affect the cellotriose concentration eliciting virulence\nC_LI",

We explore the use of these models to create as yet undiscovered instances of viral sequences in a pandemic situation. Towards this goal, we formulate a novel framework for training models to align the sequence generation problem to the characteristics of a pandemic. We applied our method to modeling the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, the primary driver of the COVID-19 pandemic, and compared our method to models trained via prevalent practices applied to biological sequence modeling. Our method substantially outperforms a state-of-the-art generative model finetuned on SARS-CoV2 data, producing samples containing sequences which are four times as likely to be real, undiscovered sequences, and ten times as infectious. Our method can forecast novel lineages of the virus up to approximately 3 months in advance. Given a limited sequence budget, our method generates sequences belonging to the Delta variant and multiple dominant Omicron subvariants up to a month in advance.",

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relations among genes from observational data is a fundamental problem in systems biology, especially in humans where direct gene interventions or perturbations are unethical/infeasible. Furthermore, causality is emerging as an integral factor for building interpretable and generalizable machine-learning models of complex phenotypes. Existing methods can discover causal relations from observed gene expression and matched genetic data using the well-established framework of Mendelian Randomization. But, the prevalence of expression measurement errors can mislead most existing methods into making wrong causal discoveries, especially among genes transcribed at low to moderate levels and using data with large sample size (say thousands as in modern genomic or GWAS studies).\n\nIn this study, we propose a new framework for causal discovery that is robust against measurement noise by extending an established statistical approach CIT (Causal Inference Test). We specifically developed a two-stage approach called RCD (Robust Causal Discovery), wherein we first estimate measurement error from gene expression data and then incorporate it to get consistent parameter estimates that could be used with appropriately extended statistical tests of correlation or mediation done in the original CIT. By quantifying and accounting for noise in the data, our RCD method is able to significantly outperform the baseline method in recovering ground-truth causal relations among simulated noisy genes and transcription factor to target gene relations among noisy yeast genes using data on 1012 yeast segregants. Encouraged by these results, we applied our RCD to a human setting where perturbations are infeasible and identified several causal relations, including ones involving transcriptional regulators in the skeletal muscle tissue.\n\nData and Code AvailabilityThe code that implements our two-stage RCD framework is available here: https://github.com/BIRDSgroup/RCD; code for reproducing the figures/tables in this manuscript is also provided in this link.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) is a clinically benign oncolytic virus which has been investigated for use in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer (BC). In human clinical trials, MRV has been shown to be safe, and multiple BC patients have shown partial responses to intratumoral and intravenous virus delivery. Combination therapies inclusive of MRV and current FDA approved BC chemotherapies are being investigated to target metastatic, early BC, and triple negative BC. Though MRV is being tested clinically, we still do not fully understand the highly variable patient responses to MRV therapy. One of the most aggressive BC subtypes is HER2+ BC, in which human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is dysregulated, resulting in increased growth, survival, and metastasis of cancer cells. FDA approved therapies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, target HER2 to prevent signaling of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. However, recent findings show that accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1) in HER2+ BC cells contributes to trastuzumab resistance. In this work, we provide evidence that MRV infects, replicates in, and kills HER2 overexpressing cells. MRV infection is also found to have variable effects on signaling pathways that activate or are activated by HER2 expression. Finally, we show that MRV reduces HIF-1 accumulation in all the cell lines tested, including a HER2+ BC cell line. These studies provide further evidence that MRV holds promise for use in conjunction with trastuzumab to treat HER2+ BC patients.",

    "abstract": "Most rod-shaped bacteria elongate by inserting new cell wall material into the inner surface of the cell sidewall. This is primarily performed by a highly conserved protein complex, the elongasome, which moves processively around the cell circumference and inserts long glycan strands that act as barrel-hoop-like reinforcing structures, thereby giving rise to a rod-shaped cell. However, it remains unclear how elongasome synthesis dynamics and termination events are regulated to determine the length of these critical cell-reinforcing structures. To address this, we developed a method to track individual elongasome complexes around the entire circumference of Bacillus subtilis cells for minutes-long periods using single molecule fluorescence microscopy. We found that the B. subtilis elongasome is highly processive and that processive synthesis events are frequent terminated by rapid reversal or extended pauses. We found that cellular levels of RodA regulate elongasome processivity, reversal and pausing. Our single molecule data, together with stochastic simulations, show that elongasome dynamics and processivity are regulated by molecular motor tug-of-war competition between several, likely two, oppositely oriented peptidoglycan synthesis complexes bound to the MreB filament. Our data, thus, demonstrate that molecular motor tug-of-war is a key regulator of elongasome dynamics in B. subtilis, which likely also regulates the cell shape via modulation of elongasome processivity.",

These relapses, which call for prolonged antibiotic treatment and increase the risk of emergence of resistance, may originate from ill understood adaptation of the pathogen to the host. Here, we studied three pairs of Escherichia coli strains corresponding to three cases of BJIs and their relapse to better understand in-patient adaptation.\n\nWhole genome comparison presented evidence for positive selection with prevalence of non-synonymous and loss of function mutations. Phenotypic characterization showed that biofilm formation capacity was not modified, contrary to what is usually described in such relapse cases. Although virulence was not modified, we identified the loss of two virulence factors (namely an AFA afimbrial adhesin and a YadA-like adhesin) contributing to immune system evasion in one of the studied relapse strain. Other selected strategies likely helped the relapse strains to outcompete competitors through global growth optimization and colicin production.

    "abstract": "The boreal spruce forest soil can assimilate atmospheric N2O through symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizae or with bacteria, especially during spring and autumn, when aerobic microsites to soil can form. In cold soils with large field capacity (FCD), high humidity and absence of fertilisation, a balance between absorption and emission of nitrous oxide and dinitrogen was observed to be close to zero, and even to assume negative values in some cases, thus suggesting that forest soils absorb more N2O than they emit. Furthermore, in the presence of cryptogamic coverings of mosses and lichens, the absorption value was observed to be greater than in forests with less coverage; although the main role in N2O absorption is played by soil and root system. However, the role played by epiphytic organisms in N2O absorption in the boreal forests has not been uncovered yet. We studied, N2O dynamics of the lichen, Platismatia glauca, showing that N2O is consumed especially at lower incubation temperatures. The quantitative analysis with real-time PCR of nitrous oxide reductase gene fragment nosZ, showed that enzyme is present in the lichen and the gene is more transcribed under lower incubation temperature. The presented results unveil that cryptogamic covers consume nitrous oxide (with values between 0.1 and 0.4 ng N2O-C/g (ww)/h) at the atmospheric concentration via complete dissimilatory denitrification when nitrogen is limited.",

    "abstract": "Since viruses have limited coding capacity in their genomes, they use host cell machinery to complete virtually every stage of their replication cycle. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is comprised of two concentric protein shells, the inner core and the outer capsid. Following attachment to its receptor, reovirus enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within endosomes reovirus utilizes host acid-dependent proteases to process the viral outer capsid. Specifically, the outer capsid protein {sigma}3 is degraded and 1 is cleaved to form the disassembly intermediate infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs). ISVPs undergo additional conformational changes into ISVP*s that release small peptides which mediate the penetration of endosomal membranes.\n\nMembrane penetration allows for delivery of the remaining viral core into the cytoplasm for subsequent gene expression. Here, we describe that the ubiquitin proteasome system controls an entry step of reovirus particles. We show that chemically inhibiting the proteasome blocks infection at a stage following ISVP formation but prior to transcriptional activation of cores. Specifically, inhibition of the proteasome prevents conformational changes in 1 characteristic of ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion. In the absence of these conformational changes, cores are unable to be delivered and become transcriptionally active, thereby blocking viral replication. This work highlights a previously unknown way in which reovirus relies on host factors for successful replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEDue to their limited genetic capacity, viruses are reliant on multiple host systems to replicate successfully. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is commonly used as a model system for understanding host-virus interactions. In this study, we identify the host ubiquitin proteasome system as a regulator of reovirus entry. Inhibition of the proteasome using a chemical inhibitor blocks reovirus uncoating. Blocking these events reduces subsequent replication of the virus. This work identifies that additional host factors controls reovirus entry.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome of the mosquito Aedes aegypti is largely determined by the environment and influences mosquito susceptibility for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Larval interactions with different bacteria can influence adult Ae. aegypti replication of arboviruses, but little is known about the role that mosquito host genetics play in determining how larval-bacterial interactions shape Ae aegypti susceptibility to arboviruses. To address this question, we isolated single bacterial isolates and complex microbiomes from Ae. aegypti larvae from various field sites in Senegal. Either single bacterial isolates or complex microbiomes were added to two different genetic backgrounds of Ae. aegypti in a gnotobiotic larval system. Using 16S amplicon sequencing we show that similarities in bacterial community structures when given identical microbiomes between different genetic backgrounds of Ae. aegypti was dependent on the source microbiome, and the abundance of single bacterial taxa differed between Ae. aegypti genotypes. Using single bacterial isolates or the entire preserved complex microbiome, we tested the ability of specific microbiomes to drive differences in infection rates for Zika virus in different genetic backgrounds of Ae. aegypti. We observed that the proportion of Zika virus-infected adults was dependent on the interaction between the larval microbiome and Ae. aegypti host genetics. By using the larval microbiome as a component of the environment, these results demonstrate that interactions between the Ae. aegypti genotype and its environment can influence Zika virus infection. As Ae. aegypti expands and adapts to new environments under climate change, an understanding of how different genotypes interact with the same environment will be crucial for implementing arbovirus transmission control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) are a valuable tool to study community assembly patterns, host-microbe interactions, and microbe-microbe interactions in a fully controllable setting. Constructing the SynCom inocula for plant-microbe experiments can be time consuming and difficult because a large number of isolates with different media requirements and growth rates are grown in parallel and mixed to appropriate titers. A potential workaround to assembling fresh SynCom inocula for every experiment could be to pre-make and freeze SynComs on a large scale, creating ready-to-use stock inocula. The objective of this study was to compare the reproducibility, stability, and colonization ability of freshly prepared versus frozen SynCom inocula. We used a community of seven species known to colonize maize roots. The results from inoculation with the frozen SynCom were as consistent as standardized de novo construction of fresh SynCom. Our results indicate that creating frozen SynCom inocula for repeated use in experiments not only saves time, but could also improve cross-experiment reproducibility. Although this approach was only validated with one SynCom, it demonstrates a principle that can be tested for improving approaches in constructing other SynComs.\n\nImportanceSynthetic communities (SynComs) are an invaluable tool to characterize and model plant-microbe interactions. Multimember SynComs approximate intricate real-world interactions between plants and their microbiome, but the complexity and time required for their construction increases enormously for each additional member added to the SynCom. Therefore, researchers who study a diversity of microbiomes using SynComs are looking for ways to simplify the use of SynComs. In this manuscript, we evaluate the feasibility of creating ready-to-use freezer stocks of a well-studied seven-member SynCom for maize roots. The frozen ready-to-use SynCom stocks work according to the principle of \"just add buffer and apply to sterilized seeds or seedlings\" and thus can save multiple days of laborious growing and combining of multiple microorganisms. We show that ready-to-use SynCom stocks provide comparable results to freshly constructued SynComs and thus allow for large time savings when working with SynComs.",

    "abstract": "The domestic mite Blomia tropicalis is a major source of allergens in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite its great medical importance, the allergome of this mite is not sufficiently studied. Only 14 allergen groups have been identified in B. tropicalis so far, even though early radioimmunoelectrophoresis techniques (27 uncharacterized allergen complexes) and comparative data based on 40 allergen groups officially recognized by WHO/IUIS in domestic astigmatid mites, suggest that a large set of additional allergens may be present. Here, we use a multiomics approach to assess the allergome of B. tropicalis using genomic, transcriptomic sequence data, and a highly sensitive protein abundance quantification. Out of 14 known allergen groups, we confirmed 13 (one WHO/IUIS allergen, Blo t 19, was found to be a contaminant originated from a nematode) and identified 16 potentially novel allergens using sequence similarity. These data indicate that B. tropicalis shares 27 known/deduced allergen groups with pyroglyphid house dust mites (genus Dermatophagoides). Among them, five allergen-encoding genes were highly expressed at the transcript level: Blo t 1, Blo t 5, Blo t 21 (known), Blo t 15, and Blo t 18 (predicted). However, at the protein level, a different set of most abundant allergens was found: Blo t 2, 10, 11, 20 and 21 (mite bodies) or Blo t 3, 4, 6 and predicted Blo t 13, 14 and 36 (mite feces). We show the use of an integrated omics method to identify and predict an array of mite allergens and advanced, label-free proteomics to determine allergen protein abundance. Our research identifies a large set of novel putative allergens and shows that expression levels of allergen-encoding genes may not be strictly correlated with the actual allergenic protein abundance in the mite bodies.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a major public health concern worldwide. Although praziquantel is currently available as the only treatment option for schistosomiasis, the absence of reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools highlights the need for the identification and characterization of new drug targets. Recently, we identified the B. glabrata homolog (accession number XP_013075832.1) of human CAXIV, showing 37% amino acid sequence identity, from a BLAST search in NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration/dehydration of CO2/HCO3. These enzymes are associated with many physiological processes, and their role in tumorigenesis has been widely implicated. CAs create an acidic extracellular environment that facilitates the survival, metastasis, and growth of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the role of CA inhibition in B. glabrata snails exposed to S. mansoni miracidia. We analyzed the expression of the B. glabrata CA encoding transcript in juvenile susceptible and resistant snails, with and without exposure to S. mansoni. Our results showed that the expression of the CA mRNA encoding transcript was upregulated during early and prolonged infection in susceptible snails (BBO2), but not in the resistant BS-90 stock. Notably, sodium salicylate, a form of aspirin, inhibited the expression of CA, post-exposure, to the parasite. Increasing research between parasites and cancer has shown that schistosomes and cancer cells share similarities in their capacity to proliferate, survive, and evade host immune mechanisms. Here, we show that this model system is a potential new avenue for understanding the role of CA in the metastasis and proliferation of cancer cells. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of CA as a biomarker for infection in other schistosomiasis-causing parasites, including S. japonicum and S. haematobium.",

    "abstract": "Increased expression and hyperactivation of the methyltransferase SETDB1 are commonly observed in cancer and central nervous system disorders. However, there are currently no reported SETDB1-specific methyltransferase inhibitors in the literature, suggesting this is a challenging target. Here, we disclose that the previously reported small-molecule ligand for SETDB1s Triple Tudor Domain, (R,R)-59, is unexpectedly able to increase SETDB1 methyltransferase activity both in vitro and in cells. Specifically, (R,R)-59 promotes in vitro SETDB1-mediated methylation of lysine 64 of the protein kinase Akt1. Treatment with (R,R)-59 also increased Akt1 threonine 308 phosphorylation and activation, a known consequence of Akt1 methylation, resulting in stimulated cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. (R,R)-59 is the first SETDB1 small-molecule positive activator for the methyltransferase activity of this protein. Mechanism of action studies show that full-length SETDB1 is required for significant in vitro methylation of an Akt1-K64 peptide, and that this activity is stimulated by (R,R)-59 primarily through an increase in catalytic activity rather than a change in SAM binding.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=63 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/539986v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f4022org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ba47borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb8b0borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16595bc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmiodarone is underutilized due to significant off-target toxicities. We hypothesized that targeted delivery to the heart would lead to lowering of dose by utilizing a cardiomyocyte targeting peptide (CTP), a cell penetrating peptide identified by our prior phage display work.\n\nMethodsCTP was synthesized thiolated at the N-terminus, conjugated to amiodarone via Schiff base chemistry, HPLC purified and confirmed with MALDI/TOF. Stability of the conjugate was assessed using serial HPLCs. Guinea pigs (GP) were injected intraperitoneally daily with vehicle (7 days), amiodarone (7 days; 80mg/Kg), CTP-amiodarone (5 days;26.3mg/Kg), or CTP (5 days; 17.8mg/Kg), after which GPs were euthanized, hearts excised, perfused on a Langendorff apparatus with Tyrodes solution and blebbistatin (5M) to minimize contractions. Voltage (RH237) and Ca2+-indicator dye (Rhod-2/AM) were injected, fluorescence from the epicardium split and focused on two cameras capturing at 570-595nm for cytosolic Ca2+ and 610-750nm wavelengths for voltage. Subsequently, hearts were paced at 250ms with programmed stimulation to measure changes in conduction velocities (CV), action potential duration (APD) and Ca2+ transient durations at 90% recovery (CaTD90). mRNA was extracted from all hearts and RNA sequencing performed with results compared to control hearts.\n\nResultsCTP-amiodarone remained stable for up to 21 days at 37{degrees}C. At [~]1/15th of the dose of amiodarone, CTP-amiodarone decreased CV in hearts significantly compared to control GPs (0.92{+/-}0.05 vs. 1.00{+/-}0.03m/s, p=0.0007), equivalent to amiodarone alone (0.87{+/-}0.08ms, p=0.0003). Amiodarone increased APD (192{+/-}5ms vs. 175{+/-}8ms for vehicle, p=0.0025), while CTP-amiodarone decreased it significantly (157{+/-}16ms, p=0.0136) similar to CTP alone (155{+/-}13ms, p=0.0039). Both amiodarone and CTP-amiodarone significantly decreased calcium transients compared to controls. CTP-amiodarone and CTP decreased CaTD90 to an extent greater than amiodarone alone (p<0.001). RNA-seq showed that CTP alone increased the expression of DHPR and SERCA2a, while decreasing expression of proinflammatory genes NF-kappa B, TNF-, IL-1{beta}, and IL-6.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggests that CTP can deliver amiodarone to cardiomyocytes at [~]1/15th the total molar dose of amiodarone needed to produce comparable slowing of CVs. The ability of CTP to decrease AP durations and CaTD90 may be related to its increase in expression of Ca-handling genes, and merits further study.",

    "abstract": "Various hormones, kinases, and stressors (fasting, heat shock) stimulate 26S proteasome activity. To understand how its capacity to degrade ubiquitylated protein can increase, we studied ZFAND5, which promotes protein degradation during muscle atrophy. Cryo-electron microscopy showed that ZFAND5 induces large conformational changes in the 19S regulatory particle. ZFAND5s AN1 Zn finger interacts with the Rpt5 ATPase and its C-terminus with Rpt1 ATPase and Rpn1, a ubiquitin-binding subunit. Surprisingly, these C-terminal interactions are sufficient to activate proteolysis. With ZFAND5 bound, entry into the proteasomes protein translocation channel is wider, and ZFAND5 dissociation causes opening of the 20S gate for substrate entry. Using single-molecular microscopy, we showed that ZFAND5 binds ubiquitylated substrates, prolongs their association with proteasomes, and increases the likelihood that bound substrates undergo degradation, even though ZFAND5 dissociates before substrate deubiquitylation. These changes in proteasome conformation and reaction cycle can explain the accelerated degradation and suggest how other proteasome activators may stimulate proteolysis.",

We have previously shown that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), phosphorylated at tyrosine 1 (Y1P) on the C- terminal domain, transcribes RNA at DSBs to promote efficient DNA repair. However, it is still unknown how transcription is regulated at DSBs. Here, we show that the trimeric SOSS1 complex (hSSB1, INTS3, and c9orf80) binds to Y1P RNAPII in response to DNA damage, hSSB1 binds to R-loops, and formation of the SOSS1 complex is required for the coexistence of replication protein A (RPA) and hSSB1 at DSBs. The damage-activated tyrosine kinase c- Abl phosphorylates hSSB1 to enable its binding to Y1P RNAPII and its recruitment to DSBs. Finally, we show both in vitro and in vivo that the SOSS1 complex and RNAPII form dynamic repair compartments at DSBs via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The loss of the trimeric SOSS1 leads to impaired DNA repair, highlighting its biological importance in the RNA-dependent DNA damage response.\n\nTeaserTrimeric SOSS1 complex and transcription contribute to phase separation at double-strand DNA breaks.",

    "abstract": "Meloidogyne enterolobii is an aggressive root-knot nematode (RKN) species that has emerged as a significant pathogen of sweetpotato in the Southeastern United States. M. enterolobii is spread primarily through the movement of infected  seed sweetpotatoes used for propagation. The RKN resistance in commercially grown sweetpotato cultivars has proven ineffective against this nematode. Detecting RKN in sweetpotato by eye is unreliable, and further distinguishing M. enterolobii from other RKN species that infect sweetpotato is labor intensive; relying on molecular tests conducted on individual nematodes dissected out of host roots by trained technicians. Here, we have developed a high-throughput survey method to collect skin samples and extract total DNA from batches of sweetpotato storage roots. Combining this method with species-specific PCR assays allowed for quick and sensitive detection of M. enterolobii and other RKN species infecting sweetpotatoes. We tested this method using batches of infected storage roots at varying levels of M. enterolobii infection. We also inoculated skin samples with varying numbers of individual M. enterolobii eggs to determine the methods detection threshold and used this method to conduct surveys for RKN on fresh market sweetpotatoes. Our results show that this method can consistently and reliably detect M. enterolobii in sweetpotato batches at levels as low as 2 eggs per 10 mL skin sample. This method will be a useful tool to help screen for the presence of M. enterolobii in  seed sweetpotatoes before they are replanted, thereby helping to slow the spread of this nematode to M. enterolobii-free sweetpotato growing operations.",

For large carriers, it is established that this transport is motor-driven; however, the mode by which small vesicles, which outnumber larger carriers, are transported is poorly characterized. Here we show that intracellular nanovesicles (INVs), a substantial class of small vesicles, are highly mobile within cells and that this mobility depends almost entirely on passive diffusion (0.1-0.3 {micro}m2 s-1). Using single particle tracking, we describe how other small trafficking vesicles have a similar diffusive mode of transport, that contrasts with the motor-dependent movement of larger endolysosomal carriers. We also demonstrate that a subset of INVs are involved in constitutive secretion and that delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane during exocytosis is decreased when diffusion of INVs is specifically restricted. Our results suggest that passive diffusion is sufficient to explain the majority of small vesicle transport.",

In contrast to the spliceosomal snRNPs, U7 snRNP lacks the Sm subunits D1 and D2 and instead contains two related proteins, Lsm10 and Lsm11. The remaining five subunits of the U7 heptameric Sm ring, SmE, F, G, B and D3, are shared with the spliceosomal snRNPs. The pathway that assembles the unique ring of U7 snRNP is unknown. Here, we show that a heterodimer of Lsm10 and Lsm11 tightly interacts with the methylosome, a complex of the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, MEP50 and pICln known to methylate arginines in the C-terminal regions of the Sm proteins B, D1 and D3 during the spliceosomal Sm ring assembly. Both biochemical and Cryo-EM structural studies demonstrate that the interaction is mediated by PRMT5, which binds and methylates two arginine residues in the N-terminal region of Lsm11. Surprisingly, PRMT5 also methylates an N-terminal arginine in SmE, a subunit that does not undergo this type of modification during the biogenesis of the spliceosomal snRNPs. An intriguing possibility is that the unique methylation pattern of Lsm11 and SmE plays a vital role in the assembly of the U7 snRNP.",

    "abstract": "Anionic phospholipids (PS, PA, PI, PIPs) are low abundant phospholipids with impactful functions in cell signaling, membrane trafficking and cell differentiation processes. They can be quickly metabolized and can transiently accumulate at define spots within the cell or an organ to respond to physiological or environmental stimuli. As even a small change in their composition profile will produce a significant effect on biological processes, it is crucial to develop a sensitive and optimized analytical method to accurately detect and quantify them. While thin layer chromatography (TLC) separation coupled with gas chromatography (GC) detection methods already exist, they do not allow for precise, sensitive and accurate quantification of all anionic phospholipid species. Here we developed a method based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with two-dimensional mass spectrometry (MS2) by MRM mode to detect and quantify all molecular species and classes of anionic phospholipids in one-shot. This method is based on a derivatization step by methylation that greatly enhances the ionization, the separation of each peaks, the peak resolution as well as the limit of detection and quantification for each individual molecular species, and more particularly for PA and PS. Our method universally works in various plant samples. Remarkably, we identified that PS is enriched with very long chain fatty acids in the roots but not in aerial organs of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our work thus paves the way to new studies on how the composition of anionic lipids is finely tuned during plant development and environmental responses.\n\nSignificance StatementWhile anionic phospholipids have key functions in plant cellular processes, their low concentration in biological samples and their low stability during the analysis complicate their quantification. Here, we present the first one-shot analytical method for the profiling and quantification of all anionic phospholipid classes and species from plant tissues with unprecedented sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Elongator is a tRNA-modifying complex that regulates the fidelity of protein translation. Recently, a moonlighting function of Elongator has been identified in regulating polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton during asymmetric cell division. Elongator induces symmetry breaking of the anaphase midzone by selectively stabilizing microtubules on one side of the spindle. This polarizes the segregation of signalling endosomes containing cell-fate determinants to only one daughter cell, thus contributing to cell fate determination. Here, we unravelled the molecular mechanism by which Elongator controls microtubule dynamics. Elongator binds simultaneously to the tip of microtubules and also to free GTP-tubulin heterodimers via their C-terminal tails. Elongator thereby locally increases tubulin concentration at microtubule ends, which stabilizes microtubules by increasing their growth speed and decreasing their catastrophe rate. We show that the Elp123 and Elp456 subcomplexes bind to microtubules and free tubulin heterodimers, respectively, and that these activities must be coupled for Elongator to stabilize microtubules. Surprisingly, we found that Elp456 has strong selectivity towards polyglutamylated tubulin dimers. Hence, microtubules assembled by Elongator become selectively enriched with polyglutamylated tubulin.

    "abstract": "The universally conserved protein YidC aids the insertion and folding of transmembrane polypeptides independently or as a part of the SecYEG translocon complex. In the former scenario, the lipid-exposed YidC surface equipped with a highly conserved positively charged arginine is thought to facilitate membrane insertion of the nascent chain by providing a countercharge for the acidic residues at the polypeptides N-terminal region. Here we show that the purified and reconstituted E. coli YidC forms an ion-conducting transmembrane pore upon binding a ribosome or ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC). This pore is closed in the absence of ribosomes. As this pore is not visible in the published monomeric YidC structure, we used AlphaFold to construct the model of a parallel YidC dimer. Experimental evidence for a dimeric assembly comes from our BN-PAGE analysis of native vesicles, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies, and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. In the dimeric model, the conserved positively charged arginine and many residues interacting with nascent chains point into the putative pore. This result suggests the possibility of an alternative mode of YidC-assisted membrane protein insertion.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic sequence represents an untapped source of genetic novelty, particularly for conjugative systems that could be used for plasmid-based delivery of Cas9-derived antimicrobial agents. However, unlocking the functional potential of conjugative systems purely from metagenomic sequence requires the identification of suitable candidate systems as starting scaffolds for de novo DNA synthesis. Here, we developed a bioinformatics approach that searches through the metagenomic  trash bin for conjugative systems present on contigs that are typically excluded from common metagenomic analysis pipelines. Using a human metagenomic gut dataset representing 2805 taxonomically distinct units, we identified 1598 contigs containing conjugative systems with a differential distribution in human cohorts. We synthesized de novo an entire Citrobacter spp. conjugative system of 54 kb and containing at least 47 genes, pCitro, and found that pCitro conjugates from Escherichia coli to Citrobacter rodentium with a 30-fold higher frequency than to E. coli, and is compatible with Citrobacter resident plasmids. Mutations in the traV and traY conjugation components of pCitro inhibited conjugation. We showed that pCitro can be re-purposed as an antimicrobial delivery agent by programming it with the TevCas9 nuclease and Citrobacter -specific sgRNAs to kill C. rodentium. Our study reveals a trove of uncharacterized conjugative systems in metagenomic data and describes an experimental framework to animate these large genetic systems as novel target-adapted delivery vectors for Cas9-based editing of bacterial genomes.",

    "abstract": "Improving photosynthetic efficiency in plants and microalgae is of utmost importance to support the growing world population and to enable the bioproduction of energy and chemicals. Limitations in photosynthetic light conversion efficiency can be directly attributed to kinetic bottlenecks within the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBBC) responsible for carbon fixation. A better understanding of these bottlenecks in vivo is crucial to overcome these limiting factors through bio-engineering. The present study is focused on the analysis of phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We have characterized a PRK knock-out mutant strain and showed that in the absence of PRK, Chlamydomonas cannot grow photoautotrophically while functional complementation with a synthetic construct allowed restoration of photoautotrophy. Nevertheless, using standard genetic elements, the expression of PRK was limited to 40% of the reference level in complemented strains and could not restore normal growth in photoautotrophic conditions suggesting that the CBBC is limited. We were subsequently able to overcome this initial limitation by improving the design of the transcriptional unit expressing PRK using diverse combinations of DNA parts including PRK endogenous promoter and introns. This enabled us to obtain strains with PRK levels comparable to the reference strain and even overexpressing strains. A collection of strains with PRK levels between 16% and 250% of WT PRK levels was generated and characterized. Immunoblot and growth assays revealed that a PRK content of {approx}86% is sufficient to fully restore photoautotrophic growth. This result suggests that PRK is present in moderate excess in Chlamydomonas. Consistently, the overexpression of PRK did not increase photosynthetic growth indicating that that the endogenous level of PRK in Chlamydomonas is not limiting the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle under optimal conditions.",

SPF chickens co-infected with Chlamydia and IBV were employed for verification, leading to the identification of eight strains (Bi [&ge;] 0.800) with potent antiviral effects against IBV, accounting for 13.79% of the total isolated strains. The top-performing strain, Y17 Chlamydia strain, was selected and subjected to cell co-culture and U-tube experiments with IBV. Results demonstrated that the Y17 Chlamydia strain significantly impeded IBV replication in chicken tracheal epithelial cells (P<0.01) and did not secrete or induce host cells to secrete extracellular metabolites with antagonistic effects on IBV infection in U-tube experiments (P>0.05), suggesting that its antiviral activity was cell-autonomous. Our research highlights the feasibility of isolating Chlamydia strains with antiviral activity against IBV from healthy chickens and suggests that antiviral strains could be widespread, even though their efficacy against viruses is strain-specific. The presence of broad-spectrum antiviral Chlamydia strains may also be possible. Considering the prevalence of Chlamydia strains in vertebrate hosts, along with the fact that some strains are either non-pathogenic or display low toxicity, our findings could offer a fresh perspective on the prevention and treatment of viral infections in vertebrates.",

ICEs can carry additional genes that are non-essential for their transfer, but that can confer adaptive phenotypes to the host. Our aim here was to better characterize the presence, distribution and evolution of ICEs related to the well-described ICEclc among Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, and to understand their potential role in spreading genes with adaptive benefit. We examined a total of 181 P. aeruginosa genome sequences obtained from patient or hospital environment isolates. More than 90% of the isolates carried one or more ICEclc-like elements, with different degrees of conservation to the known ICEclc-lifestyle and transfer genes. ICE clones closely matched their host clonal phylogeny, but not exclusively, indicating that both clonal evolution and ICE-horizontal transfer are occurring in the hospital environment. Variable gene regions among the clinical P. aeruginosa ICEclc-type elements were notably enriched for heavy metal resistance genes, toxin-antitoxin systems, potential efflux systems and multidrug resistance proteins, a metalloprotease and for a variety of regulatory systems, but not for specific recognizable antibiotic resistance cassettes. Clonal persistence suggests adaptive benefits of these functional categories; and micro-patterns of gene gain and loss indicate ongoing ICE evolution within the P. aeruginosa hosts.",

    "abstract": "DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are covalent bonds between opposing strands of the DNA helix which prevent DNA melting and subsequent DNA replication or RNA transcription. Here, we show that UV Stimulated Scaffold Protein A (UVSSA) participates in transcription-coupled repair of ICLs. UVSSA encodes a protein that regulates the activity of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to facilitate the repair of UV lesions and to relieve transcription stress resulting from MYC activation. We show that UVSSA knockout sensitizes cells to ICL-inducing drugs, that UVSSA is specifically required for transcription-coupled repair of a single ICL in a fluorescence-based reporter assay, and that transcription-coupled repair of ICLs is defective in UVSSA-/- cells. UVSSA localizes to chromatin upon ICL damage, and interacts with transcribing Pol II, CSA, CSB, and TFIIH. The UVSSA-TFIIH interaction facilitates ICL repair. Finally, UVSSA expression positively correlates with ICL chemotherapy resistance in cancer cell lines. Our data strongly suggest that transcription-coupled ICL repair (TC-ICR) is a bona fide ICL repair mechanism that contributes to crosslinker drug resistance independently of replication-coupled ICL repair.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538304v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@162b68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17bcf74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@170fbb2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c8ef0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG UVSSA facilitates transcription-coupled DNA interstrand crosslink repair by recruiting TFIIH to transcription machinery stalled at the lesion.

    "abstract": "Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of land-use planning is a fundamental tool to minimize environmental impacts of artificialization. In this context, Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) tools based on Species Distribution Models (SDM) are frequently used for the elaboration of spatially exhaustive biodiversity diagnostics. Despite the paradigm of \"garbage in - garbage out\" that emphasises the importance of testing the suitability of data for SDM and priority conservation areas, the assessment of database sources remains relatively rare. In addition, the lack of practical recommendations for the use of open-access databases by SEA stakeholders remains a problem. The aim of this study is to explore the quality of data sources that can be used by stakeholders to assess priority conservation areas in SEA. The study was done using data for nine taxonomic groups (commonly used in inventories for environmental impact assessment) and three databases available to SEA stakeholders. Three local administrative entities in very different socio-ecological contexts were used to examine three main issues : (i) the suitability of local versus national databases for assessing conservation priorities, (ii) differences among taxonomic groups or territories in terms of the suitability of databases, (iii) the importance of the quality of databases for the application of SDM to assess priority conservation areas. Our study provides several clear messages for potential users of open-access databases. First, the need for prudence in the interpretation of biodiversity maps. Second, for SDM, the collection of individual databases at the national scale is necessary to complete local data and ensure the suitability of models in a local context. Third, a data driven approach can lead to the use of notably different species communities to identify priority conservation areas when compared to the community in the original database. Finally, we propose a workflow to guide SEA stakeholders through the process of data rationalization and use in conservation planning.",

In the classic paradigm, guanine nucleotide binding to the G subunit regulates the activation status of the complex. We sought to develop improved methods for heterologous expression and rapid purification of G subunits. Using GPA1, the sole canonical G subunit of the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, we observed that, compared to conventional purification methods, rapid StrepII-tag mediated purification facilitates isolation of protein with increased GTP binding and hydrolysis activities. This allowed us to identify a potential discrepancy with the reported GTPase activity of GPA1. We also found that human GNAI1 displayed expected binding and hydrolysis activities when purified using our approach, indicating our protocol is applicable to mammalian G subunits, potentially including those for which purification of enzymatically active protein has been historically problematic. We then utilized domain swaps of GPA1 and human GNAO1 to demonstrate that the inherent instability of GPA1 is a function of the interaction between the Ras and helical domains. Additionally, we found that GPA1-GNAO1 domain swaps uncouple the instability from the rapid nucleotide binding kinetics displayed by GPA1.",

However, the mechanisms conferring resistance to these insecticides in E. heros remain unresolved. We utilized comparative transcriptome profiling and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant calling of susceptible and laboratory-selected resistant strains of E. heros to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying resistance. The E. heros transcriptome was assembled using approximately 190.1 million paired-end reads, which generated 91,673 transcripts with a mean length of 720 bp and N50 of 1795 bp. Approximately, 54.8% of the assembled transcripts ware functionally annotated against the NCBI nr database, with most sequences (43%) being similar to the pentatomids Halyomorpha halys (43%) and Nezara viridula (29%). Comparative gene expression analysis between the susceptible (SUS) and NEO strains identified 215 significantly differentially expressed (DE) transcripts. DE transcripts associated with the metabolism of xenobiotics were all up-regulated in the NEO strain. The comparative analysis of the SUS and PYR strains identified 204 DE transcripts, including an esterase (esterase FE4), a glutathione-S-transferase, an ABC transporter (ABCC1), and aquaporins that were up-regulated in the PYR strain. We identified 9,588 and 15,043 non-synonymous SNPs in the PYR and NEO strains respectively in comparisons with the SUS strain. One of the variants (D70N) detected in the NEO strain occurs in a subunit (5) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the target-site of neonicotinoid insecticides. Nevertheless, the position of this residue was found very variable among 5 from insect species. In conclusion, neonicotinoid and pyrethroid resistance in laboratory-selected strains of E. heros is associated with a potential metabolic resistance mechanism mediated by the overexpression of several proteins commonly involved in the three phases of xenobiotic metabolism. Together these findings provide insight into the potential basis of resistance in E. heros and will inform the development and implementation of resistance management strategies against this important pest.\n\nHighlightsO_LI419 DE genes were observed in E. heros insecticide-resistant strains\nC_LIO_LI24,631 SNPs were identified in E. heros insecticide-resistant strains\nC_LIO_LIE. heros insecticide-resistant strains overexpress metabolic resistance genes\nC_LIO_LILambda-cyhalothrin-resistant E. heros overexpresses cuticular proteins\nC_LIO_LIThiamethoxam-resistant E. heros carries the target-site mutation D70N in nAChRalpha5\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Histones are synthesized and processed in the cytoplasm and then transported into the nucleus for assembly into nucleosomes. H2A-H2B is imported into the S. cerevisiae nucleus by the importin Kap114, which also imports the most prominent H2A-H2B chaperone, Nap1. We understand how Kap114 recognizes H2A-H2B for nuclear import, but little is known about how it recognizes Nap1. Furthermore, the ternary complex of Nap1, H2A-H2B and Kap114 was previously detected in both the cytosol and the nucleus, but its role in nuclear import is unclear. Here, we present biophysical analysis of interactions between Nap1, H2A-H2B, Kap114 and RanGTP, and cryo-electron microscopy structures of ternary Kap114, Nap1 and H2A-H2B complexes. Kap114 binds Nap1 very weakly, but H2A-H2B enhances Kap114-Nap1 interaction to form a ternary Kap114/Nap1/H2A-H2B complex that is stable in the absence and presence of RanGTP. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures reveal two distinct ternary Kap114/Nap1/H2A-H2B complexes: a 3.2 [A] resolution structure of Nap1 bound to H2A-H2B-bound Kap114 where Nap1 does not contact H2A-H2B, and a 3.5 [A] resolution structure of H2A-H2B sandwiched between Nap1 and Kap114. Collectively, these results lead to a mechanistic model of how Nap1*H2A-H2B encounters Kap114 in the cytoplasm and how both H2A-H2B and Nap1 are chaperoned and co-imported by Kap114 into the nucleus. The model also suggests how RanGTP-binding stabilizes a quaternary RanGTP/Kap114/Nap1/H2A-H2B complex that facilitates hand-off of H2A-H2B from Kap114 to Nap1, the assembling nucleosome or other nuclear chaperone.\n\nSignificance StatementFree core histones are highly toxic and must be sequestered by other macromolecules in the cell. The mechanism of H3-H4 import by karyopherin Importin-4 in the presence of its chaperone ASF1 is understood, but the mechanism of how histone chaperone Nap1 influences H2A-H2B import is not resolved. We present biophysical interaction analysis and cryo-EM structures that reveal how Kap114, Nap1 and H2A-H2B assemble into an import complex. These results lead us to a structural mechanism of how Nap1 delivers H2A-H2B to Kap114 in the cytosol, how Nap1 and H2A-H2B are co-imported into the nucleus, and how RanGTP may influence Kap114/Nap1/H2A-H2B interactions to assemble nucleosomes in the nucleus.",

On a faster timescale ([~]ps-ns), the conformational landscape of GPCRs is governed by the rapid dynamics of amino acid side chains. Such dynamics are essential for protein functions such as ligand recognition and allostery. Unfortunately, technical challenges have almost entirely precluded the study of side-chain dynamics for GPCRs. Here, we investigate the rapid side-chain dynamics of a thermostabilized 1B-adrenergic receptor (1B-AR) as probed by methyl relaxation. We determined order parameters for Ile, Leu, and Val methyl groups in the presence of inverse agonists that bind orthosterically (prazosin, tamsulosin) or allosterically (conopeptide {rho}-TIA). Despite the differences in the ligands, the receptors overall side-chain dynamics are very similar, including those of the apo form. However, {rho}-TIA increases the flexibility of Ile1764x56 and possibly of Ile2145x49, adjacent to Pro2155x50 of the highly conserved P5x50I3x40F6x44 motif crucial for receptor activation, suggesting differences in the mechanisms for orthosteric and allosteric receptor inactivation. Overall, increased Ile side-chain rigidity was found for residues closer to the center of the membrane bilayer, correlating with denser packing and lower protein surface exposure. In contrast to two microbial membrane proteins, in 1B-AR Leu exhibited higher flexibility than Ile side chains on average, correlating with the presence of Leu in less densely packed areas and with higher protein-surface exposure than Ile. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of studying receptor-wide side-chain dynamics in GPCRs to gain functional insights.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 regulates its response to environmental stimuli, including interactions with hosts and neighboring bacteria. Despite the importance of transcriptional regulation during these agriculturally-significant interactions, a comprehensive understanding of the TRN of P. syringae is yet to be achieved. Here, we collected and decomposed a compendium of public RNA-seq data from P. syringae to obtain 45 independently modulated gene sets (iModulons) that quantitatively describe the TRN and its activity state across diverse conditions. Through iModulon analysis, we 1) untangle the complex interspecies interactions between P. syringae and other terrestrial bacteria in cocultures, 2) expand the current understanding of the Arabidopsis thaliana-P. syringae interaction, and 3) elucidate the AlgU-dependent regulation of flagellar gene expression. The modularized TRN yields a unique understanding of interaction-specific transcriptional regulation in P. syringae.\n\nImportancePseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is a model plant pathogen that infects tomatoes and Arabidopsis thaliana. The current understanding of global transcriptional regulation in the pathogen is limited. Here, we applied iModulon analysis to a compendium of RNA-seq data to unravel its transcriptional regulatory network. We characterize each co-regulated gene set, revealing the activity of major regulators across diverse conditions. We provide new insights on the transcriptional dynamics in interactions with the plant immune system and with other bacterial species, such as AlgU-dependent regulation of flagellar genes during plant infection and downregulation of siderophore production in the presence of a siderophore cheater. This study demonstrates the novel application of iModulons in studying temporal dynamics during host-pathogen and microbe-microbe interactions, and reveals specific insights of interest.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequences can be broadly categorized into two classes: those which adopt stable secondary structure and fold into a domain (i.e., globular proteins), and those that do not. This latter class of sequences are conformationally heterogeneous and are described as being intrinsically disordered. Bioinformatics enable sub-classification of globular sequences by domain type, an approach that has revolutionized how we understand and predict protein functionality. Conversely, it is unknown if sequences of disordered protein regions are subject to broadly generalizable organizational principles that would enable their sub-classification. Here we report the development of a statistical approach that quantifies linear variance in amino acid composition across a sequence. With multiple examples we provide evidence that intrinsically disordered regions, but not globular domains, are organized into statistically non-random modules of specific compositional bias. Modularity is observed for both low and high complexity sequences and, in certain cases, we find that modules are organized in repetitive patterns. These data demonstrate that disordered sequences are non-randomly organized and motivate future experiments to comprehensively classify module types and to determine if modules, like the globular proteins domain, represent functionally separable units.",
