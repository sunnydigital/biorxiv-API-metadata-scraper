    "abstract": "HIV-infected (HIV) patients exhibit immune dysregulation independently of antiretroviral therapy. The inflammasome, a cytosolic complex responsible for cleavage of the inflammatory cytokines IL -1{beta} and IL -18 and pyroptosis, is highly activated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV patients, suggesting its involvement in leukocyte dysfunction. While monocytes, B cells, and CD4+ T cells have been studied, little is known about CD8+ T lymphocytes.\n\nTherefore, we proposed to characterize the inflammasome activation in these cells, both the NLRP3 and NLRP1/CARD8 pathways, which are partially described in T cells. CD8+ T lymphocytes from non-HIV healthy donors (HD) and HIV patients were analyzed ex vivo and stimulated in vitro with known activators of NLRP3 (-CD3/-CD28), NLRP1 and CARD8 (DPP9 inhibitor ValboroPro, VbP) to assess inflammasome activation. HIV CD8+ T cells present a constitutively activated caspase-1 which positively correlates with the cell activation state. HIV CD8+ T cells were more activated and more resistant to VbP-induced pyroptosis than HD. On the other way, HIV CD8+ T lymphocytes showed higher pyroptosis in response to -CD3/-CD28.\n\nThese findings suggest that the NLRP3 pathway is significantly dysregulated in those patients, and TCR stimulation may result in cell loss. At the same time, being HIV CD8+ T cells constitutively activated, other inflammasome pathways, such as NLRP1 or CARD8, present a delayed activation.",

    "abstract": "As Toxoplasma gondii disseminates through its host, the parasite must sense and adapt to its environment and scavenge nutrients. Oxygen (O2) is one such environmental factor and cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs) are evolutionarily conserved O2 cellular sensing proteins that regulate responses to changes in O2 availability. Toxoplasma expresses two PHDs. One of them, TgPHYa hydroxylates SKP1, a subunit of the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In vitro, TgPHYa is important for growth at low O2 levels. However, studies have yet to examine the role that TgPHYa or any other pathogen encoded PHD plays in virulence and disease. Using a type II ME49 Toxoplasma TgPHYa knockout, we report that TgPHYa is important for Toxoplasma virulence and brain cyst formation in mice. We further find that while TgPHYa mutant parasites can establish an infection in the gut they are unable to efficiently disseminate to peripheral tissues because the mutant parasites are unable to survive within recruited immune cells. Since this phenotype abrogated in IFN{gamma} knockout mice, we studied how TgPHYa mediates survival in IFN{gamma}-treated cells. We find that TgPHYa is not required for release of parasite-encoded effectors into host cells that neutralize anti-parasitic processes induced by IFN{gamma}. In contrast, we find that TgPHYa is required for the parasite to scavenge tryptophan, which is an amino acid whose levels are decreased after IFN{gamma} upregulates the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO). We further find that relative to wild-type mice that IDO knockout mice display increased morbidity when infected with TgPHYa knockout parasites. Together, these data identify the first parasite mechanism for evading IFN{gamma}-induced nutritional immunity and highlight a novel role that oxygen sensing proteins play in pathogen growth and virulence.",

    "abstract": "Flowers are colonized by a diverse community of microorganisms that alter plant health and interact with floral pathogens. Erwinia amylovora is a flower-inhabiting bacterium and a pathogen that infects different plant species, including Malus x domestica (apple). Previously, we showed that the co-inoculation of two bacterial strains, Pseudomonas and Pantoea natural inhabitants of apple flowers, reduced disease incidence caused by this floral pathogen. Here, we decipher the ecological interactions between these two flower-associated bacteria and E. amylovora in field experimentation and in vitro co-cultures. The two flower microbiota strains did not competitively exclude E. amylovora from the stigma habitat, as both commensal bacteria and the pathogen co-existed on the apple flowers, proscribing microbial antibiosis or niche exclusion as predominant mechanisms of host protection. Inspection of the total and the active microbiota populations on flowers revealed that strain co-inoculations altered microbiota activity. Using synthetic stigma exudation medium, tripartite co-culture of the bacterial strains strongly acidified the growth milieu and led to a substantial alteration of gene expression in both the pathogen and the two microbiota members. Our study emphasizes the critical role of emergent properties mediated by inter-species interactions within the plant holobiont and their impact on plant health and pathogen behavior.\n\nImportanceFire blight, caused by Erwinia amylovora, is one of the most important plant diseases of pome fruits. Plant-associated microbiota can influence plant disease occurrence through inter-species interactions. Previous studies have shown that plant microbiota commensals could suppress disease mainly by antagonizing of the pathogen growth, however, whether plant-associated microbiota could alter pathogen activity and behavior have not been well studied. Here, we show that the co-inoculation of two bacterial strains that naturally colonize the apple flowers reduce disease pressure. We further demonstrate that the interactions between these two microbiota commensals and the floral pathogen lead to a strong alteration of the pH and to the emergence of new gene expression patterns that may alter the pathogen behavior. Our findings emphasize the critical role of emergent properties mediated by inter-species interactions between plant microbiota and plant pathogens and their impact on plant health.",

    "abstract": "Extra-chromosomal selfish DNA elements can evade the risk of being lost at every generation by behaving as chromosome appendages, thereby ensuring high fidelity segregation and stable persistence in host cell populations. The yeast 2-micron plasmid and episomes of the mammalian gammaherpes and papilloma viruses that tether to chromosomes and segregate by hitchhiking on them exemplify this strategy. We document for the first time the utilization of a SWI/SNF-type chromatin remodeling complex as a conduit for chromosome association by a selfish element. One principal mechanism for chromosome tethering by the 2-micron plasmid is the bridging interaction of the plasmid partitioning proteins (Rep1 and Rep2) with the yeast RSC2 complex and the plasmid partitioning locus STB. We substantiate this model by multiple lines of evidence derived from genomics, cell biology and interaction analyses. We describe a Rep-STB bypass system in which a plasmid engineered to non-covalently associate with the RSC complex mimics segregation by chromosome hitchhiking. Given the ubiquitous prevalence of SWI/SNF family chromatin remodeling complexes among eukaryotes, it is likely that the 2-micron plasmid paradigm or analogous ones will be encountered among other eukaryotic selfish elements.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary organisms in extreme environments can give insight into how species will respond to environmental change. The intertidal forms an environmental gradient where stress increases with tidal height. Here, we explore the contribution of fixed genotypic and plastic environmental effects on thermal tolerance of the intertidal anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and its algal symbionts using a laboratory-based tank experiment. High intertidal anemones had lower baseline symbiont-to-host cell ratios under control conditions, but their symbionts had higher baseline maximum quantum yield compared to low intertidal anemone symbionts, despite identical symbiont communities. High intertidal anemones maintained greater maximum quantum yield and symbiont-to-host cell ratios under heat stress compared to low intertidal anemones, suggesting that high intertidal holobionts have greater thermal tolerance. However, thermal tolerance of clonal anemones acclimatized to different zones was not explained by tidal height alone, indicating emersion duration is not the sole environmental driver of physiological variation. Fixed genotypic effects also influenced physiological baselines, but did not modulate thermal tolerance, demonstrating thermal tolerance is largely driven by environmental history. These results indicate that this symbiosis is highly plastic and may be able to rapidly acclimatize to climate change, defying the convention that symbiotic organisms are more susceptible to environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas putida, a soil bacterium widely used for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, processes glucose through convergent peripheral pathways that ultimately yield 6-phosphogluconate. Such a periplasmic gluconate shunt (PGS), composed by glucose and gluconate dehydrogenases, sequentially transforms glucose into gluconate and 2-ketogluconate. Although the secretion of these organic acids by P. putida has been extensively recognized, the mechanism and spatiotemporal regulation of the PGS remained elusive thus far. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel methodology for metabolic flux analysis, D-fluxomics, based on deuterated sugar substrates. D-Fluxomics demonstrated that the PGS underscores a highly dynamic metabolic architecture in glucose-dependent batch cultures of P. putida, characterized by hierarchical carbon uptake by the PGS throughout the cultivation. Additionally, we show that gluconate and 2-ketogluconate accumulation and consumption can be solely explained as a result of the interplay between growth rate-coupled and decoupled metabolic fluxes. As a consequence, the formation of these acids in the PGS is inversely correlated to the bacterial growth rate--unlike the widely studied overflow metabolism of Escherichia coli and yeast. Our findings, which underline survival strategies of soil bacteria thriving in their natural environments, open new avenues for engineering P. putida towards efficient, sugar-based bioprocesses.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mainly produced from L-cysteine (Cys), renders bacteria highly resistant to oxidative stress. This mitigation of oxidative stress was suggested to be an important survival mechanism to achieve antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in many pathogenic bacteria. CyuR (known as DecR or YbaO) is a recently characterized Cys-dependent transcription regulator, responsible for the activation of the cyuAP operon and generation of hydrogen sulfide from Cys. Despite its potential importance, the regulatory network of CyuR remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of the CyuR regulon in a Cys-dependent AMR mechanism in E. coli strains. We found: 1) Cys metabolism has a significant role in AMR and its effect is conserved in many E. coli strains, including clinical isolates; 2) CyuR negatively controls the expression of mdlAB encoding a transporter that exports antibiotics such as cefazolin and vancomycin; 3) CyuR binds to a DNA sequence motif  GAAwAAATTGTxGxxATTTsyCC in the absence of Cys, confirmed by an in vitro binding assay; and 4) CyuR may regulate 25 additional genes as suggested by in silico motif scanning and transcriptome sequencing. Collectively, our findings expanded the understanding of the biological roles of CyuR relevant to antibiotic resistance associated with Cys.",
