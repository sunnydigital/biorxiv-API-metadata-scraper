    "abstract": "We are unresponsive during slow-wave sleep but continue monitoring external events for survival. Our brain wakens us when danger is imminent. If events are non-threatening, our brain might store them for later consideration to improve decision-making. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether simultaneously sleep-played foreign words and translation words are encoded/stored and which neural-electrical events facilitate encoding/storage. A closed-loop algorithm targeted word pairs to slow-wave peaks or troughs. Retrieval tests were given 12 and 36 hours later. These tests required decisions regarding the semantic category of previously sleep-played foreign words. The sleep-played vocabulary influenced awake decision-making 36 hours later, if targeted to troughs. The words linguistic processing raised neural complexity. The words semantic-associative encoding was supported by increased theta power during the ensuing peak. Fast-spindle power ramped up during a second peak likely aiding consolidation. Hence, new vocabulary played during slow-wave sleep was stored and influenced decision-making days later.",

    "abstract": "High temperatures impair plant and algal growth and reduce food and biofuel production, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a superior model to study heat responses in photosynthetic cells due to its fast growth rate, many similarities in cellular processes to land plants, simple and sequenced genome, and ample genetic and genomics resources. Chlamydomonas grows in light by photosynthesis and/or with the externally supplied organic carbon source, acetate. Most of the published research about Chlamydomonas heat responses used acetate-containing medium. Understanding how organic carbon sources affect heat responses is important for the algal industry but understudied. We cultivated Chlamydomonas wild-type cultures under highly controlled conditions in photobioreactors at control of 25{degrees}C, moderate high temperature of 35{degrees}C, or acute high temperature of 40{degrees}C with and without constant acetate supply for 1- or 4-days. Our results showed that 35{degrees}C increased algal growth with constant acetate supply but reduced algal growth without sufficient acetate. The overlooked and dynamic effects of 35{degrees}C could be explained by induced carbon metabolism, including acetate uptake and assimilation, glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis pathways, and glycolysis. Acute high temperature at 40{degrees}C for more than 2 days was lethal to algal cultures with and without constant acetate supply. Our research provides insights to understand algal heat responses and help improve thermotolerance in photosynthetic cells.\n\nHighlightWe revealed the overlooked, dynamic effects of moderate high temperature in algae depending on carbon availability and demonstrated the importance of carbon metabolism in thermotolerance of photosynthetic cells.",

    "abstract": "Human functional brain connectivity can be temporally decomposed into states of high and low cofluctuation, defined as coactivation of brain regions over time. Rare states of particularly high cofluctuation have been shown to reflect fundamentals of intrinsic functional network architecture and to be highly subject-specific. However, it is unclear whether such network-defining states also contribute to individual variations in cognitive abilities - which strongly rely on the interactions among distributed brain regions. By introducing CMEP, a new eigenvector-based prediction framework, we show that as few as 16 temporally separated time frames (< 1.5% of 10min resting-state fMRI) can significantly predict individual differences in intelligence (N = 263, p < .001). Against previous expectations, individuals network-defining time frames of particularly high cofluctuation do not predict intelligence. Multiple functional brain networks contribute to the prediction, and all results replicate in an independent sample (N = 831). Our results suggest that although fundamentals of person-specific functional connectomes can be derived from few time frames of highest connectivity, temporally distributed information is necessary to extract information about cognitive abilities. This information is not restricted to specific connectivity states, like network-defining high-cofluctuation states, but rather reflected across the entire length of the brain connectivity time series.",

    "abstract": "Interlocus sexual conflict is predicted to result in sexually antagonistic coevolution between male competitive traits, which are also female-detrimental, and mate harm resistance (MHR) in females. Little is known about connection life-history evolution and sexually antagonistic coevolution. Here, we investigated the evolution of MHR in a set of experimentally evolved populations, where mate-harming ability has been shown to have evolved in males as a correlated response to the selection for faster development and early reproduction. We measured mortality and fecundity of females of these populations and those of their matched controls, under different male exposure conditions. We observed that the evolved females were more susceptible to mate harm - suffering from significantly higher mortality under continuous exposure to control males within the twenty-day assay period. Though these evolved females are known to have shorter lifespan, such higher mortality was not observed under virgin and single-mating conditions. We used fecundity data to show that this higher mortality in evolved females is unlikely due to cost of egg production. Further analysis indicated that this decreased MHR is unlikely to be due purely to the smaller size of these females. Instead, it is more likely to be an indirect experimentally evolved response attributable to the changed breeding ecology, and/or male trait evolution. Our results underline the implications of changes in life history traits, including lifespan, to the evolution of MHR in females.",

However, investigating the health of free-ranging large whales is logistically complex. Given that the core microbiome is key to understanding host-bacteria relationships and to identifying their relevance for individual and population health, we characterized the core respiratory bacteriome of the Eastern North Pacific blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, using blow samples collected by a small quadracopter drone. 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing revealed 1,326 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), of which 11 were shared by more than 50% of all blue whales and had a relative abundance higher than 0.02%. Cutibacterium, Oceanivirga, Tenacibaculum, and Psychrobacter composed the common core respiratory bacteriome of the blue whale. Additionally, compositional analysis identified 15 bacterial classes dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (27.14%), Bacteroidea (19.83%), and Clostridia (12.89%) as the most representative classes in the respiratory tract of blue whales. However, two whales had a high abundance of bacteria with pathogenic potential, namely Mycoplasma spp. and Streptococcus spp. in their blow. Both bacterial genera have been associated with pulmonary diseases in mammals. Ours is the first study to characterize the respiratory bacteriome of apparently healthy blue whales and is a baseline for future long-term studies on blue whale health, an endangered species of conservation concern.",

However, a powerful algorithmic framework to dissect spatially resolved niches, and to quantitatively evaluate spatial cell interaction intensity will pave the ways to understand the spatial signature associated mechanism. In this study, we provide a promising framework (StereoSiTE), which is based on space nearest neighbor graph and gene expression profile to spatially resolve iTME and to quantitatively define cell-cell communication intensity. We applied StereoSiTE to dissect the iTME of xenograft model receiving immunoagonist treatment, 7 distinct cellular neighborhoods (CN) were identified, and each CN was considered as the functional unit with exclusive cell type (CT) composition. Further deconvolving the joint matrix covering CNs and CTs indicated the importance of neutrophils in CN6, which was confirmed by pathway enrichment analysis. Whats more, analysis of interaction intensity indicated that the recruited neutrophils preserved tumor protection activity through paired IL-1{beta}/IL-1R after immunoagonist treatment exclusively in CN6. This evidence provided a new possible vision of tumor immune evasion orchestrated by neutrophils. StereoSiTE is believed to be a promising framework of mapping iTME niches using spatial transcriptomics, which could be utilized to spatially reveal tumoribiology mechanisms.\n\nHighlightA framework based on space nearest neighbor graph and gene expression profile to spatially resolve iTME and to quantitatively define cell-cell communication intensity (StereoSiTE)\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/522366v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cc9236org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@932d2dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b14d6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@950fb3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A universal feature of ecological systems is that species do not interact with others with the same sign and strength. Yet, the consequences of this asymmetry in biotic interactions for the short- and long-term persistence of individual species and entire communities remains unclear. Here, we develop a set of metrics to evaluate how asymmetric interactions among species translate to asymmetries in their individual vulnerability to extinction under changing environmental conditions. These metrics, which solve previous limitations of how to independently quantify the size from the shape of the so-called feasibility domain, provide rigorous advances to understand simultaneously why some species and communities present more opportunities to persist than others. We further demonstrate that our shape-related metrics are useful to predict short-term changes in species relative abundances during seven years in a Mediterranean grassland. Our approach is designed to be applied to any ecological system regardless of the number of species and type of interactions. With it, we show that is possible to obtain both mechanistic and predictive information on ecological persistence for individual species and entire communities, paving the way for a stronger integration of theoretical and empirical research.",

    "abstract": "Organic amendment, and especially the use of composts, is a well-accepted sustainable agricultural practice. Compost increases soil carbon and microbial biomass, changes enzymatic activity, and enriches soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, relatively little is known about the immediate and long-term temporal dynamics of agricultural soil microbial communities following repeated compost applications. Our study was conducted at two field sites: Newe Yaar (NY, Mediterranean climate) and Gilat (G, semi-arid climate), both managed organically over 4 years under either conventional fertilization (0, zero compost) or three levels of compost amendment (20, 40 and 60 m3/ha or 2, 4, 6 L/m2). Microbial community dynamics in the soils was examined by high-and low-time-resolution analyses. Annual community composition in compost-amended soils was significantly affected by compost amendment levels in G (first, second and third years) and in NY (third year). Repeated sampling at high resolution (9-10 times over 1 year) showed that at both sites, compost application initially induced a strong shift in microbial communities, lasting for up to 1 month, followed by a milder response. Compost application significantly elevated alpha diversity at both sites, but differed in the compost-dose correlation effect. We demonstrate higher abundance of taxa putatively involved in organic decomposition and characterized compost-related indicator taxa and a compost-derived core microbiome at both sites. Overall, this study describes temporal changes in the ecology of soil microbiomes in response to compost vs. conventional fertilization.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDose-dependent changes in soil microbiome structure by manure compost application\nC_LIO_LIDynamic short-and long-term changes in soil microbiomes by compost amendment\nC_LIO_LIClimate, soil properties and management influence compost-amendment effects\nC_LIO_LIImmediate and temporal cumulative effects of compost on soil  and {beta} diversity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key regulator of reproductive function in vertebrates. GnRH is related to the corazonin (CRZ) neuropeptide which influences metabolism and stress responses in insects. Recent evidence suggests that GnRH and CRZ are paralogous and arose by a gene duplication in a common ancestor of bilaterians. Here we report the identification and complete characterization of the GnRH and CRZ signaling systems in the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae. We have identified a novel GnRH peptide (YSYSYGFAP-NH2) that specifically activates two GnRH receptors and a CRZ peptide (FTYTHTW-NH2) that activates three CRZ receptors in B. floridae. The latter appear to be promiscuous, as two CRZ receptors can also be activated by GnRH in the physiological range. Hence, there is a potential for cross-talk between these closely-related signaling systems. Discovery of both the GnRH and CRZ signaling systems in one of the closest-living relatives of vertebrates provides a framework to discover their roles at the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates.\n\nSignificanceIdentifying neuropeptides and resolving the relationships of neuropeptides across different phyla is challenging due to their short sequences. Here we resolve a controversy regarding the identities and evolutionary relationships of a family of homologous neuropeptides that include the well-known human reproductive hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and insect stress hormone corazonin (CRZ). We have discovered bona fide GnRH and CRZ signaling systems in Branchiostoma which provides a basis for investigating the evolution of the physiological roles of these neuropeptides in one of the closest living relatives of vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their central role in energy metabolism, mitochondria can shape intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling through the concerted activity of Ca2+ uptake to the matrix through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and efflux from the matrix mediated by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX. Ca2+ levels in the cytosol are known to regulate both metabolism and autophagic activity. Here, we describe a novel and direct relationship between NCLX, cytosolic Ca2+, and autophagic activity. We find that conditions that stimulate autophagy in vivo and in vitro such as caloric restriction and nutrient deprivation upregulate NCLX expression in hepatic tissue and cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NCLX impairs basal and starvation-induced autophagy, by decreasing LC3 II flux. Similarly, acute inhibition of NCLX activity by CGP 37157 affects early steps of autophagy activation in hepatocyte-derived cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, resulting in reduced autophagic activity. Inhibition of NCLX caused decreased cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and pre-incubation with intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM promotes similar results to those of CGP 37157 on autophagy. BAPTA-AM did not exhibit any additive effect on NCLX inhibition of autophagy, demonstrating that mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux regulates autophagy through the modulation of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion pathway NCLX is an important regulatory node linking nutrient restriction and autophagy regulation through the modulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels.",

    "abstract": "Satellite DNA (satDNA) is rapidly evolving class of tandem repeats with some motifs being involved in centromere organization and function. Rapid co-evolution of centromeric satDNA and associated proteins has been mostly attributed to the so-called centromere drive. To identify repeats associated with centromeric regions and test for the role of meiotic drive in their evolution, we investigated satDNA across Southern and Coastal clades of African annual killifishes of the genus Nothobranchius. C-banding showed expansion of (peri)centromeric heterochromatin regions in the Southern-clade killifishes. Molecular cytogenetic and bioinformatic analyses further revealed that two previously identified satellites, Nfu-SatA and Nfu-SatB, are associated with centromeres only in one lineage of the Southern clade. Nfu-SatB was, however, detected outside centromeres also in other members of the Coastal clade, which is consistent with the \"library\" hypothesis of satDNA evolution. We also identified a novel satDNA, Cl-36, associated with (peri)centromeres in N. foerschi, N. guentheri and N. rubripinnis from the Coastal clade. Our findings could be explained by centromere drive shaping karyotype change and centromeric repeat turnover in Nothobranchius species with possible reversal of spindle polarity within the Southern clade.",

The ATR-dependent intra-S checkpoint pathway mediates detection and processing of sites of replication fork stalling to maintain genomic integrity. Several factors involved in the global checkpoint pathway have been identified, but the response to a single replication fork barrier (RFB) is poorly understood. We utilized the E.coli-based Tus-Ter system in human MCF7 cells and showed that the Tus protein binding to TerB sequences creates an efficient site-specific RFB. The single fork RFB was sufficient to activate a local, but not global, ATR-dependent checkpoint response that leads to phosphorylation and accumulation of DNA damage sensor protein {gamma}H2AX, confined locally to within a kilobase of the site of stalling. These data support a model of local management of fork stalling, which allows global replication at sites other than the RFB to continue to progress without delay.",

In this study, we searched for viral infection signatures in chromosome-level genome assemblies of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. We identified a continuous 1.5 Mb putative viral region on a chromosome in R. irregularis strain 4401. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the viral region is related to viruses in the family Asfarviridae of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota. Single-copy marker genes from Nucleocytoviricota were detected as single-copy genes in the viral region. Furthermore, this viral region was absent in the genomes of four other R. irregularis strains and had fewer signals of fungal transposable elements than the other genomic regions. These results suggest a recent and single insertion of a large dsDNA viral genome in the genome of this fungal strain, providing strong evidence of the recent infection of the fungus by a dsDNA virus.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a homeostasis program of animal tissues designed to remove cells that are unwanted or are damaged by physiological insults. To assess the functional role of apoptosis we have studied the consequences of subjecting Drosophila epithelial cells defective in apoptosis to stress or genetic perturbations that normally cause massive cell death. We find that many of those cells acquire persistent activity of the JNK pathway, which drives them into senescent status, characterized by arrest of cell division, cell hypertrophy, Senescent Associated {beta}-gal activity (SA-{beta}-gal), ROS production, Senescent Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and migratory behaviour. We have identified two classes of senescent cells in the wing disc: 1) those that localize to the appendage part of the disc, express the upd, wg and dpp signalling genes and generate tumour overgrowths, and 2) those located in the thoracic region do not express wg and dpp nor they induce tumour overgrowths. Whether to become tumorigenic or non-tumorigenic depends on the original identity of the cell prior to the transformation. We also find that the p53 gene contributes to senescence by enhancing the activity of JNK.",

We explore the use of these models to create as yet undiscovered instances of viral sequences in a pandemic situation. Towards this goal, we formulate a novel framework for training models to align the sequence generation problem to the characteristics of a pandemic. We applied our method to modeling the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, the primary driver of the COVID-19 pandemic, and compared our method to models trained via prevalent practices applied to biological sequence modeling. Our method substantially outperforms a state-of-the-art generative model finetuned on SARS-CoV2 data, producing samples containing sequences which are four times as likely to be real, undiscovered sequences, and ten times as infectious. Our method can forecast novel lineages of the virus up to approximately 3 months in advance. Given a limited sequence budget, our method generates sequences belonging to the Delta variant and multiple dominant Omicron subvariants up to a month in advance.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining motor skills is crucial for an animals survival, enabling it to endure diverse perturbations throughout its lifespan, such as trauma, disease, and aging. What mechanisms orchestrate brain circuit reorganization and recovery to preserve the stability of behavior despite the continued presence of a disturbance? To investigate this question, we chronically silenced a fraction of inhibitory neurons in a pre-motor circuit necessary for singing in zebra finches. This manipulation altered brain activity and severely perturbed their song, a complex learned behavior, for around two months, after which it was precisely restored. Electrophysiology recordings revealed abnormal offline dynamics resulting from chronic inhibition loss, while subsequent recovery of the behavior occurred despite partial normalization of brain activity. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that chronic silencing of interneurons leads to elevated levels of microglia and MHC I. These experiments demonstrate that the adult brain can overcome extended periods of drastic abnormal activity. The reactivation of mechanisms employed during learning, including offline neuronal dynamics and upregulation of MHC I and microglia, could facilitate the recovery process following perturbation of the adult brain. These findings indicate that some forms of brain plasticity may persist in a dormant state in the adult brain until they are recruited for circuit restoration.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541057v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a1a80aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4929org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc29fdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@28b58d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical Abstract:C_FLOATNO Schematic overview of the experiments performed in this study.\n\nTo investigate how a complex motor behavior recovers after chronic loss of inhibitory tone, we blocked the function of zebra finch HVC inhibitory neurons by bilateral stereotaxic injection of an AAV viral vector into HVC.

    "abstract": "Oxygen-sensitive metalloenzymes are responsible for many of the most fundamental biochemical processes in nature, from the reduction of di-nitrogen in nitrogenase to the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments. However, biophysical characterization of such proteins under anoxic conditions can be challenging, especially at non-cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we introduce the first in-line anoxic small-angle X-ray scattering (anSAXS) system at a major national synchrotron source, featuring both batch-mode and chromatography-mode capabilities. To demonstrate chromatography-coupled anSAXS, we investigated the oligomeric interconversions of the Fumarate and Nitrate Reduction (FNR) transcription factor, which is responsible for the transcriptional response to changing oxygen conditions in the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli. Previous work has shown that FNR contains a labile [4Fe-4S] cluster that is degraded when oxygen is present, and that this change in cluster composition leads to the dissociation of the DNA-binding dimeric form. Using anSAXS, we provide the first direct structural evidence for the oxygen-induced dissociation of the E. coli FNR dimer and its correlation with cluster composition. We further demonstrate how complex FNR-DNA interactions can be studied by investigating the promoter region of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase genes, nrdDG, which contains tandem FNR binding sites. By coupling SEC-anSAXS with full spectrum UV-Vis analysis, we show that the [4Fe-4S] clustercontaining dimeric form of FNR can bind to both sites in the nrdDG promoter region. The development of in-line anSAXS greatly expands the toolbox available for the study of complex metalloproteins and provides a foundation for future expansions.",

Using mass cytometry, we show alterations and differences in the emergence of NK cell populations and T cell memory differentiation between iHEU and iHUU. Specific NK cells observed at birth were also predictive of acellular pertussis and rotavirus vaccine-induced IgG and IgA responses, respectively, at 3 and 9 months of life. T cell receptor V{beta} clonotypic diversity was significantly and persistently lower in iHEU preceding the expansion of T cell memory.

    "abstract": "miR-675 is a microRNA expressed from exon 1 of H19 long non-coding RNA. H19 lncRNA is temporally expressed in humans and atypical expression of miR-675 has been linked with several diseases and disorders. To execute its function inside the cell, miR-675 is folded into a particular conformation which aids in its interaction with several other biological molecules. However, the exact folding dynamics of miR-675 and its complete interaction map are currently unknown. Moreover, how H19 lncRNA and miR-675 crosstalk and modulate each others activities is also unclear. Detailed structural analysis of miR-675 in this study determines its conformation and identifies novel protein binding sites on miR-675 which can make it an excellent therapeutic target against numerous diseases. Mapping of the interactome identified some of known and unknown interactors of miR-675 which aid in expanding our repertoire of miR-675 involved pathways in the cell. This analysis also identified some of the previously unknown and yet to be characterised proteins as probable interactors of miR-675. Structural and base pair conservation analysis between H19 lncRNA and miR-675 results in structural transformations in miR-675 thus describing the earlier unknown mechanism of interaction between these two molecules. Comprehensively, this study details the conformation of miR-675, its interacting biological partners and explains its relationship with H19 lncRNA which can be interpreted to understand the role of miR-675 in the development and progression of various diseases.",

In ABCD children, traits within internalizing and externalizing behavioral categories are predicted by more similar network features concatenated across task and resting states than those between different categories. We did not observe this pattern in HCP adults. Distinct network features predict internalizing and externalizing behaviors in ABCD children and HCP adults.

In two experiments with healthy young adults (Ns = 30 and 44), retrospective attention cues prioritised an item encoded in working memory or long-term memory. Participants then retrieved a memory item or performed a perceptual discrimination task. The cue was informative for the retrieval task but not for the perceptual task. Attentional orienting improved memory retrieval for both memory types and also enhanced discrimination for visual stimuli at the location matching the prioritised working memory or long-term memory item. Eye-tracking data revealed a striking dissociation in gaze biases related to orienting in working memory vs. long-term memory. The findings suggest potent and at least partly dissociable attention-orienting processes for different memory timescales.",

The branching architecture of axons and dendrites must compute, respond, and make decisions while obeying the rules of the substrate in which they are enmeshed. Thus, it is important to delineate and understand the principles that govern these branching patterns. Here, we present evidence that asymmetric branching is a key factor in understanding the functional properties of neurons. First, we derive novel predictions for asymmetric scaling exponents that encapsulate branching architecture associated with crucial principles such as conduction time, power minimization, and material costs. We compare our predictions with extensive data extracted from images to associate specific principles with specific biophysical functions and cell types. Notably, we find that asymmetric branching models lead to predictions and empirical findings that correspond to different weightings of the importance of maximum, minimum, or total path lengths from the soma to the synapses. These different path lengths quantitatively and qualitatively affect energy, time, and materials. Moreover, we generally observe that higher degrees of asymmetric branching-- potentially arising from extrinsic environmental cues and synaptic plasticity in response to activity-- occur closer to the tips than the soma (cell body).",

Our estimates outperform existing metrics for prioritizing genes important for cell essentiality, human disease, and other phenotypes, especially for short genes. Our new estimates of selective constraint should have wide utility for characterizing genes relevant to human disease.

    "abstract": "Psychostimulant use and engagement with probabilistic schedules of reward both sensitize the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. Such behaviours may act synergistically to explain the high comorbidity between stimulant use and gambling disorder. The salient audiovisual stimuli of modern electronic gambling may exacerbate the situation. To probe these interactions, we sensitized ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via chronic chemogenetic stimulation while rats learned the rat gambling task in the presence or absence of casino-like cues. The same rats then learned to self-administer cocaine. In a separate cohort, we confirmed that our chemogenetic methods sensitized the locomotor response to cocaine, and potentiated phasic excitability of VTA dopamine neurons through in vivo electrophysiological recordings. In the absence of cues, sensitization promoted risk-taking in both sexes. When rewards were cued, sensitization expedited the development of a risk-preferring phenotype in males, while attenuating cue-induced risk-taking in females. While these results provide further confirmation that VTA dopamine neurons critically modulate risky decision making, they also reveal stark sex differences in the decisional impact which dopaminergic signals exert when winning outcomes are cued. As previously observed, risky decision-making on the cued rGT increased as both males and females learned to self-administer cocaine. The combination of dopamine sensitization and win-paired cues while gambling lead to significantly greater cocaine-taking, but these rats did not show any increase in risky choice as a result. Cocaine and heavily-cued gambles may therefore partially substitute for each other once the dopamine system is rendered labile through sensitization, compounding addiction risk across modalities.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of an intergroup encounter depends on the relative competitive abilities of the participating groups and the value of the resource for which they compete. However, few studies have been able to assess the consequences of winning intergroup encounters. We used behavioral and demographic data from 94 adult and subadult individuals in 8 groups of Colobus vellerosus at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana to investigate the factors that predict winning intergroup encounters, and whether intergroup encounter success determines access to food and female reproductive output. In support of the hypothesis that groups with high-quality males would be more likely to win encounters, winning the encounter was best predicted by rates of displays by the alpha male. Food trees that were contested during intergroup encounters were more likely to have young leaves or other higher quality food items and to be important food species. Feeding was more likely to occur during and after the intergroup encounter if the focal animals group had won the encounter. The percentage of encounters won was correlated with the groups dominance rank but not with home range size or the immature-to-female ratio. In populations such as the Boabeng-Fiema colobus in which male quality seems to be associated with winning intergroup encounters and gaining immediate access to food, one of the drivers for female transfer between groups may be differences in alpha male quality between groups and across time.",

    "abstract": "The light-harvesting reactions of photosynthesis take place on the thylakoid membrane inside chloroplasts. The thylakoid membrane is folded into appressed membranes, the grana, and non-appressed membranes that interconnect the grana, the stroma lamellae. This folding is essential for the correct functioning of photosynthesis. Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are commonly used to study the thylakoid membrane, but these techniques have limitations in visualizing a complete chloroplast and its organization. To overcome this limitation, we applied expansion microscopy (ExM) on isolated chloroplasts. ExM is a technique that involves physically expanding a sample in a swellable hydrogel to enhance the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy. Using all-protein staining, we have visualized the 3D structure of spinach thylakoids with a high level of detail. We were able to resolve stroma lamellae that were 60 nm apart and observe their helical wrapping around the grana. Furthermore, we accurately measured the dimensions of grana from top-views of chloroplasts, which allow for precise determination of the grana diameter. Ultimately, we constructed a 3D model of a complete chloroplast, which provides a foundation for structure-based modeling of photosynthetic adaptations. Our results demonstrate that ExM is a fast and reliable technique for studying thylakoid organization with a high level of detail.",

    "abstract": "Bromeliaceae, has 82 genera and 3,719 species found throughout the Neotropical region, from the southern United States to central Argentina and Chile. These plants are present in environments with different characteristics and have high endemism in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Tank bromeliads stand out for their morphology, which forms permanent water-accumulating compartments called phytotelmata, rich in organic detritus and living organisms. Culicidae use phytotelma as a breeding ground, and some species of Wyeomyia are highly dependent on these tanks. Research on the importance of bromeliads as water reservoirs that may favor the reproduction of mosquitoes that carry pathogens are controversial. Some studies indicate that these plants are potential breeding grounds for Aedes, while others suggest that they are not preferential foci for synanthropic mosquitoes, as is the case for A. aegypti. This work aimed at verifying the presence of Aedes and other Culicidae in native bromeliads in natural habitat and under ornamental cultivation in an urban environment, comparing the incidence of larvae in these possible breeding sites and contrasting with the luminosity and accumulated water volumes. Differences in species composition were observed between rural and urban environments. In the rural environment, four species of Culicidae were collected, the most abundant being Wyeomyia galvaoi -19 specimens, followed by Culex (Microculex) imitator - five specimens, while Aedes aegypti and Toxorhynchites sp 1, were the least abundant, with two individuals each. In the urban environment, five species were found, with greater abundance of Aedes aegypti (461 individuals), followed by Aedes albopictus (45), Toxorhynchites sp. 01 (3), Wyeomyia sp1 (02), and Wyeomyia galvaoi (01) In addition, these phytotelma showed great diversity of other organisms, such as: mites, nematodes, protists, rotifers, ostracods, and insect larvae of the Chironomidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae families. The study concluded that the incidence of mosquito larvae in native bromeliads is low, and that luminosity and accumulated water volumes can influence the presence of larvae. The authors emphasize that the importance of bromeliads in mosquito reproduction may vary according to several factors.",

    "abstract": "The complex spatial structure and dynamics of ecological communities continue to defy explanation by simple principles despite decades of attention from ecologists and theoreticians. For example, the relationship between plant spatial distributions and species coexistence is often challenging to resolve in empirical settings. By analysing the spatial patterns of trees in 21 large forest plots we find a general and strong latitudinal gradient in the relationship between conspecific aggregation and abundance of tree species, with stronger negative abundance-dependency as latitude increases. To derive theoretical expectations for how interactions between multiple spatial pattern and processes can impact species coexistence, we incorporate the observed spatial patterns together with neighbourhood crowding competition into a mathematical model to estimate the local extinction risk of species. Strikingly, we find simple relationships that predict species local extinction risk from their demography and spatial distribution. Compared to a corresponding non-spatial analysis, accounting for spatial patterns reduces the 1000-year extinction risk on average by 52% when species invade from low abundances of 50 individuals. Additionally, based on their current abundances, only 8% of the species had an extinction risk greater than 5%. Our approach opens up new avenues for integrating observed spatial patterns with multiple ecological processes into mathematical theory. Our results demonstrate that emerging spatial patterns can contribute substantially to coexistence in species-rich forests, emphasizing the need to understand the interacting multiple processes underpinning spatial patterns in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.",

A key gene associated is the PNPLA3 I148M variant, which has been shown to display lipogenesis functionality. However, the role of PNPLA3 in increased ROS formation is debated. Moreover, there are no studies determining correlation between the variant and alcohol-induced oxidative stress. This project determines the following mechanistic functions of the PNPLA I148M variant to test for the efficiency of PNPLA3 gene therapy for patients with fatty liver disease and alcohol liver disease.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between lipid induced oxidative stress and PNPLA3 148M variant.

Moreover, there is a statistical correlation between PNPLA3 148M overexpressed cell lines and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress by MitoSOX cellular ROS analysis methods. This study confirmed the significant decrease in oxidative stress levels for 148I variant overexpressed cell lines and proved the efficiency of PNPLA3 targeted gene therapy to NAFLD patients and suggested the potential use of the therapeutic method to patients with ALD. To ensure gene therapeutic effectiveness for patients with NAFLD and alcoholic liver diseases, further experiments may be needed to verify molecular pathways of ROS formation by PNPLA3 with qPCR analysis.",

    "abstract": "Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (Banf1) is a small DNA-bridging protein. The binding status of Banf1 to DNA is regulated by its N-terminal phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation. Banf1 can be phosphorylated at Ser4 into mono-phosphorylated Banf1, which is further phosphorylated at Thr3 to form di-phosphorylated Banf1. It was observed decades ago that mono-phosphorylated Banf1 cannot bind to DNA. However, the underlying molecular- and atomic-level mechanisms remain unclear. A clear understanding of these mechanisms will aid in interfering with the cell proliferation process for better global health. Herein, we explored the detailed atomic bases of unphosphorylated Banf1-DNA binding and how mono- and di-phosphorylation of Banf1 impair these atomic bases to eliminate its DNA-binding capability, followed by exploring the DNA-binding capability of mono- and di-phosphorylation Banf1, using comprehensive and systematic molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations. This work presented in detail the residue-level binding energies, hydrogen bonds and water bridges between Banf1 and DNA, some of which have not been reported. Moreover, we revealed that mono-phosphorylation of Banf1 causes its N-terminal secondary structure changes, which in turn induce significant changes in Banf1s DNA binding surface, thus eliminating its DNA-binding capability. At the atomic level, we also uncovered the alterations in interactions due to the induction of mono-phosphorylation that result in the N-terminal secondary structure changes of Banf1. Additionally, our modelling showed that phosphorylated Banf1 with their dominant N-terminal secondary structures bind to DNA with a significantly lower affinity and the docked binding pose are not stable in MD simulations. These findings help future studies in predicting effect of mutations in Banf1 on its DNA-binding capability and open a novel avenue for the development of therapeutics such as cancer drugs, targeting cell proliferation by inducing conformational changes in Banf1s N-terminal domain.",

    "abstract": "The robust nature of the non-conventional yeast Issatchenkia orientalis allows it to grow under highly acidic conditions and therefore, has gained increasing interest in producing organic acids using a variety of carbon sources. Recently, the development of a genetic toolbox for I. orientalis, including an episomal plasmid, characterization of multiple promoters and terminators, and CRISPR-Cas9 tools, has eased the metabolic engineering efforts in I. orientalis. However, multiplex engineering is still hampered by the lack of efficient multicopy integration tools. To facilitate the construction of large, complex metabolic pathways by multiplex CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify and prioritize genome-wide intergenic loci and characterized 47 sites. These loci are screened for guide RNA cutting efficiency, integration efficiency of a gene cassette, the resulting cellular fitness, and GFP expression level. We further developed a landing pad system using components from these well-characterized loci, which can aid in the integration of multiple genes using single guide RNA and multiple repair templates of the users choice. We have demonstrated the use of the landing pad for simultaneous integrations of 2, 3, 4, or 5 genes to the target loci with efficiencies greater than 80%. As a proof of concept, we showed how the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid can be improved by integrating five copies of genes at multiple sites in one step. We have further demonstrated the efficiency of this tool by constructing a metabolic pathway for succinic acid production by integrating five gene expression cassettes using a single guide RNA along with five different repair templates, leading to the production of 9 g/L of succinic acid in batch fermentations. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a single gRNA-mediated CRISPR platform to build complex metabolic pathways in non-conventional yeast.

    "abstract": "Body coloration in ectotherms serves multiple biological functions, including avoiding predators, communicating with conspecific individuals, and involvement in thermoregulation. As ectotherms rely on environmental sources of heat to regulate their internal body temperature, stable melanistic body coloration or color change can be used to increase or decrease heat absorption and heat exchange with the environment. While the function of melanistic coloration for thermoregulation has been found to increase solar radiation absorption for heating in many diurnal ectotherms, research on crepuscular and nocturnal ectotherms is lacking. Since crepuscular and nocturnal ectotherms generally absorb heat from the substrate, coloration is likely under different selective pressures than in diurnal ectotherms. We tested if the proportion of dorsal melanistic body coloration is related to differences in body temperature heating and cooling rates in the crepuscular gecko Eublepharis macularius and whether changes in environmental temperature trigger color changes in this species. Temperature measurements of the geckos and of the environment were taken using infrared thermography and temperature loggers. Color data were obtained using objective photography and a newly developed custom software package. We found that body temperature reflected substrate temperatures, and that the proportion of melanistic coloration has no influence on heating or cooling rates or on color changes. These findings suggest that, in E. macularius, melanistic coloration may not be used for thermoregulation. Future research should further test the function of melanistic coloration in other crepuscular and nocturnal vertebrates to understand the evolution of melanistic pattern in animals active in low light conditions.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a type 2 allergic disease characterized by esophageal inflammation and epithelial cell dysfunction. Acquired loss of the anti-serine protease of kazal type 7 (SPINK7) in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus has a causal role in EoE pathogenesis. Yet there is a limited understanding of the factors that regulate its expression and responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Herein, we identified the transcription factor, ovo like transcriptional repressor 1 (OVOL1) as an esophageal selective gene product that regulates SPINK7 promoter activity. Overexpression of OVOL1 increased SPINK7 expression, whereas, its depletion decreased SPINK7 expression, impaired epithelial barrier and increased production of the pro-atopy cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Mechanistically, ligands of AHR induced nuclear translocation of OVOL1 which in turn promoted epithelial cell differentiation, barrier function and SPINK7 expression. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 abolished AHR ligand-induced OVOL1 nuclear translocation. Stimulation with IL-13 abrogated the nuclear translocation of OVOL1 and promoted enhanced degradation of OVOL1 protein. This effect of IL-13 was dependent on the esophageal specific cysteine protease calpain-14. Translational studies demonstrated loss of OVOL1 protein expression in patients with EoE. In summary, AHR mediates its action via OVOL1-induced SPINK7 transcription, and IL-4 and IL-13 repress this pathway in EoE. As such, activation of the AHR pathway is a potential intervention strategy for reversing EoE.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/541192v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e946a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c087forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@71ecc8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17044da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The influence of the exposome on regulatory networks in EoE pathogenesis.\n\nAHR is activated and influenced by diet nutrients, environmental toxicants, microbiome composition, tryptophan metabolites, and drugs.

    "abstract": "Drug tolerance leads to increased cell survival upon antimicrobial treatment and its contribution to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance is well described in bacteria. However, this antimicrobial response is still overlooked in human fungal pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus. Due to the global increase of antifungal resistance to currently used antifungals to treat aspergillosis, new antifungals such as the pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor olorofim have been developed. Here, we show that reversing olorofim activity by the addition of exogenous pyrimidines reveals the presence of olorofim tolerance in 4% of A. fumigatus environmental strains. Disrupting cell wall integrity or inhibiting efflux transport in those strains reverses olorofim tolerance, yet inconsistently, thus suggesting that this response may have a multifactorial origin. Understanding the mechanistic basis of A. fumigatus tolerance to olorofim will increase our knowledge on its contribution to resistance allowing the development of strategies to suppress it before this promising antifungal reaches clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "CBASS is an anti-phage defense system that protects bacteria from phage infection and is evolutionarily related to human cGAS-STING immunity. cGAS-STING signaling is initiated by viral DNA but the stage of phage replication which activates bacterial CBASS remains unclear. Here we define the specificity of Type I CBASS immunity using a comprehensive analysis of 975 operon-phage pairings and show that Type I CBASS operons composed of distinct CD-NTases, and Cap effectors exhibit striking patterns of defense against dsDNA phages across five diverse viral families. We demonstrate that escaper phages evade CBASS immunity by acquiring mutations in structural genes encoding the prohead protease, capsid, and tail fiber proteins. Acquired CBASS resistance is highly operon-specific and typically does not affect overall fitness. However, we observe that some resistance mutations drastically alter phage infection kinetics. Our results define late-stage virus assembly as a critical determinant of CBASS immune activation and evasion by phages.",

Previous studies suggested the presence of two distinct morphotypes in New Zealand,  verum and  simile. Traditional mycological analyses revealed a third morphotype with clear differences in colony morphology and cardinal growth rates at varying temperatures. Genome sequencing of eight C. minus isolates provided further evidence of the existence of a third morphotype, named  novus in this study. To further analyse these morphotypes, we predicted candidate effector proteins for all eight isolates, and also characterized a cell-death eliciting effector family, Ecp32, which is present in other pine phytopathogens. In concordance with their distinct classification into three different morphotypes, the number of Ecp32 family members differed, with patterns of pseudogenization and some family members being found exclusively in some morphotypes. We also showed that proteins belonging to the Ecp32 family trigger cell death responses in non-host Nicotiana species, and, as previously demonstrated for other plant pathogens, the C. minus proteins belonging to the Ecp32 family adopt a {beta}-trefoil fold. Understanding the geographical range and variations in virulence and pathogenicity of these morphotypes will provide a better understanding of pine needle diseases as well as enable the development of more durable methods to control this disease.",

    "abstract": "One fundamental yet elusive aspect of the chromosome architecture is the constrained topolome, which refers to how chromatin elements restrain DNA topology. Nucleosomes stabilise negative DNA supercoils, with most nucleosomes typically restraining a DNA linking number difference ({Delta}Lk) of about -1.26. However, whether this capacity is uniform across the genome is unknown. Here, we calculated the {Delta}Lk restrained by over 4000 nucleosomes in yeast cells. To achieve this, we placed each nucleosome in a circular minichromosome and performed Topo-seq, a novel high-throughput procedure to inspect the topology of circular DNA libraries in a single gel electrophoresis. We found that nucleosomes inherently restrain distinct {Delta}Lk values depending on their genomic origin. Nucleosome DNA topologies differ significantly at gene bodies ({Delta}Lk=-1.29), intergenic regions ({Delta}Lk=-1.23), rDNA genes ({Delta}Lk=-1.24) and telomeric regions ({Delta}Lk=-1.07). Nucleosomes nearby the transcription start and termination sites also exhibit singular DNA topologies. These findings demonstrate that nucleosome DNA topology is imprinted by its native chromatin context and persists even when the nucleosome is relocated. This imprinting contributes to nucleosome functional roles and chromatin folding architectures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHeart failure is the number one cause of death worldwide and mortality is directly correlated with the high incidence of obesity and diabetes. Indeed, the epidemic phenomenon of obesity was projected to reach 50% in the US by the year 2030. However, the mechanisms linking metabolic dysfunction with heart disease are not clear. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling, is considered to be an emerging therapeutic target against the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Increased PTP1B levels and activity have been observed in brain, muscle and adipose tissues isolated from obese and/or diabetic animals, as well as in human obese human patients. Its role, however, and the mechanisms by which it modulates metabolic processes in the heart remain unknown.\n\nMethod and ResultsWe generated cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific PTP1B knock-out (PTP1Bfl/fl::MHCCre/+) mice to investigate the cardiomyocyte-specific role of PTP1B in response to high fat diet (HFD)-induced cardiac dysfunction. While we did not observe any physiological or functional cardiac differences at baseline, in response to HFD, we found that PTP1Bfl/fl::MHCCre/+ mice were protected against development of cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and diminished cardiac steatosis. Metabolomics data revealed that hearts with CM-specific deletion of PTP1B had increased fatty acid oxidation and NAD+ metabolism, but reduced glucose metabolism; we further validated these findings by real-time qPCR analysis. Mechanistically, we identified a novel PTP1B PKM2-AMPK axis in the heart, which acts as a molecular switch to promote fatty acid oxidation. In this regard, we identified that hearts from PTP1Bfl/fl::MHCCre/+ mice had upregulated levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and NAD phosphate (NADPH), leading to higher levels of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting step of the NAD+ salvage pathway and an enzyme associated with obesity and diabetes.\n\nConclusionsTogether, these results suggest that CM-specific deletion of PTP1B mediates a substrate switch from glucose to fatty acid metabolism, protecting hearts against development of HFD-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction through mechanisms involving a novel PTP1B/PKM2/AMPK axis that is critical for the regulation of NAMPT and NAD+ biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative description of biological structures is a valuable yet difficult task in the life sciences. This is commonly accomplished by imaging samples using fluorescence microscopy and analyzing resulting images using Pearsons correlation or Manders co-occurrence intensity-based colocalization paradigms. Though conceptually and computationally simple, these approaches are critically flawed due to their reliance on signal overlap, sensitivity to cursory signal qualities, and inability to differentiate true and incidental colocalization. Point pattern analysis provides a framework for quantitative characterization of spatial relationships between spatial patterns using the distances between observations rather than their overlap, thus overcoming these issues. Here we introduce an image analysis tool called Spatial Pattern Analysis using Closest Events (SPACE) that leverages nearest neighbor-based point pattern analysis to characterize the spatial relationship of fluorescence microscopy signals from image data. The utility of SPACE is demonstrated by assessing the spatial association between mRNA and cell nuclei from confocal images of cardiac myocytes. Additionally, we use synthetic and empirical images to characterize the sensitivity of SPACE to image segmentation parameters and cursory image qualities such as signal abundance and image resolution. Ultimately, SPACE delivers performance superior to traditional colocalization methods and offers a valuable addition to the microscopists toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Decades before its clinical onset, epigenetic changes start to accumulate in the progenitor cells of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Delineating these changes can improve risk-stratification for patients and shed insights into AML etiology, dynamics and mechanisms. Towards this goal, we extracted \"epigenetic signatures\" through two parallel machine learning approaches: a supervised regression model using frequently mutated genes as labels and an unsupervised topic modeling approach to factorize covarying epigenetic changes into a small number of \"topics\". First, we created regression models for DNMT3A and TET2, the two most frequently mutated epigenetic drivers in AML. Our model differentiated wild-type vs. mutant genotypes based on their downstream epigenetic impacts with very high accuracy: AUROC 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. Methylation loci frequently selected by the models recapitulated known downstream pathways and identified several novel recurrent targets. Second, we used topic modeling to systematically factorize the high dimensional methylation profiles to a latent space of 15 topics. We annotated identified topics with biological and clinical features such as mutation status, prior malignancy and ELN criteria. Topic modeling successfully deconvoluted the combined effects of multiple upstream epigenetic drivers into individual topics including relatively infrequent cytogenetic events, improving the methylation-based subtyping of AML. Furthermore, they revealed complimentary and synergistic interactions between drivers, grouped them based on the similarity of their downstream methylation impact and linked them to prognostic criteria. Our models identify new signatures and methylation pathways, refine risk-stratification and inform detection and drug response studies for AML patients.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LISupervised and unsupervised models reveal new methylation pathways of AML driver events and validate previously known associations.\nC_LIO_LIIndividual DNMT3A and TET2 signatures are accurate and robust, despite the complex genetic and epigenetic make-up of samples at diagnosis.\nC_LIO_LIUnsupervised topic modeling factorizes covarying methylation changes and isolates methylation signatures caused by rare mutations.\nC_LIO_LITopic modeling reveals a group of mutations with similar downstream methylation impacts and mapped to adverse-risk class by ELN.\nC_LIO_LITopic modeling uncovers methylation signatures of infrequent cytogenetic events, significantly improving methylation-based subtyping.\nC_LIO_LIOur models can be leveraged to build predictive models for AML-risk.\nC_LIO_LIOur models show that cytogenetic events, such as t(15;17) have widespread trans downstream methylation impacts.\nC_LI",

Whilst this may seem exceptional or unprecedented, the progression of climate change is expected to increase both the likelihood and severity of such events. Livestock are vulnerable to heat stress, which manifests as losses to health and welfare, productivity, and sustainability. Here, we characterize the heatwave of July 2022 in the context of livestock heat-stress risk, with a focus on cattle. Meteorological data was obtained from 85 weather stations and the Comprehensive Climate Index (CCI) was calculated, hourly, for each station. The CCI was mapped across the UK for 18/07/22 and 19/07/22 and compared against heat stress risk thresholds. Across both days, >25% of sites experienced \"severe\" heat stress risk. On 19/07/22 there was an \"extreme\" risk across >5% of sites. The site that experienced the highest risk was near Rugby, in the West Midlands. Across all sites, night-time temperatures fell below risk thresholds and may have mitigated some of the heat stress risk. Whilst there was some evidence of productivity losses, this was not conclusive. The impacts of this event on livestock were not just direct, but indirect through negative impacts on water and forage availability. The heatwave of July 2022 must serve as a warning for the UK livestock industry and these results may act as a case study of what the sector may be increasingly likely to experience in the future.",

However, the understanding of the factors underlying this mortality are still limited, especially at stand scale. We aim to identify the factors that triggered the mortality of the widely distributed Pinus sylvestris in an extensive forest area in central Spain. We compared radial growth patterns in pairs of live and recently dead individuals that co-occur in close proximity and present similar age and size, thereby isolating the effects of size and environment from the mortality process. Temporal dynamics of growth, growth synchrony, and growth sensitivity to water availability (P-PET) were compared between live and recently dead trees. Over the last 50 years, we observed an increase in the growth synchrony and sensitivity to water availability as drought conditions intensified consistent to prior research. However, no differences were found in radial growth between live and dead individuals 15 years before mortality, and dead individuals showed lower growth synchrony and sensitivity to water availability than live ones for much of the period studied. This suggests a decoupling between trees growth responses and climatic conditions, which could increase vulnerability to hydraulic failure and/or carbon starvation. Overall, our results point to an important role of growth sensitivity to water availability in tree mortality for P. sylvestris at its southern distribution limit.",

    "abstract": "Identifying along which lineages shifts in diversification rates occur is a central goal of comparative phylogenetics; these shifts may coincide with key evolutionary events such as the development of novel morphological characters, the acquisition of adaptive traits, polyploidization or other structural genomic changes, or dispersal to a new habitat and subsequent increase in environmental niche space. However, while multiple methods now exist to estimate diversification rates and identify shifts using phylogenetic topologies, the appropriate use and accuracy of these methods is hotly debated. Here we test whether five Bayesian methods--Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM), two implementations of the Lineage-Specific Birth-Death-Shift model (LSBDS and PESTO), the approximate Multi-Type Birth-Death model (MTBD; implemented in BEAST2), and the cladogenetic diversification rate shift model (CLaDS2)--produce comparable results. We apply each of these methods to a set of 65 empirical time-calibrated phylogenies and compare inferences of speciation rate, extinction rate, and net diversification rate. We find that the five methods often infer different speciation, extinction, and net-diversification rates. Consequently, these different estimates may lead to different interpretations of the macroevolutionary dynamics. The different estimates can be attributed to fundamental differences among the compared models. Therefore, the inference of shifts in diver-sification rates is strongly method-dependent. We advise biologists to apply multiple methods to test the robustness of the conclusions or to carefully select the method based on the validity of the underlying model assumptions to their particular empirical system.\n\nLay SummaryUnderstanding why some groups of organisms have more species than others is key to understanding the origin of biodiversity. Theory and empirical evidence suggest that multiple distinct historical events--such as the evolution of particular morphological features (e.g., the flower, the tetrapod limb) and competition amongst species--can produce this pattern of divergent species richness. Identifying when and where on the tree of life shifts in diversification rates occur is important for explaining the origin of modern-day biodiversity and understanding how disparity among species evolves. Several statistical methods have been developed to infer diversification rates and identify these shifts. While these methods each attempt to make inferences about changes in the tempo of diversification, they differ in their underlying statistical models and assumptions. Here we test if these methods draw similar conclusions using a dataset of 65 time-calibrated phylogenies from across multicellular life. We find that inferences of where rate shifts occur strongly depends on the chosen method. Therefore, biologists should choose the model whose assumptions they believe to be the most valid and justify their model choice a priori, or consider using several independent methods to test an evolutionary hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are facing significant environmental challenges. Ocean acidification has the potential to induce the dissolution of coral reefs. The community of micro-bioerosion exhibits a heightened level of concern in the context of ocean acidification. Comprehending the close interplay between bioeroders and corals is of utmost importance in predicting the trajectory of these vulnerable ecosystems. The genus Ostreobium, which belongs to the order Bryopsidales (Chlorophyta) and comprises euendolithic chlorophyte algae, has been identified as the primary cause of reef dissolution among microbioeroders. The objective of this study was to comprehend the inherent distribution of rbcL clades of Ostreobium in the Southwestern Caribbean corals within a gradient of reef depth. The Ostreobium rbcL variants were found to be linked with corals belonging to the Agariciidae, Merulinidae, Poritiidae, Siderastreidae, Astroconeiidae, Montastreidae, Mussidae, and Pocilloporidae families. The individuals selected for the current investigation are categorized as members of either the \"complex\" or \"robust\" coral groups. Our findings indicate that solely the corals categorized as  complex exhibit close memberships with the three Ostreobium superclades. In general, the dispersion of Ostreobium within the Southwestern Caribbean region exhibits differentiation among various coral groups and is influenced by geographical and bathymetric factors. The Ostreobiums diversity is primarily composed of ecological specialists, wherein most clades are linked to particular hosts. Conversely, only a few ecological generalists are associated with multiple hosts, akin to zooxanthellae. Ostreobium exhibits greater diversity on encrusting corals such as agariciids, which are among the most abundant and widespread coral species in the Caribbean.",

    "abstract": "Animals are able to adapt their behaviors to their environment. In order to achieve this, the nervous system plays integrative roles, such as perception of external signals, sensory processing, and behavioral regulations via various signal transduction pathways. Here genetic analyses of C. elegans found that mutants of components of JNK and p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) signaling pathways, exhibit various types of defects in the learning of salt chemotaxis. C. elegans homologues of JNK MAPKKK and MAPKK, MLK-1 and MEK-1, respectively, are required to avoid salt concentrations experienced during starvation. In contrast, homologues of p38 MAPKKK and MAPKK, NSY-1 and SEK-1, respectively, are required for high-salt chemotaxis after conditioning. Genetic interaction analyses suggest that a JNK family MAPK, KGB-1, functions downstream of both signaling pathways to regulate salt chemotaxis learning. Furthermore, we found that the NSY-1/SEK-1 pathway functions in sensory neurons, ASH, ADF, and ASER, to regulate the learned high-salt chemotaxis. A neuropeptide, NLP-3, expressed in ASH, ADF, and ASER neurons, and a neuropeptide receptor, NPR-15, expressed in AIA interneurons that receive synaptic input from these sensory neurons, function in the same genetic pathway as NSY-1 / SEK-1 signaling. These findings suggest that this MAPK pathway may affect neuropeptide signaling between sensory neurons and interneurons, thus promoting high-salt chemotaxis after conditioning.",

Here we leverage the epigenomes of colon cancers with matched adjacent tissue, in addition to non-cancerous normals and cell line models, to assess the role of transposable elements as drivers or passengers in cancer development. Using the baseline of activity from normal and adjacent tissue, we show that the youngest subfamilies of the LINE1 (L1) family exhibit a degree of activity and recurrence across patients that goes beyond what is expected from hypomethylation and cell division, suggesting an additional mechanism of oncogenic reactivation. We characterize this mechanism and find that the loss of the tumor suppressor PLZF drives young L1 reactivation in a cell-division-independent manner. PLZF de-repression exposes abundant motifs for tumor core factors in the L1 5UTR. Active young L1s act as oncogenic enhancers, interacting with oncogenes via gained chromatin loops. We uncover oncogenic L1 reactivation as a hallmark of colon cancer, where young L1s activate universally in our cohort at high levels of recurrence, act as enhancers to oncogenes, and become wired into the core regulatory circuitry of colon cancer.",

However, it remains a bottleneck in distangling the relationship between the tumor microbiome and patient survival. In this study, we aimed to decode this complex relationship by developing ASD-cancer (autoencoder-based subtypes detector for cancer), a semi-supervised deep learning framework that could extract survival-related features from tumor microbiome and transcriptome data, and identify patients survival subtypes. By using samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we identified two statistically distinct survival subtypes across all 20 types of cancer. Our framework provided improved risk-stratification (e.g., for Liver hepatocellular carcinoma, LIHC, log-rank test, P = 8.12E-6) compared to PCA (e.g., for LIHC, log-rank test, P = 0.87), predicted survival subtypes accurately, and identified biomarkers for survival subtypes. Additionally, we identified potential interactions between microbes and genes that may play roles in survival. For instance, in LIHC, Arcobacter, Methylocella, and Isoptericola may regulate host survival through interactions with host genes enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, indicating these species as potential therapy targets. Further experiments on validation dataset have also supported these patterns.

Additionally, the tool incorporates a wide range of metrics to characterize various structural properties of transcript models, such as transcription start and end sites, splice junctions, and other structural features.

Moreover, SQANTI3 includes a Rescue module that prevents the loss of known genes and transcripts exhibiting evidence of expression but displaying low-quality features. Lastly, SQANTI3 incorporates IsoAnnotLite, which enables functional annotation at the isoform level and facilitates functional iso-transcriptomics analyses.

    "abstract": "Auxin is a well-studied plant hormone, the spatial distribution of which remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the effects of cell growth and divisions on the dynamics of auxin patterning, using a combination of mathematical modelling and experimental observations. In contrast to most prior work, models are not designed or tuned with the aim to produce a specific auxin pattern. Instead, we use well-established techniques from dynamical systems theory to uncover and classify ranges of auxin patterns as exhaustively as possible, as parameters are varied. Previous work using these techniques has shown how a multitude of stable auxin patterns may coexist, each attainable from a specific ensemble of initial conditions. When a key parameter spans a range of values, these steady patterns form a geometric curve with successive folds, often nicknamed a snaking diagram. As we introduce growth and cell divisions into a one-dimensional model of auxin distribution, we observe new behaviour which can be conveniently explained in terms of this diagram. Cell growth changes the shape of the snaking diagram, corresponding to deformations of auxin patterns. As divisions occur this can lead to abrupt creation or annihilation of auxin peaks. We term this phenomenon  snake-jumping. Under rhythmic cell divisions, we show how this can lead to stable oscillations of auxin. However, we also show that this requires a high level of synchronisation between cell divisions. Using 18 hour time-lapse imaging of the auxin reporter DII:Venus in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, we show auxin fluctuates greatly, both in terms of amplitude and periodicity, consistent with the snake-jumping events observed with non-synchronised cell divisions. Periodic signals downstream the auxin signalling pathway have previously been recorded in plant roots. The present work shows that auxin alone is unlikely to play the role of a pacemaker in this context.\n\nAuthor summaryAuxin is a crucial plant hormone, the function of which underpins almost every known plant development process. The complexity of its transport and signalling mechanisms, alongside the inability to image directly, make mathematical modelling an integral part of research on auxin. One particularly intriguing phenomenon is the experimental observation of oscillations downstream of auxin pathway, which serve as initiator for lateral organ formation. Existing literature, with the aid of modelling, has presented both auxin transport and signalling as potential drivers for these oscillations. In this study, we demonstrate how growth and cell divisions may trigger fluctuations of auxin with significant amplitude, which may lead to regular oscillations in situations where cell divisions are highly synchronised. More physiological conditions including variations in the timing of cell divisions lead to much less temporal regularity in auxin variations. Time-lapse microscope images confirm this lack of regularity of auxin fluctuations in the root apical meristem. Together our findings indicate that auxin changes are unlikely to be strictly periodic in tissues that do not undergo synchronous cell divisions and that other factors may have a robust ability to convert irregular auxin inputs into the periodic outputs underpinning root development.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is an essential microelement for plants as well as for human beings, and it regulates numerous metabolic process and protein activity. Zn deficiency not only impairs plant growth and development, but also affects human health. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for more than half of the worlds population, but how Zn homeostasis in rice is maintained is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that two F-group bZIP transcription factors, OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50, are important for metal homeostasis in rice. Mutation of OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50 impairs plant growth and reduces Zn, Fe, and Cu content in shoots. The N-terminus of either OsbZIP48 or OsbZIP50 contains two cysteine- and histidine-rich (CHR) domains, deletion or mutation of these CHR domains increases nucleus localization of OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50. Both OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50 have transcriptional activation activity, and the expression of 1117 genes involved in metal uptake, phenylpropanoid biosynthetic process, cell wall organization, et al., is reduced in OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50 double mutant than that in wild-type ZH11 plant under Zn deficiency. Both OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50 bind to the promoter region of the ZIP family transporter gene OsZIP10 in rice, and activate the promoter activity of ZDRE cis-element derived from the OsZIP10 promoter in effector-reporter assays. Mutation of the CHR domain of OsbZIP48 in OsbZIP50 mutant background increases the content of Zn/Fe/Cu in brown rice seeds and leaves. Thus, this study reveals that OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50 regulate metal homeostasis, especially under Zn deficiency in rice, and provides candidate target genes for biofortification of micronutrients in future.\n\nsignificance statementZinc (Zn) is an essential microelement not only for plants but also for human beings. This paper shows that the N-terminal cysteine- and histidine-rich domain of OsbZIP48/50 is important for their nucleus localization, therefore transcriptional activity, and reveals the downstream genes of OsbZIP48/50 involved in metal homeostasis under Zn deficiency in rice.",

Defects in protein expression during fetal development can lead to severe developmental abnormalities or premature death. Currently, quantitative techniques to monitor protein synthesis rates in a developing fetus (in utero) are limited. Here, we developed a novel in utero stable isotope labeling approach to quantify tissue-specific protein dynamics of the nascent proteome during mouse fetal development. Fetuses of pregnant C57BL/6J mice were injected with isotopically labeled lysine (Lys8) and arginine (Arg10) via the vitelline vein at various gestational days. After treatment, fetal organs/tissues including brain, liver, lung, and heart were harvested for sample preparation and proteomic analysis. We show that the mean incorporation rate for injected amino acids into all organs was 17.50 {+/-} 0.6%. By analyzing the nascent proteome, unique signatures of each tissue were identified by hierarchical clustering. In addition, the quantified proteome-wide turnover rates (kobs) were calculated between 3.81E-5 and 0.424 hour-1. We observed similar protein turnover profiles for analyzed organs (e.g., liver versus brain), however, their distributions of turnover rates vary significantly.

We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, and D166Y in the Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE-complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants (with potency D166Y > V48F) led to reduced Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) size, due to increased spontaneous (mEPSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout (KO) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher (potency D166Y>V48F) than in the Syt1 KO. These mutations (potency D166Y > V48F) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the apparent height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion.",

Recent efforts have led to the development of optogenetic tools to induce G protein-mediated signaling, with the promise of acute and cell type-specific manipulation of neuromodulatory signals. However, designing and deploying optogenetically functionalized GPCRs (optoXRs) with accurate specificity and activity to mimic endogenous signaling in vivo remains challenging. Here we optimized the design of optoXRs by considering evolutionary conserved GPCR-G protein interactions and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach using two Drosophila Dopamine receptors (optoDopRs). We validated these optoDopRs showing that they exhibit high signaling specificity and light sensitivity in vitro. In vivo we detected receptor and cell type-specific effects of dopaminergic signaling in various behaviors including the ability of optoDopRs to rescue loss of the endogenous receptors. This work demonstrates that OptoXRs can enable optical control of neuromodulatory receptor specific signaling in functional and behavioral studies.",

In Drosophila, the primary feedback loop involving the CLOCK-CYCLE transcriptional activators and the PERIOD-TIMELESS transcriptional repressors is interlocked with a secondary loop involving VRILLE (VRI) and PAR DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (PDP1), a repressor and activator of Clock transcription, respectively. Whereas extensive studies have found numerous transcriptional, translational, and post-translational modulators of the primary loop, relatively little is known about the secondary loop. In this study, we demonstrate that TARANIS (TARA), a Drosophila homolog of the TRIP-Br/SERTAD family of transcriptional coregulators, functions with VRI and PDP1 to modulate the circadian period and rhythm strength in Drosophila. Overexpression of TARA lengthens the circadian period, whereas tara mutants exhibit reduced rhythmicity, a faster molecular clock, and reduced expression of the PDF neuropeptide. We find that TARA can form a physical complex with VRI and PDP1, enhancing their repressor and activator functions, respectively. The conserved SERTA domain of TARA is required to regulate the transcriptional activity of VRI and PDP1, and its deletion leads to reduced locomotor rhythmicity. Consistent with TARAs role in enhancing VRI and PDP1 activity, overexpressing tara has a similar effect on the circadian period and rhythm strength as simultaneously overexpressing vri and Pdp1. Together, our results suggest that TARA modulates circadian behavior by enhancing the transcriptional activity of VRI and PDP1.\n\nStatement of SignificanceInternal molecular clocks generating circadian rhythms of around 24 hours broadly impact behavior and physiology, and circadian dysfunction is associated with various neurological and metabolic diseases. The Drosophila circadian clock is a valuable model for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying daily rhythms. In this study, we identify a conserved gene, taranis, as a novel regulator of the Drosophila molecular clock. We show that TARANIS modulates circadian behavior by physically interacting with and enhancing the transcriptional activity of clock proteins VRILLE and PDP1. Since mammalian homologs of VRILLE and PDP1 also function in the molecular clock, our results have implications for understanding the mammalian circadian clock.",

    "abstract": "The neural system that encodes heading direction in humans is found consistently in the medial and superior parietal cortex and the entorhinal-retrosplenial circuit. However, it is still unclear whether heading direction in these different regions is represented within an allocentric or egocentric coordinate system. To investigate this problem, we first asked whether regions encoding (putatively) allocentric facing direction also encode (unambiguously) egocentric goal direction. Second, we assessed whether directional coding in these regions scaled with the preference for an allocentric perspective during everyday navigation. Before the experiment, participants learned different object maps in two geometrically similar rooms. In the MRI scanner, their task was to retrieve the egocentric position of a target object (e.g., Front, Left) relative to an imagined facing direction (e.g., North, West). Multivariate analyses showed, as predicted, that facing direction was encoded bilaterally in the superior parietal lobule (SPL), the retrosplenial complex (RSC), and the left entorhinal cortex (EC). Crucially, we found that the same voxels in the SPL and RSC also coded for egocentric goal direction. Moreover, when facing directions were expressed as egocentric bearings relative to a reference vector, activities for facing direction and egocentric direction were correlated, suggesting a common reference frame. Besides, only the left EC coded allocentric goal direction as a function of the subjects propensity to use allocentric strategies. Altogether, these results suggest that heading direction in the superior and medial parietal cortex is mediated by an egocentric code, whereas the entorhinal cortex encodes directions according to an allocentric reference frame.",
