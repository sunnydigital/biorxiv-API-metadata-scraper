    "abstract": "In the rapidly advancing field of synthetic biology, there is a critical need for technology to discover targeting moieties for therapeutic biologics. We developed INSPIRE-seq, an approach that utilizes a nanobody library and next-generation sequencing to identify nanobodies selected for complex environments. INSPIRE-seq enables the parallel enrichment of immune cell-binding nanobodies that penetrate the tumor microenvironment. Clone enrichment and specificity varies across immune cell subtypes in the tumor, lymph node, and spleen. INSPIRE-seq identified a dendritic cell binding clone that binds PHB2. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a connection with cDC1s, and immunofluorescence confirmed nanobody-PHB2 colocalization along cell membranes. Structural modeling and docking studies assisted binding predictions and will guide nanobody selection. In this work, we demonstrate that INSPIRE-seq offers an unbiased approach to examine complex microenvironments and assist in the development of nanobodies, which could serve as active drugs, modified to become drugs, or used as targeting moieties.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great potential to be used as alternatives to embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine and disease modelling, thereby avoiding ethical issues arising from the use of embryo-derived cells. However, despite clear similarities between the two cell types, it is likely they are not identical. In this study we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors. We find that while hESCs and hiPSCs express a near identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the expression levels of a wide subset of proteins. hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs. The proteomic data show hiPSCs have significantly increased abundance of vital cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins, which correlated with phenotypic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. Thus, higher levels of glutamine transporters correlated with increased glutamine uptake, while higher levels of proteins involved in lipid synthesis correlated with increased lipid droplet formation. Some of the biggest metabolic changes were seen in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism, with corresponding enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown experimentally using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins including ECM components and growth factors, some with known tumorigenic properties as well as proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. Our data indicate that reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPSCs effectively restores protein expression in cell nuclei to a similar state to hESCs, but does not similarly restore the profile of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins, with consequences for cell phenotypes affecting growth and metabolism. The data improve understanding of the molecular differences between induced and embryonic stem cells with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) provides a method for safely perturbing brain activity, and has been employed in basic research to test hypotheses concerning brain-behavior relationships with increasing translational applications.\n\nObjectiveWe introduce and evaluate a novel subthreshold NIBS method: kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation (kTMP). KTMP is a magnetic induction method that delivers continuous kHz-frequency cortical electric fields which may be amplitude-modulated to potentially mimic electrical activity at endogenous frequencies.\n\nMethodsWe used TMS to compare the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a hand muscle before and after kTMP. In Experiment 1, we applied kTMP for 10 min over motor cortex to induce an E-field amplitude of approximately 2.0 V/m, comparing the effects of waveforms at frequencies of 2.0, 3.5, or 5.0 kHz. In Experiments 2 and 3 we used two forms of amplitude-modulated kTMP with a carrier frequency at 3.5 kHz and modulation frequencies of either 20 or 140 Hz.\n\nResultsThe only percept associated with kTMP was an auditory tone, making kTMP amenable for double-blind experimentation. Relative to sham stimulation, non-modulated kTMP at 2.0 and 3.5 kHz resulted in an increase in cortical excitability, with Experiments 2 and 3 providing a replication of this effect for the 3.5 kHz condition. Although amplitude-modulated kTMP increased MEP amplitude compared to sham, no enhancement was found compared to non-modulated kTMP.\n\nConclusionskTMP opens a new experimental NIBS space inducing relatively large amplitude subthreshold E-fields able to increase cortical excitability with minimal sensation.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation is that they dynamically exchange materials with their surroundings, and this can be crucial to condensate function. How is this rate of exchange controlled? Intuitively, the rate can be limited by the flux from the dilute phase or by the mixing speed in the dense phase. Surprisingly, recent experiments suggest that the exchange rate can instead be limited by the dynamics of molecules at the droplet interface, implying the existence of an \"interface resistance\". We combine theory and simulation to show that interface resistance can arise when incident molecules transiently touch the interface without bonding to the dense phase, i.e., the molecules \"bounce\" from the interface. This occurs when the molecules can adopt conformations that limit the accessibility of their sticky regions. Our work highlights the underappreciated role of interface resistance, with implications for both natural and synthetic condensates.",

    "abstract": "Our prior study discovered that numerous adaptive mechanisms emerge in response to cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase type 8 (TGAC8) which included overexpression of a large number of proteins. Here we conducted an unbiased phosphoproteomics analysis in order to determine the role of altered protein phosphorylation in the adaptive heart performance and protection profile of adult TGAC8 left ventricle (LV) at 3-4 months of age, and integrated the phosphoproteome with transcriptome and proteome. Based on differentially regulated phosphoproteins by genotype, numerous stress-response pathways within reprogrammed TGAC8 LV, including PKA, PI3K and AMPK signaling pathways, predicted upstream regulators (e.g., PDPK1, PAK1 and PTK2B, and downstream functions (e.g., cell viability, protein quality control), and metabolism were enriched. In addition to PKA, numerous other kinases and phosphatases were hyper-phosphorylated in TGAC8 vs. WT. Hyper-phosphorylated transcriptional factors in TGAC8 were associated with increased mRNA transcription, immune responses and metabolic pathways. Combination of the phosphoproteome with its proteome and with the previously published TGAC8 transcriptome enabled the elucidation of cardiac performance and adaptive protection profiles coordinately regulated at post-translational modification (PTM) (phosphorylation), translational and transcriptional levels. Many stress-response signaling pathways, i.e., PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK and ubiquitin labeling, were consistently enriched and activated in the TGAC8 LV at transcriptional, translational and PTM levels. Thus, reprogramming of the cardiac phosphoproteome, proteome and transcriptome confers resilience to chronic adenylyl cyclase-driven stress.",

    "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely utilized in statistics, machine learning, and genomics for dimensionality reduction and uncovering low-dimensional latent structure. To address the challenges posed by ever-growing data size, fast and memory-efficient PCA methods have gained prominence. In this paper, we propose a novel Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) algorithm implemented in PCAone, featuring a window-based optimization scheme that enables accelerated convergence while improving the accuracy. Additionally, PCAone incorporates out-of-core and multithreaded implementations for the existing Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) and RSVD. Through comprehensive evaluations using multiple large-scale real-world datasets in different fields, we demonstrate the advantage of PCAone over existing methods. The new algorithm achieves significantly faster computation time while maintaining accuracy comparable to the slower IRAM method. Notably, our analyses of UK Biobank, comprising around 0.5 million individuals and 6.1 million common SNPs, demonstrate that PCAone accurately computes the top 40 principal components within a 9 hours. This analysis effectively captures population structure, signals of selection, structural variants, and low recombination regions, utilizing less than 20 GB of memory and 20 CPU threads. Furthermore, when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data featuring 1.3 million cells, PCAone, accurately capturing the top 40 principal components in 49 minutes. This performance represents a 10-fold improvement over state-of-the-art tools.",

    "abstract": "Previously, Tuller et al. found that the first 30 to 50 codons of the genes of yeast and other eukaryotes are slightly enriched for rare codons, so are presumably translated somewhat slowly. They argued, based on informatics, that this initial slow translation \"ramp\" was adaptive; and increased efficiency of translation by queuing ribosomes to prevent collisions. Today, the translational speeds of different codons are known, and indeed rare codons are translated slowly. We re-examined the slow translation ramp. We confirm the finding that 5 regions are enriched for rare codons. However, we also find that the 5 ends of yeast genes are poorly conserved in evolution, suggesting that they are unstable and turn over relatively rapidly. When a new 5 end forms de novo, it is likely to include codons that would otherwise be rare. Because evolution has had a relatively short time to select against these codons, 5 ends are typically slightly enriched for rare, slow codons. Opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al., we show by direct experiment that genes with slowly translated codons at the 5 end are expressed relatively poorly, and substituting faster codons improves expression. Further informatic studies suggest that for natural genes, slow 5 ends are correlated with poor gene expression, opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al. Thus we conclude that slow 5 translation is a \"spandrel\"; it is a non-adaptive consequence of something else, in this case the turnover of 5 ends in evolution, and it does not improve translation.\n\nHighlightThe 5 ends of yeast genes are unstable over evolutionary time, enriching for rare codons, slowing translation; slow initial translation does not enhance expression.",

    "abstract": "Functional responses are central to describe consumer-resource interactions. Defined as the per capita average feeding rate of consumers, since Hollings seminal papers, they have been widely used in ecology. Hollings central observation was that they often saturate as resource density increases. If the interference between consumers is strong, they also decrease with consumer density. Here we emphasize the stochastic nature of the individual feeding processes and the associated probability distributions of the different behavioral types and show how they control population-averaged feeding rates. We do so by revisiting a classic approach based on the formulation of feeding interactions in terms of individual-based reaction schemes. We highlight the common assumptions underlying the different functional forms and discover a new predator-dependent functional response that should be considered the natural extension of the Holling type II functional response when consumers interference is considered. Our work has clear implications, on the one hand, for both model selection and parameter inference from feeding experiments, and, on the other, for the use of multi-species extensions of these functional responses in population-level food-web dynamic models.",

The emergence of supersaturated amorphous drug-salt-polymer systems provides a new approach to this problem. However, the effects of polymers on drug-drug interactions in aqueous phase are largely unexplored and it is unclear how to choose an optimal salt-polymer combination for a particular drug. We describe a comparative experimental and computational characterization of amorphous solid dispersions containing the drug celecoxib, and PVP-VA or HPMCAS polymers with or without Na+/K+ salts. Classical models for drug-polymer interactions fail to identify the best drug-salt-polymer combination. In contrast, more stable drug-polymer interaction energies computed from molecular dynamics simulations correlate with prolonged stability of supersaturated amorphous drug-salt-polymer systems, along with better dissolution and pharmacokinetic profiles. The celecoxib-salt-PVP-VA formulations exhibit excellent biopharmaceutical performance, offering the prospect of less frequent administration and lower doses of this widely used anti-inflammatory, thereby increasing cost-effectiveness, and reducing side-effects.",

However, how dynein and dynactin recognise diverse adaptors, how they interact with each other during complex formation, and the role of critical regulators such as LIS1 remain unclear. To address this, we determine the cryo-EM structure of dynein-dynactin on microtubules with LIS1 and the lysosomal adaptor JIP3. We show how JIP3 specifies complex formation despite a shorter coiled coil and lack of identifiable motifs compared to typical adaptors. We find LIS1 directly binds dynactins p150 subunit, closely tethering it to dynein. This interaction is necessary for dyneins cellular and in vitro activity. We also show how dyneins intermediate chain relieves p150s autoinhibition to enable LIS1 binding. Together, our data suggest LIS1 and p150 constrain dynein-dynactin to ensure efficient complex formation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCulture-independent 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding is a commonly used method in microbiome profiling. However, this approach can only reflect the proportion of sequencing reads, rather than the actual cell fraction. To achieve more quantitative cell fraction estimates, we need to resolve the 16S gene copy numbers (GCN) for different community members. Currently, there are several bioinformatic tools available to estimate 16S GCN, either based on taxonomy assignment or phylogeny.\n\nMethodHere we develop a novel algorithm, Stacked Ensemble Model (SEM), that estimates 16S GCN directly from the 16S rRNA gene sequence strings, without resolving taxonomy or phylogeny. For accessibility, we developed a public, end-to-end, web-based tool based on the SEM model, named Artificial Neural Network Approximator for 16S rRNA Gene Copy Number (ANNA16).\n\nResultsBased on 27,579 16S rRNA gene sequence data (rrnDB database), we show that ANNA16 outperforms the most commonly used 16S GCN prediction algorithms. The prediction error range in the 5-fold cross validation of SEM is completely lower than all other algorithms for the 16S full-length sequence and partially lower at 16S subregions. The final test and a mock community test indicate ANNA16 is more accurate than all currently available tools (i.e., rrnDB, CopyRighter, PICRUSt2, & PAPRICA). SHAP value analysis indicates ANNA16 mainly learns information from rare insertions.\n\nConclusionANNA16 represents a deep learning based 16S GCN prediction tool. Compared to the traditional GCN prediction tools, ANNA16 has a simple structure, faster inference speed without precomputing, and higher accuracy. With increased 16S GCN data in the database, future studies could improve the prediction errors for rare, high-GCN taxa due to current under sampling.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum accounts for the majority of over 600000 malaria-associated deaths annually. Parasites resistant to nearly all antimalarials have emerged and the need for drugs with alternative modes of action is thus undoubted. The FK506-binding protein PfFKBP35 has gained attention as a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506 (tacrolimus). Whilst there is considerable interest in targeting PfFKBP35 with small molecules, a genetic validation of this factor as a drug target is missing and its function in parasite biology remains elusive. Here, we show that limiting PfFKBP35 levels are lethal to P. falciparum and result in a delayed death-like phenotype that is characterized by defective ribosome homeostasis and stalled protein synthesis. Our data furthermore suggest that FK506, unlike the action of this drug in model organisms, exerts its anti-proliferative activity in a PfFKBP35-independent manner and, using cellular thermal shift assays, we identify putative FK506-targets beyond PfFKBP35. In addition to revealing first insights into the function of PfFKBP35, our results show that FKBP-binding drugs can adopt non-canonical modes of action - with major implications for the development of FK506-derived molecules active against Plasmodium parasites and other eukaryotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Genetic pleiotropy is abundant across spatially distributed brain characteristics derived from one neuroimaging modality (e.g. structural, functional or diffusion MRI). A better understanding of pleiotropy across modalities could inform us on the integration of brain function, micro- and macrostructure.

When jointly analysing phenotypes derived from structural, functional and diffusion MRI with the Multivariate Omnibus Statistical Test (MOSTest), we boost the discovery of loci and genes beyond previously identified effects for each modality individually. Cross-modality genes are involved in fundamental biological processes and predominantly expressed during prenatal brain development. We additionally boost genetic discovery and prediction of psychiatric disorders by conditioning independent GWAS on our multimodal multivariate GWAS. These findings shed light on the shared genetic mechanisms underlying variation in brain morphology, functional connectivity, and tissue composition.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=192 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521181v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (68K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127268dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1540816org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df01f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9d3fa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Evoked neural responses to sensory stimuli have been extensively investigated in humans and animal models both to enhance our understanding of brain function and to aid in clinical diagnosis of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Recording and imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and calcium imaging provide complementary information about different aspects of brain activity at different spatial and temporal scales. Modeling and simulations provide a way to integrate these different types of information to clarify underlying neural mechanisms.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to shed light on the neural dynamics underlying auditory evoked responses by fitting a rate-based model to LFPs recorded via multi-contact electrodes which simultaneously sampled neural activity across cortical laminae. Recordings included neural population responses to best-frequency (BF) and non-BF tones at four representative sites in primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake monkeys. The model considered major neural populations of excitatory, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons across layers 2/3, 4, and 5/6. Unknown parameters, including the connection strength between the populations, were fitted to the data. Our results revealed similar population dynamics, fitted model parameters, predicted equivalent current dipoles (ECD), tuning curves, and lateral inhibition profiles across recording sites and animals, in spite of quite different extracellular current distributions. We found that PV firing rates were higher in BF than in non-BF responses, mainly due to different strengths of tonotopic thalamic input, whereas SOM firing rates were higher in non-BF than in BF responses due to lateral inhibition.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of the model-fitting approach in identifying the contributions of cell-type specific population activity to stimulus-evoked LFPs across cortical laminae, providing a foundation for further investigations into the dynamics of neural circuits underlying cortical sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Despite the distortion of speech signals caused by unavoidable noise in daily life, our ability to comprehend speech in noisy environments is relatively stable. However, the neural mechanisms underlying reliable speech-in-noise comprehension remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the neural tracking of acoustic and semantic speech information during noisy naturalistic speech comprehension. Participants listened to narrative audio recordings mixed with spectrally matched stationary noise at three signal-to-ratio (SNR) levels (no noise, 3 dB, -3 dB), and 60-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded. A temporal response function (TRF) method was employed to derive event-related-like responses to the continuous speech stream at both the acoustic and the semantic levels. Whereas the amplitude envelope of the naturalistic speech was taken as the acoustic feature, word entropy and word surprisal were extracted via the natural language processing method as two semantic features. Theta-band frontocentral TRF responses to the acoustic feature were observed at around 400 ms following speech fluctuation onset over all three SNR levels, and the response latencies were more delayed with increasing noise. Delta-band frontal TRF responses to the semantic feature of word entropy were observed at around 200 to 600 ms leading to speech fluctuation onset over all three SNR levels. The response latencies became more leading with increasing noise and were correlated with comprehension performance and perceived speech intelligibility. While the following responses to speech acoustics were consistent with previous studies, our study revealed the robustness of leading responses to speech semantics, which suggests a possible predictive mechanism at the semantic level for maintaining reliable speech comprehension in noisy environments.\n\nHighlightsO_LILeading responses were observed in the semantic-level neural tracking, with more leading latencies as noise increased.\nC_LIO_LIFollowing responses were observed in the acoustic-level neural tracking, with more delayed latencies as noise increased.\nC_LIO_LISemantic-level neural tracking is correlated with comprehension performance and perceived intelligibility.\nC_LIO_LIDistinct frequency bands were involved in speech semantic and acoustic processing.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A recently described member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is Mycobacterium orygis, which can cause disease primarily in animals but also in humans. Although M. orygis has been reported from different geographic regions around the world, due to a lack of proper identification techniques, the contribution of this emerging pathogen to the global burden of zoonotic tuberculosis is not fully understood. In the present work, we report single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis using whole genome sequencing (WGS) that can accurately identify M. orygis and differentiate it from other members of MTBC species. WGS-based SNPs analysis was performed for 61 isolates from different Provinces in Canada that were identified as M. orygis. A total of 56 M. orygis sequences from the public databases were also included in the analysis. Several unique SNPs in gyrB, PPE55, Rv2042c, leuS, mmpL6, and mmpS6 genes were used to determine their effectiveness as genetic markers for the identification of M. orygis. To the best of our knowledge, five of these SNPs, viz., gyrB277 (A[-&gt;]G), gyrB1478 (T[-&gt;]C), leuS1064 (A[-&gt;]T), mmpL6486 (T[-&gt;]C), and mmpS6334 (C[-&gt;]G) are reported for the first time in this study. Our results also revealed several SNPs specific to other species within MTBC. The phylogenetic analysis shows that studied genomes were genetically diverse and clustered with M. orygis sequences of human and animal origin reported from different geographic locations. Therefore, the present study provides a new insight into the high confidence identification of M. orygis from MTBC species based on WGS data, which can be useful for reference and diagnostic laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning and stabilized by post-learning reactivation. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unknown. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives the offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed two days prior, linking the fear from the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. We find that fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with prior studies, we find reactivation of the recent aversive memory ensemble during the offline period following learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Taken together, these results demonstrate that strong aversive experience can drive retrospective memory-linking through the offline co-reactivation of recent memory ensembles with memory ensembles formed days prior, providing a neural mechanism by which memories can be integrated across days.",

    "abstract": "P-TEFb and CDK12 facilitate transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. Given the prominence of both kinases in cancer, gaining a better understanding of their interplay could inform the design of novel anti-cancer strategies. While down-regulation of DNA repair genes in CDK12-targeted cancer cells is being explored therapeutically, little is known about mechanisms and significance of transcriptional induction upon inhibition of CDK12. We show that selective targeting of CDK12 in colon cancer-derived cells activates P-TEFb via its release from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP. In turn, P-TEFb stimulates Pol II pause release at thousands of genes, most of which become newly dependent on P-TEFb. Amongst the induced genes are those stimulated by hallmark pathways in cancer, including p53 and NF-{kappa}B. Consequently, CDK12-inhibited cancer cells exhibit hypersensitivity to inhibitors of P-TEFb. While blocking P-TEFb triggers their apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner, it impedes cell proliferation irrespective of p53 by preventing induction of genes downstream of the DNA damage-induced NF-{kappa}B signaling. In summary, stimulation of Pol II pause release at the signal-responsive genes underlies the functional dependence of CDK12-inhibited cancer cells on P-TEFb. Our study establishes the mechanistic underpinning for combinatorial targeting of CDK12 with either P-TEFb or the induced oncogenic pathways in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Mammary gland development occurs primarily in adulthood, undergoing extensive expansion during puberty followed by cycles of functional specialization and regression with every round of pregnancy/lactation/involution. This process is ultimately driven by the coordinated proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. However, the endogenous molecular factors regulating these developmental dynamics are still poorly defined. Endocannabinoid signaling is known to determine cell fate-related events during the development of different organs in the central nervous system and the periphery. Here, we report that the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) plays a pivotal role in adult mammary gland development. Specifically, it is required for luminal lineage specification in the mammary gland, and it promotes hormone-driven secretory differentiation of mammary epithelial cells by controlling the endogenous levels of anandamide and the subsequent activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Together, our findings shed light on the role of the endocannabinoid system in breast development and point to FAAH as a therapeutic target in milk-production deficits.",

Based on a metabarcoding analysis of brook stickleback gut contents in two polymorphic populations, we found significant diet differences were associated with pelvic spine reduction, but we found no clear or consistent trend supporting a tendency for benthic feeding in pelvic-reduced brook stickleback. These results contrast with those found in threespine stickleback where pelvic spine reduction is often associated with a benthic diet. Hence, we found non-parallel consequences of spine polymorphism across species. Furthermore, a difference in gill raker morphology has been frequently observed between ecomorphs with differen diets in many fish species.

We apply STalign to align ST datasets within and across technologies as well as to align ST datasets to a 3D common coordinate framework. We show that STalign achieves high gene expression and cell-type correspondence across matched spatial locations that is significantly improved over landmark-based affine alignments.

BackgroundA critical knowledge gap in freshwater plants research is the lack of genetic tools necessary to answer fundamental questions about their demographic histories, adaptation, and phylogenetic relationships. One example of this is Typha, a global genus of freshwater plants foundational to wetlands that is also becoming an increasingly problematic biological invader in numerous regions worldwide; while important insights have been discovered for this genus, existing markers are insufficient to answer fundamental questions about their demographic histories, adaptation, and phylogenetic relationships, to identify introduced and hybrid lineages, and to examine patterns of hybridisation and introgression.\n\n2. MethodsWe optimised a library preparation and data processing protocol to develop genome-wide nuclear and plastid resources for studying the evolutionary history, genetic structure and diversity, hybridisation, local adaptation, invasiveness, and geographic expansion dynamics of Typha.\n\n3. Main resultsWe sequenced 140 Typha samples and identified [~]120K nuclear SNPs that differentiate T. angustifolia, T. domingensis and T. latifolia and retrieved their plastome sequences. We observed genetic introgression among the three species.\n\n4. ConclusionsFollowing a fast, straightforward, and cost-efficient genomic library preparation protocol, we produced a suite of genome-wide resources to facilitate investigations into the taxonomy and population genetics of Typha and to advance the genomic understanding of wetland plants.\n\n5. ContributionsThe protocol described, the updated chromosome-level genome assembly of T. latifolia, the catalogue of species-specific SNPs, and the chloroplast sequences produced in this study comprise permanent resources that can be applied to study the genetic composition of multiple populations and hybrid zones and will be incorporated into future studies of Typha, an ecologically important and globally invasive macrophyte.",

    "abstract": "Pyroptosis and apoptosis are two forms of regulated cell death that can defend against intracellular infection. Although pyroptosis and apoptosis have distinct signaling pathways, when a cell fails to complete pyroptosis, backup pathways will initiate apoptosis. Here, we investigated the utility of apoptosis compared to pyroptosis in defense against an intracellular bacterial infection. We previously engineered Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to persistently express flagellin, and thereby activate NLRC4 during systemic infection in mice. The resulting pyroptosis clears this flagellin-engineered strain. We now show that infection of caspase-1 or gasdermin D deficient macrophages by this flagellin-engineered S. Typhimurium induces apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, we also now engineer S. Typhimurium to translocate the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain of BID, which also triggers apoptosis in macrophages in vitro. In both engineered strains, apoptosis occurred somewhat slower than pyroptosis. During mouse infection, the apoptotic pathway successfully cleared these engineered S. Typhimurium from the intestinal niche, but failed to clear the bacteria from the myeloid niche in the spleen or lymph nodes. In contrast, the pyroptotic pathway was beneficial in defense of both niches. In order to clear an infection, distinct cell types may have specific tasks that they must complete before they die. In some cells, either apoptotic or pyroptotic signaling may initiate the same tasks, whereas in other cell types these modes of cell death may lead to different tasks that may not be identical in defense against infection. We recently suggested that such diverse tasks can be considered as different cellular \"bucket lists\" to be accomplished before a cell dies.",

We found that serotonin neural activity in mating females peaked specifically upon male ejaculation, and remained elevated above baseline until disengagement. Artificial intravaginal mechanical stimulation was sufficient to elicit increased 5-HT neural activity but the delivery of ejaculatory fluids was not. Distal penis erectile enlargement (\"penile cupping\") at ejaculation and forceful expulsion of ejaculatory fluid each provided sufficient mechanical stimulation to elicit serotonin neuron activation.

The final assembly spans 2.8 billion basepairs, 99.34% of which are in 30 chromosome-scale scaffolds. Hi-C heatmaps support a karyotype of 1n=30 chromosomes. Comparisons with other octopus species genomes show a conserved octopus karyotype, and a pattern of local genome rearrangements between species. This new chromosome-scale genome of O. vulgaris will further facilitate research in all aspects of cephalopod biology, including various forms of plasticity and the neural machinery underlying sophisticated cognition, as well as an understanding of cephalopod evolution.",

Grasses encompass more than 10,000 species and cover more than 40% of the world land area from tropical to temperate regions. Given that grasses also supply about a fifth of the worlds dietary protein as cereal grains, unlocking the sources of phenotypic variation in B. distachyon is hence of prime interest in fundamental and applied research in agronomy, ecology and evolution. We present here the B. distachyon diversity panel, which encompasses 332 fully sequenced accessions covering the whole species distribution from Spain to Iraq. By combining population genetics, niche modeling and landscape genomics, we suggest that B. distachyon recolonized Europe and the Middle East following the last glacial maximum. Consequently, the species faced new environmental conditions which led to clear associations between bioclimatic variables and genetic factors as well as footprints of positive selection in the genome.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe remarkable resistance to ionizing radiation found in anhydrobiotic organisms, such as some bacteria, tardigrades, and bdelloid rotifers has been hypothesized to be incidental to the desiccation resistance. Both stresses produce reactive oxygen species and cause damage to DNA and other macromolecules. However, this hypothesis has only been investigated in a few species.\n\nResultsIn this study, we analyzed the transcriptomic response of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga to desiccation and to low- (X-rays) and high- (Fe) LET radiation to highlight the molecular and genetic mechanisms triggered by both stresses. We identified numerous genes encoding antioxidants, but also chaperones, that are constitutively highly expressed, which may contribute to the protection of proteins against oxidative stress during desiccation and ionizing radiation. We also detected a transcriptomic response common to desiccation and ionizing radiation with the over-expression of genes mainly involved in DNA repair and protein modifications but also genes with unknown functions being bdelloid-specific. A distinct transcriptomic response specific to rehydration was also found, with the over-expression of genes mainly encoding Late Embryogenesis Abundant proteins, specific Heat Shock Proteins, and glucose repressive proteins.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest that the extreme resistance of bdelloid rotifers to radiation might indeed be a consequence of their capacity to resist complete desiccation. This study paves the way to functional genetic experiments on A. vaga targeting promising candidate proteins playing central roles in radiation and desiccation resistance.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a leading global cause of death from infectious disease. Biofilms are increasingly recognized as a relevant growth form during M. tb infection and may impede treatment by enabling bacterial drug and immune tolerance. M. tb has a complicated regulatory network that has been well-characterized for many relevant disease states, including dormancy and hypoxia. However, despite its importance, our knowledge of the genes and pathways involved in biofilm formation is limited. Here we characterize the biofilm transcriptomes of fully virulent clinical isolates and find that the regulatory systems underlying biofilm growth vary widely between strains and are also distinct from regulatory programs associated with other environmental cues. We used experimental evolution to investigate changes to the transcriptome during adaptation to biofilm growth and found that the application of a uniform selection pressure resulted in loss of strain-to-strain variation in gene expression, resulting in a more uniform biofilm transcriptome. The adaptive trajectories of transcriptomes were shaped by the genetic background of the M. tb population leading to convergence on a sub-lineage specific transcriptome. We identified widespread upregulation of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) as a common feature of the biofilm transcriptome and hypothesize that ncRNA function in genome-wide modulation of gene expression, thereby facilitating rapid regulatory responses to new environments. These results reveal a new facet of the M. tb regulatory system and provide valuable insight into how M. tb adapts to new environments.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding mechanisms of resistance and tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) can help us develop new treatments that capitalize on M. tbs vulnerabilities. Here we used transcriptomics to study both the regulation of biofilm formation in clinical isolates as well as how those regulatory systems adapt to new environments. We find that closely related clinical populations have diverse strategies for growth under biofilm conditions, and that genetic background plays a large role in determining the trajectory of evolution. These results have implications for future treatment strategies that may be informed by our knowledge of the evolutionary constraints on strain(s) from an individual infection. This work provides new information about the mechanisms of biofilm formation in M. tb and outlines a framework for population level approaches for studying bacterial adaptation.",

Repetitive activation of both stimuli induced response potentiation that is impaired in mice with selective deficits in either intrinsic plasticity (SK2 KO) or LTP (CaMKII TT305/6VA). Intrinsic, but not synaptic, plasticity expands the local, dendritic RF representation. Simultaneous dendrite and axon initial segment recordings confirm that these dendritic events affect axonal output.

    "abstract": "The role of the intestinal microbiota in host health is increasingly revealed in its contributions to disease states. The host-microbiome interaction is multifactorial and dynamic. One of the factors that has recently been strongly associated with host physiological responses is peptidoglycan from bacterial cell walls. Peptidoglycan from gut commensal bacteria activate peptidoglycan sensors in human cells, including the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2 (NOD2). When present in the gastrointestinal tract, both the polymeric form (sacculi) and de-polymerized fragments can modulate host physiology including checkpoint anticancer therapy efficacy, body temperature and appetite, and postnatal growth. To leverage this growing area of biology towards therapeutic prescriptions, it will be critical to directly analyze sacculi from living hosts in a reproducible and non-invasive way. Here we show that peptidoglycan/sacculi can be readily isolated from fecal samples of mice and humans. Analysis of fecal samples provided a non-invasive route to probe the gut commensal community including the metabolic synchronicity with the host circadian clock. Together, these results pave the way for non-invasive diagnostic tools to emerge that inform on the causal nature of peptidoglycan in host health and disease.",

How RNAPII manages this complex diffusive search in 3D nuclear space remains largely unknown. The disordered carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, which is essential for recruiting transcription-associated proteins, forms phase-separated droplets in vitro, hinting at a potential role in modulating RNAPII dynamics. Here, we use single-molecule tracking and spatiotemporal mapping in living yeast to show that the CTD is responsible for confining RNAPII diffusion within a subnuclear region enriched for active genes, but without apparent phase separation into condensates. Both Mediator and global chromatin organization are required for sustaining RNAPII confinement. Remarkably, truncating the CTD disrupts RNAPII spatial confinement, prolongs target search, diminishes chromatin binding, impairs pre-initiation complex formation, and reduces transcription bursting. This study illuminates the pivotal role of the CTD in driving spatiotemporal confinement of RNAPII for efficient gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Many animals rely on optic flow for navigation, using differences in eye image velocity to detect deviations from their intended direction of travel. However, asymmetries in image velocity between the eyes are often overshadowed by strong, symmetric translational optic flow during navigation. Yet, the brain efficiently extracts these asymmetries for course control. While optic flow sensitive-neurons have been found in many animal species, far less is known about the postsynaptic circuits that support such robust optic flow processing. In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, a group of neurons called the horizontal system (HS) are involved in course control during high-speed translation. To understand how HS cells facilitate robust optic flow processing, we identified central networks that connect to HS cells using full brain electron microscopy datasets. These networks comprise three layers: convergent inputs from different, optic flow-sensitive cells, a middle layer with reciprocal, and lateral inhibitory interactions among different interneuron classes, and divergent output projecting to both the ventral nerve cord (equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord), and to deeper regions of the fly brain. By combining two-photon optical imaging to monitor free calcium dynamics, manipulating GABA receptors and modeling, we found that lateral disinhibition between brain hemispheres enhance the selectivity to rotational visual flow at the output layer of the network. Moreover, asymmetric manipulations of interneurons and their descending outputs induce drifts during high-speed walking, confirming their contribution to steering control. Together, these findings highlight the importance of competitive disinhibition as a critical circuit mechanism for robust processing of optic flow, which likely influences course control and heading perception, both critical functions supporting navigation.",

    "abstract": "The house mouse (Mus musculus), commensal to humans, has spread globally via human activities, leading to secondary contact between genetically divergent subspecies. This pattern of genetic admixture can provide insights into the selective forces at play in this well-studied model organism. Our analysis of 163 house mouse genomes, with a particular focus on East Asia, revealed substantial admixture between the subspecies castaneus and musculus, particularly in Japan and southern China. We revealed, despite the admixture, all Y chromosomes in the East Asian samples belonged to the musculus-type haplogroup, potentially explained by genomic conflict under sex ratio distortion due to varying copy numbers of ampliconic genes on sex chromosomes. We also investigated the influence of selection on the post-hybridization of the subspecies castaneus and musculus in Japan. Even though the genetic background of most Japanese samples closely resembles the subspecies musculus, certain genomic regions overrepresented the castaneus-like genetic components, particularly in immune-related genes. Furthermore, a large genomic block containing a vomeronasal/olfactory receptor gene cluster predominantly harbored castaneus-type haplotypes in the Japanese samples, highlighting the crucial role of olfaction-based recognition in shaping hybrid genomes.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a highly heritable and complex group of psychiatric conditions resulting in abnormal repetitive behaviors and impairment in communication and cognitive skills in children. Recent efforts have led to unmasking some of the genetic and environmental risk factors that contribute to the manifestation of ASD.\n\nPrevious studies have focused on the genetic correlation between ASDs and other neuropsychiatric disorders but an in-depth understanding of the common variants and its correlation to other disorders is required. In this study, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the common variants identified in ASDs by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and compared it to the consensus genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Schizophrenia (SCZ) that we have recently reported to determine the shared genetic associations in both the disorders. Further, using a meta-analytical approach we have also probed the cellular phenotypes observed in ASD and compared it to the phenotypes observed in SCZ induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. Our collective analysis of the deficits in ASD in comparison to SCZ iPSC-derived neurons indicates the presence of developmental divergent trajectories of neuronal pathophysiology that converge to similar phenotypes after the neuronal cells have matured even though the disorders share a high percentage of genetic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy plays a key role in the responses to different stress condition in plants, providing both pro-life and pro-death functions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), are common modulators of stress responses, having both toxic and signaling functions. In this context, the relationship between ROS and autophagy regulation remains unclear, and in some aspect contradictory. In this study, we employed pharmacological and genetic approaches to investigate the effects of radical superoxide (O -), hydrogen peroxide (H O) and singlet oxygen (1O) on the cytoplastic redox state and autophagic flux in Arabidopsis thaliana. Ours results demonstrated that oxidative treatments with H2O2 and MV, which drastically increased the oxidized state of the cytoplasm, reduced the autophagic flux. Conversely, singlet oxygen, which did not have significant effects on the cytoplasmic redox state, increased the autophagic flux. Additionally, our findings indicated that after H2O2 and high light treatments and during the recovery period, the cytoplasm returned to its reduced state, while autophagy was markedly induced. In summary, our study unveils the differential effects of ROS on the autophagic flux, establishing a correlation with the redox state of the cytoplasm. Moreover, it emphasizes the dynamic nature of autophagy in response to oxidative stress and the subsequent recovery period.\n\nHIGHLIGHTThis research show that the differential effects of ROS on autophagic flux correlates with their effects on cytoplasmic redox state.",

The underlying neural circuit mechanism remains poorly understood. We investigated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to perform an analog of the classic Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The networks consist of two modules responsible for rule representation and sensorimotor mapping, respectively, where each module is comprised of a circuit with excitatory neurons and three major types of inhibitory neurons. We found that rule representation by self-sustained persistent activity across trials, error monitoring and gated sensorimotor mapping emerged from training. Systematic dissection of trained RNNs revealed a detailed circuit mechanism. The networks' dynamical trajectories for different rules reside in separate subspaces of population activity; they become virtually identical and performance was reduced to chance level when dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons were silenced, demonstrating that rule-based gating critically depends on the disinhibitory motif.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnxiety is a common symptom of several mental health disorders and adversely affects motivated behaviors. Anxiety can emerge from associating risk of future harm while engaged in goal-guided actions. Using a recently developed behavioral paradigm to model this aspect of anxiety, we investigated the role of two cortical subregions, the prelimbic medial frontal cortex (PL) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), which have been implicated in anxiety and outcome expectation, in flexible representation of actions associated with harm risk.\n\nMethodsA seek-take reward-guided instrumental task design was used to train animals to associate the seek action with a variable risk of punishment. After learning, animals underwent extinction training for this association. Fiber photometry was used to measure and compare neuronal activity in PL and lOFC during learning and extinction.\n\nResultsAnimals increased action suppression in response to punishment contingencies. This increase dissipated after extinction training. These behavioral changes were associated with region specific changes in neuronal activity. PL neuronal activity preferentially adapted to threat of punishment whereas lOFC activity adapted to safe aspects of the task. Moreover, correlated activity between these regions was suppressed during actions associated with harm risk suggesting that these regions may guide behavior independently under anxiety.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest the PL and lOFC serve distinct but complementary roles in the representation of learned anxiety. This dissociation may provide a mechanism for how overlapping cortical systems are implicated in reward-guided action execution during anxiety.",

Recently there has been a surge of multiplexed RNA in situ techniques but their application to human tissues and clinical biopsies has been limited due to their large size, general lower tissue quality and high background autofluorescence. Here we report DART-FISH, a versatile padlock probe-based technology capable of profiling hundreds to thousands of genes in centimeter-sized human tissue sections at cellular resolution. We introduced an omni-cell type cytoplasmic stain, dubbed RiboSoma that substantially improves the segmentation of cell bodies. We developed a computational decoding-by-deconvolution workflow to extract gene spots even in the presence of optical crowding. Our enzyme-free isothermal decoding procedure allowed us to image 121 genes in a large section from the human neocortex in less than 10 hours, where we successfully recapitulated the cytoarchitecture of 20 neuronal and non-neuronal subclasses. Additionally, we demonstrated the detection of transcripts as short as 461 nucleotides, including neuropeptides and discovered new cortical layer markers.

    "abstract": "Malignancies of epithelial tissues, called carcinomas, account for the majority of cancer cases. Much cancer research has focused on genetic alterations and their relation to different carcinoma phenotypes. Besides a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here, we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer, and propose that they emerge from a mechanical buckling instability upon epithelial overgrowth. Using a combination of microscopy imaging of the mouse and human bladder tissue, elasticity theory, and numerical simulations of differential growth in the bladder mucosa, we find that aberrant tissue morphologies can emerge through stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds exhibit qualitative and quantitative similarity with imaged early papillary tumors and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy indeed reveals local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a mechanical origin of the different carcinoma subtypes in the bladder, which have vastly different clinical prognosis.

    "abstract": "Activation of immune cells requires the remodeling of cell metabolism in order to support immune function. We study these metabolic changes through the infection of Drosophila larvae by parasitoid wasp. Neutralization of the parasitoid egg involves the differentiation of lamellocytes, which encapsulate the egg. A melanization cascade is initiated, producing toxic molecules to destroy the egg; meanwhile the capsule created also protects the host from the toxic reaction. We combine transcriptomics and metabolomics, including 13C-labeled glucose and trehalose tracing, as well as genetic manipulation of sugar metabolism to study changes in metabolism, specifically in Drosophila hemocytes. We found that hemocytes increase the expression of several carbohydrate transporters, and accordingly uptake of sugar during infection. These carbohydrates are metabolized by increased glycolysis, associated with lactate production, and cyclic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), in which glucose-6-phosphate is re-oxidized to maximize NADPH production. Oxidative PPP is required for lamellocyte differentiation and resistance, as is systemic trehalose metabolism. In addition, fully differentiated lamellocytes use a cytoplasmic form of trehalase to cleave trehalose to glucose, within the cell, to fuel cyclic PPP. Intracellular trehalose metabolism is not required for resistance, but may be associated with host protection from its own toxic response. Thus, our results suggest that sugar metabolism within immune cells, and specifically in cyclic PPP, may be important for not only fighting infection, but also for protecting the host from its own immune response and ensuring sufficient fitness of the survivor.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that cell signaling outcomes depend not only on the signal strength but also on its temporal progression. Our lab employs Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Resonance Energy Transfer (FLIM/FRET) biosensors to study intracellular signaling dynamics. We studied activation of {beta}1 receptors by Isoproterenol, which triggers cAMP signaling via the G protein Gs, using two different FLIM microscopes: a widefield frequency domain FLIM (fdFLIM) setup and a fast confocal Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) setup.\n\nWhen comparing results from each FLIM setup, unexpectedly we obtained distinctively different cAMP kinetics: fdFLIM recording of cAMP in HeLa and Cos7 cells yielded transient responses, reminiscent of rapid receptor desensitization, while TCSPC recordings exhibited sustained responses lasting over 30 minutes. We initially suspected phototoxicity due to the intense light locally in the laser focus spot in confocal microscopy to interfere with normal termination of signal transduction and set out to map photosensitive steps in the signaling cascade in detail. We find no evidence for light-sensitivity in either generation or breakdown of cAMP, but rather, our findings show that the kinetic differences are due to selective degradation of {beta}1 agonists on the fdFLIM setup. Agonist degradation appeared due to the commercial FluoroBrite medium, even though this has been specifically advertised to lower phototoxicity and reduce autofluorescence. Mass spectrometry identified Folic acid, an undisclosed constituent of FluoroBrite, as the culprit leading to artifacts in fdFLIM measurements.\n\nIn all, our study underscores the impact of subtle phototoxicity effects on experimental outcome, and it shows that in this case confocal TCSPC provides the more reliable data needed to study response kinetics.

However, it is unclear whether overexpressed BAX and BAK form the same ultrastructural assemblies following the same temporal hierarchy as endogenously expressed proteins. Combining live- and fixed-cell STED super-resolution microscopy, we show that overexpression of BAK results in novel BAK structures, which are virtually absent in non-overexpressing apoptotic cells. We further demonstrate that in wildtype cells, BAK is recruited to apoptotic pores before BAX. Both proteins together form unordered, mosaic rings on apoptotic mitochondria in immortalized cell culture models as well as in human primary cells. In BAX- or BAK-single-knockout cells, the remaining protein is able to form rings independently. The heterogeneous nature of these rings corroborates the toroidal apoptotic pore model.",

    "abstract": "Vasoinhibin is a proteolytic fragment of the hormone prolactin that inhibits blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) and permeability, stimulates the apoptosis and inflammation of endothelial cells and promotes fibrinolysis. The antiangiogenic and antivasopermeability properties of vasoinhibin were recently traced to the HGR motif located in residues 46 to 48, allowing the development of potent, orally active, HGR-containing vasoinhibin analogs for therapeutic use against angiogenesis-dependent diseases. However, whether the HGR motif is also responsible for the apoptotic, inflammatory, and fibrinolytic properties of vasoinhibin has not been addressed. Here, we report that HGR-containing analogs are devoid of these properties. Instead, the incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with oligopeptides containing the sequence HNLSSEM, corresponding to residues 30 to 36 of vasoinhibin, induced apoptosis, the nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B, the expression of genes encoding leukocyte adhesion molecules (VCAM1 and ICAM1) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, TNF), and the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes. Also, the intravenous or intra-articular injection of HNLSSEM-containing oligopeptides induced the expression of Vcam1, Icam1, Il1b, Il6, Tnf in the lung, liver, kidney, eye, and joints of mice and, like vasoinhibin, these oligopeptides promoted the lysis of plasma fibrin clots by binding to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Moreover, the inhibition of PAI-1, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, or NF-{kappa}B prevented the apoptotic and inflammatory actions. In conclusion, the functional properties of vasoinhibin are segregated into two different structural determinants. Because apoptotic, inflammatory, and fibrinolytic actions may be undesirable for antiangiogenic therapy, HGR-containing vasoinhibin analogs stand as selective and safe agents for targeting pathological angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Aging of the hematopoietic system promotes various blood, immune and systemic disorders and is largely driven by hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction (1). Autophagy is central for the benefits associated with activation of longevity signaling programs (2), and for HSC function and response to nutrient stress (3,4). With age, a subset of HSCs increases autophagy flux and preserves some regenerative capacity, while the rest fail to engage autophagy and become metabolically overactivated and dysfunctional (4). However, the signals that promote autophagy in old HSCs and the mechanisms responsible for the increased regenerative potential of autophagy-activated old HSCs remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy activation is an adaptive survival response to chronic inflammation in the aging bone marrow (BM) niche (5). We find that inflammation impairs glucose metabolism and suppresses glycolysis in aged HSCs through Socs3-mediated impairment of AKT/FoxO-dependent signaling. In this context, we show that inflammation-mediated autophagy engagement preserves functional quiescence by enabling metabolic adaptation to glycolytic impairment. Moreover, we demonstrate that transient autophagy induction via a short-term fasting/refeeding paradigm normalizes glucose uptake and glycolytic flux and significantly improves old HSC regenerative potential. Our results identify inflammation-driven glucose hypometabolism as a key driver of HSC dysfunction with age and establish autophagy as a targetable node to reset old HSC glycolytic and regenerative capacity.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAutophagy compensates for chronic inflammation-induced metabolic deregulation in old HSCs, and its transient modulation can reset old HSC glycolytic and regenerative capacity.",

    "abstract": "Timely percutaneous coronary intervention is the most effective initial therapy for the acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, the mechanism in energy metabolism underlying time-dependent coronary reperfusion remains largely unknown. Here, we generated an integrative map of cardiac cells using bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq combined with metabolomics profiling of hearts with reperfusion at distinct time points post MI in rat. We found early time reperfusion (ETR), but not late time reperfusion (LTR) reduced myocardial injury by maintaining cardiac energy homeostasis. PPAR was identified as a key regulator for maintaining fatty acid metabolism after MI/R injury. Importantly, pretreatment with FDA-approved PPAR agonist, fenofibrate, improved the transcriptional signatures, and ameliorated the function of the MI/R injured hearts, particularly in the ETR. Together, our data not only deciphered the protective effect of ETR by maintaining cardiac energy homeostasis, but also provided insights into the translational potential of PPAR activation in alleviating MI/R injury.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary disorders impact 40-80% of individuals with obesity. Respiratory muscle dysfunction is linked to these conditions; however, its pathophysiology remains largely undefined. Mice subjected to diet-induced obesity (DIO) develop diaphragmatic weakness. Increased intra-diaphragmatic adiposity and extracellular matrix (ECM) content correlate with reductions in contractile force. Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) is an obesity-associated matricellular protein linked with muscular damage in genetic myopathies. THBS1 induces proliferation of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)--mesenchymal cells that differentiate into adipocytes and fibroblasts. We hypothesized that THBS1 drives FAP-mediated diaphragm remodeling and contractile dysfunction in DIO. We tested this by comparing effects of dietary challenge on diaphragms of wild-type (WT) and Thbs1 knockout (Thbs1-/-) mice. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated DIO-induced stromal expansion in WT diaphragms. Diaphragm FAPs displayed upregulation of ECM and TGF{beta}-related expression signatures, and augmentation of a Thy1-expressing sub-population previously linked to type 2 diabetes. Despite similar weight gain, Thbs1-/- mice were protected from these transcriptomic changes, and from obesity-induced increases in diaphragm adiposity and ECM deposition. Unlike WT controls, Thbs1-/-diaphragms maintained normal contractile force and motion after DIO challenge. These findings establish THBS1 as a necessary mediator of diaphragm stromal remodeling and contractile dysfunction in overnutrition, and potential therapeutic target in obesity-associated respiratory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "By preserving progenitor characteristics, cell culture on soft hydrogel represents a practical tool in regenerative medicine compared with conventional rigid plastic. However, the mechanism by which the mechanical microenvironment determines progenitor phenotype, and its relevance to human biology, remain poorly described. Thanks to an innovation enabling the generation of uniform multi-well hydrogels, we show that 2D culture on mechanomimetic supports leads to an atypical S-phase quiescence and prevents cell drift, while preserving the differentiation capacities of human bronchoepithelial cells. Mechanistically, defects in proteostasis and basal endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) underlie the quiescent phenotype and resistance to ERS-induced apoptosis by metabolic stress. Furthermore, analysis of available single cell data of the human lung confirmed that these molecular features are consistent with those of pulmonary basal cells. Overall, this study demonstrates that mechanomimetic supports are relevant devices for characterizing novel molecular events that govern progenitor biology in human tissues.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) are small second messenger molecules produced by the type III CRISPR-Cas system as part of the prokaryotic immune response. The role of cOAs is to allosterically activate downstream effector proteins that induce dormancy or cell death, and thus abort viral spread through the population. Interestingly, different type III systems have been reported to utilize different cOA stoichiometries (with 3 to 6 adenylate monophosphates). However, so far, their characterization has only been possible in bulk and with sophisticated equipment, while a portable assay with single-molecule resolution has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate the label-free detection of single cOA molecules using a simple protein nanopore assay. It sensitively identifies the stoichiometry of individual cOA molecules and their mixtures from synthetic and enzymatic origin. To achieve this, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) and validated it with a series of experiments on mono- and polydisperse cOA samples. Ultimately, we determined the stoichiometric composition of cOAs produced enzymatically by the CRISPR type III-A and III-B variants of Thermus thermophilus. Interestingly, both variants produce cOAs of nearly identical composition, and we discuss the biological implications of this finding. The presented nanopore-CNN workflow with single-cOA resolution can be adapted to many other signaling molecules (including eukaryotic ones), and it may be integrated into portable handheld devices with potential point-of-care applications.",

    "abstract": "Despite the well-known importance of a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in biological research, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and students from non-traditional academic backgrounds remain underrepresented in the composition of university faculty. Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint graduate student advising as a critical component of this leaky pipeline. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers.\n\nSignificanceGraduate students from minority backgrounds are less likely to receive effective mentorship from their advisors, and perhaps consequentially, complete their degree programs and aspire to scientific careers at lower rates than their peers. This is likely due in part to a lack of mentorship training on the part of their advisors. The data from our study highlight mentoring practices associated with graduate student outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Specifically, we identify meeting frequency, faculty diversity, and peer support as attributes that positively predict graduate student productivity and well-being in the biological sciences.",

    "abstract": "The post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitination is a highly regulated process that involves a dynamic, three-step enzymatic cascade, where more than 600 E3 ligases play a critical role in recognizing specific substrates for modification. Separating bona fide targets of E3s from E3-interacting proteins remains a major challenge in the field. In this study, we present BioE3, a novel approach for identifying substrates of ubiquitin-like (UbL) E3 ligases of interest. Using BirA-E3 ligase fusion proteins and bioUbLs, the method facilitates site-specific biotinylation of UbL-modified substrates of particular E3s for proteomic identification. We demonstrate that the BioE3 system can identify both known and novel targets of two RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligases: RNF4, known to be involved in DNA damage response and the regulation of PML nuclear bodies, and MIB1, implicated in endocytosis, autophagy, and centrosomal protein homeostasis. We further show the versatility of BioE3 by identifying targets of an organelle-specific E3 (MARCH5) and a relatively uncharacterized E3 (RNF214). Furthermore, we show that BioE3 works with HECT-type E3 ligases and identify novel targets of NEDD4 involved in vesicular trafficking. BioE3 is a powerful tool that enables identification of bona fide substrates of UbL E3 ligases and how they change with chemical perturbations. BioE3 may also be applicable for UbLs beyond Ub and SUMO, as well as other E3 ligase classes. The resulting knowledge can shed light on the regulation of cellular processes by the complex UbL network and provide information useful for strategies such as targeted protein degradation (TPD), advancing our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and their applications.",

    "abstract": "The uterine epithelium is composed of a single layer of hormone responsive polarized epithelial cells that line the lumen and form tubular glands. Endometrial epithelial organoids (EEO) can be generated from uterine epithelia and recapitulate cell composition and hormone responses in vitro. As such, the development of EEO represents a major advance for facilitating mechanistic studies in vitro. However, a major limitation for the use of EEO cultured in basement membrane extract and other hydrogels is the inner location of apical membrane, thereby hindering direct access to the apical surface of the epithelium to study interactions with the embryo or infectious agents such as viruses and bacteria. Here, a straightforward strategy was developed that successfully reverses the polarity of EEO. The result is an apical-out organoid that preserves a distinct apical-basolateral orientation and remains responsive to ovarian steroid hormones. Our investigations highlight the utility of polarity-reversed EEO to study interactions with E. coli and blastocysts. This method of generating apical-out EEO lays the foundation for developing new in vitro functional assays, particularly regarding epithelial interactions with embryos during pregnancy or other luminal constituents in a pathological or diseased state.",

Unraveling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge. Here, we comprehensively mapped genetic interactions for all core DDR genes using combinatorial CRISPRi screening. We discovered myriad new connections, including interactions between cancer genes and small molecule targets. We focused on two of the strongest interactions: FEN1/LIG1:WDR48 and FANCM:SMARCAL1. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain overactive translesion synthesis in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells, and that a preclinical inhibitor of USP1 specifically kills FEN1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM suppress DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation at TA-rich repeats in late replicating regions that otherwise escape into mitosis and cause nuclear fragmentation. We present fundamental insights into genome maintenance processes and our dataset provides a springboard for mechanistic investigations into connections between DDR factors and suggests multiple interactions that could be exploited in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of peripheral blood neutrophils at sites of inflammation involves a multistep cascade, starting with E- and P-selectin expressed on the inflamed vascular endothelium binding sialofucosylated glycans on leukocytes. As the glycoconjugate biosynthesis pathways in different cells are distinct, the precise carbohydrate ligands of selectins varies both across species, and between different immune cell populations in a given species. To study this aspect in human neutrophils, we developed a protocol to perform CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing on CD34+ hHSCs (human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells) as they are differentiated towards neutrophil lineage. This protocol initially uses a cocktail of SCF (stem-cell factor), IL-3 (interleukin-3) and FLT-3L (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand) to expand the stem/progenitor cells followed by directed differentiation to neutrophils using G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). Microfluidics based assays were performed on a confocal microscope platform to characterize the rolling phenotype of each edited cell type in mixed populations. These studies demonstrated that CD44, but not CD43, is a major E-selectin ligand on human neutrophils. The loss of function results were validated by developing sialofucosylated recombinant CD44. This glycosylated protein supported both robust E-selectin binding in a cell-free assay, and it competitively blocked neutrophil adhesion to E-selectin on inflamed endothelial cells. Together, the study establishes important methods to study human neutrophil biology and determines that sialoflucosylated-CD44 is a physiological human E-selectin ligand.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIA CRISPR-Cas9 based protocol was optimized to knockout genes in primary human neutrophils derived from CD34+ hHSCs\nC_LIO_LIUnder physiological fluid shear conditions, a sialofucosylated form of CD44 expressed on human neutrophils is a major E-selectin ligand\nC_LI\n\nVISUAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/553923v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1891653org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118e074org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@38052aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db0882_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Differences in dietary fatty acid saturation impact glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in vertebrates. Excess dietary intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induces glucose intolerance and metabolic disorders. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) elicit beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. However, it remains elusive how SFAs and UFAs signal differentially toward insulin signaling to influence glucose homeostasis. Here, using a croaker model, we report that dietary palmitic acid (PA), but not oleic acid or linoleic acid, leads to dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling which provokes systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, using croaker primary myocytes, mouse C2C12 myotubes and HEK293T cells, we show that PA-induced mTORC1 activation is dependent on mitochondrial fatty acid {beta} oxidation. Notably, PA profoundly elevates acetyl-CoA derived from mitochondrial fatty acid {beta} oxidation which intensifies Tip60-mediated Rheb acetylation. Subsequently, the induction of Rheb acetylation facilitates hyperactivation of mTORC1 which enhances serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and simultaneously inhibits transcription of IRS1 through impeding TFEB nuclear translocation, leading to impairment of insulin signaling. Furthermore, targeted abrogation of acetyl-CoA produced from fatty acid {beta} oxidation or Tip60-mediated Rheb acetylation by pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown rescues PA-induced insulin resistance. Collectively, this study reveals a conserved acetylation-dependent mechanistic insight for understanding the link between fatty acids and insulin resistance, which may provide a potential therapeutic avenue to intervene in the development of T2D.",

    "abstract": "Heart valve tissue engineering holds the potential to transform the surgical management of congenital heart defects affecting the pediatric pulmonary valve (PV) by offering a viable valve replacement with the compositional, architectural and mechanical properties required to function in situ. While aiming to recapitulate the native valve, the minimum requirement for tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs) has historically been adequate mechanical function at implantation. However, long-term in situ functionality of TEHVs remains elusive, suggesting that a closer approximation of the native valve is required. The realization of biomimetic engineered pediatric PV is impeded by insufficient characterization of healthy pediatric tissue. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the planar biaxial tensile behaviour, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and organization, and valvular interstitial cell (VIC) phenotypes of PVs from piglets to provide benchmarks for TEHVs. The piglet PV possessed an anisotropic and non-linear tension-strain profile from which material constants for a predictive constitutive model were derived. Further, the ECM of the pediatric PV possessed a trilayer organization populated by collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and elastin. Biochemical quantification of ECM proteins normalized to wet weight and DNA content of PV tissue revealed homogenous distribution of proteins across sampled regions of the leaflet. Finally, the predominant phenotype of VICs in the piglet PV was quiescent vimentin-expressing fibroblasts, with a small proportion of activated -smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts residing primarily at the base of the leaflet. Overall, the properties characterized in this study can be used to inform TEHV design parameters towards generation of biomimetic pediatric PVs.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/553926v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bff7d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1272b90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d1b54org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d3a93_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesEnlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) have been previously reported in Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL), but their significance and pathophysiology remains unclear. We investigated associations of ePVS with classical imaging measures, cognitive measures and plasma proteins to better understand what ePVS represents in CADASIL and whether radiographic measures of ePVS would be of value in future therapeutic discovery studies for CADASIL.\n\nMethods24 individuals with CADASIL and 24 age and sex matched controls were included. Disease status was determined based on presence of NOTCH3 mutation. Brain imaging measures of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), ePVS volumes, clinical, and cognitive measures, as well as plasma proteomics were used in models. Global ePVS volumes were calculated via a novel, semi-automated pipeline and levels of 7363 proteins were quantified in plasma using the SomaScan assay. The relationship of ePVS with global burden of WMH, brain atrophy, functional status, neurocognitive measures, and plasma proteins were modelled with linear regression models.\n\nResultsCADASIL and control groups did not exhibit differences in mean ePVS volumes. However, increased ePVS volumes in CADASIL were associated with increased WMH volume ({beta}=0.57, p=0.05), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum-of-Boxes score ({beta}=0.49, p=0.04), and decreased brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) ({beta}=-0.03, p=0.10). In interaction term models, the interaction term between CADASIL disease status and ePVS volume was associated with increased WMH volume ({beta}=0.57, p=0.02), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum-of-Boxes score ({beta}=0.52, p=0.02), decreased BPF ({beta}=-0.03, p=0.07) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ({beta}=-1.49, p=0.03). Proteins positively associated with ePVS volumes were found to be related to leukocyte migration and inflammation, while negatively associated proteins were related to lipid metabolism. Two central hub proteins were identified in protein networks associated with ePVS volumes: CXCL8/IL-8, and CCL2/MCP-1. The levels of CXCL8/IL8 were also associated with increased WMH volume ({beta}=2.44, p < 0.01), and levels of CCL2/MCP-1 were further associated with decreased BPF ({beta}=-0.0007, p < 0.01), MMSE score ({beta}=-0.02, p < 0.01), and increased Trail Making Test B (TRAILB) completion time ({beta}=0.76, p < 0.01). No protein was associated with all 3 studied imaging measures of pathology (BPF,ePVS,WMH).\n\nDiscussionBased on associations uncovered between ePVS volumes and cognitive functions, imaging and plasma proteins, we conclude that ePVS volumes capture pathologies contributing to chronic brain dysfunction and degeneration in CADASIL, with relevance to future clinical trials for novel therapeutic discoveries to prevent decline and injury in individuals carrying NOTCH3 mutations.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe aimed to generate and phenotype a mouse model of FHONDA (Foveal Hypoplasia, Optic Nerve Decussation Defects, and Anterior Segment Dysgenesis), a rare disease associated with mutations in SLC38A8 that causes severe visual alterations similar to albinism without affecting pigmentation.\n\nMethodsThe FHONDA mouse model was generated with CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 technology using an RNA guide targeting the Scl38a8 murine locus. The resulting mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J. Melanin content was measured using spectrophotometry. Retinal cell architecture was analyzed through light and electron microscopy. Retinal projections to the brain were evaluated with anterograde labelling in embryos and adults. Visual function was assessed by electroretinography (ERG) and the optomotor test (OT).\n\nResultsFrom numerous Slc38a8 mouse mutant alleles generated, we selected one that encodes a truncated protein (p.196Pro*, equivalent to p.199Pro* in the human protein) closely resembling a mutant allele described in patients (p.200Gln*). Slc38a8 mutant mice exhibit wild-type eye and coat pigmentation with comparable melanin contents. Subcellular abnormalities were observed in retinal pigment epithelium cells of Slc38a8 mutant mice. Anterograde labelling experiments of retinal projections in embryos and adults showed a reduction of ipsilateral fibers. Functional visual analyses revealed a decreased ERG response in scotopic conditions and a reduction of visual acuity in mutant mice measured by OT.\n\nConclusionsSlc38a8 mutant mice recapitulate the phenotype of FHONDA patients concerning their normal pigmentation and their abnormal visual system, as observed in all types of albinism. These mice will be helpful in better understanding the pathophysiology of this genetic condition.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has significantly benefited patients with several types of solid tumors and some lymphomas. However, many of the treated patients do not have durable clinical response. It has been demonstrated that rescuing exhausted CD8+ T cells is required for ICB-mediated antitumor effects. We recently developed an immunostimulatory strategy based on silencing STAT3 while stimulating immune responses by CpG, ligand for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). The CpG-small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugates efficiently enter immune cells, silencing STAT3 and activating innate immunity to enhance T-cell mediated antitumor immune responses. In the present study, we demonstrate that blocking STAT3 through locally delivered CpG-Stat3 siRNA enhances the efficacies of the systemic PD-1 and CTLA4 blockade against mouse A20 B cell lymphoma. In addition, locally delivered CpG-Stat3 siRNA combined with systemic administration of PD-1 antibody significantly augmented both local and systemic antitumor effects against mouse B16 melanoma tumors, with enhanced tumor-associated T cell activation. Overall, our studies in both B cell lymphoma and melanoma mouse models demonstrate the potential of combinatory immunotherapy with CpG-Stat3 siRNA and checkpoint inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for B cell lymphoma and melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Timely regulation of carbon metabolic pathways is essential for cellular processes and to prevent futile cycling of intracellular metabolites. In Halobacterium salinarum, a hypersaline adapted archaeon, a sugar-sensing TrmB family protein controls gluconeogenesis and other biosynthetic pathways. Notably, Hbt. salinarum does not utilize carbohydrates for energy, uncommon among Haloarchaea. We characterized a TrmB-family transcriptional regulator in a saccharolytic generalist, Haloarcula hispanica, to investigate whether the targets and function of TrmB, or its regulon, is conserved in related species with distinct metabolic capabilities. In Har. hispanica, TrmB binds to 15 sites across the genome and induces the expression of genes primarily involved in gluconeogenesis and tryptophan biosynthesis. An important regulatory control point in Hbt. salinarum, activation of ppsA and repression of pykA, is absent in Har. hispanica. Contrary to its role in Hbt. salinarum and saccharolytic hyperthermophiles, TrmB does not act as a global regulator: it does not directly repress the expression of glycolytic enzymes, peripheral pathways such as cofactor biosynthesis, or catabolism of other carbon sources in Har. hispanica. Cumulatively, these findings suggest re-wiring of the TrmB regulon alongside metabolic network evolution in Haloarchaea.",

    "abstract": "Protein knock-down with an inducible degradation system is a powerful tool to study proteins of interest in living cells. Here, we adopted the auxin-inducible degron (AID) approach to detail Kaposis Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) function in latency maintenance and inducible viral lytic gene expression. We fused the mini-AID (mAID) tag at the LANA N-terminus with KSHV BAC16 recombination, and iSLK cells were stably infected with the recombinant KSHV encoding mAID-LANA. Incubation with 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid (5-Ph-IAA), a derivative of natural auxin, rapidly degraded LANA within 1.5 h. In contrast to our hypothesis, depletion of LANA did not trigger lytic reactivation but rather decreased inducible lytic gene expression when we stimulated reactivation with a combination of ORF50 protein expression and sodium butyrate treatment. Decreased overall lytic gene induction seemed to associate with a rapid loss of KSHV genomes in the absence of LANA. The rapid loss of viral genomic DNA was blocked by treatment with lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cellular innate immune proteins, cyclic AMP-GMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), and other autophagy-related genes rescued the degradation of viral genomic DNA upon LANA depletion. These results suggest that LANA is actively protecting viral genomic DNA from sensing by cGAS-STING signaling axis, and add novel insights into the role of LANA in latency maintenance.",

The variety of the detected rRNA gene sequences reflects the diversity of the microorganisms existing in the analyzed sample. Their biomass also can be estimated by applying quantitative sequencing with the information of rRNA gene copy numbers in genomes, however, the information on rRNA gene copy number is still limited. Especially, the copy number in microbial eukaryotes is much less understood than that of prokaryotes, possibly because of the large and complex structure of eukaryotic genomes. In this communication, we report an alternative approach that is more appropriate from the existing method of quantitative sequencing and demonstrate that the copy number of eukaryotic rRNA can be measured efficiently and comprehensively. By applying this approach widely, information on the eukaryotic rRNA copy number can be determined, and their community structures can be depicted and compared more efficiently.",

One potential candidate isolated from this effort is the anti-lipogenic gene adipose (adp). Adp has an established role in the negative regulation of lipogenesis in the fat body of the fly and adipose tissue in mammals. While fat is key to proper development in general, adp has not been investigated during brain development. Here we found that RNAi knockdown of adp in neuronal stem cells and neurons results in reduced brain lobe volume and sought to replicate this with a mutant fly. We generated a novel adp mutant that acts as a loss-of-function mutant based on buoyancy assay results. We found that despite a change in fat content in the body overall and an increase in the number of larger (>5m) brain lipid droplets, there was no change in the brain lobe volume of mutant larvae. Overall, our work describes a novel adp mutant that can functionally replace the long-standing adp60 mutant and shows that the adp gene has no obvious involvement in brain growth.",

    "abstract": "Plant intracellular immune receptors, primarily nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), can detect virulence proteins (effectors) from pathogens and activate NLR-triggered immunity (NTI). Recently,  sensor NLRs have been reported to function with  helper NLRs to activate immune responses. We investigated the role of two helper NLRs, Nrc2 (NLR required for cell death 2) and Nrc3, on immunity in tomato to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) mediated by the sensor NLR Prf and the Pto kinase. Loss-of-function mutations in both Nrc2 and Nrc3 completely compromised Prf/Pto-mediated NTI to Pst containing the cognate effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. An nrc3 mutant showed intermediate susceptibility between wild-type tomato plants and a Prf mutant, while an nrc2 mutant developed only mild disease symptoms. These observations indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act additively to contribute to Prf/Pto-mediated immunity. We also examined at what point Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in the Prf/Pto-mediated immune response. In the nrc2/3 mutant, programmed cell death (PCD) normally induced by constitutively-active variants of AvrPtoB, Pto or Prf was abolished, but that induced by M3K or Mkk2 was not. PCD induced by a constitutively active variant of Nrc3 was also abolished in a Nicotiana benthamiana line with reduced expression of Prf. MAPK activation triggered by expression of AvrPto in the wild-type Pto-expressing tomato plants was completely abolished in the nrc2/3 mutant. These results indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in concert with Prf/Pto and upstream of MAPK signaling. Nrc2 and Nrc3 were not required for the HR triggered by Ptr1, another sensor NLR mediating Pst resistance, although these helper NLRs do appear to be involved in resistance to certain Pst race 1 strains.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian tongue is richly innervated with somatosensory, gustatory and motor fibers. These form the basis of many ethologically important functions such as eating, speaking and social grooming. Despite its high tactile acuity and sensitivity, the neural basis of tongue mechanosensation remains largely mysterious. Here we explored the organization of mechanosensory afferents in the tongue and found that each lingual papilla is innervated by Piezo2+ trigeminal neurons. Notably, each fungiform papilla contained highly specialized ring-like sensory neuron terminations that circumscribe the taste buds. Myelinated lingual afferents in the mouse lingual papillae did not form corpuscular sensory end organs but rather had only free nerve endings. In vivo single-unit recordings from the trigeminal ganglion revealed two types of lingual low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) with conduction velocities in the A{delta} range or above and distinct response properties: intermediately adapting (IA) units and rapidly adapting (RA) units. IA units were sensitive to static indentation and stroking, while RA units had a preference for tangential forces applied by stroking. Lingual LTMRs were not directly responsive to rapid cooling or chemicals that can induce astringent or numbing sensations. Genetic labeling of lingual afferents in the tongue revealed at least two types of nerve terminal patterns, involving dense innervation of individual fungiform papillae by multiple putatively distinct afferents, and relatively sparse innervation of filiform papillae. Together, our results indicate that fungiform papillae are mechanosensory structures, while suggesting a simple model that links the functional and anatomical properties of tactile sensory neurons in the tongue.",

It remains unclear if these maps are a consequence of feed-forward input from the retina or local computations in the colliculus. To determine whether these maps originate in the retina, we mapped the local and global distribution of orientation- and direction-selective retinal ganglion cell boutons using in-vivo two-photon calcium imaging. We found that OS boutons formed patches that matched the distribution of OS neurons within the colliculus. DS boutons displayed less regional specializations, better reflecting the organization of DS neurons in the retina. Both eyes convey similar orientation but different DS inputs to the colliculus, as shown in recordings from retinal explants. These data demonstrate that orientation and direction maps within the colliculus are independent, implying that orientation maps are inherited from the retina, but direction maps require local circuits.",

In ticks, the innate immune system is crucial in the outcome between vector-pathogen interaction and overall vector competence.

Here, we show that granulocytes, professional phagocytic cells, are integral in eliciting immune responses against commensal and pathogen infection. The chemical depletion of granulocytes led to decreased phagocytic efficiency of tissues-associated hemocytes. We demonstrate E. chaffeensis can infect circulating hemocytes, and both cell-free plasma and hemocytes from E. chaffeensis-infected ticks can establish Ehrlichia infection in recipient ticks. Lastly, we provide evidence to show granulocytes play a dual role in E. chaffeensis infection. Depleting granulocytic hemocytes increased Ehrlichia load in the salivary gland and midgut tissues. In contrast, granulocyte depletion led to a reduced systemic load of Ehrlichia. This study has identified multiple roles for granulocytic hemocytes in the control and systemic dissemination of E. chaffeensis infection.",

Despite its importance, few studies have determined how the size of organelles or other structures is maintained during tissue growth, when cells are growing, dividing, and rearranging. The developing egg chamber is a powerful model in which to study the relative growth rates of subcellular structures. The egg chamber contains a cluster of sixteen germ cells, which are connected through intercellular bridges called ring canals. Ring canals are formed following incomplete cytokinesis after each of four germ cell divisions. As the egg chamber grows, the nurse cells and the ring canals that connect them increase in size. Here, we demonstrate that ring canal size scaling is related to their lineage; the largest, \"first born\" ring canals grow at a relatively slower rate than ring canals derived from subsequent mitotic divisions. This lineage-based scaling relationship is maintained even if directed transport is reduced, ring canal size is altered, or if the germ cells go through an additional mitotic division. Further, we propose that changes in ring canal scaling could provide a mechanism to alter egg size.",

    "abstract": "Identification of tandem repeat (TR) variations plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of genetic diseases, forensic analysis, evolutionary studies, and crop improvement, thereby contributing to various fields of research and practical applications. However, traditional TR identification methods are often limited to processing genomes obtained through sequence assembly and cannot directly start detection from sequencing reads. Furthermore, the inflexibility of detection mode and parameters hinders the accuracy and completeness of the identification, rendering the results unsatisfactory. These shortcomings result in existing TR variation identification methods being associated with high computational cost, limited detection sensitivity, precision and comprehensiveness. Here, we propose DeepTRs, a novel method for identifying TR variations, which enables direct TR variation identification from raw Nanopore sequencing reads and achieves high sensitivity, accuracy, and completeness results through the multi-modal conversion of Nanopore reads alignment and deep learning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepTRs outperform existing methods.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of long chain non coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG16) on paclitaxel (PTX) resistance in breast cancer and to understand its underlying mechanism, to lay a foundation for decreasing the PTX resistance in breast cancer treatment and improving the therapeutic quality for breast cancer patients.\n\nMethodsPTX was used to induce the establishment of PTX resistant breast cancer cell lines; the control group (normal cultured MCF-7/PTX cells), si-NC group, si-SNHG16 group, si-SNHG16+anti miR-NC group, and si-SNHG16 +anti-Let-7a-5p group were set to compared the effect of SNHG16 on the PTX resistance in MCF-7 cells; MTT assay, Flow cytometry, and Transwell invasion assay were used to determine the PTX resistance, apoptosis, and invasion ability of MCF-7 cells in different groups, respectively; for further assess the effect of SNHG16 on the PTX resistance, nude mouse tumor transplantation experiment was used; and the potential mechanism of SNHG16 regulated the PTX resistance in MCF-7 cells was explored by double luciferase reporter gene detection method and gene silencing technology.\n\nResultsThe expression of SNHG16 gene and DUSP7 protein in MCF-7 cell line was the highest, and the expression of Let-7a-5p was the lowest compared with the various breast cancer cell lines (human breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A and human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453) (P<0.05); PTX could increase the expression of SNHG16 gene and DUSP7 protein, and reduce the expression of Let-7a-5pin MCF-7 cell line (P<0.05); the results of cell experiment and nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment demonstrated that inhibiting the expression of SNHG16 gene could reduce the invasive ability and promote cell apoptosis of MCF-7/PTX cells (P<0.05), and inhibit tumor growth and reduce the PTX resistance in breast cancer transplantation models; simultaneous inhibition of Let-7a-5p and SNHG16 had a weakening effect in MCF-7/PTX cells (P<0.05). Double luciferase reporter gene detection and gene silencing technology demonstrated that inhibiting SNHG16 gene expression could increase the expression of Let-7a-5p and decrease the expression of DUSP7 (P<0.05); inhibiting the Let-7a-5p gene could increase the expression of DUSP7.\n\nConclusionsInhibiting SNHG16 gene could upregulate Let-7a-5p expression and downregulate the expression of DUSP7 to inhibit MCF-7 cell invasion, promote MCF-7 cell apoptosis, and reduce the PTX resistance in MCF-7 cells and nude mouse tumor transplantation models, those data demonstrated that SNHG16-Let-7a-5p-DUSP7 axis maybe a potential therapeutic strategy for decreasing the PTX resistance in breast cancer in the future.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant global public health concern. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and declined renal function. PM2.5 exerts its harmful effects on various organs through oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) involves similar biological processes involved in PM2.5 toxicity and is a known risk factor for CKD. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on IRI-induced AKI. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 or filtered air for 12 weeks before IRI, and were euthanized 48h after IRI. Animals exposed to PM2.5 and IRI exhibited reduced glomerular filtration and impaired urine concentration ability. Moreover, they showed elevated tubular damage markers NGAL and KIM-1, along with significant tubular necrosis. PM2.5 exposure exacerbated local innate immune activation, leading to an increased infiltration of Ly6G+ granulocytes and F480+ macrophages in the kidney. This, in turn, contributed to heightened renal senescence markers and myofibroblast infiltration. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKI-induced hampered tubular function is worsened by PM2.5, leading to reduced resilience to stress, activation of aging mechanisms and early hallmarks of fibrosis. Decreasing PM2.5 and implementing preventive strategies can improve AKI patients outcome and prevent AKI progression.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the mechanisms by which non-encapsulated heme, released in the plasma of mice post exposure to chlorine (Cl2) gas, resulted in the initiation and propagation of acute lung injury. We exposed adult C57BL/6 male and female to Cl2 (500 ppm for 30 min) in environmental chambers and returned them to room air and injected them intramuscularly with a single dose of human hemopexin (hHPX; 5 {micro}g/ g BW), the most efficient scavenger of heme, 30-60 min post exposure. Concentrations of hHPX in plasma of air and Cl2 exposed mice were 9081{+/-}900 vs. 1879{+/-} 293 at 6 h and 2966{+/-}463 vs. 1555{+/-}250 at 50 h post injection (ng/ml; X{+/-}1 SEM=3; p<0.01). Cl2 exposed mice developed progressive acute lung injury post exposure characterized by increased concentrations of plasma heme, marked inflammatory response, respiratory acidosis and increased concentrations of plasma proteins in the alveolar space. Injection of hHPX decreased the onset of acute lung injury at 24 h post exposure; mean survival, for the saline and hHPX groups were 40 vs. 80% (P<0.001) at 15 d post exposure. Non-supervised global proteomics analysis of mouse lungs at 24 h post exposure, revealed the upregulation of 92 and downregulation of 145 lung proteins. Injection of hHPX at one h post exposure moderated the Cl2 induced changes in eighty-three of these 237 lung proteins. System biology analysis of the global proteomics data showed that hHPX reversed changes in mitochondrial dysfunction and elF2 and integrin signaling. Western blot analysis of lung tissue showed significant increase of phosphorylated elF2 at 24 h post exposure in vehicle treated mice but normal levels in those injected with hHPX. Similarly, RT-PCR analysis of lung tissue showed that hHPX reversed the onset of mtDNA lesions. A form of recombinant human hemopexin generated in tobacco plants was equally effective in reversing acute lung and mtDNA injury. The results of this study offer new insights as to the mechanisms by which exposure to Cl2 results in acute lung injury and to the therapeutic effects of hemopexin.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular peptides largely remains unknown. RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we unveil a crucial connection between the demethylation machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide homogalacturonan, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with PECTIN METHYL ESTERASEs (PMEs) abolishes RALF1 perception. Similarly, the application of free demethylated oligogalacturonides in the medium also reduces RALF1 activity. Accordingly, we conclude that RALF1 requires demethylated pectin to signal at the cell surface. We propose that demethylated and hence negatively charged pectin acts as a signalling scaffold for the positively charged RALF peptides, defining its output signalling. This mode of RALF peptide hormone signalling could shed light on a broader plant developmental context, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to hormone-mediated responses.",

    "abstract": "Gene variants that hyperactivate PI3K-mTOR signaling in the brain lead to epilepsy and cortical malformations in humans. Some gene variants associated with these pathologies only hyperactivate mTORC1, but others, such as PTEN, PIC3CA, and AKT, hyperactivate both mTORC1- and mTORC2-dependent signaling. Previous work has established a key role for mTORC1 hyperactivity in mTORopathies, however, whether mTORC2 hyperactivity contributes is not clear. To test this, we inactivated mTORC1 and/or mTORC2 downstream of early Pten deletion in a new model of somatic Pten LOF in the cortex. Spontaneous seizures and epileptiform activity persisted despite mTORC1 or mTORC2 inactivation alone, but inactivating both mTORC1 and mTORC2 normalized pathology. These results suggest that hyperactivity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are sufficient to cause epilepsy, and that targeted therapies should aim to reduce activity of both complexes.",

    "abstract": "Non-neuronal cells constitute 90-95% of sensory ganglia. These cells play critical roles in modulation of nociceptive signal transmissions by sensory neurons. Accordingly, the aim of this review-study was to identify, profile and summarize TG non-neuronal cell types in naive male mice using published and our own data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). TG contains 5 types of non-neuronal cells: glial, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, endothelial and immune cells. There is agreement among publications for glial, fibroblasts, smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Based on gene profiles, glial cells were classified as Schwann cells and satellite glial cells (SGC). Mpz had dominant expression in Schwann cells, and Fabp7 is specific for SCG. Two types of Col1a2+ fibroblasts located throughout TG were distinguished using gene profiles. TG smooth muscle and endothelial cells representing blood vessels were detected with well recognized markers. Our study split reported single TG immune cell group into 3 types of macrophages and 4 types of neutrophils. Macrophages were located among neuronal bodies and nerve fibers, and were sub-grouped by unique transcriptomic profiles and using Ccr2, Cx3cr1 and Iba1 as markers. S100a8+ neutrophils were located in dura surrounding TG and were sub-grouped by clustering and expressions of Csf3r, Ly6G, Ngp, Elane and Mpo. Overall, generated and summarized here dataset on non-neuronal TG cells could provide essential and fundamental information for studies on cell plasticity, interactomic network between neurons and non-neuronal cells and function during variety of pain conditions in the head and neck region.",

While each single mutation rescued the motility of CAPS/unc-31 and synaptotagmin/snt-1 mutants significantly, double mutations unexpectedly worsened motility or lost their rescuing effects. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that simultaneous mutations of open syntaxin and gain-of-function P334A UNC-18 induces a strong imbalance of excitatory over inhibitory transmission. We conclude that open syntaxin and P334A UNC-18 do not have additive beneficial effects on C. elegans characteristics such as motility, growth, offspring bared, body size, and exocytosis.

    "abstract": "An intricate meshwork of trabeculations lines the luminal side of cardiac ventricles. Compaction, a developmental process, is thought to reduce trabeculations by adding them to the neighboring compact wall which is then enlarged. When pig, a plausible cardiac donor for xenotransplantation, is compared to human, the ventricular walls appear to have fewer trabeculations. We hypothesized the trabecular volume is proportionally smaller in pig than in human. Macroscopically, we observed in sixteen pig hearts that the ventricular walls harbor few but large trabeculations. Close inspection revealed a high number of tiny trabeculations, a few hundred, within the recesses of the large trabeculations. While tiny, these were still larger than embryonic trabeculations and even when considering their number, the total tally of trabeculations in pig was much fewer than in human. Volumetrics based on high-resolution MRI of additional six pig hearts compared to six human hearts, revealed the left ventricles were not significantly differently trabeculated (21.5 versus 22.8%, respectively), and the porcine right ventricles were only slightly less trabeculated (42.1 versus 49.3%, respectively). We then analyzed volumetrically ten pig embryonic hearts from gestational day 14 to 35. The trabecular and compact layer always grew, as did the intertrabecular recesses, in contrast to what compaction predicts. The proportions of the trabecular and compact layers changed substantially, nonetheless, due to differences in their growth rate rather than compaction. In conclusion, processes that affect the trabecular morphology do not necessarily affect the proportion of trabecular-to-compact myocardium and they are then distinct from compaction.",

    "abstract": "Ranavirus disease, caused by viruses within the genus Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae), is considered a globally emerging infectious disease linked to mass mortality events in both wild and cultured ectothermic vertebrates. Surveillance work is however limited in Asia hence prevalence and the dynamics of the disease remains poorly understood. To understand disease burden and the potential biotic and abiotic drivers in southern China region, we conducted a systematic surveillance of the ranavirus across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region (GAR). For this, we used a multifaceted approach involving screening of amphibians and other potential reservoirs, diagnostic tests, phylogenetic analyses, prevalence estimation, co-infection assessments, and climatic niche analyses. Over one thousand individuals were sampled across 25 sampling sites. We found ninety-two individuals from 18 species of ectothermic vertebrates to be infected with ranavirus. Two lineages were responsible - Rana nigromaculata ranavirus and Tiger frog virus were identified using phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP) gene fragment. We also found evidence of a co-infection with ranavirus and Bd that can be highly detrimental to host populations; possibly the first such documentation in Asia. Our niche modelling analysis suggests that precipitation and seasonality play an important role in ranavirus prevalence in Guangxi region - southwestern, southeastern, central and northeastern regions of GAR can be considered to be optimum habitats for ranaviruses. Infection rates in wild frog species have reached 100% in some areas, even in nature reserves. Our research also indicates that culture facilities and pet farms are frequently infected, serving as likely vectors for the regional and global spread of ranaviruses. The knowledge generated suggests the need for systematic surveillance, stringent biosecurity measures, and control of international animal trade to prevent further transmission and protection of biodiversity and aquaculture industries across Asia.",

    "abstract": "Broodiness is one of the important factors affecting poultry egg production, with the black-bone Silky (Gallus gallus domesticus Brisson) exhibiting strong broodiness behavior. Changes in ovarian signaling can offer insights into the mechanisms influencing broodiness. However, research comparing the characteristics of long non- coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the ovaries during the broody chickens (BC) and high egg- laying chickens (GC) groups of poultry is still limited. In this study, we employed RNA-seq to analyze the ovarian transcriptomes (lncRNAs and mRNAs) of eight brooding and high egg-laying Taihe Black-Bone Silky Fowls (TBsf). We identified a total of 16,444 mRNAs and 18,756 lncRNAs, among which 349 mRNAs and 651 lncRNAs (P < 0.05) showed significantly different expression (DE) between the BC and GC groups. Additionally, we identified the cis-regulated and trans-regulated target genes of differentially abundant lncRNA transcripts and constructed an lncRNA- mRNA trans-regulated interaction network associated with ovarian follicle development. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation analyses revealed that DE mRNAs and target genes of DE lncRNAs were associated with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, CCR6 chemokine receptor binding, G-protein coupled receptor binding, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. Our study provides a catalogue of lncRNAs and mRNAs related to ovarian development and constructs a predicted interaction network of differentially abundant lncRNAs and Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in TBsf, thus enhancing our understanding of the interactions between lncRNAs and genes regulating brooding behavior.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis of the ovaries from BC and GC groups in TBsf. A total of 349 significantly differentially expressed mRNAs and 651 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs were detected. Furthermore, we identified 10 key genes that may affect reproductive performance in chickens: STC1, MMP13, IL8, AT2, FSHB, RARB, THOC7, FGF12, EPHA1, and NPY5R. Based on GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, we preliminarily explored five pathways that may influence egg production performance: neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, CCR6 chemokine receptor binding, G-protein coupled receptor binding, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and ECM-receptor interaction. These genes and pathways may play crucial roles in improving broodiness behavior. This study establishes a foundation for subsequent screening of candidate functional genes and functional validation of important production traits in TBsf, providing a theoretical basis for further molecular breeding and enhancing egg-laying performance in TBsf.",

    "abstract": "A fully split shell in pistachio (Pistacia vera) is a trait that is preferred by consumers and is a criterion in evaluating the grade of the pistachio nut. However, while the expanding kernel has been hypothesized to provide the physical force needed for shell split, the mechanisms that control shell split remains unknown. Furthermore, it is intriguing how the shell, or endocarp, splits at the suture ridge when there is no clear dehiscence zone.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to 1) identify traits associated with dehiscence in fruit in the high split rate cultivar Golden Hills when compared to the lower split rate cultivar Kerman and determine the anatomical features associated with endocarp dehiscence at the suture region, and 2) examine the effect of kernel shape on endocarp dehiscence.\n\nWe determined that despite of the fact that the pistachio endocarp is primarily composed of a single type of polylobate schlerenchyma cell, specialization of cell shape and size at the suture site results in smaller, more flattened cells. We report that there is a furrowing of the shell at the dorsal and apical suture site, where dehiscence initiates. This furrowing is not observed at the ventral suture site or in the indehiscent fruit of Pistacia atlantica, a species that has been used as rootstock for P. vera. In addition, the size of the kernel in the sagittal axis (the width) is strongly associated with higher split rate. Based on our results, a tentative model emerges where, in the absence of specialized cell types, cell shape modification can create an anatomically distinct region that is mechanically weak in the endocarp for the initiation of dehiscence, while the force from the width of the kernel is necessary for the shell split rate difference as observed in cultivars.",

    "abstract": "The primary focus of medicinal cannabis research is to ensure the stability of cannabis lines for consistent administration of chemically consistent products to patients. In recent years, tissue culture has emerged as a valuable technique for genetic preservation and rapid production of cannabis clones. However, there is concern that the physical and chemical conditions of the growing media can induce somaclonal variation, potentially impacting the viability and uniformity of clones. To address this concern, we developed Comparative Restriction Enzyme Analysis of Methylation (CREAM), a novel method to assess DNA methylation patterns and used it to assess a population of 78 cannabis clones maintained in tissue culture. Through bioinformatics analysis of the methylome, we successfully detected 2,272 polymorphic methylated regions among the clones. Remarkably, our results demonstrated that DNA methylation patterns were preserved across subcultures within the clonal population, allowing us to distinguish between two subsets of clonal lines used in this study. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the epigenetic variability within clonal lines in medicinal cannabis produced through tissue culture techniques. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the effects of tissue culture on DNA methylation and ensuring the consistency and reliability of medicinal cannabis products with therapeutic properties. Additionally, the CREAM method is a fast and affordable technology to get a first glimpse at methylation in a biological system. It offers a valuable tool for studying epigenetic variation in other plant species, thereby facilitating broader applications in plant biotechnology and crop improvement.",
