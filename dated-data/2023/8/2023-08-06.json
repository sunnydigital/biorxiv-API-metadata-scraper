    "abstract": "For a vast majority of organisms, life-history processes depend on their physiological state, such as body size, as well as on their environment. Size-structured population models, or more generally, physiologically structured population models (PSPMs), have emerged as powerful tools for modelling the population dynamics of organisms, as they account for the dependences of growth, mortality, and fecundity rates on an organisms physiological state and capture feedbacks between a populations structure and its environment, including all types of density regulation. However, despite their widespread appeal across biological disciplines, few numerical packages exist for solving PSPMs in an accessible and computationally efficient way. The main reason for this is that PSPMs typically involve solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and no single numerical method works universally best, or even at all, for all PDEs. Here, we present libpspm, a general-purpose numerical library for solving user-defined PSPMs. libpspm provides eight different methods for solving the PDEs underlying PSPMs, including four semi-implicit solvers that can be used for solving stiff problems. Users can choose the desired method without changing the code specifying the PSPM. libpspm allows for predicting the dynamics of multiple physiologically structured or unstructured species, each of which can have its own distinct set of physiological states and demographic functions. By separating model definition from model solution, libpspm can make PSPM-based modelling accessible to non-specialists and thus promote the widespread adoption of PSPMs.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR enabled cell and gene therapies have the potential to revolutionize the field of genetic medicine. However, the vast majority of rare diseases remain untreatable due to the limitations of current tools and techniques. To date, most corrective therapeutic approaches have been restricted to mutation-by-mutation approaches, where either HDR, or newer techniques such as base or prime editing, rewrite small regions of DNA at a time ([~]1-100 bp). While these approaches are powerful, short editing windows (relative to the size of human genes) are financially and/or technically incompatible with most rare-disease mutation profiles. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to \"rewrite\" 7kb+ sections of the human genome simultaneously via a selection-free process we have named \"long-range rewriting\". Long-range rewriting approaches are compatible with multiple nucleases, cell types and genomic loci, and can be used with both double-strand break (DSB) and non-DSB based approaches.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which RFC1 PRE drives pathology remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time we discovered and determined the high-resolution structures of parallel G-quadruplex formed by AAGGG repeats within the pathogenic RFC1 PRE, revealing an intriguing conformational plasticity at the 3-termi that allows stacking of multiple G4s. We further identify a molecular mechanism by which the DNA G4 in RFC1 PRE impedes polymerase processivity leading to replication stalling and transcription inhibition in vitro in a repeat-length-dependent manner, and the transcription inhibition could partially contribute to a reduced gene expression in cells. Our results demonstrate that the DNA G-quadruplex of RFC1 PRE participate in aberrant molecular cascades, and provide an unprecedented high-resolution structural target to discover helicases and ligands that resolve the pathogenic G4 for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Population genomics has revolutionised our ability to study bacterial evolution by enabling data-driven discovery of the genetic architecture of trait variation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have more recently become accompanied by genome-wide epistasis and co-selection (GWES) analysis, which offers a phenotype-free approach to generating hypotheses about selective processes that simultaneously impact multiple loci across the genome. However, existing GWES methods only consider associations between distant pairs of loci within the genome due to the strong impact of linkage-disequilibrium (LD) over short distances. Based on the general functional organisation of genomes it is nevertheless expected that the majority of co-selection and epistasis will act within relatively short genomic proximity, on co-variation occurring within genes and their promoter regions, and within operons. Here we introduce LDWeaver, which enables an exhaustive GWES across both short- and long-range LD, to disentangle likely neutral co-variation from selection. We demonstrate the ability of LDWeaver to efficiently generate hypotheses about co-selection using large genomic surveys of multiple major human bacterial pathogen species and validate several findings using functional annotation and phenotypic measurements. Our approach will facilitate the study of bacterial evolution in the light of rapidly expanding population genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Age-related muscle wasting and dysfunction render the elderly population vulnerable and incapacitated, while underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we implicate the CERS1 enzyme of the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway in the pathogenesis of age-related skeletal muscle impairment. In humans, CERS1 abundance declines with aging in skeletal muscle cells and, correlates with biological pathways involved in muscle function and myogenesis. Furthermore, CERS1 is upregulated during myogenic differentiation. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CERS1 in aged mice blunts myogenesis and deteriorates aged skeletal muscle mass and function, which is associated with the occurrence of morphological features typical of inflammation and fibrosis. Ablation of the CERS1 orthologue lagr-1 in C. elegans similarly exacerbates the age-associated decline in muscle function and integrity. We discover genetic variants reducing CERS1 expression in human skeletal muscle and Mendelian randomization analysis in the UK biobank cohort shows that these variants reduce muscle grip strength and overall health. In summary, our findings link age-related impairments in muscle function to a reduction in CERS1, thereby underlining the importance of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway in age-related muscle homeostasis.",

It is unclear whether SynGAP imparts structural properties at synapses independent of its GAP activity. Here, we report that inactivating mutations within the SynGAP GAP domain do not inhibit synaptic plasticity or cause behavioral deficits. Instead, SynGAP modulates synaptic strength by physically competing with the AMPA- receptor-TARP complex, the major excitatory receptor complex in the brain, in the formation of molecular condensates with synaptic scaffolding proteins.

    "abstract": "How novel phenotypes originate from conserved genes, processes, and tissues remains a major question in biology. Research that sets out to answer this question often focuses on the conserved genes and processes involved, an approach that explicitly excludes the impact of genetic elements that may be classified as clade-specific, even though many of these genes are known to be important for novel, or clade-restricted, phenotypes. This is especially true for understudied phyla such as mollusks, where limited genomic and functional biology resources for members of this phylum has long hindered assessments of genetic homology and function. To address this gap, we constructed a chromosome-level genome for the gastropod Berghia stephanieae (Valdes, 2005) to investigate the expression of clade-specific genes across both novel and conserved tissue types in this species. The final assembled and filtered Berghia genome is comparable to other high quality mollusk genomes in terms of size (1.05 Gb) and number of predicted genes (24,960 genes), and is highly contiguous. The proportion of upregulated, clade-specific genes varied across tissues, but with no clear trend between the proportion of clade-specific genes and the novelty of the tissue. However, more complex tissue like the brain had the highest total number of upregulated, clade-specific genes, though the ratio of upregulated clade-specific genes to the total number of upregulated genes was low. Our results, when combined with previous research on the impact of novel genes on phenotypic evolution, highlight the fact that the complexity of the novel tissue or behavior, the type of novelty, and the developmental timing of evolutionary modifications will all influence how novel and conserved genes interact to generate diversity.",

    "abstract": "TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) has emerged as a key player in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. While facilitating Dicer-mediated pre-miRNA cleavage and recruitment of the RISC complex, TRBP binds to different pre-miRNAs & siRNAs, each varying in sequence, structure, or both. Our hypothesis posits that TRBP displays dynamic adaptability to accommodate this heterogeneity in target RNA structures. Thus, it is crucial to ascertain the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced protein dynamics in RNA recognition and binding. Prior investigations from the lab have elucidated the role of intrinsic and RNA- induced conformational exchange in the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1) of TRBP in shape-dependent RNA recognition. Building further on this, the current study delves into the intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics of the dsRBD2 of TRBP, juxtaposed with dsRBD1. Remarkably, dsRBD2 exhibits a higher binding affinity to a short (12bp) dsRNA when compared with dsRBD1, which can be attributed to the presence of residues critical to RNA binding and structural plasticity in dsRBD2. Utilizing state-of- the-art NMR spin relaxation, relaxation dispersion experiments, and MD simulations, we report that dsRBD2 depicts constrained conformational plasticity when compared to dsRBD1, as evidenced by the fast (ps-ns) and slower (s-ms) conformational dynamics measurements. Although, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes induced conformational exchange within the designated RNA-binding regions and the other residues, the amplitude of the motions remains modest when compared to those observed in dsRBD1. The culmination of our findings leads us to propose a dynamics-driven model of the two tandem domains of TRBP, substantiating their contributions to the versatility of dsRNA recognition and binding.",

Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) allows passage of intact capsid, though mechanistic details of the process remain to be fully understood. Here we investigate the factors regulating HIV-1 capsid translocation into the NPC central channel using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We find that successful translocation is contingent on the compatibility of the capsid morphology and channel dimension and the proper orientation of the capsid approach to the channel. The central channel dynamically expands to allow capsid passage, demonstrating the pleomorphic nature of the channel necessary for transporting large cargoes. Structural analysis shows that stress induced by the central channel confinement and uncondensed internal genomic material generates correlated striated patterns of lattice disorder across the viral capsid surface which is an indicator of its lattice \"elasticity\". Our results suggest that the \"elasticity\" can aid the capsid to adapt to the stress and remain structurally intact during translocation.\n\nTeaserComputer Simulations identify capsid elasticity as a key factor for successful nuclear entry.",

We found previously that PTP1B deficiency promotes HER2+ breast cancer cell death in hypoxia by activating RNF213, an [~]600kDa protein containing AAA-ATPase domains and two ubiquitin ligase domains (RING and RZ), which is implicated in Moyamoya disease (MMD). Here we report that PTP1B and ABL1/2 reciprocally control RNF213 phosphorylation on tyrosine-1275. This phosphorylation promotes RNF213 oligomerization and RZ domain activation. The RZ domain ubiquitylates CYLD/SPATA2, and together with the LUBAC complex, induces their degradation. Decreased CYLD/SPATA2 levels cause NF-{kappa}B activation, which together with hypoxia-induced ER-stress triggers pyroptosis. Mutagenesis experiments show that the RING domain negatively regulates the RZ domain, and RING mutants, including MMD alleles, catalyze LUBAC-independent CYLD/SPATA2 degradation.

    "abstract": "Functional diversification of transcription factors and of their downstream targets contributes to the emergence of new organ morphologies. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying floral organ specification in rice, we investigated the function of OsMADS2 and OsMADS4, the rice PISTILLATA (PI) paralogs controlling lodicule and stamen formation. The morphological characterization of osmads2 null mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 reiterated OsMADS2s nonredundant role in lodicule development. Furthermore, it uncovered unreported roles in controlling flowering time, floral meristem size, floral organ number, cell wall metabolism, and sterile lemma development. Although downregulation of OsMADS4 did not affect floral organ development, doubly perturbed osmads2d8/d8 osmads4kd florets exhibited more severe abnormalities than the osmads2 single mutant. Doubly perturbed inflorescences also exhibited defective rachis extension and parthenocarpy. Remarkably, ubiquitous overexpression of OsMADS4 in osmads2 rescued the different abnormalities of the osmads2 mutant but resulted in defective anther development and reduced seed set, phenotypes also observed when Arabidopsis PI was overexpressed in wild-type rice. These findings suggest that increased ubiquitous PI activity is detrimental to anther development. To uncover genes whose (in)direct regulation may contribute to these phenotypes, we combined the genome-wide identification of OsMADS2 binding regions (ChIP-Seq) with transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq). These analysis uncovered several OsMADS2 target genes that are implicated in lodicule and stamen development and in controlling floral organ number, e.g., PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 24 (PME24), GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASE 9B16 (GH9B16), TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), SPOROCYTELESS (SPL), FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER 1 (FON1), YUCCA3 and YUCCA7. Altogether, our results provide insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms of rice PI paralogs in floral organ specification, thereby expanding our understanding of their function as well as their conservation and diversification.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) modulates intracellular survival and differentiation signaling pathways downstream of neurotrophin receptors in the developing peripheral nervous system (PNS). Although well-studied in the context of brain development, our understanding of the in vivo role of PTEN in the PNS is limited to models of neuropathic pain and nerve injury. Here, we assessed how alterations in PTEN signaling affects the development of peripheral somatosensory circuits. We found that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in Pten heterozygous (PtenHet) mice exhibit defects in neuronal subtype diversification. Abnormal DRG differentiation in PtenHet mice arises early in development, with subsets of neurons expressing both progenitor and neuronal markers. DRGs in PtenHet mice show dysregulation of both mTOR and GSK-3{beta} signaling pathways downstream of PTEN. Finally, we show that mice with an autism-associated mutation in Pten (PtenY68H/+) show abnormal DRG development. Thus, we have discovered a crucial role for PTEN signaling in the intrinsic diversification of primary sensory neuron populations in the DRG during development.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing datasets comprise true single cells, or singlets, in addition to cells that coalesce during the protocol, or doublets. Identifying singlets with high fidelity in single-cell RNA sequencing is necessary to avoid false negative and false positive discoveries. Although several methodologies have been proposed to infer true singlets and doublets, they typically rely on datasets being highly heterogeneous. Here we develop and apply singletCode, a computational framework that leverages datasets with synthetically introduced DNA barcodes for a hitherto unexplored application: to extract ground truth singlets. We demonstrate the feasibility of singlets extracted via singletCode to evaluate the performance and robustness of existing doublet detection methodologies. We find that existing doublet detection methods show lower than documented sensitivity to doublets simulated with ground truth singlets. As DNA barcoded datasets are being increasingly reported, singletCode can identify singlets and inform rational choice of doublet detecting algorithms and their associated limitations.",
