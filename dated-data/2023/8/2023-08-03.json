    "abstract": "MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (MET{Delta}Ex14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild type and MET{Delta}Ex14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase C helix, pointing to differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a {beta}5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for kinase domain activation in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.",

    "abstract": "Irregular monoterpenes are important precursors of different compounds employed in pest control such as insecticides and insect sex pheromones. Metabolically engineered plants are appealing as biofactories of such compounds, but specially as potential live biodispensers of related bioactive volatiles, which could be continuously emitted to the environment from different plant tissues. Here we assess the use of cultivated tobacco and Nicotiana benthamiana as biofactories for the irregular monoterpenes chrysanthemol and lavandulol. We evaluate the impact of high levels of constitutive metabolite production on the plant physiology and biomass, and their biosynthetic dynamics for different plant tissues and developmental stages. As an example of an active pheromone compound, we super-transformed the best lavandulol-producing tobacco line with an acetyl transferase gene to obtain a tobacco lavandulyl acetate biodispenser emitting up to 0.63 mg of lavandulyl acetate per plant every day. We estimate that with these volatile emission levels, between 200 and 500 plants per hectare would be sufficient to ensure a daily emission of pheromones comparable to commercial lures. This is an important step towards plant-based sustainable solutions for pest control, and it lays the ground for further developing biofactories for other irregular monoterpenoid pheromones, whose biosynthetic genes are yet unknown.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the potential limits placed on organisms by their ecophysiology is crucial for predicting their responses to varying environmental conditions. Studies to date have traditionally relied on between-species comparisons, however, recently, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of intraspecific variation in shaping an organisms ecological and physiological responses. In this context, widely distributed resident bird species offer a well-suited study system to examine intraspecific geographical variation in ecophysiological traits. A main hypothesis for explaining avian thermoregulatory mechanisms is the aerobic capacity model, which posits a positive correlation between basal (BMR) and summit (Msum) metabolism, caused by the energetic maintenance costs associated with increased muscle mass for shivering thermogenesis and enhanced investment in digestive organs for food processing. Most evidence for this hypothesis, however, comes from interspecific comparisons only, and the ecophysiological underpinnings of avian thermoregulatory capacities hence remain controversial. Here, we focus on great tits (Parus major), measuring winter BMR and Msum in two populations from different climates, a maritime-temperate (Gontrode, Belgium) and a continental (Zvenigorod, Russia) one. We test for the presence of intraspecific geographical variation in metabolic rates and assess the predictions following the aerobic capacity model. We found that metabolic rates differed between populations, whereby the birds from the maritime-temperate climate (Gontrode) showed higher (whole-body and mass-independent) BMR whereas conversely, great tits from Zvenigorod showed higher levels of both (whole-body and mass-independent) Msum. Within each population, our data did not fully support the aerobic capacity models predictions. We argue that the decoupling of BMR and Msum observed may be caused by different selective forces acting on these metabolic rates, with birds from the continental-climate Zvenigorod population facing the need to conserve energy for surviving long winter nights (by keeping their BMR at low levels) while simultaneously being able to generate more heat (i.e., a high Msum) to withstand cold spells. We argue that the coupling or uncoupling of basal and maximum metabolic rates at the intraspecific level is likely influenced by different selective pressures that shape local adaptations in response to different climate regimes.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), the major cellular entry pathway, starts when clathrin assembles on the plasma membrane into clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). Two populations of CCPs are detected within the same cell:  productive CCPs that invaginate and pinch off, forming clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) [1, 2], and  abortive CCPs [3, 4, 5] that prematurely disassemble. The mechanisms of gating between these two populations and their relations to the functions of dozens of early-acting endocytic accessory proteins (EAPs) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have remained elusive. Here, we use experimentally-guided modeling to integrate the clathrin machinery and membrane mechanics in a single dynamical system. We show that the split between the two populations is an emergent property of this system, in which a switch between an Open state and a Closed state follows from the competition between the chemical energy of the clathrin basket and the mechanical energy of membrane bending. In silico experiments revealed an abrupt transition between the two states that acutely depends on the strength of the clathrin basket. This critical strength is lowered by membrane-bending EAPs [10, 11, 12]. Thus, CME is poised to be shifted between abortive and productive events by small changes in membrane curvature and/or coat stability. This model clarifies the workings of a putative endocytic checkpoint whose existence was previously proposed based on statistical analyses of the lifetime distributions of CCPs [4, 13]. Overall, a mechanistic framework is established to elucidate the diverse and redundant functions of EAPs in regulating CME progression.",

    "abstract": "Research in network neuroscience demonstrates that human intelligence is shaped by the structural brain connectome, which enables a globally coordinated and dynamic architecture for general intelligence. Building on this perspective, the network neuroscience theory proposes that intelligence arises from system-wide network dynamics and the capacity to flexibly transition between network states. According to this view, network flexibility is made possible by network controllers that move the system into specific network states, enabling solutions to familiar problems by accessing nearby, easy-to-reach network states and adapting to novel situations by engaging distant, difficult-to-reach network states. Although this framework predicts that general intelligence depends on network controllability, the specific cortical regions that serve as network controllers and the nature of their control operations remain to be established. We therefore conducted a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between regional measures of network controllability and general intelligence within a sample of 275 healthy young adults using structural and diffusion-weighted MRI data. Our findings revealed significant associations between intelligence and network controllers located within the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex. Furthermore, we discovered that these controllers collectively enable access to both easy- and difficult-to-reach network states, aligning with the predictions made by the network neuroscience framework. Additionally, our research demonstrated that the identified network controllers are primarily localized within the left hemisphere and do not reside within regions or connections that possess the highest capacity for structural control in general. This discovery suggests that the identified regions may facilitate specialized control operations and motivates further exploration of the network topology and dynamics underlying intelligence in the human brain.\n\nSummaryThis study examines the relationship between regional measures of network controllability and general intelligence within a sample of 275 healthy young adults using structural and diffusion-weighted MRI data. We report that individual differences in general intelligence are associated average and modal controllability in specific left-hemisphere cortical regions, and further show that controller regions associated with intelligence are distinct from regions with the highest, centrality, controllability, or communication. These findings reveal a significant structural role for individual regions in controlling the trajectory of the connectome, advancing our understanding of the nature and mechanisms of network controllability in general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic studies have revealed rare missense and protein-truncating variants in GRIN2A, encoding for the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptors, that confer significant risk for schizophrenia (SCZ). Mutations in GRIN2A are also associated with epilepsy and developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). However, it remains enigmatic how alterations to the same protein can result in diverse clinical phenotypes. Here, we performed functional characterization of human NMDA receptors (GluN1/GluN2A heteromers) that contain SCZ-linked GluN2A variants, and compared them to NMDA receptors with GluN2A variants associated with epilepsy or DD/ID. All tested protein-truncating variants and a subset of missense variants associated with SCZ led to a loss-of-function (LoF) phenotype, whereas epilepsy and DD/ID-associated variants resulted in both gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes. We additionally show that M653I, a LoF GRIN2A variant associated with DD/ID, exerts a dominant-negative effect when co-expressed with a wild-type GluN2A, whereas Y698C, a LoF SCZ-linked variant, does not. These findings demonstrate that SCZ-associated GRIN2A variants are predominantly LoF and offer a potential mechanism by which SCZ and DD/ID-linked variants can cause different effects on receptor function and therefore result in divergent pathological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Classic life history theory makes generalized predictions about phenotypic correlations across large clades. Modern comparative tests of these correlations account for the underlying structure of phylogenetic trees. Yet neither life history theory nor phylogenetic comparative methods automatically specify how biological mechanisms generate correlations. This problem is evident in comparative analyses of birds. Birds show a correlation between body size and age at first reproduction, but do not actually grow larger if they delay reproduction. Instead, field studies raise the hypothesis that social contexts--especially cooperative breeding, coloniality, and lekking--generate unique demands for behavioral development, which in turn result in delayed reproduction. Here, we support that hypothesis with a comparative dataset spanning 961 species in 155 avian families. Continuous (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), discrete (hidden state Markov), and phylogenetic regression models revealed delayed reproduction in colonial birds, a weaker signal in cooperative birds, and the consistent evolution of sexual bimaturism in polygynous, lekking birds. These results show an association between diverse social contexts, sex-specific developmental demands, and life history evolution in birds. Considering this diversity, we discuss how even statistically powerful phylogenetic correlations--whether focused on mass, lifespan, or broad social categories--can ultimately fail to model the history of life history evolution.",
