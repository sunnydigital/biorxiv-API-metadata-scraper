    "abstract": "Despite the important breakthroughs of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in recent years, the overall objective response rate (ORR) remains limited in various cancers. Here, we synthesized programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody iRGD conjugate (PD-1-(iRGD)2) through glycoengineering and bio-orthogonal reaction. PD-1-(iRGD)2 exhibited extra iRGD receptor dependent affinity to several cancer cell lines rather than normal cell lines. Via dual targeting, PD-1-(iRGD)2 engageed tumor cells and T cells thus mediating T cell activation and facilitating tumor elimination. Besides, the attachment of iRGD impressively improved the penetrability of both PD-1 antibody and PD-1+ T cells. In multiple syngeneic mouse models, PD-1-(iRGD)2 effectively reduced tumor growth with satisfactory biosafety. Moreover, results of flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq revealed that PD-1-(iRGD)2 remodeled the tumor microenvironment (TME) and expanded a unique population of \"better effector\" CD8+ tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) expressing stem and memory associated genes including Tcf7, Il7r, Lef1 and Bach2. Conclusively, PD-1-(iRGD)2 could be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy.\n\nStatement of significanceDesigned against the clinical dilemma of unsatisfied response rate after contemporary cancer immunotherapy, PD-1-(iRGD)2 engages T cells and tumor cells, promotes T cell infiltration and expands a unique population of \"better effectors\" with enhanced therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is the most abundant biogenic organic sulfur compound and a methane precursor in anoxic sediments. However, understanding of the microbial diversity driving DMS-dependent methanogenesis is limited, and the metabolic pathways underlying this process in the environment remain unexplored. To address this, we used anoxic incubations, amplicon sequencing, genome-centric metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of brackish sediments of the Baltic Sea. We identified Methanolobus as the dominant methylotrophic methanogens in all our sediment samples. We also showed that Methanolobus use trimethylamine- and methanol-methyltransferases, not methyl-sulfide methyltransferases, when producing methane from DMS. This demonstrated that methylotrophic methanogenesis does not require a substrate-specific methyltransferase as was previously accepted and highlights the versatility of the key enzymes in methane production in anoxic sediments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding Influenza B virus infections is of critical importance in our efforts to control severe influenza and influenza-related disease. Until 2020, two genetic lineages of influenza B virus - Yamagata and Victoria - circulated in the population. These lineages are antigenically distinct but differences in virus replication or the induction of host cell responses after infection have not been carefully studied. Recent IBV clinical isolates of both lineages were obtained from influenza surveillance efforts of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Response and characterized in vitro. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata clinical isolates were recognized less efficiently by serum from influenza-vaccinated individuals in comparison to the vaccine strains. B/Victoria lineages formed smaller plaques on MDCK cells compared to B/Yamagata, but infectious virus production in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures showed no differences. While ciliated epithelial cells were the dominant cell type infected by both lineages, B/Victoria lineages had a slight preference for MUC5AC-positive cells, while B/Yamagata lineages infected more basal cells. Finally, while both lineages induced a strong interferon response 48 hours after infection of hNEC cultures, the B/Victoria lineages showed a much stronger induction of interferon related signaling pathways compared to B/Yamagata. This demonstrates that the two influenza B virus lineages differ not only in their antigenic structure but in their ability to induce host innate immune responses.",

Tof1 supports rapid DNA replication, fork pausing, and resolution of DNA topological stress. Here, we show that disruption of FPC function through loss of either Tof1 or Mrc1 results in DNA damage in long replicons. Despite increasing DNA damage in long replicons, loss of either Tof1 or Mrc1 concurrently reduces DNA damage in regions prone to damage caused by DNA topological stress, indicating that the rapid replication promoted by the FPC fosters completing DNA replication at the cost of increased vulnerability to DNA topological stress. Supporting this we find that a tof1 mutation that selectively inhibits DNA topological stress resolution increases DNA damage in contexts prone to DNA topological stress. Our data indicates that the FPC balances rapid replication with recruitment of topoisomerase I to resolve the topological stress generated by increased DNA unwinding.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are responsible for many biological processes such as in the case of liver kinase LKB1 - a serine/threonine kinase, relevant for cell proliferation and cell polarity. LKB1 itself becomes fully activated upon recruitment to the plasma membrane by binding of its disordered C-terminal polybasic motif consisting of eight lysines/arginines to phospholipids. Here we present extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the polybasic motif interacting with a model membrane composed of phosphatidylcholin (POPC) and phosphatidic acid (PA) and cell culture experiments. Protein-membrane binding effects are due to the electrostatic interactions between the polybasic amino acids and PAs. For significant binding the first three lysines turn out to be dispensable, which was also recapitulated in cell culture using transfected GFP-LKB1 variants. LKB1-membrane binding results in a non-monotonous changes in the structure of the protein as well as of the membrane, in particular accumulation of PAs and reduced thickness at the protein-membrane contact area. The protein-lipid binding turns out to be highly dynamic due to an interplay of PA-PA repulsion and protein-PA attraction. The thermodynamics of this interplay is captured by a statistical fluctuation model, which allows the estimation of both energies. Quantification of the significance of each polar amino acid in the polybasic provides detailed insights into the molecular mechanism of the protein-membrane binding of LKB1. These results can be likely transferred to other proteins, which interact by intrinsically disordered polybasic regions with anionic membranes.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth is required for cell cycle progression. The amount of growth required for cell cycle progression is reduced in poor nutrients, which leads to a reduction in cell size. In budding yeast, nutrients influence cell size by modulating the duration and extent of bud growth, which occurs predominantly in mitosis. However, the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that mediate the effects of nutrients on bud growth. This led to the discovery that nutrients regulate numerous components of the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), which controls exit from mitosis. A key component of the MEN undergoes gradual multi-site phosphorylation during bud growth that is dependent upon growth and correlated with the extent of growth. Furthermore, activation of the MEN is sufficient to over-ride a growth requirement for mitotic exit. The data suggest a model in which the MEN integrates signals regarding cell growth and nutrient availability to ensure that mitotic exit occurs only when sufficient growth has occurred.",

    "abstract": "Epithelia must be able to resist mechanical force to preserve tissue integrity. While intercellular junctions are known to be important for the mechanical resistance of epithelia, the roles of tight junctions (TJs) remain to be established. We previously demonstrated that epithelial cells devoid of the TJ membrane proteins claudins and JAM-A completely lack TJs and exhibit focal breakages of their apical junctions. Here, we demonstrate that apical junctions undergo spontaneous fracture when claudin/JAM-A-deficient cells are exposed to mechanical stress. The junction fracture was accompanied by actin disorganization, and actin polymerization was required for apical junction integrity in the claudin/JAM-A-deficient cells. Further deletion of CAR resulted in the disruption of ZO-1 molecule ordering at cell junctions, accompanied by severe defects in apical junction integrity. These results demonstrate that TJ membrane proteins regulate the mechanical resistance of the apical junctional complex in epithelial cells.\n\nSummaryTight junction membrane proteins claudins, JAM, and CAR coordinately regulate the nanometer-scale organization of ZO-1 molecules, and are required for the mechanical resistance of apical junctions in epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is deemed an inflammatory disease, yet the defining diagnostic symptom is mechanical bronchoconstriction. We previously discovered a conserved process that drives homeostatic epithelial cell death in response to mechanical cell crowding called cell extrusion(1, 2). Here, we show that the pathological crowding of a bronchoconstrictive attack causes so much epithelial cell extrusion that it damages the airways, resulting in inflammation and mucus secretion. While relaxing airways with the rescue treatment albuterol did not impact these responses, inhibiting live cell extrusion signaling during bronchoconstriction prevented all these symptoms. Our findings propose a new etiology for asthma, dependent on the mechanical crowding of a bronchoconstrictive attack. Our studies suggest that blocking epithelial extrusion, instead of ensuing downstream inflammation, could prevent the feed-forward asthma inflammatory cycle.",

    "abstract": "A core pathophysiologic feature underlying many respiratory diseases is multiciliated cell dysfunction, leading to inadequate mucociliary clearance. Due to the prevalence and highly variable etiology of mucociliary dysfunction in respiratory diseases, it is critical to understand the mechanisms controlling multiciliogenesis that may be targeted to restore functional mucociliary clearance. Multicilin, in a complex with E2F4, is necessary and sufficient to drive multiciliogenesis in airway epithelia, however this does not apply to all cell types, nor does it occur evenly across all cells in the same cell population. In this study we further investigated how co-factors regulate the ability of Multicilin to drive multiciliogenesis. Combining data in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human bronchial epithelial cells, we identify RBL2 as a repressor of the transcriptional activity of Multicilin. Knockdown of RBL2 in submerged cultures or phosphorylation of RBL2 in response to apical air exposure, in the presence of Multicilin, allows multiciliogenesis to progress. These data demonstrate a dynamic interaction between RBL2 and Multicilin that regulates the capacity of cells to differentiate and multiciliate. Identification of this mechanism has important implications for facilitating MCC differentiation in diseases with impaired mucociliary clearance.",

Complementary use of outward proton pumping Arch3 rhodopsins in lysosomes offers an approach to vary pH in a range from around 5 to 6.5 in both directions (alkalization and acidification). Lyso-NsXeR optogenetics efficiency was demonstrated, in particular, by its ability to inhibit lysosome proteolytic enzymes. Unprecedented time resolution of the optogenetic approach allowed direct in situ monitoring of vATPase activity. Thus, optogenetic monitoring and regulation of the lysosome function, through pH control over a wide range, could serve as an approach to studying fundamental cell processes, and rational drug design.",

    "abstract": "Fertilization is a fundamental mechanism of sexual reproduction. Generally, oocytes are ovulated from the ovarian follicles and contact the sperm outside the ovarian medulla. Unlike this, follicle fertilization which means the egg contact with sperm in the ovarian medulla without ovulation is known in the viviparous teleost species belonging to the Poeciliidae. In this study, we focused on a viviparous teleost species, Poecilia reticulata (guppy). Our sperm tracking assay indicated that the sperm reached the immature oocytes with a germinal vesicle, and the fertilized immature oocytes were presumed to contribute to littermates. The binding between immature oocytes and sperm is a specific trait in the guppy, which was not observed in Danio rerio (zebrafish) or Oryzias latipes (medaka). The loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that bouncer plays a critical role in immature oocyte-to-sperm binding. This fertilization trait in immature oocytes may provide certain advantages for females with respect to nutrition or other gestation costs. Our findings shed light on the unique reproductive strategies of guppy and contribute to our understanding of the diverse reproductive mechanisms in vertebrates.\n\nSummary statementUnlike general vertebrates, guppys oocyte fertilizes with sperm in the ovarian medulla at the immature stages.

    "abstract": "Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular bacterium that infects many insects and other arthropods. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is one of several effects that Wolbachia has on its hosts. In its simplest form, CI causes host reproductive failure when an uninfected female mates with an infected male. Theoretically, this has two consequences. First, when an incompatible Wolbachia strain is introduced into a recipient host population, uninfected females are selected against, triggering Wolbachia invasion. Second, reproductive failures during Wolbachia invasion lead to a transient decrease in population growth rate. Modelling studies combining Wolbachia invasion and host population dynamics show that these two processes could interact to cause population decline and even extinction. However, these effects could be sensitive to density dependence, with competition reducing the demographic impact of CI and Allee effect increasing the probability of extinction. We tested these predictions with laboratory experiments in the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii and the exogenous Wolbachia strain wTei. Surprisingly, the introduction of wTei into D. suzukii populations at carrying capacity did not result in the expected invasion of wTei and transient population decline. In parallel, we found strong negative density dependence, but no Allee effect. From these results, we propose that negative density dependence is an important but underappreciated driver of the eco-evolutionary feedback underlying Wolbachia invasion and insect population dynamics. If future models and data support this hypothesis, pest management strategies using Wolbachia-induced CI should target early-season populations with negligible competition but a possible Allee effect.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation for disease resistance within host populations can strongly impact the spread of endemic pathogens. In plants, recent work has shown that within-population variation in resistance can also affect the transmission of foreign spillover pathogens if that resistance is general. However, most hosts also possess specific resistance mechanisms that provide strong defenses against coevolved endemic pathogens. Here we use a modeling approach to ask how antagonistic coevolution between hosts and their endemic pathogen at the specific resistance locus can affect the frequency of general resistance, and therefore a hosts vulnerability to foreign pathogens. We develop a two-locus model with variable recombination that incorporates both general (resistance to all pathogens) and specific (resistance to endemic pathogens only). We find that introducing coevolution into our model greatly expands the regions where general resistance can evolve, decreasing the risk of foreign pathogen invasion. Furthermore, coevolution greatly expands which conditions maintain polymorphisms at both resistance loci, thereby driving greater genetic diversity within host populations. This genetic diversity often leads to positive correlations between host resistance to foreign and endemic pathogens, similar to those observed in natural populations. However, if resistance loci become linked, the resistance correlations can shift to negative. If we include a third, linkage modifying locus into our model, we find that selection often favors complete linkage. Our model demonstrates how coevolutionary dynamics with an endemic pathogen can mold the resistance structure of host populations in ways that affect its susceptibility to foreign pathogen spillovers, and that the nature of these outcomes depends on resistance costs, as well as the degree of linkage between resistance genes.",

In order to design practical systems, parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the effects of limited sampling of statistical quantities, should be considered. To that end, we have developed a method for simulating speckle contrast signals including effects of detector noise. The method was validated experimentally, and the simulations were used to study the effects of physical and experimental parameters on the accuracy and precision of k.

    "abstract": "Decellularized tissues offer significant potential as biological materials for tissue regeneration due to their ability to preserve the complex compositions and architecture of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). While the use of decellularized ECM hydrogels from bovine and porcine bone tissues has been extensively studied, the evaluation and derivation of decellularized matrices from human bone tissue remain largely unexplored.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate how the physiochemical and biological properties of ECM hydrogels derived from human bone ECM could be controlled by manipulating bone powder size (45-250 m, 250-1000 m, and 1000-2000 m) and ECM composition through modulation of digestion time (3, 5, and 7 days).\n\nThe current studies demonstrate that a reduction in material bone powder size and an increase in ECM digestion time resulted in enhanced protein concentrations in the ECM hydrogels, accompanied by the presence of a diverse array of proteins. Furthermore, these adjustments in the physicochemical properties generated improved gelation strength of the hydrogels. The evaluation of human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (HBMSCs) cultured on ECM hydrogels derived from 45-250 m bone powder, treated for 7 days, demonstrated enhanced osteogenic differentiation compared to hydrogels derived from both larger bone powders and collagen gels.\n\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the significant promise of human bone ECM hydrogels as biologically active materials for bone regeneration. The ability to manipulate digestion time and bone powder size enables the generation of hydrogels with enhanced release of ECM proteins and appropriate gelation and rheological properties, offering new opportunities for application in bone tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPublic health faces the ongoing mission of safeguarding the populations health against various infectious diseases caused by a great number of pathogens. Epidemiology is an essential discipline in this field. With the rise of more advanced technologies, new tools are emerging to enhance the capability to intervene and control an epidemic. Among these approaches, molecular clustering comes forth as a promising option. However, appropriate genetic distance thresholds for defining clusters are poorly explored in contexts outside of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1).\n\nMethodsIn this work, using the well-used pairwise Tamura-Nei 93 (TN93) distance threshold of 0.015 for HIV-1 as a point of reference for molecular cluster properties of interest, we perform molecular clustering on whole genome sequence datasets from HIV-1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Zaire ebolavirus, and Mpox virus, to explore potential pairwise distances thresholds for these other viruses.\n\nResultsWe found the following pairwise TN93 distance thresholds as potential candidates for use in molecular clustering: 0.00016 (3 mutations) for Ebola, 0.00014 (4 mutations) for SARS-CoV-2, and 0.0000051 (1 mutation) for Mpox.\n\nConclusionThis study provides valuable information for epidemic control strategies, and public health efforts in managing infectious diseases caused by these viruses. The identified pairwise distance thresholds for molecular clustering can serve as a foundation for future research and intervention to combat epidemics effectively.\n\nAvailability and implementationAll relevant data and results can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/Niema-Lab/ENLACE-2023",

However, the structure of the immature form of TBEV remains unknown. Here, we employed state-of-the-art cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to determine the structure of the immature TBEV particle. The immature TBEV particle has a diameter of 56 nm and its surface glycoproteins are organised into spikes characteristic of immature flaviviruses. The cryoEM reconstructions of the whole virus and of the individual spike enabled us to build atomic models of the major viral components, the E and prM proteins. The insights obtained from our study provide a foundation for understanding the early stages of TBEV assembly and maturation. The pr domains of prM have a critical role in holding the heterohexameric prM3E3 spikes in metastable conformation. Destabilisation of the prM furin-sensitive loop at acidic pH facilitates its processing. The prM cleavage, the collapse of E protein ectodomains onto the virion surface concurrent with significant movement of the membrane domains of both E and M, and release of the pr fragment from the particle render the virus mature and infectious. This knowledge contributes to our understanding of the flavivirus life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how different neuronal types connect and communicate is critical to interpreting brain function and behavior. However, it has remained a formidable challenge to decipher the genetic underpinnings that dictate the specific connections formed between pre- and post-synaptic neuronal types. To address this, we propose a novel bilinear modeling approach that leverages the architecture similar to that of recommendation systems. Our model transforms the gene expressions of mouse bipolar cells (presynaptic) and retinal ganglion cells (postsynaptic), obtained from single-cell transcriptomics, into a covariance matrix. The objective is to construct this covariance matrix that closely mirrors a connectivity matrix, derived from connectomic data, reflecting the known anatomical connections between these neuronal types. Our model successfully recaptiulates recognized connectivity motifs and provides interpretable insights into genetic interactions that shape the connectivity. Specifically, it identifies unique genetic signatures associated with different connectivity motifs, including genes important to cell-cell adhesion and synapse formation, highlighting their role in orchestrating specific synaptic connections between these neurons. Our work establishes an innovative computational strategy for decoding the genetic programming of neuronal type connectivity. It not only sets a new benchmark for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of synaptic connections but also paves the way for mechanistic studies of neural circuit assembly and genetic manipulation of circuit wiring.",

    "abstract": "This study builds on work on language processing and information theory which suggests that informationally uniform, or smoother, sequences are easier to process than ones in which information arrives in clumps. Because episodic memory is a form of memory in which information is encoded within its surrounding context, we predicted that episodic memory in particular would be sensitive to information distribution. We used the \"dual process\" theory of recognition memory to separate the episodic memory component (recollection) from the non-episodic component (familiarity) of recognition memory. Though we find a weak effect in the predicted direction, this does not reach statistical significance and so the study does not support the hypothesis. The study does replicate a known effect from the literature where low frequency words are more easily recognized than high frequency ones when participants employ recollection-type memory. We suggest our results may be explained by linguistic processing being particularly adapted to processing linear sequences of information in a way that episodic memory is not. Episodic memory likely evolved to deal with unpredictable, sometimes clumped, information streams.",

Utilizing simulated short reads from genomes with specified mutations, we contrasted our genomic matrix approach with the consensus sequence method. Our matrix methodology accurately reflected the known mutations and true compositions, demonstrating its efficacy in understanding the sample variability and their interconnections. Further tests using real data from GISAID and NCBI-SRA confirmed its reliability and robustness.

    "abstract": "Corals rely on a wide range of microorganisms for their functioning, including intracellular dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) and bacteria. Marine heatwaves trigger the loss of Symbiodiniaceae from coral tissues - coral bleaching - often leading to death. While coral-bacteria interactions are widely studied, Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions have remained largely uninvestigated. Here, we provide a genomic analysis of 49 bacteria, spanning 16 genera, that closely associate with six cultured Symbiodiniaceae species. We analyzed bacterial functional potential by focusing on potentially beneficial functions for the Symbiodiniaceae host, including B vitamin synthesis and antioxidant abilities, which may be crucial for Symbiodiniaceae heat tolerance and in turn coral resistance to thermal bleaching. These analyses suggest a wide potential for B vitamin synthesis and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (through the production of carotenoids or antioxidant enzymes), and possibly the transfer of organic carbon to host cells. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis between bacteria isolated from wild-type and heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae cultures revealed that exposure to long-term elevated temperature has resulted in mutations in genes known to be involved in host-symbiont interactions, such as secretion systems. Climate change may therefore modify how Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria interact. This study provides an overview of the possible roles of Symbiodiniaceae-associated bacteria in Symbiodiniaceae functioning and heat tolerance, reinforcing the need for further studies of such interactions to fully understand coral biology and climate resilience.\n\nImportanceSymbiotic microorganisms are crucial for the survival of corals and their resistance to coral bleaching in the face of climate change. However, the impact of microbe-microbe interactions on coral functioning is mostly unknown, but could be essential factors for coral adaption to future climates. Here, we investigated interactions between cultured dinoflagellates of the Symbiodiniaceae family, essential photosymbionts of corals, and associated bacteria. By assessing the genomic potential of 49 bacteria, we found that they are likely beneficial for Symbiodiniaceae, through the production of B vitamins and antioxidants. Additionally, bacterial genes involved in host-symbiont interactions, such as secretion systems, accumulated mutations following long-term exposure to heat, suggesting symbiotic interactions may change under climate change. This highlights the importance of microbe-microbe interactions in coral functioning.",

    "abstract": "Plants host diverse communities of fungi (collectively called the mycobiota) which play crucial roles in their development. The assembly processes of the mycobiota, however, remain poorly understood, in particular, whether it is transmitted by parents through the seeds (vertical transmission) or recruited in the environment (horizontal transmission). Here we attempt to quantify the relative contributions of horizontal and vertical transmission in the mycobiota assembly of a desert shrub, Haloxylon salicornicum, by comparing the mycobiota of in situ bulk soil and seeds to that of (i) in situ adult individuals and (ii) in vitro-germinated seedlings in soil collected in situ, either autoclaved or not. We show that the mycobiota is partially transmitted through the seeds to seedlings. In contrast, root mycobiota of adults are highly similar to that of bulk soil, whereas adult leaf mycobiota remain similar to that of seeds. Thus, the mycobiota is transmitted both horizontally and vertically depending on the plant tissue. Despite discrepancies between in situ and in vitro approaches, our result may also suggest a compositional turnover in plant mycobiota during plant development. Understanding the respective contribution of these transmission paths to the plant mycobiota is fundamental to deciphering potential coevolutionary processes between plants and fungi.",

    "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) inhibits the type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling pathways during infection, and the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been identified as a potent IFN antagonist. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a major scaffold protein organizing the PML nuclear bodies (NBs) of the cell and plays a diverse role in maintaining the cellular homeostasis including antiviral response among many other processes. The present study reveals a significant reduction of PML NBs in cells during infection of PRRSV, implicating the negative regulation of PML gene expression by PRRSV. Subsequently, the nsp1{beta} protein was identified as the viral regulator for PML expression. The overexpression of PML isoforms restricted viral replication, while the gene silencing of endogenous PML promoted viral replication. The downregulation of PML expression by PRRSV was post-translational via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Of six isoforms, PML-II and PML-IV exhibited the most potent suppressive activity against viral replication. PRRSV nsp1{beta} bound to PML directly, and this interaction was mediated through the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-interacting motifs (SIMs) on nsp1{beta}. Further studies revealed that double mutations in SIM1 and SIM4 abolished the binding of nsp1{beta} to PML and prevented the PML degradation. The PML downregulation by nsp1 was common in other arteriviruses including equine arteritis virus, murine lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. Our study unveils the evolutionary conservation of the viral immune evasion strategy employed by arteriviruses, which promotes their replication by targeting PML for downregulation.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE STUDYPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically significant disease in the swine industry worldwide. One of the immunological hallmarks in virus-infected animals is the suppression of type I interferon response during an early-stage infection, leading to the consequence of adaptive immunity and viral persistence. In the present study, we report that the nsp1-beta protein of PRRS virus degrades the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and downregulates PML nuclear body (NB) formation. The PML downregulation by PRRS virus results in enhanced viral replication. The PML downregulation by nsp1 is common in other arteriviruses, unveiling the basic understanding of cell-virus interactions and immune evasion strategies for arteriviruses.",

Understanding the molecular basis of Xanthomonas cell cycle and identifying therapeutic targets is crucial for effective disease management.

Our analysis revealed 525 essential genes, 181 high fitness cost genes, 7 small non-coding RNAs, 25 transfer RNAs, 4 ribosomal RNAs, and the origin of replication. Notably, the use of a newly designed Tn5 transposon with an outward pointing lac promoter significantly reduced false positives caused by polar effects associated with conventional transposons. Functional enrichment analysis showed that essential genes were significantly enriched in processes related to ribosome biogenesis, energy production and conversion, and membrane metabolism. Interestingly, the distribution of essential genes in X. citri showed similarities to that of the model organism E. coli, suggesting a conserved mode of genome organization that influences transposon accessibility.

Using the precision of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we have recreated tEPOR and studied the effect of variations of the genotype on RBC development. We then combined tEPOR with a correction strategy developed for {beta}-thalassemia and demonstrated that coupling the two genome editing events gave RBCs a significant selective advantage. This demonstrates the potential of combining human genetics with the precision of genome editing to enable safer and more effective genome editing therapies for patients with serious genetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The design of novel protein-protein interfaces using physics-based design methods such as Rosetta requires substantial computational resources and manual refinement by expert structural biologists. A new generation of deep learning methods promises to simplify protein-protein interface design and enable its application to a wide variety of problems by researchers from various scientific disciplines. Here we test the ability of a deep learning method for protein sequence design, ProteinMPNN, to design two-component tetrahedral protein nanomaterials and benchmark its performance against Rosetta. ProteinMPNN had a similar success rate to Rosetta, yielding 13 new experimentally confirmed assemblies, but required orders of magnitude less computation and no manual refinement. The interfaces designed by ProteinMPNN were substantially more polar than those designed by Rosetta, which facilitated in vitro assembly of the designed nanomaterials from independently purified components. Crystal structures of several of the assemblies confirmed the accuracy of the design method at high resolution. Our results showcase the potential of deep learning-based methods to unlock the widespread application of designed protein-protein interfaces and self-assembling protein nanomaterials in biotechnology.",

One essential nutrient is iron, which is obtained from the heme of the human host hemoglobin (Hb) through a protein machinery called Iron-regulated Surface Determinant (Isd). IsdB is the protein in charge of heme extraction from Hb, which is the first step of the chain of events leading to iron transfer to the bacterium cell interior. In order to elucidate the molecular events leading from the formation of the initial IsdB:Hb complex to heme extraction, we have performed a time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) investigation combined with a rapid mixing triggering approach. We succeeded in defining the stoichiometry of IsdB:Hb binding and in describing the kinetics of the subsequent structural changes.

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is catalyzed by the ribosome and a host of highly conserved elongation factors. Most elongation factors that are conserved in all domains of life are essential, such as EF-Tu (e/aEF1A) and EF-G (e/aEF2). In contrast, the universally conserved elongation factor P (EF-P/eIF5A) is essential in eukaryotes but is dispensable in most bacteria. EF-P prevents ribosome stalling at difficult-to translate sequences, especially polyprolines. Since efp deletion phenotypes range from modest to lethal in different bacterial species, we hypothesized that some bacteria encode an uncharacterized elongation factor with compensatory functions. To identify this factor, we used Tn-seq to screen for genes that are essential in the absence of EF-P in Bacillus subtilis. This screen identified YfmR, a member of the ABCF family of ATPases, as a translation factor that is essential when efp is deleted. We find that depleting YfmR from {Delta}efp cells decreases actively translating ribosomes and increases free ribosomal subunits bound to initiator tRNA, suggesting that ribosomes stall in early elongation. We also find that deleting efp from the spore-forming pathogen Bacillus anthracis causes a severe survival defect in liquid culture and in the presence of macrophages. B. anthracis {Delta}efp also does not produce detectable spores. We find that heterologous expression of B. subtilis YfmR in B. anthracis {Delta}efp cells partially rescues the severe growth and sporulation defects of this mutant. Our results therefore identify YfmR as an important translation factor that becomes essential in the absence of EF-P, and suggest that the essential function of YfmR and EF-P is to assist translation during early elongation.\n\nSignificanceTranslation is one of the most ancient and energetically demanding process that occurs in the cell. Ribosomes constitute more than 60% of cellular mass in actively growing cells, and ribosomes are a major target of antimicrobials and chemotherapeutics. Here, we report evidence that both EF-P and the uncharacterized protein YfmR are important for early translation elongation in bacteria, and that this activity is essential. YfmR is a member of the ABCF family of ATPases whose role in translation is only beginning to be understood. Given the broad distribution of ABCFs from bacteria to fungi, we expect our results to have implications for understanding the crucial first steps of translation elongation in diverse organisms.",

    "abstract": "Lipid distribution in the eukaryotic cells depends on tight couplings between lipid transfer and lipid metabolism. Yet these couplings remain poorly described. Notably, it is unclear to what extent lipid exchangers of the OSBP-related proteins (ORPs) family, coupled to PI(4)P metabolism, contribute to the formation of sterol and phosphatidylserine gradient between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other cell regions. To address this question, we have examined in vitro the activity of Osh4p, a representative ORP, between Golgi mimetic membranes in which PI(4)P is produced by a PI 4-kinase and ER mimetic membranes in which PI(4)P is hydrolyzed by the phosphatase Sac1p. Using quantitative, real-time assays, we demonstrate that Osh4p creates a sterol gradient between the two membranes by sterol/PI(4)P exchange as soon as a PI(4)P gradient is generated at this interface following ATP addition, and define how much PI(4)P must be synthesized for this process. Then, using a kinetic model supported by our in vitro data, we estimate to what extent PI(4)P metabolism can drive lipid transfer in cells. Finally, we show that Sec14p, by transferring phosphatidylinositol between membranes, can support the synthesis of PI(4)P and the creation of a sterol gradient by Osh4p. These results indicate to what extent ORPs, under the control of PI(4)P metabolism, can distribute lipids in the cell.",

Perturb-seq provides a tool to investigate the effects of individual mutations on cellular programs. Here we deploy SEUSS, a Perturb-seq like approach, to generate and assay mutations at physical interfaces of the RUNX1 Runt domain. We measured the impact of 115 mutations on RNA profiles in single myelogenous leukemia cells and used the profiles to categorize mutations into three functionally distinct groups: wild-type (WT)-like, loss-of-function (LOF)-like and hypomorphic. Notably, the largest concentration of functional mutations (non-WT-like) clustered at the DNA binding site and contained many of the more frequently observed mutations in human cancers. Hypomorphic variants shared characteristics with loss of function variants but had gene expression profiles indicative of response to neural growth factor and cytokine recruitment of neutrophils. Additionally, DNA accessibility changes upon perturbations were enriched for RUNX1 binding motifs, particularly near differentially expressed genes. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of targeting protein interaction interfaces to better define the landscape of prospective phenotypes reachable by amino acid substitutions.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory gastrointestinal process that afflicts nearly 10% of premature babies born in the United States each year, with a mortality rate of 15 - 30%. NEC severity is graded using the Bells classification system based on the presenting symptoms and radiological findings. Animal models are a valuable tool in studying the pathogenesis of this disease; however, prior models cannot control the severity of NEC induced, a critical aspect of the disease in human infants. Here, we aim to bridge this gap in knowledge through development of a murine model of NEC with graded characteristics.\n\nPostnatal day 3 (P3) C57BL/6 mice were fed formula containing different concentrations (0.25%, 1%, 2%, and 3%) of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), an osmotic agent previously shown to induce severe NEC in neonatal mice. P3 mice were fed every 3 hours over a 72-hour period. During feeding, we collected data on weight gain and behavior, which included activity, response, and body color. After feeding, at P6, we dissected the mice to check for bowel features and collect organs for immunohistochemistry and cytokine analysis. Mice fed formula only or 0% DSS were used as a control instead of breastfed mice. Since staying with the dam during the first week of life is vital to normal development in mice, using formula-fed mice as the control accounts for the handling bias that exists during feeding.\n\nComparing breastfed and formula-fed mice alone, weight gain was significantly greater in breastfed mice, and liver cytokine concentrations tended to be higher. In the established graded NEC model, clinical differences were seen among the mice fed different DSS concentrations. Over the course of NEC induction, mice fed higher concentrations of DSS lost weight quicker and exhibited greater clinical severity scores. External bowel scores (dilation, color, and friability) were considerably worse in mice fed higher DSS concentrations; although internal small bowel pathology showed intestinal disarray among mice fed all DSS concentrations. Staining for cellular proliferation marker Ki-67 in intestines shows that mice fed higher concentrations of DSS display less cell proliferation at the base of the small intestine crypts. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the liver, to assess systemic inflammation downstream of the gastrointestinal system, trended higher in mice fed with higher concentrations of DSS.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that we have successfully characterized a graded newborn mouse model where NEC severity can be predictably induced. This mouse model will be a valuable tool in gaining greater insight and understanding of the pathophysiology of this devastating disease process and to understand its long0term complications, such as neurodevelopmental impairment.",

Evaluation of vaccine candidates for gonorrhea requires a suite of assays for predicting efficacy in vitro and in animal models of infection, including the role of antibodies elicited by immunization. Here we present assays to evaluate antibody functionality after immunization: antibody binding to intact N. gonorrhoeae, serum bactericidal activity, and opsonophagocytic killing activity using primary human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). These assays were developed with purified antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae and used to evaluate serum from mice that were vaccinated with 4CMenB or given alum as a negative control.

    "abstract": "Viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) attach to the host cell envelope, inject their genetic material into the host cytosol and either persist as prophage or hijack the host machinery to produce progeny virions. Attachment is mediated through phage receptor binding proteins that are specific for different host cell surface molecules. A subset of phage, the myoviruses, possess contractile tails, the outer sheath of which contracts upon receptor binding, driving an inner tail tube through the cell envelope and delivering the phage genome into the host cytosol. The molecular details of phage tail contraction and mode of cell envelope penetration have remained poorly understood and were completely unknown for any phage infecting bacteria enveloped by a proteinaceous S-layer. Here we reveal the extended and contracted atomic structures of an intact contractile-tail phage that binds to and penetrates the protective S-layer of the Gram positive human pathogen Clostridioides difficile. Surprisingly, we find no evidence of the intrinsic enzymatic domains that other phages exploit in cell wall penetration, suggesting that sufficient energy is released upon tail contraction to penetrate the S-layer and the thick cell wall without enzymatic activity. However, it is also notable that the tail sheath subunits move less than those studied in related contractile injection systems such as the model phage T4. Instead, the unusually long tail length and flexibility upon contraction likely contribute towards the required free energy release for envelope penetration. Our results show that the principles of phage contraction and infection as determined in the model system of T4 are not universal. We anticipate that our structures will form a strong foundation to engineer C. difficile phages as therapeutics, and highlight important adaptations made in order to infect S-layer containing pathogens.",

AOM possess widely different specific affinities for ammonia, thought to determine their niche differentiation. Nevertheless, ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOA, AOB), and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) co-occur in soils, freshwater sediments, and aquifers, suggesting that other factors must drive their coexistence. Here, we show that representatives of four AOM lineages employ distinct regulatory strategies for ammonia or urea utilization, thereby minimizing direct competition for either substrate. The tested AOA and comammox species preferentially used ammonia over urea, while beta-proteobacterial AOB favored urea utilization, repressed ammonia transport in the presence of urea, and showed higher affinity for urea than ammonia, whereas gamma-proteobacterial AOB co-utilized both substrates. Stable isotope tracing, kinetics, and transcriptomics experiments revealed that both assimilation and oxidation of ammonia are transport-dependent. These results reveal novel mechanisms of nitrogen metabolism regulation and transporter-based affinity underlying the contrasting niche adaptation and coexistence patterns among the major AOM lineages.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis poses a global health challenge, demanding improved diagnostics and therapies. Distinguishing between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) and Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infections holds critical \"One Health\" significance due to zoonotic nature of these infections and inherent resistance of M. bovis to pyrazinamide, a key part of Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) regimen. Furthermore, most of the currently used molecular detection methods fail to distinguish between the two species. To address this, our study presents an innovative molecular-biosensing strategy. We developed a label-free citrate-stabilized silver nanoparticle aggregation assay, offering sensitive, cost-effective, and swift detection. For molecular detection, genomic markers unique to M. tb and M. bovis were targeted using species-specific primers. In addition to amplifying species-specific regions, these primers also aid detection of characteristic deletions in each of the mycobacterial species. Post polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we compared two highly sensitive visual detection methods with respect to the traditional agarose gel electrophoresis. The paramagnetic bead-based bridging flocculation assay, successfully discriminates M. tb from M. bovis with a sensitivity of ~40 bacilli. The second strategy exploits citrate-stabilized silver nanoparticle which aggregates in the absence of amplified dsDNA on addition of sodium chloride (NaCl). This technique enables precise, sensitive and differential detection of as few as ~4 bacilli. Our study hence advances tuberculosis detection, overcoming challenges of M. tb and M. bovis differentiation offering a quicker alternative to time-consuming methods.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the precise coordination of DNA replication, transcription and translation is mediated by dynamic interactions among the corresponding macromolecular machineries, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Here we show that such coordination is hijacked by ribosome antibiotics to trigger secondary damage that predominantly contributes to their efficacy. Specifically, through developing a transcription dynamics profiling method, complemented by genetic and biochemical approaches, we unveil that translation inhibition disrupts transcription-translation coupling, leading to premature stalling of RNA polymerase (RNAP) at genome scale, which subsequently triggers extensive genomic instability. Moreover, mutagenic repairment of genomic lesions is mediated by heterogenous hyperactivation of SOS response, facilitating an inducible evolutionary path towards genetic resistance characterized by a unique mutation spectrum. Our findings thereby reveal a yet overlooked reverse-central-dogma pathway underlying actions of ribosome inhibitors, and establish a framework to understand antibiotic efficacy and induced mutagenesis through network disorder.",

    "abstract": "SwrA activates flagellar gene expression in Bacillus subtilis to increase the frequency of motile cells in liquid and elevate flagellar density to enable swarming over solid surfaces. Here we use ChIP-seq to show that SwrA interacts with many sites on the chromosome in a manner that depends on the response regulator DegU. We identify a DegU-specific inverted repeat DNA sequence and show that SwrA synergizes with phosphorylation to increase DegU DNA binding affinity. We further show that SwrA increases the size of the DegU footprint expanding the region bound by DegU towards the promoter. The location of the DegU inverted repeat was critical and moving the binding site closer to the promoter impaired transcription more that could be explained by deactivation. We conclude that SwrA/DegU forms a heteromeric complex that enables both remote binding and interaction between the activator and RNA polymerase in the context of an interceding UP element. We speculate that multimeric activators that resolve cis-element spatial conflicts are common in bacteria and likely act on flagellar biosynthesis loci and other long operons of other multi-subunit complexes.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn Bacteria, the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase recognizes specific DNA sequences called promoters that determine where gene transcription begins. Some promoters also have sequences immediately upstream called an UP element that is bound by the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase and is often necessary for transcription. Finally, promoters may be activated by transcription factors that bind DNA specific sequences and help recruit RNA polymerase to weak promoter elements. Here we show that the promoter for the 32 gene long flagellar operon in Bacillus subtilis requires an UP element and is activated by a heteromeric transcription factor of DegU and SwrA. Our evidence suggests that SwrA oligomerizes DegU over the DNA to allow RNA polymerase to interact with DegU and the UP element simultaneously. Heteromeric activator complexes are known but poorly-understood in bacteria and we speculate they may be needed to resolve spatial conflicts in the DNA sequence.",

The purpose of the study was to assess UAB126 effect in progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in rodent models of Type1 diabetes (T1D), streptozotocin-induced, and Type2 diabetes (T2D), the db/db mice. UAB126 treatment was delivered either by oral gavage for 6 weeks or by topical application of eye drops for 2 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the retinal function of diabetic mice was assessed by electroretinography (ERG), and their retinal tissue was harvested for protein and gene expression analyses. Bone-marrow cells were isolated and differentiated into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The glycolysis stress test and the 2-DG glucose uptake analysis were performed. Our results demonstrated that in the UAB126-treated diabetic BMDMs, the ECAR rate and the 2-DG uptake were improved as compared to untreated diabetic BMDMs. In UAB126-treated diabetic mice, hyperglycemia was reduced and associated with the preservation of ERG amplitudes and enhanced AMPK activity. Retinas from diabetic mice treated with topical UAB126 demonstrated an increase in Rxr and Ppar, and expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism. Altogether, our data indicate that RXR activation is beneficial to preclinical models of DR.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase that acts as a central mediator of translation, and plays important roles in cell growth, synaptic plasticity, cancer, and a wide range of developmental disorders. The signaling cascade linking lipid kinases (PI3Ks), protein kinases (AKT) and translation initiation complexes (EIFs) to mTOR has been extensively modeled, but does not fully describe mTOR system behavior. Here, we use quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation to monitor a protein interaction network (PIN) composed of 300+ binary interactions among mTOR-related proteins. Using a simple model system of serum deprived or fresh-media-fed mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, we observed extensive PIN remodeling involving 27+ individual protein interactions after one hour, despite phosphorylation changes observed after only five minutes. Using small molecule inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, MEK and ERK, we define subsets of the PIN, termed  modules, that respond differently to each inhibitor. Using primary fibroblasts from individuals with overgrowth disorders caused by pathogenic PIK3CA or MTOR variants, we find that hyperactivation of mTOR pathway components is reflected in a hyperactive PIN. Our data define a \"modular\" organization of the mTOR PIN in which coordinated groups of interactions respond to activation or inhibition of distinct nodes, and demonstrate that kinase inhibitors affect the modular network architecture in a complex manner, inconsistent with simple linear models of signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Omics and multi-omics studies are currently increasingly used in ecotoxicology to highlight the induction of known or new biomarkers when an organism is exposed to one (or more) contaminant(s). Although it is virtually impossible to identify all biomarkers from all possible organisms, biomarkers can be grouped into two categories, defense or damage biomarkers and they have a limited number of response trends. Our working hypothesis is that defense and damage biomarkers show different dose-response patterns. A meta-analysis of 156 articles and 2,595 observations of dose-response curves of well-known defense and damage biomarkers was carried out in order to characterize the response trends of these biological parameters in a large panel of living organisms (18 phyla) exposed to a wide variety of inorganic or organic contaminants. Defense biomarkers describe biphasic responses (bell-shaped and U-shaped) to a greater extent than damage biomarkers. In contrast, damage biomarkers varied mainly monotonically (decreasing or increasing). Neither the nature of the contaminant nor the type of organisms, whatever the kingdom (Plantae, Animalia, Chromista or Bacteria), influence these specific responses. This result suggests that cellular defense and damage mechanisms are not specific to stressors and are conserved throughout life. The meta-analysis results confirm the usefulness of trend analysis in dose-response models as a biological interpretation of biomarkers in large dataset and their application in determining the concentration ranges inducing defense responses (CRIDeR) and the concentration ranges inducing damage responses (CRIDaR) regardless of the contaminant tested or the organism studied.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe interpreted 2,595 biomarker dose-response curves generated by chemical exposure.\nC_LIO_LIDefense biomarkers mainly describe biphasic (bell- or U-shaped) trends.\nC_LIO_LIDamage biomarkers mainly describe monotonic (decreasing or increasing) trends.\nC_LIO_LICellular defense and damage responses appear to have been conserved during evolution.\nC_LIO_LIResponse trend analysis is a promising tool for environmental risk assessment.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551999v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b19c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@188ae31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@643ed6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15953cd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo), threatens plant growth and yield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying rice immunity against Xoo remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated down-regulation of a NAC (NAM-ATAF-CUC) transcription factor OsNAC2 enhanced resistance to bacterial blight disease in rice. Consistently, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis was greatly attenuated when OsNAC2 overexpressed. Furthermore, study demonstrated that OsNAC2 can down-regulated the expression of SA synthesis genes, thus mediating SA signal transmission. Simultaneously, OsNAC2 interacted with OsEREBP1 (AP2/ERF family) in the nucleus, may be bloking the inhibition of OsNAC2 to OsICS1, OsPAL3 and so on. Furthermore, OsEREBP1 interacted with OsXb22a in the cytoplasm to exert its positive regulatory effects to bacterial blight. However, OsNAC2-overexpression kept OsEREBP1 in the nucleus and be rapidly degraded in pathogen infection, which adversely affects the interaction of OsEREBP1-OsXb22a. Our results determined that OsNAC2 inhibits the SA signaling and stably interacts with OsEREBP1 to maintain disease resistance. This OsNAC2-OsEREBP1-based homeostatic mechanism provides new insights into rice disease resistance, and it may be useful for improving the disease resistance of important crops through breeding.",

Here, we developed a multifaceted approach to genetically engineer allogeneic ( off -the-shelf) CAR-T cells resistant to both biochemical (adenosine) and immunological (PD-L1 and TGF-{beta}) inhibitory signaling. We multiplexed an adenine base editor with a CRISPR-Cas12b nuclease to manufacture a CAR-T cell product comprising six gene edits to evade allorejection (B2M, CIITA), prevent graft-versus-host disease (CD3E) and resist major biochemical (ADORA2A) and immunological (PDCD1, TGFBR2) immunosuppressive barriers in solid tumors. Combinatorial genetic disruption in CAR-T cells enabled superior anti-tumor efficacy leading to improved tumor elimination and survival in humanized mouse models that recapitulated the suppressive features of a human tumor microenvironment (TME). This novel engineering strategy conferred CAR-T cells resistance to a diverse TME, which may unlock the therapeutic potential of CAR-T cells against solid tumors.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMultiplex genome engineered CAR-T cells resistant to allorejection and the convergence of biochemical and immunological negative regulators within the tumor microenvironment exhibit superior efficacy against solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Type IV pili are ancient and widespread filamentous organelles found in most bacterial and archaeal phyla where they support a wide range of functions, including substrate adhesion, DNA uptake, self aggregation, and cell motility. In most bacteria, PilT-family ATPases disassemble adhesion pili, causing them to rapidly retract and produce twitching motility, important for surface colonization. As archaea do not possess homologs of PilT, it was thought that archaeal pili cannot retract. Here, we employ live-cell imaging under native conditions (75{degrees}C and pH 2), together with automated single-cell tracking, high-temperature fluorescence imaging, and genetic manipulation to demonstrate that S. acidocaldarius exhibits bona fide twitching motility, and that this behavior depends specifically on retractable adhesion pili. Our results demonstrate that archaeal adhesion pili are capable of retraction in the absence of a PilT retraction ATPase and suggests that the ancestral type IV pilus machinery in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) relied on such a bifunctional ATPase for both extension and retraction.",

However, we found that as extracellular lactate accumulates, it also enters the mitochondrial matrix and stimulates mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity. The resulting increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis suppresses glycolysis and increases the utilization of pyruvate and/or alternative respiratory substrates. The ability of lactate to increase oxidative phosphorylation does not depend on its metabolism. Both L- and D-lactate are effective at enhancing ETC activity and suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the selective induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by unmetabolized D-lactate reversibly suppressed aerobic glycolysis in both cancer cell lines and proliferating primary cells in an ATP-dependent manner and enabled cell growth on respiratory-dependent bioenergetic substrates. In primary T cells, D-lactate enhanced cell proliferation and effector function. Together, these findings demonstrate that lactate is a critical regulator of the ability of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to suppress glucose fermentation.",

Fungal community composition strongly shifted due to drought and its legacy. In contrast, bacterial community composition resisted change during the experiment, but still was affected by the legacy of drought. We identified fungal and bacterial taxa with differential abundance due to heat and drought and found that taxa affected during climate events are not necessarily the taxa affected in recovery periods, showing the complexity and importance of legacy effects. Additionally, we found evidence that symbiotic groups of microbes important to plant performance respond in diverse ways to climate treatments and their legacy, suggesting plants may be impacted by past climatic events like drought and warming even if they do not experience the event themselves.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements profoundly affect the biology and evolution of their hosts, yet their own evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate insect endogenous retroviruses (iERVs), a monophyletic group of LTR retrotransposons that have acquired the trait of infectivity, likely through capture of a Baculovirus envelope gene. In Drosophila ovaries, iERVs with functional envelope have adapted their cis-regulatory sequences to be expressed in any somatic cell type, from where they infect the germline. Strikingly, related retroviruses show distinct expression patterns, indicating niche partitioning. In contrast, all non-infectious iERVs that emerged through secondary envelope-loss are specifically expressed in the germline. Co-evolving with iERVs, the genome-protecting piRNA pathway has assimilated iERV promoter and sequence information into piRNA clusters, underscoring the functional significance of iERV expression in somatic niches. We propose that the evolutionary innovation of cell-to-cell infectivity has triggered the adaptive radiation of iERVs through trait diversification and antagonistic virus-host interactions, processes that likely underpin niche-specific expression of endogenous retroviruses in vertebrates as well.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are near ubiquitous small, cellular appendages critical for cell-to-cell communication. As such, they are involved in diverse developmental and homeostatic processes, including energy homeostasis. ARL13B is a regulatory GTPase highly enriched in cilia. Mice expressing an engineered ARL13B variant, ARL13BV358A which retains normal biochemical activity, display no detectable ciliary ARL13B. Surprisingly, these mice become obese. Here, we measured body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels to reveal these mice display hyperphagia and metabolic defects. We showed that ARL13B normally localizes to cilia of neurons in specific brain regions and pancreatic cells but is excluded from these cilia in the Arl13bV358A/V358A model. In addition to its GTPase function, ARL13B acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARL3. To test whether ARL13Bs GEF activity is required to regulate body weight, we analyzed the body weight of mice expressing ARL13BR79Q, a variant that lacks ARL13B GEF activity for ARL3. We found no difference in body weight. Taken together, our results show that ARL13B functions within cilia to control body weight and that this function does not depend on its role as a GEF for ARL3. Controlling the subcellular localization of ARL13B in the engineered mouse model, ARL13BV358A, enables us to define the cilia-specific role of ARL13B in regulating energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria initiate colonization and biofilm formation in response to mechanical cues caused by surface proximity. The protein PilY1 has been proposed as a key actor mediating mechanosensing. PilY1 is a calcium and integrin-binding protein with additional roles in host adhesion and functional regulation of the type IV pili (T4P), the appendages involved in twitching motility, and various aspects of the surface-associated life of bacteria. Due to its extracellular location and involvement in several surface processes, PilY1 is exposed to mechanical forces that could modulate its different roles. Herein, we explore the effect of mechanical forces and ligand binding on the conformational dynamics of the PilY1 C-terminal domain. Our single-molecule approach demonstrates that PilY1 acts as a ligand-modulated force sensor. At high forces, PilY1 unfolding occurs through a hierarchical sequence of intermediates. When calcium is bound to its cognate site linked to T4P regulation, there is a long-range mechanical stabilization affecting several PilY1 domains, which ensures the structural integrity of the protein. In the low-force regime, the integrin-binding domain of PilY1 exhibits calcium-tuned force sensitivity and conformational dynamics akin to those of mechanosensor proteins. Integrin binding to this domain occurs under force, inducing a shortening of its unfolded extension. Our findings suggest that the roles of the PilY1 C-terminal domain are force and ligand-modulated, which could entail a mechanical-based compartmentalization of its functions.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of proteasome genes in cells treated with sub-lethal concentrations of proteasome inhibitors is upregulated by the transcription factor Nrf1 (NFE2L1), which is activated by a novel DDI2 protease. Here we demonstrate that the recovery of proteasome activity is DDI2-independent and occurs before the upregulation of proteasome gene expression. The recovery requires protein translation, but the efficiency of translation of proteasomal mRNA does not increase upon proteasome inhibition. Based on this data, we propose that the increased efficiency of proteasome assembly is responsible for the recovery of proteasome activity.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes have long been known for their acidic lumen and efficient degradation of cellular byproducts. In recent years it has become clear that their function is far more sophisticated, involving multiple cell signaling pathways and interactions with other organelles. Unfortunately, their acidic interior, fast dynamics, and small size makes lysosomes difficult to image with fluorescence microscopy. Here we report a far-red small molecule, HMSiR680-Me, that fluoresces only under acidic conditions, causing selective labeling of acidic organelles in live cells. HMSiR680-Me can be used alongside other far-red dyes in multicolor imaging experiments and is superior to existing lysosome probes in terms of photostability and maintaining cell health and lyso-some motility. We demonstrate that HMSiR680-Me is compatible with overnight time lapse experiments, as well as time lapse super-resolution microscopy with a fast frame rate for at least 1000 frames. HMSiR680-Me can also be used alongside silicon rhodamine dyes in a multiplexed super-resolution microscopy experiment to visualize interactions between the inner mitochondrial membrane and lysosomes with only a single excitation laser and simultaneous depletion. We envision this dye permitting more detailed study of the role of lysosomes in dynamic cellular processes and disease.",

    "abstract": "The PAR polarity network is a paradigmatic example of how systems of mutually antagonism interactions among peripheral membrane binding proteins allow them to form and maintain complementary polar domains in response to a transient polarizing cue. The oligomeric scaffolding protein PAR-3 has emerged as a keystone member of the PAR network in many different contexts. In early C. elegans embryos, PAR-3 is required for all other PAR asymmetries, and it can form stable unipolar asymmetries when its known inhibitors are absent and all other members of the PAR network are cytoplasmic or spatially uniform on the membrane. But how PAR-3 forms stable unipolar asymmetries absent mutual antagonism is unknown. Here we combine single particle analysis with quantitative modeling and experimental manipulations to determine how the dynamics of PAR-3 membrane binding, oligomerization and dissociation allow PAR-3 to maintain stable asymmetries in the one cell C. elegans embryo. We find that two forms of positive feedback contribute to sustaining PAR-3 asymmetries: First, a sharp size-dependent decrease in oligomer dissociation rates makes the effective dissociation rate of PAR-3 decrease sharply with its membrane density. Second, membrane-bound PAR-3 promotes additional binding of PAR-3 to the membrane through a mechanism that requires the presence of anterior polarity proteins CDC-42, PAR-6 and PKC-3. Through a combination of modeling and quantitative measurements, we show that these two feedback loops are sufficient to dynamically stabilize asymmetries of the magnitude observed in polarized C. elegans zygotes. These results establish a dynamic basis for stabilizing monopolar PAR-3 asymmetries; they underscore a crucial role for the oligomerization and add to the growing body of evidence that point to a central role for oligomerization of peripheral membrane proteins in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity.",

However, correlative X-ray tomography and fluorescence imaging for the same cell has yet to be routinely realized due to challenges in sample preparation and X-ray radiation damage. Here we report an integrated experimental and computational workflow for achieving correlative multi-modality X-ray imaging of a single cell. The method consists of the preparation of radiation-resistant single-cell samples using live-cell imaging-assisted chemical fixation and freeze-drying procedures, targeting and labeling cells for correlative x-ray tomography and x-ray fluorescence measurement, and computational reconstruction of the correlative and multi-modality images. With X-ray tomography, cellular structures including the overall structure and intracellular organelles are visualized, while X-ray fluorescence imaging reveals the distribution of multiple chemical elements within the same cell. Our correlative method demonstrates the feasibility and broad applicability of using X-rays to understand cellular structures and the roles of multiple chemical elements and related proteins in signaling and other biological processes.",

    "abstract": "The human placenta is a reservoir of a multitude of cell types with immense regenerative potential. Caudal-type homeobox-2 (CDX2) is a conserved factor that regulates trophectoderm formation and placentation during early embryonic development and hence can play a vital role in understanding developmentally conserved regenerative mechanisms. Cdx2 lineage tracing in our previous study identified multipotent Cdx2 lineage cells in the mouse placenta capable of restoring cardiac function after intravenous delivery in male mice with experimental cardiac injury (myocardial infarction). Here we demonstrate that CDX2-expressing cells are prevalent in the human chorionic placenta and are uniquely committed to cardiovascular differentiation. We examined the term placentas from 106 healthy donors and showed that isolated CDX2 cells can spontaneously differentiate into cardiomyocytes, functional vascular cells, and retain homing ability in vitro. Functional annotation from transcriptomics analysis supports enhanced cardiogenesis, vasculogenesis, immune modulation, and chemotaxis gene signatures in CDX2 cells. CDX2 cells can be clonally propagated in culture with retention of cardiovascular differentiation. Bringing us a step closer to translation, our study identifies an easily accessible and ethically feasible cell source to facilitate therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Cells arrest growth and enter a quiescent state upon nutrient deprivation. However, the molecular processes by which cells respond to different starvation signals to regulate exit from the cell division cycle and initiation of quiescence remains poorly understood. To study the role of protein expression and signaling in quiescence we combined temporal profiling of the proteome and phosphoproteome using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast). We find that carbon and phosphorus starvation signals activate quiescence through largely distinct remodeling of the proteome and phosphoproteome. However, increased expression of mitochondrial proteins is associated with quiescence establishment in response to both starvation signals. Deletion of the putative quiescence regulator RIM15, which encodes a serine-threonine kinase, results in reduced survival of cells starved for phosphorus and nitrogen, but not carbon. However, we identified common protein phosphorylation roles for RIM15 in quiescence that are enriched for RNA metabolism and translation. We also find evidence for RIM15-mediated phosphorylation of some targets, including IGO1, prior to starvation consistent with a functional role for RIM15 in proliferative cells. Finally, our results reveal widespread catabolism of amino acids in response to nitrogen starvation, indicating widespread amino acid recycling via salvage pathways in conditions lacking environmental nitrogen. Our study defines an expanded quiescent proteome and phosphoproteome in yeast, and highlights the multiple coordinated molecular processes at the level of protein expression and phosphorylation that are required for quiescence.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are difficult to study because they often belong to large protein families and form extensive networks of auto- and cross- regulation. They are highly abundant and often localize to condensates with a slow turnover, requiring long depletion times or knockouts that cannot distinguish between direct and indirect or compensatory effects.\n\nHere, we developed a system that is optimized for the rapid degradation of nuclear RBPs, called hGRAD. It comes as a 'one-fits-all' plasmid, and integration into any cell line that expresses endogenously GFP-tagged proteins allows an inducible, rapid and complete knockdown. We show that the nuclear RBPs SRSF3, SRSF5, SRRM2 and NONO are completely cleared from nuclear speckles and paraspeckles within two hours. hGRAD works in various cell types, is more efficient than other methods and does not require the expression of exogenous ubiquitin ligases. Combining SRSF5 hGRAD degradation with Nascent-seq uncovered highly dynamic transient transcript changes, compensatory mechanisms and that SRSF5 promotes transcript stability.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans has the remarkable capacity to neutralize acidic growth environments by releasing ammonia derived from the catabolism of amino acids. The molecular components and mechanisms controlling this capacity remain poorly understood. Here, we present an integrative model with the cytosolic NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh2) as the principal component. We show that the alkalization defect of a strain lacking the SPS-sensor regulated transcription factor STP2 is due to the inability to fully derepress GDH2 and the two proline catabolic enzymes, PUT1 and PUT2. Notably, the Stp2-dependent regulation of PUT1 and PUT2 occurs independent of Put3, the proline-dependent activator. Accordingly, a stp2-/- put3-/- strain is unable to derepress the expression of these enzymes resulting in a severe alkalization defect that nearly phenocopies the abrogated alkalization of a gdh2-/- strain. In wildtype cells, alkalization is tightly dependent on mitochondrial activity and occurs as long as conditions permit respiratory growth. As alkalization proceeds, Gdh2 levels decrease and glutamate is transiently extruded from cells. Together these two processes constitute a rudimentary regulatory system enabling cells to prevent the rapid intracellular build-up of ammonia. Similar to C. albicans, Gdh2-dependent alkalization is dispensable for C. glabrata and C. auris virulence as assessed using a whole-blood infection model. Intriguingly, fungal-dependent alkalization does not influence the growth or proliferation of Lactobacillus crispatus, a potent antagonist of C. albicans that normally resides in the acidic vaginal microenvironment. Our data suggest that it is time to reconsider the idea that pH modulation driven by pathogenic fungi plays a crucial role in shaping the architecture and dynamics of (poly)microbial communities. Other factors are likely to be more critical in contributing to dysbiosis and that favor virulent growth.",

    "abstract": "The formation of the brain and spinal cord is initiated in the earliest stages of mammalian pregnancy in a highly organized process known as neurulation. Convergent and extension movements transforms a flat sheet of ectodermal cells into a narrow and elongated line of neuroepithelia, while a major source of Sonic Hedgehog signaling from the notochord induces the overlying neuroepithelial cells to form two apposed neural folds. Afterward, neural tube closure occurs by synchronized coordination of the surface ectoderm and adjacent neuroepithelial walls at specific axial regions known as neuropores. Environmental or genetic interferences can impair neurulation resulting in neural tube defects. The Fuz gene encodes a subunit of the CPLANE complex, which is a macromolecular planar polarity effector required for ciliogenesis. Ablation of Fuz in mouse embryos results in exencephaly and spina bifida, including dysmorphic craniofacial structures due to defective cilia formation and impaired Sonic Hedgehog signaling. In this work, we demonstrate that knocking Fuz out during embryonic mouse development results in a hypoplastic hindbrain phenotype, displaying abnormal rhombomeres with reduced length and width. This phenotype is associated with persistent loss of ventral neuroepithelial stiffness, in a notochord adjacent area at the level of the rhombomere 5, preceding the development of exencephaly in Fuz ablated mutants. The formation of cranial and paravertebral ganglia is also impaired in these embryos, indicating that Fuz has a critical function sustaining normal neural tube development and neuronal differentiation.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/552068v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (77K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c1d63forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d8e5e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dbf248org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff6969_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeural tube defects (NTDs) are a common cause of disability in children, representing the second most common congenital structural malformation in humans following only congenital cardiovascular malformations.
