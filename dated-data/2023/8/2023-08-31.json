    "abstract": "Cooperative groups are susceptible to invasion by cheaters that reap the benefits but fail to pay the costs. Both theory and experimental work have shown that cheating can select for counter-adaptations to resist cheating. But then why is cheating so common? One key hypothesis is that trade-offs prevent resistors from taking over, but evidence to support the trade-off model is lacking. Here we evolved resistance to different cheaters and tested for trade-offs. Improvements against one cheater frequently entailed correlated improvements against novel cheaters. However, direct responses to selection were typically stronger than correlated responses to selection, resulting in a pattern of local adaptation of resistance. Control populations, evolved in the absence of a cheater, showed improvements in spore germination, whereas cheater-evolved populations did not, suggesting that the evolution of resistance retards or prevents other fitness improvements. Taken together, our findings suggest that, although cheater resistance can evolve rapidly, it may also involve subtle trade-offs that can help to explain the maintenance of polymorphism in cheating and resistance in nature.",

    "abstract": "Inferring the effects of positive selection on genomes remains a critical step in characterizing the ultimate and proximate causes of adaptation across species, and quantifying positive selection remains a challenge due to the confounding effects of many other evolutionary processes. Robust and efficient approaches for adaptation inference could help characterize the rate and strength of adaptation in non-model species for which demographic history, mutational processes, and recombination patterns are not currently well-described. Here, we introduce an efficient and user-friendly extension of of the McDonald-Kreitman test (ABC-MK) for quantifying long-term protein adaptation in specific lineages of interest. We characterize the performance of our approach with forward simulations and find that it is robust to many demographic perturbations and positive selection configurations, demonstrating its suitability for applications to non-model genomes. We apply ABC-MK to the human proteome and a set of known Virus Interacting Proteins (VIPs) to test long-term adaptation in VIPs, testing for specific pathogenic players associated with human evolution. We find substantially stronger signatures of positive selection on RNA-VIPs than DNA-VIPs, suggesting that RNA viruses may be may be an important driver of human adaptation over deep evolutionary time scales.",

    "abstract": "The obesity epidemic represents potentially the largest phenotypic change in Homo sapiens since the origin of the species. Despite obesitys high heritability, a change in the gene pool has not generally been presumed as a potential cause of the obesity epidemic. Here we advance the hypothesis that a rapid change in the obesogenic gene pool has occurred second to the introduction of modern obstetrics dramatically altering evolutionary pressures on obesity - the microevolutionary hypothesis of the obesity epidemic. Obesity is known to increase childbirth related mortality several fold. Prior to modern obstetrics, childbirth related mortality occurred in over 10% of women. After modern obstetrics, this mortality reduced to a fraction of a percent, thereby lifting a strong negative selection pressure. Regression analysis of data for [~] 190 countries was carried out to examine associations between 1990 maternal death rates (MDR) and current obesity rates. Multivariate regression showed MDR correlated more strongly with national obesity rates than GDP, calorie intake and physical inactivity. Analyses controlling for confounders via partial correlation show that MDR explains approximately 11% of the variability of obesity rate between nations. For nations with MDR above the median (>0.45%), MDR explains over 20% of obesity variance, while calorie intake, and physical inactivity show no association with obesity in these nations. The microevolutionary hypothesis offers a parsimonious explanation of the global nature of the obesity epidemic.\n\nSignificance StatementHumans underwent a rapid increase in obesity in the 20th century, and existing explanations for this trend are unsatisfactory. Here we present evidence that increases in obesity may be in large part attributable to microevolutionary changes brought about by dramatic reduction of childbirth mortality with the introduction of modern obstetrics. Given the higher relative risk of childbirth in women with obesity, obstetrics removed a strong negative selection pressure against obesity. This alteration would result in a rapid population-wide rise in obesity-promoting alleles. A cross-country analysis of earlier maternal death rates and obesity rate today found strong evidence supporting this hypothesis. These findings suggest recent medical intervention influenced the course of human evolution more profoundly than previously realized.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is known to be associated with the aetiology of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In the past, the availability of open access data has been the main driver of innovative method development and research training. However, this is increasingly being eroded by the move to controlled access, particularly of medical data, including cancer DNAm data. To rejuvenate this valuable tradition, we leveraged DNAm data from 1,845 samples (535 CRC tumours, 522 normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours, 72 colorectal adenomas, and 716 normal colon tissues from healthy individuals) from 14 open access studies deposited in NCBI GEO and ArrayExpress. We calculated each samples epigenetic age (EA) using eleven epigenetic clock models and derived the corresponding epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). For EA, we observed that most first- and second-generation epigenetic clocks reflect the chronological age in normal tissues adjacent to tumours and healthy individuals (e.g. Horvath (r = 0.77 and 0.79), Zhang EN (r = 0.70 and 0.73)) unlike the epigenetic mitotic clocks (EpiTOC, HypoClock, MiAge) (r < 0.3). For EAA, we used PhenoAge, Wu, and the above mitotic clocks and found them to have distinct distributions in different tissue types, particularly between normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours and cancerous tumours, as well as between normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours and normal colon tissue from healthy individuals. Finally, we harnessed these associations to develop a classifier using elastic net regression (with lasso and ridge regularisations) that predicts CRC diagnosis based on a patients sex and EAAs calculated from histologically normal controls (i.e. normal colon tissues adjacent to tumours and normal colon tissue from healthy individuals). The classifier demonstrated good diagnostic potential with ROC-AUC=0.886, which suggests that an EAA-based classifier trained on relevant data could become a tool to support diagnostic/prognostic decisions in CRC for clinical professionals. Our study also reemphasises the importance of open access clinical data for method development and training of young scientists. Obtaining the required approvals for controlled access data would not have been possible in the timeframe of this study.",

Dip3D has solved multiple problems in genome-wide SNV calling and haplo-tagging caused by the high sequencing error rates in Pore-C type data. Dip3D capitalizes on the high-order chromosomal interaction characteristics, enabling robust haplotype imputation and intricate haplotype-specific 3D structure discovery.

Moreover, Dip3D allows capturing haplotype high-order interactions that are unseen in Hi-C type data.

    "abstract": "Here we present a high-quality genome assembly of the mountain hare (Lepus timidus L.), based on a fibroblast cell line of a male specimen from Ilomantsi, Eastern Finland. The mountain hare represents the first Finnish contribution to the European Reference Genome Atlas pilot effort to generate reference genomes for European biodiversity.\n\nThe genome was assembled using 25X PacBio HiFi sequencing data and scaffolded utilizing a Hi-C chromosome structure capture approach. After manual curation, the assembled genome length was 2,930,972,003 bp with N50 125.8Mb. 93.16% of the assembly could be assigned to 25 identified chromosomes (23 autosomes plus X and Y), matching the published karyotype. The chromosomes were named according to size. The genome has a high degree of completeness based on the BUSCO score (mammalia_odb10 database), Complete: 96.1% [Single copy: 93.1%, Duplicated: 3.0%], Fragmented 0.8%, and Missing 2.9%. The mitochondrial genome of the cell line was sequenced and assembled separately.\n\nCompared to the previous pseudoreference genome of L. timidus ssp. hibernicus Bell, assembled using the rabbit genome, this new reference genome represents the nominal subspecies and the species-specific chromosomal conformation. In addition to providing a useful comparison for population studies, the genome can offer insight into the chromosomal evolution among Glires in general and Lagomorpha in particular. The chromosomal assembly of the genome also demonstrates that the cell line has not gone through karyotypic changes during culture.",

    "abstract": "Culture in non-human animals refers to behaviour that is socially learned and persists within a population over time. Human culture is notable in that it is cumulative: new innovations have built on previous ones over thousands of years. As a result, what is acquired via social learning often goes far beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover it during their lifetime1-3. To date, no previous study has convincingly demonstrated this phenomenon in a non-human animal. Here, we show that bumblebees can learn from a trained demonstrator to open a novel, 3D-printed two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrators to perform the unrewarded first step of the behaviour without providing a temporary reward linked to this action: the reward then being removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observers learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever having been rewarded after the first step. This suggested that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to \"re-innovate\" via individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure over the course of 12 days. The temporal and spatial distance of the unrewarded first step from the reward appeared to inhibit acquisition of two-step box-opening via individual associative learning, but this limitation was overcome by the presence of a trained conspecific. To our knowledge, these results make bumblebees the first animal to demonstrate the ability to socially learn a behaviour that is beyond their ability to innovate individually. This finding challenges the prevailing opinion of the field, which generally considers cumulative culture, which is built on this capacity, to be unique to humans.",

    "abstract": "Urinary bladder insult can be caused by environmental, genetic, and developmental factors. Depending upon insult severity, the bladder may lose its ability to maintain capacity and intravesical pressures resulting in renal deterioration. Bladder augmentation enterocystoplasty (BAE) is employed to increase bladder capacity to preserve renal function using autologous bowel tissue as a \"patch.\" To avoid the clinical complications associated with this procedure, we have engineered composite grafts comprised of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) co-seeded onto a pliable synthetic scaffold [POCO; poly(1,8-octamethylene-citrate-co-octanol)] or a biological scaffold (SIS; small intestinal submucosa) to regenerate bladder tissue in a baboon bladder augmentation model. We set out to determine the protein expression profile of bladder tissue that has undergone regeneration with the aforementioned stem cell seeded scaffolds along with baboons that underwent BAE. Data demonstrate that POCO and SIS grafted animals share high protein homogeneity between native and regenerated tissues while BAE animals displayed heterogenous protein expression between the tissues following long-term engraftment. We posit that stem cell seeded scaffolds can recapitulate tissue that is almost indistinguishable from native tissue at the protein level and may be used in lieu of procedures such as BAE.\n\nSignificance of StudyBladder augmentation enterocystoplasty has been used for decades as the gold-standard surgical procedure to treat severely dysfunctional bladders. Unfortunately, bowel (typically ileum) used for augmentation is an anatomical and physiological mismatch to bladder tissue and results in numerous complications including bladder perforation, secondary and tertiary redo surgeries, metabolic imbalances, excess mucus production, and increased risk of cancer. This is in part due to the intestinal protein expression that serves as a starting point and subsequent foundation in the optimization of pseudo bladder tissue. Within the context of this study, we demonstrate that autologous, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells along with primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can used to regenerate bladder tissue in a large deficit, non-human primate bladder augmentation model. Data demonstrate that this synergistic cellular combination facilitates the promotion of a protein tissue landscape that is nearly identical to native bladder tissue.",

We applied it to patient samples from multiple sequencing studies, and identified statistically significant mutational signatures associated with metastatic progression using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). We also employed gene cumulative contribution abundance analysis to link the mutational signatures with relevant genes, which could unearth the shared molecular mechanisms behind tumorigenesis and metastasis of each patient and lead to novel therapeutic target identification.\n\nOur study illustrates that MetaWise 2.0 is an effective DL tool for discovering clinically meaningful mutational signatures in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and relating them directly to relevant biological functions and gene targets.

    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction is a critical task in computational drug discovery. While recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown to be effective and promising, they face the following limitations: Transformer self-attention does not explicitly consider the underlying molecule structure while GNN feature representation alone is not sufficient to capture granular and hidden interactions and characteristics that distinguish similar molecules. To address these limitations, we propose SYN-FUSION, a novel approach that synergistically combines pre-trained features from GNNs and Transformers. This approach provides a comprehensive molecular representation, capturing both the global molecule structure and the individual atom characteristics. Experimental results on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate superior performance, surpassing previous models in 5 out of 7 classification datasets and 4 out of 6 regression datasets. The performance of SYN-FUSION has been compared with other Graph-Transformer models that have been jointly trained using a combination of transformer and graph features, and it is found that our approach is on par with those models in terms of performance. Extensive analysis of the learned fusion model across aspects such as loss, latent space, and weight distribution further validates the effectiveness of SYN-FUSION. Finally, an ablation study unequivocally demonstrates that the synergy achieved by SYN-FUSION surpasses the performance of its individual model components and their ensemble, offering a substantial improvement in predicting molecular properties.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS*Applied computing [-&gt;]Molecular sequence analysis; Bioinformatics; * Computing methodologies[-&gt;] Artificial intelligence; Transfer learning; Neural networks.",

ReDis combines Kraken2 with Minimap2 for aligning sequencing reads against a reference database with hundreds of gigabytes (GB) in size accurately within feasible time, and then uses a novel statistical model to assign the ambiguous reads for producing accurate abundance estimates. In contrast to the popular Kraken2+Bracken, ReDis improved the accuracy of abundance estimation on simulated reads from two highly similar genomes: Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri.\n\nContacth.guo@foxmail.com or jlsljf0101@126.com",

    "abstract": "DNA origami cryptography, which employs nanoscale steganography to conceal information within folded DNA origami nanostructures, shows promise as a secure molecular cryptography technique due to the large 700-bit key size generated through scaffold routing and sliding and the interlacing of staple strands.1 However, achieving the promised security, high information density, fast pattern detection, and accurate information readout requires even more secure cryptography and fast readout. Here, we advance the DNA origami cryptography protocol by demonstrating its ability to encrypt specific information in both 2D and 3D DNA origami structures, thus increasing the number of possible scaffold routings and improving the encryption key size. To this end, we used all-DNA-based steganography, enabled by high-speed 2D and 3D DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging, which does not require protein binding to reveal the pattern, allowing for higher information density. We combined 2D and 3D DNA-PAINT data with unsupervised clustering, achieving up to 89% accuracy and high ratios of correct-to-wrong readout despite significant flexibility in the 3D DNA origami structure shown by oxDNA simulation. Furthermore, we propose design criteria that ensure complete information retrieval for the DNA origami cryptography protocol. We anticipate that this technique will be highly secure and versatile, making it an ideal solution for secure data transmission and storage via DNA.",

    "abstract": "The layered liquid crystalline (LC) phases formed by DNA molecules which include rigid and flexible segments ( gapped DNA) enable the study of both end-to-end stacking and side-to-side lateral interactions that drive the condensation of DNA molecules. The resulting layer structure exhibits long-range inter-layer and intra-layer positional correlations. Using synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, we investigate the impact of divalent Mg2+ cations on the stability of the inter- and intra-layer DNA ordering as a function of temperature between 5-65 {degrees}C and for different terminal base pairings at the blunt ends of the gapped DNA constructs, which mediate the strength of the attractive end-to-end interaction. We demonstrate that the stabilities at a fixed DNA concentration of both inter-layer and intra-layer order are significantly enhanced even at a few mM Mg2+ concentration. The stability continues to increase up to [~]30 mM Mg2+ concentration, but at higher ([~]100 mM) Mg2+ content repulsion between positive ions counteracts and reverses the increase. On the other hand, sufficiently strong base-stacking interactions promote intra-layer order even in the absence of multivalent cations, which demonstrates the impact of liquid crystal layering on the DNA condensation process. We discuss the implications of these results in terms cation-mediated DNA-DNA attraction.",

    "abstract": "Multitasking proteins or moonlighting proteins (MLP) play a major role in human disease and many are drug targets. MLPs have a single polypeptide with two different biochemical functions and often have different cellular localizations. Analysis of MultitaskProtDB-II and Comparative Toxicogenomics databases and Gene Ontology and STRING analysis, showed that curcumin and resveratrol regulate 3 groups of MLPs. Group 1 MLPs drive epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas MLPs in groups 2 and 3 regulate tumour growth and suppression, respectively. The 3 groups of MLPs form a complex self-regulating network due to regulatory interactions between MLPs and the presence of transcription factors (CTNNB1, p53, NRF2) with their regulators and targets. Curcumin and/or resveratrol downregulate MLPs which drive EMT (CTNNB1, FASN, SMADs 2,3,4, MECP2, MMP2, TGF{beta}R1, HES1) and promote growth and inflammation (MMP2, EGFR, FGF2, MDR1). Second, curcumin and/or resveratrol modulate pleiotropic, regulatory  hub MLPs (GSK3{beta}, NOTCH1, HMGB1). Third, both phytochemicals upregulate tumour suppressor CDH1, and CYCS, which triggers apoptosis. Fourth, both phytochemicals modulate p53 expression, activity, and independently downregulate tumorigenic gene targets of p53 in groups 1 and 2. This dual mechanism can permit regulation of p53 activity in cells with wild type or mutant p53. Fifth, moonlighting functions of specific MLPs can cause unpredictable effects. These results add insights into synergistic and pleiotropic anti-cancer mechanisms of curcumin and resveratrol. It has clinical relevance because both phytochemicals are chemo-preventive agents and chemosensitizers in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Sexual maturation in many fishes requires a major physiological change that involves a rapid transition between energy storage and usage. In Atlantic salmon, this transition for the initiation of maturation is tightly controlled by seasonality and requires a high-energy status. Lipid metabolism is at the heart of this transition since lipids are the main energy storing molecules. The balance between lipogenesis (lipid accumulation) and lipolysis (lipid use) determines energy status transitions. A genomic region containing a transcription co-factor of the Hippo pathway, vgll3, is the main determinant of maturation timing in Atlantic salmon. Interestingly, vgll3 acts as an inhibitor of adipogenesis in mice and its genotypes are potentially associated with seasonal heterochrony in lipid storage and usage in juvenile Atlantic salmon. Here, we explored changes in expression of more than 300 genes directly involved in the processes of adipogenesis, lipogenesis and lipolysis, as well as the Hippo pathway in the adipose tissue of immature and mature Atlantic salmon with distinct vgll3 genotypes. We found molecular evidence consistent with a scenario in which immature males exhibiting vgll3 genotype specific seasonal direction of change in their lipid profiles. We also identified components of the Hippo signaling pathway as potential major drivers of vgll3 genotype specific differences in adipose tissue gene expression. This study demonstrates the importance of adipose gene expression patterns for directly linking environmental changes with energy balance and age at maturity through genetic factors bridging lipid metabolism, seasonality and sexual maturation.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthetic organisms must cope with rapid fluctuations in light intensity. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) enables the dissipation of excess light energy as heat under high light conditions, whereas its relaxation under low light maximizes photosynthetic productivity. We quantified variation in NPQ kinetics across a large sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) association panel in four environments, uncovering significant genetic control for NPQ. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 20 unique regions in the sorghum genome associated with NPQ. We detected strong signals from the sorghum ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3 (SVR3) involved in plastid-nucleus signaling and tolerance to cold. By integrating GWAS results for NPQ across maize (Zea mays) and sorghum association panels, we identified a second gene, NON-YELLOWING 1 (NYE1), originally identified by Gregor Mendel in pea (Pisum sativum) and involved in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in light-harvesting complexes, along with OUTER ENVELOPE PROTEIN 37 (OEP37), that encodes a transporter in chloroplast envelope. Analysis of nye1 insertion alleles in A. thaliana confirmed the effect of this gene on NPQ kinetics across monocots and eudicots. We extended our comparative genomics GWAS framework across the entire maize and sorghum genomes, identifying four additional loci involved in NPQ kinetics. These results provide a baseline for engineering crops with improved NPQ kinetics and increasing the accuracy and speed of candidate gene identification for GWAS in species with high linkage disequilibrium.",

    "abstract": "The pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC), located in the medulla, is the essential rhythm-generating neural network for breathing. The actions of opioids on this network impair its ability to generate robust, rhythmic output, contributing to life-threatening opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). The occurrence of OIRD varies across individuals and internal and external states, increasing the risk of opioid use, yet the mechanisms of this variability are largely unknown. In this study, we utilize a computational model of the preBotC to perform several in silico experiments exploring how differences in network topology and the intrinsic properties of preBotC neurons influence the sensitivity of the network rhythm to opioids. We find that rhythms produced by preBotC networks in silico exhibit variable responses to simulated opioids, similar to the preBotC network in vitro. This variability is primarily due to random differences in network topology and can be manipulated by imposed changes in network connectivity and intrinsic neuronal properties. Our results identify features of the preBotC network that may regulate its susceptibility to opioids.\n\nSignificance StatementThe neural network in the brainstem that generates the breathing rhythm is disrupted by opioid drugs. However, this response can be surprisingly unpredictable. By constructing computational models of this rhythm-generating network, we illustrate how random differences in the distribution of biophysical properties and connectivity patterns within individual networks can predict their response to opioids, and we show how modulation of these network features can make breathing more susceptible or resistant to the effects of opioids.",

    "abstract": "The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster emerges as an affordable, genetically tractable model of behavior and brain diseases. However, despite the surprising level of evolutionary conservation from flies to humans, significant genetic and circuit-level differences hinder the interpretability of fruit fly models for human disease. Therefore, to facilitate fly-to-human translation with more direct behavior-level comparison, we surveyed the rarely-exploited, rich behavioral repertoire of fruit flies with genetic alterations relevant to Parkinsons disease (PD). Flies displayed variable behaviors, including freezing, slowing and running, in response to predator-mimicking passing shadows used as threatening stimuli in a single-animal trial-based assay. We found that the expression of human mutant Parkin in flies resulted in reduced walking speed and decreased reactivity to passing shadows. Flies with dopamine receptor mutations showed similar alterations, consistent with the motor and cognitive deficits typical in humans with PD. However, Drosophila overexpressing the human form of -synuclein manifested in only moderate phenotypical alterations, suggesting that other fruit fly models may be favored in PD research. We also found age-dependent trends in behavioral choice across the fly lifespan, while dopamine receptor mutant flies maintained their decreased general reactivity throughout all age groups. Our data demonstrate that single-trial behavioral analysis can reveal subtle behavioral changes in mutant flies that can be used to further our understanding of disease pathomechanisms and help gauge the validity of genetic Drosophila models of neurodegeneration.",

Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are often involved in the underlying pathology, but their specific functions during locomotor control in health and disease remain obfuscated.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to describe the effect of gradual adult-onset Purkinje cell degeneration on gaiting patterns in mice and whether two different mechanisms that both lead to Purkinje cell degeneration caused different patterns in the development of gait ataxia.\n\nMethodsUsing the ErasmusLadder together with a newly developed limb detection algorithm and machine learning-based classification, we subjected mice to a physically challenging locomotor task with detailed analysis of single limb parameters, intralimb coordination and whole-body movement. We tested two Purkinje cell-specific mouse models, one involving stochastic cell death due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms (Pcp2-Ercc1-/-), the other carrying the mutation that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (Pcp2-ATXN1[82Q]).\n\nResultsBoth mouse models showed increasingly stronger gaiting deficits, but the sequence with which gaiting parameters deteriorated depended on the specific mutation.\n\nConclusionsOur longitudinal approach revealed that gradual loss of Purkinje cell function can lead to a complex pattern of loss of function over time, and this pattern depends on the specifics of the pathological mechanisms involved.

Effector CD8+ T cell transit through skin is necessary and sufficient to populate LN TRM in draining LNs, a process reinforced by antigen encounter in skin.

    "abstract": "Human-wildlife conflict is increasing steadily worldwide and is rapidly becoming an important challenge for the success of conservation programs. Brown bears, which suffer from reduced habitat suitability and quality globally, frequently conflict with humans. These animals need large home ranges to fulfill their habitat requirements. When space and food are restricted, brown bears frequently shift towards human-dominated landscapes that offer reliable food sources. As a country where most of the landscape and habitats are human-dominated, human-brown bear conflict events (HBCs) are frequent in Turkiye. However, there has been no formal analysis of the nature and scope of these conflicts at the country level. Here, using HBC data from 2017 to 2022, we determined the spatial and temporal dynamics of HBC events and generated a risk probability map based on anthropogenic predictors and geographic profiling, to determine the factors driving HBC across Turkiye. HBC events did not show any annual or seasonal trends but varied considerably across biogeographic regions, with most conflicts occurring along the Black Sea coast and Eastern Anatolia. Sixty percent of all conflicts were due to bear foraging behavior in human settlements while twelve percent were the result of human activity in forests, with 57% of all conflict events resulting in direct injury to either humans or bears. We found that distance to villages, distance to protected areas, distance to farmland and human footprint to be the most important factors contributing to conflict risk. Consequently, 21% of the country was found to be under human-bear conflict risk, with 43% of the risks occurring within a 10 km radius from the centers of protected areas. Our analyses indicate that the high occurrence of HBCs is mainly the result of limited natural areas and resources available to brown bears and the increasing human encroachment in and around core bear habitats.",

With comprehensive whole-genome sequence data, we investigated the genetic introgression between two divergent lineages of nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) in the Baltic Sea. We found that the intensity and direction of selection on the introgressed variation varied across different genomic elements: while functionally important regions had experienced reduced rates of introgression, promoter regions showed enrichment. Despite the general trend of negative selection, we identified specific genomic regions that were enriched for introgressed variants and within these regions, we detected footprints of selection, indicating adaptive introgression. We found the selection against the functional changes to be strongest in the vicinity of the secondary contact zone and weaken as a function of distance from the initial contact. Altogether, the results suggest that the stabilization of introgressed variation in the genomes is a complex, multi-stage process involving both negative and positive selection. In spite of the predominance of negative selection against introgressed variants, we also found evidence for adaptive introgression variants likely associated with adaptation to Baltic Sea environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "The species Brassica rapa is mainly cultivated as a vegetable crop with high economic value. But infectious diseases, such as soft rot disease and clubroot disease can cause severe yield losses. Introducing resistance genes through breeding is an efficient and sustainable way to reduce the susceptibility and improve the yield of crops. Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat (NLR) genes are the main types of resistance genes. They can recognize pathogen effectors and initiate downstream immune response. However, the intraspecific diversity of NLR genes in Brassica rapa has remained unknown. Based on domain similarity search and machine learning pipeline, we identified 2188 NLRs in 17 accessions of Brassica rapa genomes, which constitute the species-wide pan-NLRome in Brassica rapa. The diversity of the four types of NLR genes are significantly different in the aspects of chromosome location, number stability, integrated domains (IDs), evolutionary trajectory, and positive selection sites. Phylogenetic analyses show TNL-type NLRs whose N terminus contain Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain experienced accession-specific expansion. Moreover, the expanded TNL-type NLRs carry more positively selected amino acid residues which are mainly located on the protein surface based on their 3D structures. These evidences might imply their important biological function in perceiving pathogen effectors. Taken together, our study provides better insights into the diversity and variation of NLR genes in Brassica rapa pangemone, which can facilitate the biofunction assigning, cloning, and subsequent application in breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "The process of aging increases the risk of developing age-related diseases, which come at great societal healthcare costs and suffering to individuals. Meanwhile, targeting the basic mechanisms of aging can reduce the risk of developing age-related diseases during aging, essentially resulting in a  healthy aging process. Multiple aging pathways exist, which over past decades have systematically been confirmed through gene knockout or overexpression studies in mammals and the ability to increase healthy lifespan. In this work, we perform transcriptome-based drug screening to identify small molecules that mimic the transcriptional profiles of long-lived genetic interventions in mammals. We identify one small molecule whose transcriptional effects mimic diverse known genetic longevity interventions: compound 60 (Cmpd60), which is a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and 2 (HDAC2). In line with this, in a battery of molecular, phenotypic, and bioinformatic analyses, in multiple disease cell and animal models, we find that Cmpd60 treatment rejuvenates multiple organ systems. These included the kidney, brain, and heart. In renal aging, Cmpd60 reduced partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and decreased fibrosis in vivo. For the aging brain, Cmpd60 reduced dementia-related gene expression in vivo, effects that were recapitulated when treating the APPSWE-1349 Alzheimer mouse. In cardiac aging, Cmpd60 treatment activated favorable developmental gene expression in vivo and in line with this, improved ventricular cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation in a cell model of cardiac hypertrophy. Our work establishes that a systemic, two-week treatment with an HDAC1/2 inhibitor serves as a multi-tissue, healthy aging intervention in mammals. This holds potential for translation towards therapeutics that promote healthy aging in humans.",

Treatment strategies can be determined based on factors such as genetic mutations, age, and diet. Another way of implementing precision medicine in a dynamic fashion is through bioelectronics equipped with real-time sensing and intelligent actuation. Bioelectronic devices such as ion pumps can be utilized to deliver therapeutic drugs. To be able to perform precision medicine, medical devices need to be able to deliver drugs with high precision. For this, closed-loop control is required to be able to change the treatment strategy as new information about the response and progression of the biological system is received. To this end, a sliding mode controller is utilized given its ability to perform satisfactory control actions when there is model uncertainty.

Here we designed a genetic recombinase-based SOX10 reporter system in human pluripotent stem cells that enables tracking and lineage tracing of Neural Crest cells (NCCs) in a human organoid model of the developing neural tube. We found that VPA induces extensive cellular senescence and promotes mesenchymal differentiation of human NCCs at the expense of neural lineages. We next show that the clinically-approved drug, Rapamycin, inhibits AP1-mediated senescence and restores aberrant NCC differentiation trajectory in human organoids exposed to VPA. Notably, in vivo validation in developing zebrafish highlighted the therapeutic promise of this approach. Collectively our data identifies a novel mechanism for VPA-associated neurodevelopmental teratogenicity and a potential pharmacological preventative strategy. The results exemplify the power of genetically modified human stem cell-derived organoid models for drug discovery and safety testing.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is usually accompanied with an elevated sympathetic tonicity, but how sympathetic hyperactivity is triggered is not fully understood. Recent advances reveal that microglia-centered neuroinflammation contributes to sympathetic excitation in hypertension. In this study, we performed a temporospatial analysis of microglia at both morphological and transcriptomic levels, and found that microglia in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were early responders to hypertensive challenges. PVN is the central hub for maintaining cardiovascular function via regulation of fluid balance and sympathetic outflow. Comprehensive vasculature analyses unveiled that PVN was characterized by high capillary density, thin vessel diameter, and complex vascular topology among brain regions. As such, PVN is susceptible to the penetration of ATP released from the vasculature in response to hemodynamic disturbance after blood pressure increase. ATP ligation to microglial P2Y12 receptor is responsible for the microglial accumulation and activation in the PVN. Furthermore, either pharmacological blockade or genetic ablation of microglial P2Y12 could substantially restrain blood pressure increase under hypertensive challenge. Together, these findings disclose that a unique vasculature pattern results in the vulnerability of PVN pre-sympathetic neurons to hypertension-associated insults, which is mediated by microglia.",

Although haploinsufficient genes play a critical role in deletion pathogenicity, current methods for deletion pathogenicity prediction fail to integrate multiple lines of evidence for haploinsufficiency at the gene level, limiting their power to pinpoint deleterious deletions associated with genetic disorders. Here we introduce DosaCNV, a deep multiple-instance learning framework that, for the first time, models deletion pathogenicity jointly with gene haploinsufficiency. By integrating over 30 gene-level features potentially predictive of haploinsufficiency, DosaCNV shows unmatched performance in prioritizing pathogenic deletions associated with a broad spectrum of genetic disorders. Furthermore, DosaCNV outperforms existing methods in predicting gene haploinsufficiency even though it is not trained on known haploinsufficient genes. Finally, DosaCNV leverages a state-of-the-art technique to quantify the contributions of individual gene-level features to haploinsufficiency, allowing for human-understandable explanations of model predictions. Altogether, DosaCNV is a powerful computational tool for both fundamental and translational research.",

Further, prior crystallography on the asymmetric dimeric of the unphosphorylated WNK1 kinase domain (WNK1/S382A, WNK1/SA) revealed conserved waters in the active site. Here we show by crystallography that PEG400 applied to crystals of dimeric WNK1/SA grown in space group P1 induces de-dimerization with a change in space group to P21. Both the conserved waters, referred to here as conserved water network 1 (CWN1) and the chloride binding site are disrupted by PEG400. CWN1 is surrounded and stabilized by a pan-WNK-conserved cluster of charged residues. Here we mutagenized these charges in WNK3 to probe the importance of the CWN1 to WNK regulation. Two mutations at E314 in the Activation Loop (WNK3/E314Q and WNK3/E314A) enhanced activity, consistent with the idea that the CWN1 is inhibitory. Mutations of other residues in the cluster had similar or less activity than wild-type. PEG400 activation of WNK3 was not significantly reduced in the point mutants tested. The crystallographic and assay data support a role for CWN1 and the charged cluster in stabilizing an inactive configuration of WNKs and suggest that water functions as an allosteric inhibitor of WNKs.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium ions to attract free swimming cells. However, the basis of chemotaxis to potassium remains poorly understood. Here, using a microfluidic device, we found that Escherichia coli can rapidly accumulate in regions of high potassium concentration on the order of millimoles. Using a bead assay, we measured the dynamic response of individual flagellar motors to stepwise changes in potassium concentration, finding that the response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway instead of the motor response to changes in the proton motive force (PMF). To characterize the chemotactic response to potassium, we exposed the bacteria to a range of potassium concentrations and measured the dose-response curve and adaptation kinetics via a FRET assay, finding that the chemotaxis pathway exhibited a sensitive response and fast adaptation to potassium. We further found that the two major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr respond differently to potassium. Tar receptors exhibit a biphasic response, whereas Tsr receptors respond to potassium as an attractant. These different responses were consistent with the responses of the two receptors to intracellular pH changes. Therefore, bacteria may sense the change in potassium concentration by sensing the change in intracellular pH. The sensitive response and fast adaptation allow bacteria to sense and localize small changes in potassium concentration. As the ratio of the two major chemoreceptors changes with bacterial growth stages, the differential responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium suggest that cells at different growth stages respond differently to potassium and may have different requirements for potassium.",

Here, we investigated the function of PRDM6 in human hindbrain neuroepithelial stem cells and tested PRDM6 as a driver of Group 4 medulloblastoma. We report that human PRDM6 localizes predominantly to the nucleus, where it causes widespread repression of chromatin accessibility and complex alterations of gene expression patterns. Genome-wide mapping of PRDM6 binding reveals that PRDM6 binds to chromatin regions marked by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation that are located within, or proximal to, genes. Moreover, we show that PRDM6 expression in neuroepithelial stem cells promotes medulloblastoma. Surprisingly, medulloblastomas derived from PRDM6-expressing neuroepithelial stem cells match human Group 3, but not Group 4, medulloblastoma. We conclude that PRDM6 expression has oncogenic potential but is insufficient to drive Group 4 medulloblastoma from neuroepithelial stem cells. We propose that both PRDM6 and additional factors, such as specific cell-of-origin features, are required for Group 4 medulloblastoma. Given the lack of PRDM6 expression in normal tissues and its oncogenic potential shown here, we suggest that PRDM6 inhibition may have therapeutic value in PRDM6-expressing medulloblastomas.",

    "abstract": "Multiple PCR analyzes were performed using 19 different primer sets to open and broaden the search spectrum for shrimp pathogens. In addition, multiple primer pairs for 10 pathogens were compared to see if there were differences in selectivity or sensitivity among them. Some pathogens that did not present histological lesions were detected. The most important outcome was that selection of appropriate primers was the most critical factor in obtaining reliable results. We found high variability in results among primers and we learned it was prudent to seasonally assess among them for the best set selection. It is important to understand that a PCR positive test result alone does not confirm the presence of a viable pathogen or a disease state. Nor, as might be expected, does it mean that the positive PCR test results will be necessarily accompanied by histological lesions characteristic of the targeted pathogen. However, the use of appropriately selected primers sets can reveal whether there is an evolution in the result spectrum over time and if some pathogens disappear or reappear or new ones emerge. In general, most shrimp presented coinfections that consisted of the presence of WzSV8, DHPV, chronic midgut inflammation and tubule distension/epithelial atrophy consistent with Pir A/B toxicity.

While cultivated extensively for their ornamental value, commercial interest in irises lies in the secondary metabolites present in their rhizomes. The Dalmatian Iris (Iris pallida Lam.) is an ornamental plant that also produces secondary metabolites with potential value to the fragrance and pharmaceutical industries. In addition to providing base notes for the fragrance industry, iris tissues and extracts possess anti-oxidant, anti- inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. However, study of these secondary metabolites has been hampered by a lack of genomic information, instead requiring difficult extraction and analysis techniques.

    "abstract": "Increased salience of drug-related cues over non-drug reinforcers can drive drug use behaviors and contribute to tobacco use disorder (TUD). An important scientific and clinical goal is to effectively measure this elevated drug-seeking behavior in TUD. However, most TUD assessments rely on self-reported cravings and cigarette consumption, not providing an objective measure of cue-induced drug seeking. The probabilistic image choice (PIC) task, initially developed and validated for cocaine use disorder (and since validated in users of methamphetamine and opioids), investigates the choice of viewing drug-related pictures as compared to other salient pictures (e.g., pleasant and unpleasant cues). This study aimed to develop and validate the PIC task for TUD and evaluate the associations between behavioral choice and tobacco craving, daily cigarette consumption, and nicotine dependence (the Fagerstrom score). We recruited 468 smokers and 121 nonsmokers using the Prolific online platform. Participants performed the PIC task twice (at a one-month interval) and completed other measures relevant to TUD. As expected, compared to nonsmokers, tobacco smokers selected to view significantly more tobacco images and less pleasant (non-drug reinforcer) images, a profile that remained stable at retest. Drug seeking on the PIC task was associated with craving but not with the other tobacco dependence measures, suggesting that the task is better at modeling current drug \"wanting\" rather than cumulative nicotine exposure or physical dependence. In conclusion, these results suggest that the PIC task can be a valuable tool for objectively assessing craving-associated tobacco seeking in TUD.\n\nImplicationsCurrent measures of tobacco use disorder (TUD) rely on self-reports of consumption, dependence and craving and do not take into consideration the role of drug-related cues in driving tobacco seeking. This study shows that the probabilistic image choice (PIC) task provides an objective, reliable proxy measure of drug-seeking behavior in cigarette smokers that is linked to craving and desire for smoking but not to other measures of TUD. Therefore, the PIC task may be a useful complementary tool for the classification, diagnosis, and prognosis of TUD.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing understanding of the various roles mitochondria play in neurons, how they contribute to higher brain functions such as learning and memory remains underexplored. Here, using C. elegans, we found that expression level and activity of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) pore forming unit MCU-1 impacts learning and memory for odors sensed by a specific sensory neuron, AWCON. Genetic and pharmacological manipulation showed that MCU-1 was required in the sensory neuron during conditioning. For aversive odor learning, MCU-1 mediates learning to 60-min conditioning by facilitating the selective release of NLP-1 neuropeptide through mitochondrial ROS production. MCU activation and neuropeptide release likely coincide with the AWC calcium peak following odor removal. We propose that mitochondria contribute to learning and memory by acting as a duration sensor to control select neuropeptide release in response to prolonged stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding chloride channel that is regulated by intracellular cAMP/PKA phosphorylation. CFTR is widely expressed in peripheral tissues and organs of mammals and plays a vital role in maintaining chloride balance and cellular homeostasis. While preliminary studies have identified CFTR expression in the central nervous system (CNS), it is not clear whether this channel also modulates the neural network of the cerebral cortex by regulating the intracellular chloride level of neurons. In this study, we employed immunohistochemical staining, patch-clamp recording, and two-photon imaging techniques to comprehensively analyze the functions of the CFTR channel in the rodent cortex. Our results indicate that CFTR is primarily distributed in the deep pyramidal somata and superficial axons of the cerebral cortex. Regulation of CFTR has the potential to alter the resting membrane potential and evoke action potentials of layer V pyramidal neurons, which produces significant changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting CFTR channels increased the calcium activity of axon boutons and somata of the primary motor cortex in vivo, promoting motor learning. Overall, these findings implicate a crucial role of CFTR in modulating Cl-homeostasis and neuronal excitability in the cerebral cortex, furthering our understanding of the functions of the chloride channel in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is suggested as an important risk factor for all-cause mortality and multiple chronic diseases including hematological neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and potentially a spectrum of autoimmune or immune-deficiency diseases. Mutations in TET2 are one of the first identified, most important and prevalent genetic drivers of CH. However, cooperative factors and mechanisms underlying TET2-deficiency related CH (TedCH) remain largely unknown. Controversially, it is recently suggested that certain diseases take place prior to TedCH and promote TedCH on the contrary, indicating diseases in non-hematopoietic organs may act as environmental non-genetic drivers of CH. To clarify relationships between immune-dysfunctional diseases and CH, here we tested impact of various challenges on TedCH. We found that expedited TedCH depended on establishment of inflammatory environment. Primary or chimeric Tet2-mutant mice spontaneously developed co-symptoms reminiscent of human chronic colitis and myeloid leukemia, which was exacerbated by feeding with DSS, an experimental inducer of ulcerative colitis. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis reveals in depth the damage of colon and bone marrow in the Tet2-mutant mice in physiological condition or fed with DSS, along with increase of dysbacteriosis indicated by gut microbiome analysis. Results from colon scRNA-seq from both mouse and human highlight important roles of PTX3/IL-1{beta} pro-inflammatory signaling in promoting colitis or leukemia. Finally, TedCH trajectory and inflammation in colon and bone marrow was ameliorated by treatment of IL-1R1 inhibitor Anakinra.

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is related to the accumulation of malignant plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow. MM accounts for approximatively 10% of hematological malignancies and despite major improvement in therapies and outcomes, relapses will virtually occur in all patients. Usually, the disease goes along with an excess production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) component by the tumor PC clone. However, many questions remain regarding the consequences of a deregulated Ig production on PC survival. Recent advances in RNA-based therapy using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) prompted us to examine the impact of altered Ig heavy to light chain (HC/LC) ratios in MM cells. We designed a pan IgG subclasses specific ASO targeting a consensus sequence found in the polyadenylation signal (PAS) of all secreted IGHG mRNAs (IgG-ASO). Remarkably, treatment with this compound strongly decreased IgG secretion in MM cell lines and patient cells. Consistent with a deregulated HC/LC ratio, a dose-dependent excess of free-LCs (as monomers and dimers) was observed in myeloma cells treated with IgG-ASO, compared to an irrevelant control ASO (CTRL). RNA-seq profiles further indicated that the expression of genes involved in cellular metabolism, unfolded protein response (UPR) and cell death pathways were altered after treatment with IgG-ASO. Interestingly, impaired survival of primary IgG-expressing cells isolated from MM patients was achieved upon treatment with IgG-ASO, whereas no major effect was observed for healthy cells. Altogether, our data provide evidence for efficient inhibition of IgG secretion upon ASO treatment and suggest that an excess of free-LC due to disruption of HC/LC stoichiometry is toxic for MM cells expressing complete Ig. Such RNA-based strategies targeting PC in an Ig isotype-dependent manner could open new avenues for selective therapeutic approaches in PC dyscrasias.",

    "abstract": "The Saccharomycotina yeasts (\"yeasts\" hereafter) are a fungal clade of scientific, economic, and medical significance. Yeasts are highly ecologically diverse, found across a broad range of environments in every biome and continent on earth1; however, little is known about what rules govern the macroecology of yeast species and their range limits in the wild2. Here, we trained machine learning models on 12,221 occurrence records and 96 environmental variables to infer global distribution maps for 186 yeast species ([~]15% of described species from 75% of orders) and to test environmental drivers of yeast biogeography and macroecology. We found that predicted yeast diversity hotspots occur in mixed montane forests in temperate climates. Diversity in vegetation type and topography were some of the greatest predictors of yeast species richness, suggesting that microhabitats and environmental clines are key to yeast diversification. We further found that range limits in yeasts are significantly influenced by carbon niche breadth and range overlap with other yeast species, with carbon specialists and species in high diversity environments exhibiting reduced geographic ranges. Finally, yeasts contravene many longstanding macroecological principles, including the latitudinal diversity gradient, temperature-dependent species richness, and latitude-dependent range size (Rapoports rule). These results unveil how the environment governs the global diversity and distribution of species in the yeast subphylum. These high-resolution models of yeast species distributions will facilitate the prediction of economically relevant and emerging pathogenic species under current and future climate scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres, which are chromosomal end structures, play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and integrity in eukaryotes. In the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the X- and Y-elements are subtelomeric repetitive sequences found in all thirty-two and seventeen telomeres, respectively. While the Y-elements serve as a backup for telomere functions in cells lacking telomerase, the function of the X-elements remains unclear. This study utilized the S. cerevisiae strain SY12, which has three chromosomes and six telomeres, to investigate the role of X-elements (as well as Y-elements) in telomere maintenance. Deletion of Y-elements (SY12Y{Delta}), X-elements (SY12XY{Delta}+Y), or both X- and Y-elements (SY12XY{Delta}) did not impact the length of the terminal TG1-3 tracks or telomere silencing. However, inactivation of telomerase in SY12Y{Delta}, SY12XY{Delta}+Y, and SY12XY{Delta} cells resulted in cellular senescence and the generation of survivors. These survivors either maintained their telomeres through homologous recombination-dependent TG1-3 track elongation or underwent microhomology-mediated intra-chromosomal end-to-end joining. Our findings indicate the non-essential role of subtelomeric X- and Y-elements in telomere regulation in both telomerase-proficient and telomerase-null cells and suggest that these elements may represent remnants of S. cerevisiae genome evolution. Furthermore, strains with fewer or no subtelomeric elements exhibit more concise telomere structures and offer potential models for future studies in telomere biology.",

While carcinogenic mechanisms of single pathogenic bacteria have been characterized in vitro, limited tools are available to investigate interactions between pathogenic bacteria and both commensal microbiota and colonocytes in a physiologically relevant tumor microenvironment. To address this, we developed a microfluidic device that can be used to co-culture colonocytes and colorectal microbiota. The device was used to explore the effect of Fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic pathogen associated with colorectal cancer development in humans, on colonocyte gene expression and microbiota composition. F. nucleatum altered the transcription of genes involved in cytokine production, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and proliferation in colonocytes in a contact-independent manner; however, most of these effects were diminished by the presence of fecal microbiota. Interestingly, F. nucleatum significantly altered the abundance of multiple bacterial clades associated with mucosal immune responses and cancer development in the colon. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the potential carcinogenic activity of pathogens in the context of a commensal microbiota, and the potential to discover novel inter-species microbial interactions in the colorectal cancer microenvironment.",

This full-plate actuator/imager, OptoDyCE-plate, uses optogenetic stimulation and optical readouts of voltage and calcium from all wells in parallel. The system is validated with syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs, grown as monolayers, or in quasi-3D isotropic and anisotropic constructs using electrospun matrices, in 96 and 394-well format. Genetic modifications, e.g. interference CRISPR (CRISPRi), and nine compounds of acute and chronic action were tested, including five histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis). Their effects on voltage and calcium were compared across growth conditions and pacing rates. We also demonstrated deployment of optogenetic cell spheroids for point pacing to study conduction in 96-well format, and the use of temporal multiplexing to register voltage and calcium simultaneously on a single camera in this stand-alone platform. Opto-DyCE-plate showed excellent performance even in the small samples in 384-well plates, in the various configurations. Anisotropic structured constructs may provide some benefits in drug testing, although drug responses were consistent across tested configurations. Differential voltage vs. calcium responses were seen for some drugs, especially for non-traditional modulators of cardiac function, e.g. HDACi, and pacing rate was a powerful modulator of drug response, highlighting the need for comprehensive multiparametric assessment, as offered by OptoDyCE-plate. Increasing throughput and speed and reducing cost of screening can help stratify potential compounds early in the drug development process and accelerate the development of safer drugs.",

The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics develops two RDF datasets across multi species for the study of gene expression and orthology: Bgee and Orthologous MAtrix (OMA, an orthology database).\n\nMethodsThis study integrates the RIKEN BioResource knowledge graph with Resource Description Framework (RDF) datasets from Bgee, a gene expression database, the OMA, the DisGeNET, a human gene-disease association, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), UniProt, and four disease ontologies in the RIKEN BioResource MetaDatabase. Our aim is to explore which model organisms are most appropriate for specific medical science research applications, using SPARQL queries across the integrated datasets. More precisely, we attempt to explore disease-related genes, as well as anatomical parts where these genes are overexpressed and subsequently identify appropriate bioresource candidates available for specific disease research applications.\n\nResultsWe illustrate the above through two use cases targeting either Alzheimers disease or melanoma. We identified two Alzheimers disease-related genes that were overexpressed in the prefrontal cortex (APP and APOE) and 21 RIKEN bioresources predicted to be relevant to Alzheimers disease research. Furthermore, executing a transitive search for the Uberon terms by using the Property Paths function, we identified two melanoma-related genes (HRAS and PTEN), and eight anatomical parts in which these genes were overexpressed, such as the \"skin of limb\" as an example. Finally, we compared the performance of the federated SPARQL query via the remote Bgee SPARQL endpoint with the performance of a centralized SPARQL query using the Bgee dataset as part of the RIKEN BioResource MetaDatabase.\n\nConclusionsAs a result, we demonstrated that the performance of the federated approach degraded.

At a cellular level, rare cancer cells cease proliferation and survive chemotherapy and disseminate disease.

In addition, multiple RNA-seq comparisons were used to identify genes whose expression correlates with survival in dormancy. Combined, these approaches discover the Netrin signaling pathway as critical to dormant HGSOC cell survival. We demonstrate that Netrin-1 and -3, UNC5H receptors, DCC and other fibronectin receptors induce low level ERK activation to promote survival in dormant conditions. Furthermore, we determine that Netrin-1 and -3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC and demonstrate their overexpression elevates cell survival in dormant conditions.

    "abstract": "The ability to control each finger independently is an essential component of human hand dexterity. A common observation of hand function impairment after stroke is the loss of this finger individuation ability, often referred to as enslavement, i.e., the unwanted coactivation of non-intended fingers in individuated finger movements. In the previous literature, this impairment has been attributed to several factors, such as the loss of corticospinal drive, an intrusion of flexor synergy due to upregulations of the subcortical pathways, and/or biomechanical constraints. These factors may or may not be mutually exclusive and are often difficult to tease apart. It has also been suggested, based on a prevailing impression, that the intrusion of flexor synergy appears to be an exaggerated pattern of the involuntary coactivations of task-irrelevant fingers seen in a healthy hand, often referred to as a flexor bias. Most previous studies, however, were based on assessments of enslavement in a single dimension (i.e., finger flexion/extension) that coincide with the flexor bias, making it difficult to tease apart the other aforementioned factors. Here, we set out to closely examine the nature of individuated finger control and finger coactivation patterns in all dimensions. Using a novel measurement device and a 3D finger-individuation paradigm, we aim to tease apart the contributions of lower biomechanical, subcortical constraints, and top-down cortical control to these patterns in both healthy and stroke hands. For the first time, we assessed all five fingers full capacity for individuation. Our results show that these patterns in the healthy and paretic hands present distinctly different shapes and magnitudes that are not influenced by biomechanical constraints. Those in the healthy hand presented larger angular distances that were dependent on top-down task goals, whereas those in the paretic hand presented larger Euclidean distances that arise from two dissociable factors: a loss of complexity in finger control and the dominance of an intrusion of flexor bias. These results suggest that finger individuation impairment after stroke is due to two dissociable factors: the loss of finger control complexity present in the healthy hand reflecting a top-down neural control strategy and an intrusion of flexor bias likely due to an upregulation of subcortical pathways. Our device and paradigm are demonstrated to be a promising tool to assess all aspects of the dexterous capacity of the hand.",

Unfortunately, these methods can prove difficult to interpret, as it may not be immediately obvious how models reach their predictions. We present the data processing kitchen sink (DPKS) which provides reproducible access to classic statistical methods and advanced explainable machine learning algorithms to build highly accurate and fully interpretable predictive models. In DPKS, explainable machine learning methods are used to calculate the importance of each protein towards the prediction of a model for a particular proteome state. The calculated importance of each protein can enable the identification of proteins that drive phenotypic change in a data-driven manner while classic techniques rely on arbitrary cutoffs that may exclude important features from consideration.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) XBB lineages have achieved dominance worldwide and keep on evolving. Convergent evolution of XBB lineages on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) L455F and F456L is observed, resulting in variants like EG.5, FL.1.5.1, XBB.1.5.70, and HK.3. Here, we show that neutralizing antibody (NAb) evasion drives the convergent evolution of F456L, while the epistatic shift caused by F456L enables the subsequent convergence of L455F through ACE2 binding enhancement and further immune evasion. Specifically, L455F and F456L evades Class 1 NAbs, which could reduce the neutralization efficacy of XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfection convalescent plasma. Importantly, L455F single substitution significantly dampens receptor binding; however, the combination of L455F and F456L forms an adjacent residue flipping, which leads to enhanced NAbs resistance and ACE2 binding affinity. Our results indicate the evolution flexibility contributed by epistasis cannot be underestimated, and the evolution potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD remains high.\n\nHighlightsO_LIL455F and F456L enhance the resistance to Class 1 NAbs\nC_LIO_LIL455F and F456L lower neutralization of XBB BTI convalescent plasma\nC_LIO_LIL455F+F456L flipping significantly increases ACE2 binding affinity\nC_LI",

The reduction of humoral immunity due to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has signaled the need for an update to vaccine composition. A strain change for all authorized/approved vaccines to a monovalent composition with Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 has been supported by the WHO, EMA, and FDA. Here, we demonstrate that immunization with a monovalent recombinant spike protein COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax, Inc.) based on the subvariant XBB.1.5 induces cross-neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, EG.5.1, and XBB.1.16.6 subvariants, promotes higher pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers than bivalent (Prototype + XBB.1.5) vaccine, induces SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Th1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses against XBB subvariants, and robustly boosts antibody responses in mice and nonhuman primates primed with a variety of monovalent and bivalent vaccines.

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses transcribe and replicate their genome in the nucleus of the infected cells, two functions that are supported by the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (FluPol). FluPol displays structural flexibility related to distinct functional states, from an inactive form to conformations competent for replication and transcription. FluPol machinery is constituted by a structurally-invariant core comprising the PB1 subunit stabilized with PA and PB2 domains, whereas the PA endonuclease and PB2 C-domains can pack in different configurations around the core. To get insights into the functioning of FluPol, we selected single-domain nanobodies (VHHs) specific of the influenza A FluPol core. When expressed intracellularly, several of them exhibited inhibitory activity on type A FluPol, but not on the type B one. The most potent VHH (VHH16) targets PA, but preferentially bind the PA-PB1 dimer with an affinity below the nanomolar range. Ectopic intracellular expression of VHH16 in virus permissive cells blocks multiplication of different influenza A subtypes, even when induced at late times post-infection. VHH16 was found to impair the transport of the PA-PB1 dimer to the nucleus, without affecting its handling by the importin b RanBP5 and subsequent steps in FluPol assembly. These data suggest that the VHH16 neutralization activity is likely due to an alteration of the import of the PA-PB1 dimer into the nucleus, resulting to an inhibition of FluPol functioning. VHH16 binding site represent a potential target for antiviral development.",

    "abstract": "The use of slowly degrading pesticides poses a particular problem when these are applied to urban areas such as gravel paths. The urban gravel provides an environment very different from agricultural soils; i.e., it is both lower in carbon and microbial activity. We, therefore, endeavoured to stimulate the degradation of the pesticide diflufenican added to an urban gravel microcosm amended with dry alfalfa to increase microbial activity.\n\nIn the present study, the formation of the primary diflufenican metabolite 2-[3-(Trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]nicotinic acid (commonly abbreviated as AE-B) was stimulated by the alfalfa amendment. The concurrent changes of the active microbial communities within the gravel were explored using shotgun metatranscriptomic sequencing of ribosomal RNA and messenger RNA. Our results showed, that while the active microbial communities in the gravel were dominated by bacteria with a relative abundance of 87.0 - 98.5 %, the eukaryotic groups, fungi and micro-eukaryotes, both had a 4-5 fold increase in relative abundance over time in the alfalfa amended treatment. Specifically, the relative abundance of microorganisms involved in degradation of complex carbon sources, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Sordariomycetes, Mortierellales, and Tremellales, were shown to increase in the alfalfa amended treatment. Further, the functional gene profile showed an increase in genes involved in increased activity and production of new biomass in the alfalfa treatment compared to the control, as well as pointing to genes potentially involved in biodegradation of complex carbon sources and the biotransformation of diflufenican.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics have rapidly become a standard tool for decoding cell identity, fate, and interactions in mammalian model organisms. Adopting these techniques to uncover functional dynamics in aquatic single-celled organisms holds huge potential, but evidence of their applicability to non-model, poorly understood microeukaryotes remains limited. In the present study, live Ochro-monas triangulata cells from fast and slow growth phases were FACS-sorted based on food vacuole staining and chlorophyll fluorescence, and single-cell transcriptomic libraries were prepared following the Smart-seq2 protocol. In total, 744 transcriptomes were Illumina sequenced. Lacking a reference genome, transcriptomes were assembled de novo using Trinity and resulting transcripts were annotated by BLAST using the Swiss-Prot database. Following read mapping, differential gene expression was evaluated using DESeq2 and metabolic maps were generated based on pathways from the KEGG Orthology database. Clustering the read counts revealed the identity of the two expected transcriptional states corresponding to each growth phase as well as a third distinct cluster of cells present in both growth phases. This cryptic group showed extensive downregulation of genes in pathways associated with ribosome-functioning, CO2 fixation and core carbohydrate catabolism such as glycolysis, {beta} oxidation of fatty acids, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Nevertheless, the biological underpinnings of this cluster, which would have remained unnoticed in an integrated approach, could not be clarified. Additionally, the possibility of using carry-over rRNA reads for taxonomic annotation was tested, which revealed specific individual-level bacterial communities associated with members within each cluster, as well as verified identification of 88% of the cells as O. triangulata. In conclusion, we demonstrate the power of single cell transcriptomics for metabolic mapping of microeukaryotes for which genomic reference resources might be limited, and thereby highlight its potential as a tool to gain access to microeukaryote dynamics and diversity in natural communities.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To test cefiderocol, a siderophore-cephalosporin antibiotic for topical monotherapy treatment of experimental extensively drug resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis. Design: Preclinical study. Subjects and Controls: Deidentified P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates, XDR P. aeruginosa from eye drop outbreak, rabbits, saline, cefiderocol 50 mg/ml, ciprofloxacin 0.3%, and tobramycin 14 mg/ml. Methods, Intervention, or Testing: Cefiderocol antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates (n=135) was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. Ocular toxicity/tolerability and antibacterial efficacy were tested in vivo with experimental rabbit models. Main Outcome Measures: MIC analysis for susceptibility, graded tests for ocular toxicity/tolerability, CFU analysis for bacterial burden, corneal cefiderocol concentrations. Results: 100% of P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates were susceptible to cefiderocol (n=135), the MIC90 was 0.125 ug/ml including the XDR isolate (MIC = 0.125 ug/ml). Topical cefiderocol 50 mg/ml was minimally toxic to the ocular surface and was well tolerated. For the XDR P. aeruginosa isolate, topical cefiderocol 50 mg/ml, significantly decreased corneal CFU compared to ciprofloxacin 0.3%, tobramycin 14 mg/ml, and saline. In addition, tobramycin 14 mg/ml was more effective than the saline control. Mean cefiderocol corneal concentrations were 191x greater than the MIC90 of the P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cefiderocol is well tolerated on rabbit corneas and is effective against P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates in vitro and was effective in vivo against an XDR isolate. Given the recent outbreak of keratitis caused by this XDR P. aeruginosa, cefiderocol is a promising additional antibiotic that should be further evaluated for topical treatment of keratitis caused by antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa.",

This led to the creation of AMPSphere, a comprehensive catalog comprising 863,498 non-redundant peptides, the majority of which were previously unknown. We observed that AMP production varies by habitat, with animal-associated samples displaying the highest proportion of AMPs compared to other habitats. Furthermore, within different human-associated microbiota, strain-level differences were evident. To validate our predictions, we synthesized and experimentally tested 50 AMPs, demonstrating their efficacy against clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens both in vitro and in vivo. These AMPs exhibited antibacterial activity by targeting the bacterial membrane. Additionally, AMPSphere provides valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of peptides. In conclusion, our approach identified AMP sequences within prokaryotic microbiomes, opening up new avenues for the discovery of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) induces mammary tumors in mice. Recently, we have shown that MMTV perturbs expression of the host miR-17-92 cluster in MMTV-infected mammary glands and MMTV-induced mammary tumors. Known as oncomiR-1, this cluster is often dysregulated in a number of cancers, especially breast cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether there was a functional interaction between MMTV and the cluster. Our results reveal that MMTV expression led to dysregulation of the cluster in both mammary epithelial HC11 and HEK293T cells with the expression of miR-92a cluster member being affected the most. Conversely, over-expression of the whole or partial cluster significantly repressed MMTV expression. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-92a alone resulted in MMTV repression to the same extent as observed with the whole or partial cluster. Inhibition of miR-92a led to nearly a complete recovery of MMTV gene expression. Deletion/substitution of the miR-92a seed sequence within the cluster rescued MMTV expression. Dual luciferase assays identified MMTV genomic RNA as the target of miR-92a. These results show that the miR-17-92 cluster acts as part of the cell's well-known miRNA-based anti-viral response to thwart incoming MMTV infection. Interestingly, miR-92a expression was the least amongst cluster members in MMTV-induced breast tumors, suggesting that the elevated level of MMTV expression in tumors is due perhaps to MMTV subverting miR-92a overexpression, restricting its ability to control MMTV replication during tumorigenesis. Thus, our study provides the first evidence demonstrating the biological significance of host miRNAs in controlling MMTV replication and influencing the process of tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Efflux of antibiotics is a survival strategy in bacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has approximately sixty efflux pumps, but little is known about the role of each pump, or which moieties that they efflux. The putative efflux pump, EfpA, is a member of the major facilitator superfamily that has been shown to be essential by saturation transposon mutagenesis studies. It has been implicated in the efflux of the frontline drug isoniazid (INH) in M. tuberculosis. This is supported by evidence from transcriptional profiling that efpA is induced in response to INH exposure. However, its role in physiology and adaptation of M. tuberculosis to antibiotics, have yet to be determined. Here, we describe the repression of efpA using CRISPR interference and the direct effect of this on the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive exposure to INH over a 45-day time-course. We determined that wild-type levels of efpA were required for the recovery of M. tuberculosis cultures following INH exposure and that, after 45-days of INH exposure, no viable colonies were recoverable from efpA-repressed M. tuberculosis cultures. We postulate that EfpA is required for the recovery of M. tuberculosis following INH-exposure and that EfpA may have a role in the development of resistance, during treatment and contributes to relapse in patients.",

The exact consequence of accumulating lcFAO-intermediates and possible influence on cellular lipid homeostasis are, however, still unknown. To investigate the fate and cellular effects of the accumulating lcFAO-intermediates and to explore new disease markers, we used tracer-based lipidomics with deuterium-labeled oleic acid (D9-C18:1) in lcFAOD patient-derived fibroblasts. In line with previous studies, we observed a trend towards neutral lipid accumulation in lcFAOD. In addition, we detected a direct connection between the chain length and patterns of (un)saturation of accumulating acylcarnitines and the various enzyme deficiencies. Our results also identified two new candidate disease markers. Lysophosphatidylcholine(14:1) (LPC(14:1)) was specifically increased in severe VLCADD compared to mild VLCADD and control samples. This was confirmed in plasma samples showing an inverse correlation with enzyme activity, which was better than the classic diagnostic marker C14:1-carnitine. The second biomarker is an unknown lipid class, which we identified as S-(3-hydroxyacyl)cysteamines. These are hypothesized to be degradation products of the CoA moiety of accumulating 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs. S-(3-hydroxyacyl)cysteamines were significantly increased in LCHADD compared to controls and other lcFAOD, including MTPD. Our findings suggest extensive alternative lipid metabolism in lcFAOD and confirm that lcFAOD accumulate neutral lipid species. In addition, we present two new disease markers for VLCADD and LCHADD, that may have significant relevance for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring.",

We used a 19-residue probe peptide spanning the R2/R3 splice junction of tau to induce aggregation specifically of 4R, but not 3R tau. The aggregates can propagate as isoform-specific seeds over multiple generations, have a high {beta}-sheet content, a lipid signal, and resemble the PSP cryo-EM fold. A simulation of peptide free energy landscapes pinpointed the features of the hairpin structure uniquely found in the cryo-EM structures of pure 4R tauopathies and captured in the peptide. These molecular dynamic simulations were experimentally validated by the S305K substitution in 4R tau, corresponding to the position found in 3R tau. This single amino acid substitution prevented tau aggregates induced by the prion-like probe peptide. The tau aggregates were dynamic and displayed growth, stability, and shrinking over time.

    "abstract": "Senescent cells accumulate in tissues with organismal age and contribute causally to multiple chronic diseases. In vivo senescent cell phenotypes are heterogeneous because cellular context and stressors vary by cell type and tissue. Due to the variability of senescence programs, there is no universal method to identify senescent cells and even widely used markers, such as CDKN2A, are not ubiquitous. Therefore, we interrogated the Tabula Muris Senis mouse single-cell aging atlas and an array of single-cell datasets from human donors that spanned many ages to find cell-specific signatures of cellular senescence. We derived 75 mouse and 65 human senescence signatures from individual cell populations. CDKN2A and other markers of senescence were overrepresented in these signatures but there were many novel senescence genes present at higher rates. Within individual cell populations, we observed multiple programs of senescence with distinct temporal and transcriptional characteristics. We packaged the signatures along with a single-cell scoring method into an open-source package: SenePy. SenePy signatures better recapitulate cellular senescence than available methods when tested on multiple in vivo RNA-seq datasets and a p16ink4a reporter single-cell dataset. We used SenePy to map the kinetics of senescent cell accumulation across 97 cell types from humans and mice. SenePy also generalizes to disease-associate senescence and we used it to identify an increased burden of senescent cells in COVID-19 and myocardial infarction. This work provides a significant advancement towards our ability to identify and characterize in vivo cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria possess a complex structural cell envelope that constitutes a barrier for antimicrobial peptides which neutralize the microbes by disrupting their cell membranes. Computational and experimental approaches were used to study a model outer membrane interaction with an antimicrobial peptide, melittin. The investigated membrane included di[3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonyl]-lipid A (KLA) in the outer leaflet and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) in the inner leaflet. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed, that the positively charged helical C-terminus of melittin anchors rapidly into the hydrophilic head-group region of KLA, while the flexible N-terminus makes contacts with the phosphate groups of KLA moving melittin into the boundary between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the lipids. Electrochemical techniques confirmed binding of melittin to the model membrane. To probe the peptide conformation and orientation during interaction with the membrane, polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy was used. The measurements revealed conformational changes in the peptide accompanied by reorientation and translocation of the peptide at the membrane surface. The study suggests that melittin insertion into the outer membrane affects its permeability and capacitance, but does not disturb the membrane's integrity, indicating a distinct mechanism of the peptide action on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.",

The Sm-like protein Rof, a homolog of the RNA chaperone Hfq, inhibits {rho}-dependent termination in vivo but recapitulation of this activity in vitro has proven difficult and the precise mode of Rof action is presently unknown. Our electron microscopic structures of {rho}-Rof and {rho}-RNA complexes show that Rof undergoes pronounced conformational changes to bind {rho} at the protomer interfaces, undercutting {rho} conformational dynamics associated with ring closure and occluding extended primary RNA-binding sites that are also part of interfaces between {rho} and RNA polymerase. Consistently, Rof impedes {rho} ring closure, {rho}-RNA interactions, and {rho} association with transcription elongation complexes. Structure-guided mutagenesis coupled with functional assays confirmed that the observed {rho}-Rof interface is required for Rof-mediated inhibition of cell growth and {rho}-termination in vitro. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that Rof is restricted to Pseudomonadota and that the {rho}-Rof interface is conserved. Genomic contexts of rof differ between Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae, suggesting distinct modes of Rof regulation. We hypothesize that Rof and other cellular anti-terminators silence {rho} under diverse, but yet to be identified, stress conditions when unrestrained transcription termination by {rho} would be lethal.",

    "abstract": "Severe heat stress causes massive loss of essential proteins by aggregation necessitating a cellular activity that rescues aggregated proteins. This activity is executed by ATP-dependent, ring-forming, hexameric AAA+ disaggregases. Little is known about the recognition principles of stress-induced protein aggregates. How can disaggregases specifically target aggregated proteins while avoiding binding to soluble non-native proteins? Here, we determined by NMR spectroscopy the core structure of the aggregate targeting N1 domain of the bacterial AAA+ disaggregase ClpG, which confers extreme heat resistance to bacteria. N1 harbors a Zn2+-coordination site that is crucial for structural integrity and disaggregase functionality. Conserved hydrophobic N1 residues located on a {beta}-strand were found crucial for aggregate targeting and disaggregation activity. Mixing experiments with N1-truncated AAA+ hexamers revealed that a minimal number of four N1 domains must be present in a AAA+ ring for high disaggregation activity. We suggest that multiple N1 domains increase substrate affinity through avidity effects. These findings define the recognition principle of a protein aggregate by a disaggregase, involving simultaneous contacts with multiple hydrophobic substrate patches located in close vicinity on an aggregate surface. This binding mode ensures selectivity for aggregated proteins while sparing soluble, non-native protein structures from disaggregase activity.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid desaturation is central to metazoan lipid metabolism and provides building blocks of membrane lipids and precursors of diverse signaling molecules. Nutritional conditions and associated microbiota regulate desaturase expression, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, we show that endogenous and microbiota-dependent small molecule signals promote lipid desaturation via the nuclear receptor NHR-49/PPAR in C. elegans. Untargeted metabolomics of a {beta}-oxidation mutant, acdh-11, in which expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase FAT-7/SCD1 is constitutively increased, revealed accumulation of a {beta}-cyclopropyl fatty acid, becyp#1, that potently activates fat-7 expression via NHR-49. Biosynthesis of becyp#1 is strictly dependent on expression of cyclopropane synthase by associated bacteria, e.g., E. coli. Screening for structurally related endogenous metabolites revealed a {beta}-methyl fatty acid, bemeth#1, whose activity mimics that of microbiota-dependent becyp#1, but is derived from a methyltransferase, fcmt-1, that is conserved across Nematoda and likely originates from bacterial cyclopropane synthase via ancient horizontal gene transfer. Activation of fat-7 expression by these structurally similar metabolites is controlled by distinct mechanisms, as microbiota-dependent becyp#1 is metabolized by a dedicated {beta}-oxidation pathway, while the endogenous bemeth#1 is metabolized via -oxidation. Collectively, we demonstrate that evolutionarily related biosynthetic pathways in metazoan host and associated microbiota converge on NHR-49/PPAR to regulate fat desaturation.",

    "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides are major constituents of the extracellular matrix, involved in myriad structural and signaling processes. Mature HS polysaccharides contain complex, non-templated patterns of sulfation and epimerization, which mediate interactions with diverse protein partners. Complex HS modifications form around initial clusters of glucosamine-N-sulfate (GlcNS) on nascent polysaccharide chains, but the mechanistic basis underpinning incorporation of the GlcNS modification itself into HS remains unclear. We have determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase (NDST)1, the bifunctional enzyme responsible for initial GlcNS modification of HS. Our structures reveal the architecture of both NDST1 deacetylase and sulfotransferase catalytic domains, alongside a previously unreported non-catalytic N-terminal domain. Surprisingly, the two catalytic domains of NDST1 adopt an unusual back-to-back topology that limits direct cooperativity. Binding analyses, aided by novel activity modulating nanobodies, suggest that sulfotransferase domain substrate anchoring initiates the NDST1 catalytic cycle, providing a plausible mechanism for cooperativity despite spatial domain separation. Our data shed light on key determinants of NDST1 activity, and describe tools to probe NDST1 function in vitro and in vivo.",

Mitotic entry is initiated by increased phosphorylation of mitotic proteins, a process driven by kinases, while mitotic exit is achieved by counteracting dephosphorylation, a process driven by phosphatases, especially PP2A:B55. While the role of kinases in mitotic entry is well-established, recent data have shown that mitosis is only successfully initiated when the counterbalancing phosphatases are also inhibited. For PP2A:B55, inhibition is achieved by the two intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), ARPP19 (phosphorylation-dependent) and FAM122A (inhibition is phosphorylation-independent). Despite their critical roles in mitosis, the mechanisms by which they achieve PP2A:B55 inhibition is unknown.

Consistent with our complementary NMR spectroscopy studies both IDPs bind PP2A:B55, but do so in highly distinct manners, unexpectedly leveraging multiple distinct binding sites on B55.

    "abstract": "A distinctive signature of the prion diseases is the accumulation of the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, in the central nervous system of prion-affected humans and animals. PrPSc is also found in peripheral tissues, raising concerns about the potential transmission of pathogenic prions through human food supplies and posing a significant risk to public health. Although muscle tissues are considered to contain levels of low prion infectivity, it has been shown that myotubes in culture efficiently propagate PrPSc. Given the high consumption of muscle tissue, it is important to understand what factors could influence the establishment of a prion infection in muscle tissue. Here we used in vitro myotube cultures, differentiated from the C2C12 myoblast cell line (dC2C12), to identify factors affecting prion replication. A range of experimental conditions revealed that PrPSc is tightly associated with proteins found in the systemic extracellular matrix (ECM), mostly fibronectin (FN). The interaction of PrPSc with FN decreased prion infectivity, as determined by standard scrapie cell assay. Interestingly, the prion-resistant reserve cells in dC2C12 cultures displayed a FN-rich ECM while the prion-susceptible myotubes expressed FN at a low level. In agreement with the in vitro results, immunohistopathological analyses of tissues from sheep infected with natural scrapie demonstrated a prion susceptibility phenotype linked to an extracellular matrix with undetectable levels of FN. Conversely, PrPSc deposits were not observed in tissues expressing FN. These data indicate that extracellular FN may act as a natural barrier against prion replication and that the extracellular matrix composition may be a crucial feature determining prion tropism in different tissues.\n\nAuthor summaryPrion diseases are complex fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by a misfolded form of the cellular protein PrPC (PrPSc). Due to the potential zoonotic transmission of these disorders through animal-based food intake, it is crucial to identify the tissues in which PrPSc can accumulate and what might influence its tropism. Animal muscle (or meat) and related food products are highly consumed, raising concern of the involvement of muscle cells in prion replication. Muscle tissue from prion-affected animals contains low levels of infectivity and PrPSc is mostly associated with nerve structures rather than myofibers, whereas C2C12 myotubes, a muscle-derived cell type, efficiently replicate prions in vitro and generate high levels of infectivity compared with other cell cultures. We demonstrate a fibronectin-mediated interference with prion infection in differentiated C2C12 cultures that correlates with the findings in tissues from naturally scrapie-infected animals. Our results suggest that extracellular matrix composition, specifically regarding the presence of fibronectin, might determine prion tropism and dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a LOV domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and non-perturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.",

Such altered memory states drive monocyte dysregulation during sepsis, promoting pathogenic behavior characterized by pro-inflammatory, immunosuppressive gene expression in concert with emergency hematopoiesis. Epigenetic changes, notably in the form of histone modifications, have been shown to underlie innate immune memory, but the contribution of DNA methylation to this process remains poorly understood. Using an ex vivo sepsis model, we discovered broad changes in DNA methylation throughout the genome of exhausted monocytes, including at several genes previously implicated as major drivers of immune dysregulation during sepsis and Covid-19 infection (e.g. Plac8). Methylome alterations are driven in part by Wnt signaling inhibition in exhausted monocytes, and can be reversed through treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, Wnt agonists, or immune training molecules. Importantly, these changes are recapitulated in septic mice following cecal slurry injection, resulting in stable changes at critical immune genes that support the involvement of DNA methylation in acute and long-term monocyte dysregulation during sepsis.",

Additionally, colonization is achieved by many strain types that exhibit high diversity in genetic content. Thus, we aimed to study strain-specific requirements for K. pneumoniae GI colonization by applying transposon insertion sequencing to three classical clinical strains: a carbapenem-resistant strain, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strain, and a non-epidemic antibiotic-susceptible strain. The transposon insertion libraries were screened in a murine model of GI colonization. At three days post-inoculation, 27 genes were required by all three strains for colonization. Isogenic deletion mutants for three genes/operons (acrA, carAB, tatABCD) confirmed colonization defects in each of the three strains. Additionally, deletion of acrA reduced bile tolerance in vitro, while complementation restored both bile tolerance in vitro and colonization ability in vivo. Transposon insertion sequencing suggested that some genes were more important for colonization of one strain than the others. For example, deletion of the sucrose porin-encoding gene scrY resulted in a colonization defect in the carbapenemase-producing strain but not in the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer or the antibiotic-susceptible strain. These findings demonstrate that classical K. pneumoniae strains use both shared and strain-specific strategies to colonize the mouse GI tract.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance and tolerance remain a major problem for treatment of staphylococcal infections. Knowing genes that influence antibiotic susceptibility could open the door to novel antimicrobial strategies, including targets for new synergistic drug combinations. Here, we developed a genome-wide CRISPR interference library for >Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrated its use by quantifying the essentialome in different strains through CRISPRi-seq, and used it to identify genes that modulate susceptibility to the lipoglycopeptide dalbavancin. By exposing the library to sublethal concentrations of dalbavancin using both CRISPRi-seq and direct selection methods, we found genes previously reported to be involved in antibiotic susceptibility, but also identified genes thus far unknown to affect antibiotic tolerance. Importantly, some of these genes could not have been detected by more conventional knock-out approaches because they are essential for growth, stressing the complementary value of CRISPRi-based methods. Notably, knockdown of a gene encoding the uncharacterized protein KapB specifically sensitizes the cells to dalbavancin, but not to other antibiotics of the same class, while knockdown of the Shikimate pathway surprisingly has the opposite effect. The results presented here demonstrate the potential of CRISPRi-seq screens to identify genes and pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility and pave the way to explore alternative antimicrobial treatments through these insights.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a rapid and highly accurate method to determine isotopomer patterns in isotopically labeled compounds. Here, we developed a novel method for tracer-based metabolomics using CE-MS for underivatized proteinogenic amino acids. The method consisting of a ZipChip CE system and a high-resolution Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer allows us to obtain highly accurate data from 1 L of 100 nmol/L mol amino acids comparable to a mere 1 x 104-5 prokaryotic cells. To validate the capability of the CE-MS method, we analyzed 16 protein-derived amino acids from a methanogenic archaeon Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus as a model organism, and the mass spectra showed sharp peaks with low mass errors and background noise. Tracer-based metabolome analysis was then performed to identify the central carbon metabolism in M. thermautotrophicus using 13C-labeled substrates. The mass isotopomer distributions of serine, aspartate, and glutamate revealed the co-occurrence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and an incomplete reductive TCA cycle for carbon fixation. In addition, biosynthesis pathways of 15 amino acids were constructed based on the mass isotopomer distributions of the detected protein-derived amino acid, genomic information, and public database. Among them, the presence of the alternative enzymes of alanine dehydrogenase, ornithine cyclodeaminase, and homoserine kinase was suggested in the biosynthesis pathways of alanine, proline, and threonine, respectively. To our knowledge, the novel 13C tracer-based metabolomics using CE-MS is the most efficient method to identify central carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis pathways and is applicable to in any kind of isolated microbe.",

    "abstract": "RexA and RexB function as an exclusion system that prevents bacteriophage T4rII mutants from growing on E. coli lambda phage lysogens. Recent data established that RexA is a non-specific DNA binding protein that can act independently of RexB to bias the lambda bistable switch toward the lytic state, preventing conversion back to lysogeny. The molecular interactions underlying these activities are unknown, owing in part to a dearth of structural information. Here we present the 2.05-Angstrom crystal structure of the lambda RexA dimer, which reveals a two-domain architecture with unexpected structural homology to the recombination-associated protein RdgC. Modelling suggests that our structure adopts a closed conformation and would require significant domain rearrangements to facilitate DNA binding. Mutagenesis coupled with electromobility shift assays, limited proteolysis, and double electron-electron spin resonance spectroscopy support a DNA-dependent conformational change. In vivo phenotypes of RexA mutants suggest that DNA binding is not a strict requirement for phage exclusion but may directly contribute to modulation of the bistable switch. We further demonstrate that RexA homologs from other temperate phages also dimerize and bind DNA in vitro. Collectively, these findings advance our mechanistic understanding of Rex functions and provide new evolutionary insights into different aspects of phage biology.",

    "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control gene expression is pivotal in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. However, in most non-model and pest insect species, empirical evidence for predictable modulation of gene expression levels is lacking. This knowledge gap is critical for genetic control systems, particularly in mosquitoes, where transgenic methods offer novel routes for pest control. Commonly, the choice of RNA polymerase II promoter (Pol II) is the primary method for controlling gene expression, but the options are limited.\n\nTo address this, we developed a systematic approach to characterize modifications in translation initiation sequences (TIS) and 3 untranslated regions (UTR) of transgenes, enabling the creation of a toolbox for gene expression modulation in mosquitoes and potentially other insects. The approach demonstrated highly predictable gene expression changes across various cell lines and promoter sequences, representing a significant advancement in mosquito synthetic biology gene expression. tools.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/555539v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1477bc2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e2b58org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fd1b9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1f906_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The use of omics data for monitoring the microbial flow of fresh meat products along a production line and the development of spoilage prediction tools from these data is a promising but challenging task. In this context, we produced a large multivariate dataset (over 600 samples) obtained on the production lines of two similar types of fresh meat products (poultry and raw pork sausages).We describe a full analysis of this dataset in order to decipher how the spoilage microbial ecology of these two similar products may be shaped differently depending on production parameter characteristics.\n\nOur strategy involved a holistic approach to integrate unsupervised and supervised statistical methods on multivariate data (OTU-based microbial diversity; metabolomic data of volatile organic compounds; sensory measurements; growth parameters), and a specific selection of potential uncontrolled (initial microbiota composition) or controlled (packaging type; lactate concentration) drivers.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the initial microbiota, which is shown to be very different between poultry and pork sausages, has a major impact on the spoilage scenarios and on the effect that a downstream parameter such as packaging type has on the overall evolution of the microbial community. Depending on the process, we also show that specific actions on the pork meat (such as deboning and defatting) elicit specific food spoilers such as Dellaglioa algida, which becomes dominant during storage. Finally, ecological network reconstruction allowed us to map six different metabolic pathways involved in the production of volatile organic compounds involved in spoilage. We were able connect them to the different bacterial actors and to the influence of packaging type in an overall view. For instance, our results demonstrate a new role of Vibrionaceae in isopropanol production, and of Latilactobacillus fuchuensis and Lactococcus piscium in methanethiol/disylphide production. We also highlight a possible commensal behavior between Leuconostoc carnosum and Latilactobacillus curvatus around 2,3-butanediol metabolism.\n\nWe conclude that our holistic approach combined with large-scale multi-omic data was a powerful strategy to prioritize the role of production parameters, already known in the literature, that shape the evolution and/or the implementation of different meat spoilage scenarios.",
