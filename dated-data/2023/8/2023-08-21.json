    "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing, a key process in gene expression, can be therapeutically modulated using various drug modalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, determining promising targets is impeded by the challenge of systematically mapping splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) in their native sequence context. Here, we use the catalytically dead CRISPR-RfxCas13d RNA-targeting system (dCas13d/gRNA) as a programmable platform to bind SREs and modulate splicing by competing against endogenous splicing factors. SpliceRUSH, a high-throughput screening method, was developed to map SREs in any gene of interest using a lentivirus gRNA library that tiles the genetic region, including distal intronic sequences. When applied to SMN2, a therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy, SpliceRUSH robustly identified not only known SREs, but also a novel distal intronic splicing enhancer, which can be targeted to alter exon 7 splicing using either dCas13d/gRNA or ASOs. This technology enables a deeper understanding of splicing regulation with applications for RNA-based drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Host-associated microbiomes vary greatly in composition both within and between host individuals, providing the raw material for natural selection to act on host-microbe associations. Nonetheless, the drivers of compositional heterogeneity in host-associated microbiomes have only rarely been examined. To understand how this heterogeneity arises, we utilize the squash bug, Anasa tristis, and its bacterial symbionts in the genus Caballeronia. We artificially modulate symbiont bottleneck size and strain diversity during colonization to demonstrate the significance of ecological drift, which causes stochastic fluctuations in community composition. Consistent with predictions from the neutral theory of biodiversity, ecological drift alone can account for heterogeneity in symbiont community composition between hosts, even when two strains are nearly genetically identical. When acting on competing, unrelated strains, ecological drift can maintain symbiont genetic diversity among different hosts by stochastically determining the dominant strain within each host. Finally, ecological drift mediates heterogeneity in isogenic symbiont populations even within a single host, along a consistent gradient running the anterior-posterior axis of the symbiotic organ. Our results demonstrate that symbiont population structure across scales does not necessarily require host-mediated selection, but emerges as a result of ecological drift acting on both isogenic and unrelated competitors. Our findings illuminate the processes that might affect symbiont transmission, coinfection, and population structure in nature, which can drive the evolution of host-microbe symbiosis and microbe-microbe interactions within host-associated microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are a deeply-conserved superfamily of metazoan transcription factors, which fine-tune the expression of their regulatory target genes in response to a plethora of sensory inputs. In nematodes, NHRs underwent an explosive expansion and many species have hundreds of nhr genes, most of which remain functionally uncharacterized. However, recent studies elucidated that two sister receptors, Ppa-NHR-1 and Ppa-NHR-40, are crucial down-stream regulators of feeding plasticity in the diplogastrid model organism Pristionchus pacificus. In this study, we functionally characterize Ppa-NHR-10, the closest paralog to Ppa-NHR-1 and Ppa-NHR-40, aiming to demonstrate that it too regulates aspects of feeding plasticity. We used CRISPR/CAS9-mediated mutagenesis to create knock-out mutations of this receptor and applied a combination of geometric morphometrics and unsupervised clustering to characterize potential mutant phenotypes. Surprisingly, we found that Ppa-NHR-10 is not involved in the regulation of plasticity in feeding structures. Instead, multiple RNA-seq experiments revealed that many of the target genes of this receptor are crucial for lipid catabolism. We hypothesized that their mis-regulation could affect the survival of mutant worms during starvation, where lipid catabolism is often essential. Using survival assays, we found that mutant worms indeed show drastically decreased starvation resistance, both as young adults and as dauer larvae. We also characterized genome-wide changes to the transcriptional landscape in P. pacificus when exposed to 24hrs of acute starvation, and found that Ppa-NHR-10 partially regulates some of these responses. Taken together, we were able to demonstrate that Ppa-NHR-10 is broadly required for starvation resistance and regulates different biological processes than its closest paralogs Ppa-NHR-1 and Ppa-NHR-40 and its one-to-one ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans. This shows that, amongst distantly-related model nematodes, even deeply-conserved NHRs can regulate vastly distinct biological processes and that neither paralogs, nor one-to-one orthologs, may be adequate predictors of their biological functions.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen predicting the biological function of a gene (or the protein it encodes) we usually use its homologs for reference since it is likely that our gene or protein of interest has homologs in a different organism (orthologs) or in the same organism (paralogs), whose biological roles have already been characterized via molecular genetic interventions. However, predicting biological functions from homologs can have its limitations. In this study, we functionally characterized a conserved nuclear receptor, Ppa-NHR-10, in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and found that both dauer larvae (a specialized dispersal stage) and adult worms are less resistant to starvation if this receptor is experimentally rendered non-functional. Not only did these findings reveal that Ppa-NHR-10 is crucial for the worms to survive harsh conditions they would frequently encounter in the wild, they also demonstrated that Ppa-NHR-10s homologs would not have been adequate predictors of its biological role: its homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans regulates a metabolic shunt pathway; its paralogs in P. pacificus regulate feeding plasticity. Thus, our data suggests that conserved nuclear receptors can functionally diversify across distantly-related nematodes, and that we cannot categorically infer their biological roles from well-studied homologs.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical transmission at synapses. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, can prune these synapses through a variety of contact-dependent and -independent means. Microglial secretion of active sialidase enzymes upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli is one unexplored mechanism of pruning. Recent work from our lab showed that treatment of neurons with bacterial sialidases disrupts neuronal network connectivity. Here, we find that activated microglia secrete Neuraminidase-3 (Neu3) associated with fusogenic extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we show Neu3 mediates contact-independent pruning of neurons and subsequent disruption of neuronal networks through neuronal glycocalyx remodeling. We observe that NEU3 is transcriptionally upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli, and that a genetic knock-out of NEU3 abrogates the sialidase activity of inflammatory microglial secretions. Moreover, we demonstrate that Neu3 is associated with a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles, possibly exosomes, that are secreted by microglia upon inflammatory insult. Finally, we demonstrate that Neu3 is both necessary and sufficient to both desialylate neurons and decrease neuronal network connectivity. These results implicate Neu3 in remodeling of the glycocalyx leading to aberrant network-level activity of neurons, with implications in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease.\n\nGraphical AbstractNeuroinflammation induces secretion of the sialidase Neu3 via extracellular vesicles from microglia that prune neuronal synapses and disrupt neuronal communication.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/554214v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6842a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ee3976org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fe7ec3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1345507_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin modifications alter protein function and stability, thereby regulating cell homeostasis and viability, particularly under stress. Ischemic stroke induces protein ubiquitination at the ischemic periphery, wherein cells remain viable, however the identity of ubiquitinated proteins is unknown. Here, we employed a proteomics approach to identify these proteins in mice undergoing ischemic stroke. The data are available in a searchable web interface (https://hochrainerlab.shinyapps.io/StrokeUbiOmics/). We detected increased ubiquitination of 198 proteins, many of which localize to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic neurons. Among these were proteins essential for maintaining PSD architecture, such as PSD95, as well as NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits. The largest enzymatic group at the PSD with elevated post-ischemic ubiquitination were kinases, such as CaMKII, PKC, Cdk5, and Pyk2, whose aberrant activities are well-known to contribute to post-ischemic neuronal death. Concurrent phospho-proteomics revealed altered PSD-associated phosphorylation patterns, indicative of modified kinase activities following stroke. PSD-located CaMKII, PKC, and Cdk5 activities were decreased while Pyk2 activity was increased after stroke. Removal of ubiquitin restored kinase activities to pre-stroke levels, identifying ubiquitination as the responsible molecular mechanism for post-ischemic kinase regulation. These findings unveil a previously unrecognized role of ubiquitination in the regulation of essential kinases involved in ischemic injury.",
