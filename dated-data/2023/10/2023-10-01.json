    "abstract": "Dysregulated branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism has emerged as a key metabolic feature associated with the obese insulin resistant state, and adipose BCAA catabolism is decreased in this context. BCAA catabolism is upregulated early in adipogenesis, but the impact of suppressing this pathway on the broader metabolic functions of the resultant adipocyte remain unclear. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 to target Bckdha and Acad8 in pre-adipocytes and induce a deficiency in BCAA or valine catabolism through differentiation. We characterise the transcriptional and metabolic phenotype of these cells using RNAseq and 13C metabolic flux analysis within a network spanning glycolysis, tricarboxylic (TCA) acid metabolism, BCAA catabolism, and fatty acid synthesis. While lipid droplet accumulation is maintained in Bckdha-deficient adipocytes, they display a more fibroblast-like transcriptional signature. In contrast, Acad8 deficiency minimally impacts gene expression. Decreased glycolytic flux emerges as the most distinct metabolic feature of Bckdha-deficient cells, accompanied by a [~]40% decrease in lactate secretion, yet pyruvate oxidation and utilization for de novo lipogenesis are increased to compensate for loss of BCAA carbon. Glutamine anaplerosis was also increased, though we observed a general decrease in levels of most non-essential amino acids consistent with an impact on nitrogen homeostasis. Overall, our data suggest that both metabolic and regulatory cross-talk exists between BCAA catabolism, glycolysis, and nitrogen metabolism in differentiated adipocytes. Suppression of BCAA catabolism associated with metabolic syndrome may result in a metabolically compromised adipocyte.",

    "abstract": "During foraging behavior, action values are persistently encoded in neural activity and updated depending on the history of choice outcomes. What is the neural mechanism for action value maintenance and updating? Here we explore two contrasting network models: synaptic learning of action value versus neural integration. We show that both models can reproduce extant experimental data, but they yield distinct predictions about the underlying biological neural circuits. In particular, the neural integrator model but not the synaptic model requires that reward signals are mediated by neural pools selective for action alternatives and their projections are aligned with linear attractor axes in the valuation system. We demonstrate experimentally observable neural dynamical signatures and feasible perturbations to differentiate the two contrasting scenarios, suggesting that the synaptic model is a more robust candidate mechanism. Overall, this work provides a modeling framework to guide future experimental research on probabilistic foraging.",

Here, hPSCs were cultured on homogeneous substrates with specific stiffness. Biocompatible material that allows spatial control of the chemical and mechanical environment for hPSC culture has not yet been developed. Culture substrates that allow flexible manipulation of spatial physical properties can assist the recapitulation of in vivo environment and assist tissue engineering.\n\nWe developed a photocurable polyethylene glycol-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-PEG) hydrogel which allows spatial control of the surface stiffness and structure at a micrometer level. The developed hydrogel can be functionalized using different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Laminin 511 functionalized PVA-PEG gel supports hPSCs growth and differentiation. Furthermore, by spatially controlling the stiffness of the patterned gel, we could selectively differentiate cells, generating complex patterned structures.",

Here, we combined large-scale single-unit recordings of mouse hippocampal CA1 with an established optogenetic approach enabling REMs-selective inhibition of medial septum GABAergic neurons (MSGABA), resulting in spatial memory deficits when applied post-learning. Although individual neural activity was unaffected by REMs-selective MSGABA inhibition during a post-learning rest session, both the synchrony of population-level activity bursts observed during REMs occurring in the rest session and place field stability measured during subsequent memory recall testing were reduced vs controls. However, the latter effect was limited to place cells participating in population activity during REMs, as stability of non-participant place cells was relatively weak and indifferent between groups. This suggests that synchronous CA1 population activity during REMs stabilizes spatial representations in a plastic subpopulation of participating CA1 neurons.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a pervasive problem that affects the lives of millions of people worldwide. Although records of drug-resistant mutations (DRMs) have been extensively tabulated within public repositories, our understanding of the evolutionary kinetics of DRMs and how they evolve together remains limited. Epistasis, the interactions between a DRM and other residues in HIV protein sequences, is found to be key to the temporal evolution of drug resistance. We use a Potts sequence-covariation statistical-energy model of HIV protein fitness under drug selection pressure, which captures epistatic interactions between all positions, combined with kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations of sequence evolutionary trajectories, to explore the acquisition of DRMs as they arise in an ensemble of drug-naive patient protein sequences. We follow the time course of 52 DRMs in the enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase, the primary targets of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The rates at which DRMs emerge are highly correlated with their observed acquisition rates reported in the literature when drug pressure is applied. This result highlights the central role of epistasis in determining the kinetics governing DRM emergence. Whereas rapidly acquired DRMs begin to accumulate as soon as drug pressure is applied, slowly acquired DRMs are contingent on accessory mutations that appear only after prolonged drug pressure. We provide a foundation for using computational methods to determine the temporal evolution of drug resistance using Potts statistical potentials, which can be used to gain mechanistic insights into drug resistance pathways in HIV and other infectious agents.\n\nSignificanceHIV affects the lives of millions of patients worldwide; cases of pan-resistant HIV are emerging. We use kinetic Monte-Carlo methods to simulate the evolution of drug resistance based on HIV patient-derived sequence data available on public databases. Our simulations capture the timeline for the evolution of DRMs reported in the literature across the major drug-target enzymes - PR, RT, and IN. The network of epistatic interactions with the primary DRMs determines the rate at which DRMs are acquired. The timeline is not explained by the overall fitness of the DRMs or features of the genetic code. This work provides a framework for the development of computational methods that forecast the time course over which drug resistance to antivirals develops in patients.",

    "abstract": "Understanding protein secretion pathways is paramount in studying diseases caused by bacteria and their respective treatments. Most such paths must signal ways to identify secretion. However, some proteins, known as non-classical secreted proteins, do not have signaling ways. This study aims to classify such proteins from predictive machine-learning techniques. We collected a set of physical-chemical characteristics of amino acids from the AA index site, bolding known protein motifs, like hydrophobicity. We developed a six-step method (Alignment, Preliminary classification, mean outliers, two Clustering algorithms, and Random choice) to filter data from raw genomes and compose a negative dataset in contrast to a positive dataset of 141 proteins from the literature. Using a conventional Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we obtained an accuracy of 91% on classifying non-classical secreted proteins in a validation dataset with 14 positive and 92 negative proteins - sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 86%, respectively, performance compared to state of the art for non-classical secretion classification. However, this works novelty resides in the fastness of executing non-CSP classification: instead of dozens of seconds to just one second considering a few dozen protein samples or only ten seconds to classify one hundred thousand proteins. Such fastness is more suitable for pan-genomic analyses than current methods without losing accuracy. Therefore, this research has shown that selecting an appropriate descriptors set and an expressive training dataset compensates for not using an advanced machine learning algorithm for the secretion by non-classical pathways purpose.

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that gene flow between closely related species is a widespread phenomenon. Alleles that introgress from one species into a close relative are typically neutral or deleterious, but sometimes confer a significant fitness advantage. Given the potential relevance to speciation and adaptation, numerous methods have therefore been devised to identify regions of the genome that have experienced introgression. Recently, supervised machine learning approaches have been shown to be highly effective for detecting introgression. One especially promising approach is to treat population genetic inference as an image classification problem, and feed an image representation of a population genetic alignment as input to a deep neural network that distinguishes among evolutionary models (i.e. introgression or no introgression). However, if we wish to investigate the full extent and fitness effects of introgression, merely identifying genomic regions in a population genetic alignment that harbor introgressed loci is insufficient--ideally we would be able to infer precisely which individuals have introgressed material and at which positions in the genome. Here we adapt a deep learning algorithm for semantic segmentation, the task of correctly identifying the type of object to which each individual pixel in an image belongs, to the task of identifying introgressed alleles. Our trained neural network is thus able to infer, for each individual in a two-population alignment, which of those individuals alleles were introgressed from the other population. We use simulated data to show that this approach is highly accurate, and that it can be readily extended to identify alleles that are introgressed from an unsampled \"ghost\" population, performing comparably to a supervised learning method tailored specifically to that task. Finally, we apply this method to data from Drosophila, showing that it is able to accurately recover introgressed haplotypes from real data. This analysis reveals that introgressed alleles are typically confined to lower frequencies within genic regions, suggestive of purifying selection, but are found at much higher frequencies in a region previously shown to be affected by adaptive introgression. Our methods success in recovering introgressed haplotypes in challenging real-world scenarios underscores the utility of deep learning approaches for making richer evolutionary inferences from genomic data.",

    "abstract": "When bilingual speakers switch back to speaking in their native language (L1) after having used their second language (L2), they often experience difficulty in retrieving words in their L1: this phenomenon is referred to as the L2 after-effect. We used the L2 after-effect as a lens to explore the neural bases of bilingual language control mechanisms. Our goal was twofold: first, to explore whether bilingual language control draws on domain-general or language-specific mechanisms; second, to investigate the precise mechanism(s) that drive the L2 after-effect. We used a precision fMRI approach based on functional localizers to measure the extent to which the brain activity that reflects the L2 after-effect overlaps with the language network (Fedorenko et al., 2010) and the domain-general Multiple Demand network (Duncan et al., 2010), as well as three task-specific networks that tap into interference resolution, lexical retrieval, and articulation. Forty-two Polish-English bilinguals participated in the study. Our results show that the L2 after-effect reflects increased engagement of domain-general but not language-specific resources. Furthermore, contrary to previously proposed interpretations, we did not find evidence that the effect reflects increased difficulty related to lexical access, articulation, and the resolution of lexical interference. We propose that difficulty of speech production in the picture naming paradigm - manifested as the L2 after-effect - reflects interference at a non-linguistic level of task schemas or a general increase of cognitive control engagement during speech production in L1 after L2.",

    "abstract": "Prestin responds to transmembrane voltage fluctuations by changing its cross-sectional area, a process underlying the electromotility of outer hair cells and cochlear amplification. Prestin belongs to the SLC26 family of anion transporters yet is the only member capable of displaying electromotility. Prestins voltage-dependent conformational changes are driven by the putative displacement of residue R399 and a set of sparse charged residues within the transmembrane domain, following the binding of a Cl- anion at a conserved binding site formed by amino termini of the TM3 and TM10 helices. However, a major conundrum arises as to how an anion that binds in proximity to a positive charge (R399), can promote the voltage sensitivity of prestin. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find that prestin displays an unstable anion-binding site, where folding of the amino termini of TM3 and TM10 is coupled to Cl- binding. This event shortens the TM3-TM10 electrostatic gap, thereby connecting the two helices, resulting in reduced cross-sectional area. These folding events upon anion-binding are absent in SLC26A9, a non-electromotile transporter closely related to prestin. Dynamics of prestin embedded in a lipid bilayer closely match that in detergent micelle, except for a destabilized lipid-facing helix TM6 that is critical to prestins mechanical expansion. We observe helix fraying at prestins anion-binding site but cooperative unfolding of multiple lipid-facing helices, features that may promote prestins fast electromechanical rearrangements. These results highlight a novel role of the folding equilibrium of the anion-binding site, and helps define prestins unique voltage-sensing mechanism and electromotility.",

While inspired by the classical step-selection framework and previous work on the quantification of uncertainty in movement predictions, MoveFormer also builds upon recent developments in deep learning, such as the Transformer architecture, allowing it to incorporate long temporal contexts. The model predicts an animals next movement step given its past movement history, including not only purely positional and temporal information, but also any available environmental covariates such as land cover or temperature. We apply our model to a diverse dataset made up of over 1550 trajectories from over 100 studies, and show how it can be used to gain insights about the importance of the provided context features, including the extent of past movement history.

The developed model is capable of translating visual stimulus inputs into corresponding signals evoked in the transfected retinal cells through optogenetic stimulation, calculating the subsequent neuronal activities of the following retinal layers, and estimating the resulted brains visual perception. As such, it can model and quantitatively analyze the impact of optical stimulation parameters (intensity, frequency, directivity, wavelength, etc.) and the LED arrays physical specifications (array size, density, pitch, implantation location, etc.) on the efficacy of the stimulation.\n\nUsing this model, we compared optical and electrical stimulations in terms of the structural similarity between their induced visual perception in the brain and the visual stimulus input. We showed that thanks to the cell-type specificity of optogenetic stimulation, it can induce more relevant visual perception qualities than electrical stimulation. We also showed that its resulted visual perception substantially improves with scaling the stimulators array size. The model was also used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of parameters such as implantation location, light intensity, single- and dual-wavelength stimulation, and illumination divergence angle on the quality of the optical-stimulation-induced visual perception. In each case, the simulation results were followed by our interpretation from a biological point of view. More importantly, in each case, we discussed how the results could be used for optimizing different parameters of an implantable optogenetic stimulator to achieve maximum efficacy and energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies have emerged as key therapeutics, and nanobodies are rapidly gaining momentum following the approval of the first nanobody drug in 2019. Nonetheless, the development of these biologics as therapeutics remains a challenge. Despite the availability of established in vitro directed evolution technologies that are relatively fast and cheap to deploy, the gold standard for generating therapeutic antibodies remains discovery from animal immunization or patients. Immune-system derived antibodies tend to have favourable properties in vivo, including long half-life, low reactivity with self-antigens, and low toxicity. Here, we present AbNatiV, a deep-learning tool for assessing the nativeness of antibodies and nanobodies, i.e., their likelihood of belonging to the distribution of immune-system derived human antibodies or camelid nanobodies. AbNatiV is a multi-purpose tool that accurately predicts the nativeness of Fv sequences from any source, including synthetic libraries and computational design. It provides an interpretable score that predicts the likelihood of immunogenicity, and a residue-level profile that can guide the engineering of antibodies and nanobodies indistinguishable from immune-system-derived ones. We further introduce an automated humanisation pipeline, which we applied to two nanobodies. Wet-lab experiments show that AbNatiV-humanized nanobodies retain binding and stability at par or better than their wild type, unlike nanobodies humanised relying on conventional structural and residue-frequency analysis.

    "abstract": "In temperate southeastern Australia over the past two decades there has been a marked progressive increase in human cases of Buruli ulcer, an infection of subcutaneous tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Native possums are the major local environmental reservoir of M. ulcerans as they not only develop Buruli lesions but they also shed M. ulcerans in their excreta. However the way humans acquire M. ulcerans from possums has not been determined. Previous case-control studies, insect field surveys and vector competence studies have suggested a role for mosquitoes in M. ulcerans transmission between possums and humans. To explore these links we conducted an extensive, 4-month structured mosquito field survey and four ad hoc field surveys across an area of 350km2 on the Mornington Peninsula, an area endemic for Buruli ulcer to the south of the major metropolitan city of Melbourne. We then compared spatial and temporal patterns of M. ulcerans-positive mosquito occurrence with M. ulcerans-positive possums (established by previous possum excreta surveys) and human Buruli ulcer cases across the region. We used metabarcoding to assess mosquito blood-feeding host preference and to reconstruct M. ulcerans genomes from positive mosquitoes to test epidemiological inferences. We collected 66,325 mosquitoes spanning 26 different species from 180 repeatedly sampled traps over a 4-month period. Culex molestus and Aedes notoscriptus were the dominant species (42% and 35% of trapped mosquitoes, respectively). PCR screening 25% of trapped mosquitoes revealed a significant association between M. ulcerans and Ae. notoscriptus (p<0.0001) with a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of 5.88 M. ulcerans positive mosquitoes per 1,000 tested. Using spatial scanning statistics, we also observed significant overlap between clusters of M. ulcerans-positive Ae. notoscriptus, M. ulcerans-positive possum excreta and human Buruli ulcer cases. Metabarcoding analyses of blood-fed Ae. notoscriptus showed individual mosquitoes had fed both on humans and native possums. Enrichment genome sequencing from PCR-positive mosquitoes confirmed shared M. ulcerans genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles between mosquitoes, possum excreta and clinical human isolates within the same regions. These findings indicate that Ae. notoscriptus likely transmit M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia and highlight mosquito control as a plausible means to control the Buruli ulcer epidemic in our region.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a comprehensive mechanistic model of a neuron with plasticity that explains the creation of engrams, the biophysical correlates of memory. In the context of a single neuron, this means clarifying how information input as time-varying signals is processed, stored, and subsequently recalled. Moreover, the model addresses two additional, long-standing, specific biological problems: the integration of Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, and the identification of a concise learning rule for synapses.\n\nIn this study, a biologically accurate Hodgkin-Huxley-style electric-circuit equivalent is derived through a one-to-one mapping from the known properties of ion channels. The dynamics of the synaptic cleft, which is often overlooked, is found to be essential in this process. Analysis of the model reveals a simple and succinct learning rule, indicating that the neuron functions as an internal-feedback adaptive filter, which is commonly used in signal processing. Simulation results confirm the circuits functionality, stability, and convergence, demonstrating that even a single neuron without external feedback can function as a potent signal processor.\n\nThe article is interdisciplinary and spans a broad range of subjects within the realm of biophysics, including neurobiology, electronics, and signal processing.\n\nSignificance statementMechanistic neuron models with plasticity are crucial for understanding the complexities of the brain and the processes behind learning and memory. These models provide a way to study how individual neurons and synapses in the brain change over time in response to stimuli, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of neuronal circuits and assemblies. Plasticity is a crucial aspect of these models, as it represents the ability of the brain to modify its connections and functions in response to experiences. By incorporating plasticity into these models, researchers can explore how changes at the synaptic level contribute to higher-level changes in behavior and cognition. Thus, these models are essential for advancing our understanding of the brain and its functions.\n\nPhySH 2023 termsNeuroplasticity, Learning, Memory, Synapses.\n\nMeSH 2023 termsNeuronal Plasticity [G11.561.638], Association learning [F02.463.425.069.296], Memory [F02.463.425.540], Synaptic transmission [G02.111.820.850]",

    "abstract": "Inflammation drives many age-related, especially neurological, diseases, and likely mediates age-related proteotoxicity. For example, dementia due to Alzheimers Disease (AD), cerebral vascular disease, many other neurodegenerative conditions is increasingly among the most devastating burdens on the American (and world) health system and threatens to bankrupt the American health system as the population ages unless effective treatments are developed. Dementia due to either AD or cerebral vascular disease, and plausibly many other neurodegenerative and even psychiatric conditions, is driven by increased age-related inflammation, which in turn appears to mediate Abeta and related proteotoxic processes. The functional significance of inflammation during aging is also supported by the fact that Humira, which is simply an antibody to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, is the best-selling drug in the world by revenue. These observations led us to develop parallel high-throughput screens to discover small molecules which inhibit age-related Abeta proteotoxicity in a C. elegans model of AD AND LPS-induced microglial TNF-a. In the initial screen of 2560 compounds (Microsource Spectrum library) to delay Abeta proteotoxicity, the most protective compounds were, in order, phenylbutyrate, methicillin, and quetiapine, which belong to drug classes (HDAC inhibitors, beta lactam antibiotics, and tricyclic antipsychotics, respectably) already robustly implicated as promising to protect in neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD. RNAi and chemical screens indicated that the protective effects of HDAC inhibitors to reduce Abeta proteotoxicity are mediated by inhibition of HDAC2, also implicated in human AD, dependent on the HAT Creb binding protein (Cbp), which is also required for the protective effects of both dietary restriction and the daf-2 mutation (inactivation of IGF-1 signaling) during aging. In addition to methicillin, several other beta lactam antibiotics also delayed Abeta proteotoxicity and reduced microglial TNF-a. In addition to quetiapine, several other tricyclic antipsychotic drugs also delayed age-related Abeta proteotoxicity and increased microglial TNF-a, leading to the synthesis of a novel congener, GM310, which delays Abeta as well as Huntingtin proteotoxicity, inhibits LPS-induced mouse and human microglial and monocyte TNF-a, is highly concentrated in brain after oral delivery with no apparent toxicity, increases lifespan, and produces molecular responses highly similar to those produced by dietary restriction, including induction of Cbp inhibition of inhibitors of Cbp, and genes promoting a shift away from glycolysis and toward metabolism of alternate (e.g., lipid) substrates. GM310, as well as FDA-approved tricyclic congeners, prevented functional impairments and associated increase in TNF-a in a mouse model of stroke. Robust reduction of glycolysis by GM310 was functionally corroborated by flux analysis, and the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG inhibited microglial TNF-a and other markers of inflammation, delayed Abeta proteotoxicity, and increased lifespan. These results support the value of phenotypic screens to discover drugs to treat age-related, especially neurological and even psychiatric diseases, including AD and stroke, and to clarify novel mechanisms driving neurodegeneration (e.g., increased microglial glycolysis drives neuroinflammation and subsequent neurotoxicity) suggesting novel treatments (selective inhibitors of microglial glycolysis).",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular and useful non-invasive method to map patterns of brain structure and function to complex human traits. Recently published observations in multiple large scale studies cast doubt upon these prospects, particularly for prediction of cognitive traits from structural and resting state functional MRI, which seems to account for little behavioral variability. We leverage baseline data from thousands of children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD(R)) Study to inform the replication sample size required with both univariate and multivariate methods across different imaging modalities to detect reproducible brain-behavior associations. We demonstrate that by applying multivariate methods to high-dimensional brain imaging data, we can capture lower dimensional patterns of structural and functional brain architecture that correlate robustly with cognitive phenotypes and are reproducible with only 41 individuals in the replication sample for working memory-related functional MRI, and [~]100 subjects for structural MRI. Even with 100 random re-samplings of 50 subjects in the discovery sample, prediction can be adequately powered with 98 subjects in the replication sample for multivariate prediction of cognition with working memory task functional MRI. These results point to an important role for neuroimaging in translational neurodevelopmental research and showcase how findings in large samples can inform reproducible brain-behavior associations in small sample sizes that are at the heart of many investigators research programs and grants.",

Although many phenotypic imputation methods have been developed, accurate imputation for millions of individuals still remains extremely challenging. In the present study, leveraging efficient machine learning (ML)-based algorithms, we developed a novel multi-phenotype imputation method based on mixed fast random forest (PIXANT), which is several orders of magnitude in runtime and computer memory usage than the state-of-the-art methods when applied to the UK Biobank (UKB) data and scalable to cohorts with millions of individuals. Our simulations with hundreds of individuals showed that PIXANT was superior to or comparable to the most advanced methods available in terms of accuracy. We also applied PIXANT to impute 425 phenotypes for the UKB data of 277,301 unrelated white British citizens and performed GWAS on imputed phenotypes, and identified a 15.6% more GWAS loci than before imputation (8,710 vs 7,355). Due to the increased statistical power of GWAS, a certain proportion of novel genes were rediscovered, such as RNF220, SCN10A and RGS6 that affect heart rate, demonstrating the use of imputed phenotype data in a large cohort to discover novel genes for complex traits.",

In this study, we explored the utility of neural networks to predict the correct model of sequence evolution and the correct topology for four sequence alignments. We trained neural networks with different architectures using simulated nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments for a wide range of evolutionary models, model parameters and branch lengths. By comparing the accuracy of model and topology prediction of the trained neural networks with Maximum Likelihood and Neighbour Joining methods, we show that for quartet trees, the neural network classifier outperforms the Neighbour Joining method and is in most cases as good as the Maximum Likelihood method to infer the best model of sequence evolution and the best tree topology. These results are consistent for nucleotide and amino acid sequence data. Furthermore, we found that neural network classifiers are much faster than the IQ-Tree implementation of the Maximum Likelihood method.

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle atrophy and the inhibition of muscle regeneration are known to occur as a natural consequence of aging, yet the underlying mechanisms that lead to these processes in atrophic myofibers remain largely unclear. Our research has revealed that the maintenance of proper mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) is vital for preventing skeletal muscle atrophy in microgravity environments. We discovered that the deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin2 (MFN2), which serves as a tether for MAM, in human iPS cells or the reduction of MAM in differentiated myotubes caused by microgravity interfered with myogenic differentiation process and an increased susceptibility to muscle atrophy, as well as the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. The atrophic phenotype of differentiated myotubes in microgravity and the regenerative capacity of Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells in dystrophic mice were both ameliorated by treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Our findings demonstrate how the orchestration of mitochondrial morphology in differentiated myotubes and regenerating muscle stem cells plays a crucial role in regulating Notch signaling through the interaction of MAM.\n\ndigestThis study investigated the link between Mfn2 and Notch signaling in skeletal muscle atrophy. We used a microgravity system to induce muscle atrophy and found that the loss of Mfn2 leads to decreased numbers of MAM and activation of Notch signaling and that treating MFN2-deficient human iPS cells with a gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT improved their mitochondrial morphology and function. Additionally, Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells in mice have a lower capacity to regenerate dystrophic muscles and DAPT treatment improves the regeneration of these cells. The study suggests that targeting the Notch signaling pathway with a gamma-secretase inhibitor could be a therapeutic option for skeletal muscle atrophy caused by defects in Mfn2.",

    "abstract": "Based on experimentally determined average inter-origin distances of [~]100 kb, DNA replication initiates from [~]50,000 origins on human chromosomes in each cell cycle. The origins are believed to be specified by binding of factors like the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) or CTCF or other features like G-quadruplexes. We have performed an integrative analysis of 113 genome-wide human origin profiles (from five different techniques) and 5 ORC-binding profiles to critically evaluate whether the most reproducible origins are specified by these features. Out of [~]7.5 million union origins identified by all datasets, only 0.27% were reproducibly obtained in at least 20 independent SNS-seq datasets and contained in initiation zones identified by each of three other techniques (20,250 shared origins), suggesting extensive variability in origin usage and identification. 21% of the shared origins overlap with transcriptional promoters, posing a conundrum. Although the shared origins overlap more than union origins with constitutive CTCF binding sites, G-quadruplex sites and activating histone marks, these overlaps are comparable or less than that of known Transcription Start Sites, so that these features could be enriched in origins because of the overlap of origins with epigenetically open, promoter-like sequences. Only 6.4% of the 20,250 shared origins were within 1 kb from any of the [~]13,000 reproducible ORC binding sites in human cancer cells, and only 4.5% were within 1 kb of the [~]11,000 union MCM2-7 binding sites in contrast to the nearly 100% overlap in the two comparisons in the yeast, S. cerevisiae. Thus, in human cancer cell lines, replication origins appear to be specified by highly variable stochastic events dependent on the high epigenetic accessibility around promoters, without extensive overlap between the most reproducible origins and currently known ORC- or MCM-binding sites.",

The overkill hypothesis asserts that the first New Zealand settlers hunted the Moa to extinction by 1450 CE, whereas the staggered survival hypothesis allows for Moa survival until after Europeans began to arrive on New Zealand. Alleged Moa sightings post-1450 CE may shed light on these competing hypotheses. A dataset of 97 alleged Moa sightings from circa 1675 CE to 1993 CE was constructed, with sightings given subjective quality ratings corresponding to various statistical probabilities. Cumulative probabilities of Moa persistence were calculated with a conservative survival model using these probabilistic sighting-records; a method recently applied to sightings of the Thylacine. Cumulative persistence probability fell sharply after 1408 CE, and across pessimistic and optimistic variations of the model, it was more likely than not that the Moa were extinct by 1770 CE. Probabilistic sighting-record models favour the overkill hypothesis, and give very low probabilities of Moa persistence around the time of European arrival. Eyewitness data on Moa sightings are amenable to scientific study, and these methods may be applied to similar animals.",

While in the past such measurements have been conducted mostly in laboratory settings, recent advancements in dry electrode technology pave way to a broader range of consumer and medical application because of their greater convenience compared to gel-based electrodes. Here we conducted restingstate EEG recordings in two groups of healthy participants using three dry-electrode devices, the Neiry Headband, the Neiry Headphones and the Muse Headband, and a standard gel electrode-based system, the NVX. We examined signal quality for various spatial and spectral ranges which are essential for cognitive monitoring and consumer applications. Distinctive characteristics of signal quality were found, with the Neiry Headband showing sensitivity in low-frequency ranges and successfully replicating the modulations of delta, theta and alpha power corresponding to the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, and the NVX system excelling in capturing high-frequency oscillations. Neiry Headphones were more prone to low-frequency artifacts, yet effectively reproduced modulations in alpha power and demonstrated a strong alignment with NVX at higher frequencies. The Muse Headband had several limitations in signal quality. We suggest that while dry-electrode technology appears to be appropriate for the EEG rhythm-based applications, the potential benefits of these technologies in terms of ease of use and accessibility should be carefully weighted against the capacity of each concrete system.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection plays a crucial role in modern evolutionary theory, offering valuable insight into evolutionary patterns and species diversity. Recently, a comprehensive definition of sexual selection has been proposed, defining a trait as subject to sexual selection when variations in that trait are nonrandomly associated with variations in access to gametes, a limiting resource. Previous research on discrete traits demonstrated that non-random mating can be effectively quantified using the Kullback-Leibler symmetrized (Jeffreys) divergence, capturing information acquired through mating influenced by mutual mating propensities instead of random occurrences. This novel theoretical framework allows for detecting and assessing the strength of sexual selection and assortative mating.\n\nIn this study, we aim to achieve two primary objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the seamless alignment of the previous theoretical development, rooted in information theory and mutual mating propensity, with the new sexual selection definition. Secondly, we extend the theory to encompass quantitative traits. Our findings reveal that sexual selection and assortative mating can be quantified effectively for quantitative traits by measuring the information gain concerning the random mating pattern.\n\nSpecifically, the gain in information within the sexual selection pattern can be expressed as a function of the sexual selection intensity index and the ratio of variances. Additionally, the measure capturing the underlying information of assortative mating is a function of the square of the correlation coefficient, taking values within the non-negative real number set [0, +{infty}).\n\nIt is worth noting that the same divergence measure captures information acquired through mating for both discrete and quantitative traits. This presents a remarkable innovation as it provides a common context and simplifies the study of the patterns of sexual selection.",

    "abstract": "The high heritability of ALS and similar rare diseases contrasts with their low molecular diagnosis rate post-genetic testing, pointing to potential undiscovered genetic factors. Chromatin accessibility assays quantify the activity of functional elements genome-wide, offering invaluable insights into dysregulated regions. In this research, we introduced EpiOut, a computational toolbox to identify outliers in chromatin accessibility. These outliers represent dysregulated regions where chromatin accessibility uniquely diverges from the population baseline in a single or few samples. Annotation of accessible regions with histone ChIP-seq and Hi-C indicates that outliers are concentrated in functional loci, especially among promoters interacting with active enhancers. Across different omics levels, outliers are robustly replicated, and chromatin accessibility outliers are reliable predictors of gene expression outliers and aberrant protein levels. For example, 59% of gene expression outliers can be linked to aberration in chromatin accessibility. When promoter accessibility does not align with gene expression, our results indicate that molecular aberrations are more likely to be linked to post-transcriptional regulation rather than transcriptional regulation. Our findings demonstrate that the outlier detection paradigm can uncover dysregulated regions in rare diseases. EpiOut is open-sourced and freely available at github.com/uci-cbcl/EpiOut.",

One of these sensors activates an endonuclease, RNase L, that cleaves single stranded RNA. However, how the resultant widespread RNA fragmentation affects gene expression is not fully understood. Here we show that this fragmentation induces the Ribotoxic Stress Response via ZAK, potentially through ribosome collisions. The p38 and JNK pathways that are activated as part of this response promote outcomes that inhibit the virus, such as programmed cell death. We also show that RNase L limits the translation of stress-responsive genes, including antiviral IFIT mRNAs and GADD34 that encodes an antagonist of the Integrated Stress Response. Intriguingly, we found the activity of the generic endonuclease, RNase A, recapitulates many of the same molecular phenotypes as activated RNase L, demonstrating how widespread RNA cleavage can evoke an antiviral program.\n\nHighlightsO_LIActivated RNase L acts with dsRNA-sensing pathways to promote cell signaling\nC_LIO_LIRNA fragmentation induces transcription through ZAK signaling\nC_LIO_LIActivation of RNase L modulates levels of eIF2 phosphorylation\nC_LIO_LITranslation of the GADD34 and IFIT mRNAs is inhibited by active RNase L\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Endosomes are the main locus where, upon endocytosis in liver cells, insulin and the activated insulin receptor accumulate and insulin is degraded. In this study, ligand and receptor pathways in rat liver have been revisited using analytical subcellular fractionation. Density gradient analysis of microsomal and light mitochondrial fractions confirmed that, upon in vivo uptake into liver, [125I]-insulin was rapidly translocated from plasma membranes to endosomes. Internalized [125I]-labeled proinsulin and biotinylated insulin, which are less degraded than insulin in endosomes, were in part transferred to lysosomes. Following injection of native insulin, receptor and ligand were also both translocated from the plasma membrane to endosomes, with a maximum at 15-30 min. Receptor translocation was reversed by 2-3 hours and neither endocytosis nor recycling were affected by in vivo cycloheximide treatment. Fractionation of endosomes of insulin-treated rats on density gradients showed that the insulin receptor was recovered at low density, whereas insulin progressively migrated from low to high densities towards the position of acid phosphatase. On SDS polyacrylamide gels, insulin receptor  and {beta} subunits were identified in plasma membrane, endosomal and lysosomal fractions by affinity crosslinking and Western immunoblotting, respectively. Following insulin treatment, insulin receptor expression rapidly decreased in plasma membranes while increasing in endosomes. In a cell-free system, [125I]-insulin was in part transferred from endosomes to lysosomes, as was, with organelle content mixing, [125I]-biotinylated insulin. In summary: 1) the low lysosomal association of [125I]-insulin in vivo is linked to its endosomal degradation; 2) upon ligand-induced endocytosis, the insulin receptor progressively segregates from insulin and is recycled; 3) neither endocytosis no recycling of the receptor requires protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Coagulation is related to inflammation, but the key pathways, especially innate immunity inflammatory response-coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombus regulation is poorly understood and need to be further explored. In the current study, we showed that innate immunity inflammatory mediator neutrophil gelatinase-associated apolipoprotein (NGAL) interacted with and potentiated thrombin, kallikrein, and FXIa and suppressed the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin to induce hypercoagulability. Furthermore, NGAL can augment thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. In multiple mice hemostasis and thrombus models, NGAL overexpression or intravenous administration promoted hemostasis and aggravated thrombotic tendency, whereas NGAL knockout or treatment with anti-NGAL monoclonal antibody significantly prolonged bleeding time and alleviated thrombus formation. Importantly, NGAL knockout prolonged mice tail bleeding time or artery occlusion time to over 40 min or 30 min, respectively. Furthermore, anti-NGAL monoclonal antibody treatment significantly alleviated thrombus formation in mice-tail thrombosis model induced by carrageenan, which is associated with inflammation. Collectively, these findings clarify NGAL is an important coagulation regulator and mediates the crosstalk between innate immunity inflammation and coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombus, and provide new targets and strategies for the development of safe and efficient innovative antithrombotic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen, and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern. The evolution of pathogenicity and resistance in S. aureus often involves acquisition of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Bacteriophages play an especially important role, since transduction represents the main mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), including SaPI1, are MGEs that carry genes encoding virulence factors, and are mobilized at high frequency through interactions with specific \"helper\" bacteriophages, such as 80, leading to packaging of the SaPI genomes into virions made from structural proteins supplied by the helper. Among these structural proteins is the portal protein, which forms a ring-like portal at a fivefold vertex of the capsid, through which the DNA is packaged during virion assembly and ejected upon infection of the host. We have used high- resolution cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of the S. aureus bacteriophage 80 portal in solution and in situ in the empty and full SaPI1 virions, and show how the portal interacts with the capsid. These structures provide a basis for understanding portal and capsid assembly and the conformational changes that occur upon DNA packaging and ejection.",

    "abstract": "Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) acts via its sole receptor MCHR1 in rodents and is an important regulator of homeostatic behaviors like feeding, sleep, and mood to impact overall energy balance. The loss of MCH signaling by MCH or MCHR1 deletion produces hyperactive mice with increased energy expenditure, and these effects are consistently associated with a hyperdopaminergic state. We recently showed that MCH suppresses dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which principally receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the mechanisms underlying MCH-regulated dopamine release are not clearly defined. MCHR1 expression is widespread and includes dopaminergic VTA cells. However, as the VTA is a neurochemically diverse structure, we assessed Mchr1 gene expression at glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic VTA cells and determined if MCH inhibited the activity of VTA cells and/or their local microcircuit. Mchr1 expression was robust in major VTA cell types, including most dopaminergic (78%) or glutamatergic cells (52%) and some GABAergic cells (38%). Interestingly, MCH directly inhibited dopaminergic and GABAergic cells but did not regulate the activity of glutamatergic cells. Rather, MCH produced a delayed increase in excitatory input to dopamine cells and a corresponding decrease in GABAergic input to glutamatergic VTA cells. Our findings suggested that MCH may acutely suppress dopamine release while disinhibiting local glutamatergic signaling to restore dopamine levels. This indicated that the VTA is a target of MCH action, which may provide bidirectional regulation of energy balance.\n\nSignificance StatementRole of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) on energy balance may converge on the dopamine system via the mesolimbic pathway, as loss of MCH or MCH receptor (MCHR1) signaling increases hyperactivity and energy expenditure associated with a hyperdopaminergic state. MCH can suppress dopamine release within the mesolimbic pathway, but its underlying mechanism is not known. We thus determined if MCH could inhibit dopamine release through direct actions within the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that MCH directly inhibited dopaminergic VTA cells, but MCH also disinhibited excitatory input to dopamine cells. Therefore, we showed that the VTA is a putative target site supporting dopamine-dependent actions of MCH.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells are assembled into distinct subnetworks, which project to different brain areas. GABAergic interneurons were long thought to connect promiscuously and extensively to pyramidal neurons, but recent evidence supports the existence of a cell type-specific inhibitory connectome. How and when interneurons establish such a precise connectivity pattern among intermingled populations of excitatory neurons remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the molecular rules shaping cell type- and input-specific inhibitory connectivity in different Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell populations. We found that neighboring L5 intra- (L5 IT) and extra-telencephalic (L5 ET) neurons receive different combinations of inhibitory perisomatic inputs from Parvalbumin- (PV+) and Cholecystokynine-positive (CCK+) basket cells. We also identified Cdh12 and Cdh13, two cadherin superfamily members, as critical mediators of L5 pyramidal cell type-specific inhibitory connectivity. Our data revealed a minimal overlap between L5 IT and L5 ET presynaptic inhibitory networks, and suggests that different populations PV+ basket cells innervate distinct L5 pyramidal cell types. Altogether, our work unravels the contribution of cadherins in shaping cortical interneuron wiring and provides new insights into the development of inhibitory microcircuits.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is critical for tissue development and regeneration but requires extracellular environments that are conducive to motion. Cells may actively generate migratory routes in vivo by degrading or remodeling their environments or may instead utilize existing ECM microstructures or microtracks as innate pathways for migration. While hydrogels in general are valuable tools for probing the extracellular regulators of 3D migration, few have recapitulated these natural migration paths. Here, we developed a biopolymer-based (i.e., gelatin and hyaluronic acid) bicontinuous hydrogel system formed through controlled solution immiscibility whose continuous subdomains and high micro-interfacial surface area enabled rapid 3D migration, particularly when compared to homogeneous hydrogels. Migratory behavior was mesenchymal in nature and regulated by biochemical and biophysical signals from the hydrogel, which was shown across various cell types and physiologically relevant contexts (e.g., cell spheroids, ex vivo tissues, in vivo tissues). Our findings introduce a new design that leverages important local interfaces to guide rapid cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Local fluctuations of the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases of DNA (often called DNA  breathing) play a variety of critical roles in controlling the functional interactions of the DNA genome with the protein complexes that regulate it. Here we present a single-molecule fluorescence method that we have used to measure and characterize such conformational fluctuations at and near biologically important positions in model DNA replication fork constructs labeled with exciton-coupled cyanine [(iCy3)2] dimer probes. Previous work has shown that the constructs that we test here exhibit a broad range of spectral properties at the ensemble level, and these differences can be structurally and dynamically interpreted using our present methodology at the single-molecule level. The (iCy3)2 dimer has one symmetric (+) and one anti-symmetric (-) exciton with respective transition dipole moments oriented perpendicular to one another. We excite single molecule samples using a continuous-wave linearly polarized laser with polarization direction continuously rotated at the frequency 1 MHz. The ensuing fluorescence signal is modulated as the laser polarization alternately excites the symmetric and the anti-symmetric excitons of the (iCy3)2 dimer probe. Phase-sensitive detection of the modulated signal provides information about the distribution of local conformations and conformational interconversion dynamics of the (iCy3)2 probe. We find that at most construct positions that we examined the (iCy3)2 dimer-labeled DNA fork constructs can adopt four topologically distinct conformational macrostates. These results suggest that in addition to observing DNA breathing at and near ss-dsDNA junctions, our new methodology should be useful to determine which of these pre-existing macrostates are recognized by, bind to, and are stabilized by various genome regulatory proteins.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria and are implicated in genome stability, virulence, phage defense and persistence. Although TA systems encompass a large variety of molecular activities and cellular targets, their physiological role and regulatory mechanisms are often unclear1,2. Here, we show that a RES domain TA system increases the survival of the human pathogen P. aeruginosa during antibiotic treatment by generating a subpopulation of highly drug-tolerant persisters. The NatT toxin is an NAD phosphorylase, which leads to strong depletion of NAD and NADP in a subpopulation of cells. Actively growing P. aeruginosa cells effectively compensate for toxin-mediated NAD deficiency by inducing the NAD salvage path-way. In contrast, under nutrient-limited conditions, NatT generates NAD-depleted cells that give rise to drug tolerant persisters during outgrowth. Structural and biochemical analyses of active and inactive NatR-NatT complexes reveal how changes in NatR-NatT interaction controls toxin activity and autoregulation. Finally, we show that the NAD precursor nicotinamide blocks NatT activity and eliminates persister formation, exposing powerful metabolic feedback control of toxin activity. The findings that patient isolates contain natT gain-of-function alleles and that NatT increases P. aeruginosa virulence, argue that NatT contributes to P. aeruginosa fitness during infections. These studies provide mechanistic insight into how a TA system promotes pathogen persistence by disrupting essential metabolic pathways during nutrient stress.",

    "abstract": "The discrepancy between short- and long-term rate estimates, known as the time-dependent rate phenomenon (TDRP), poses a challenge to extrapolating evolutionary rates over time and reconstructing evolutionary history of viruses. The TDRP reveals a decline in evolutionary rate estimates with the measurement timescale, explained empirically by a power-law rate decay, notably observed in animal and human viruses. A mechanistic evolutionary model, the Prisoner of War (PoW) model, has been proposed to address TDRP in viruses. Although TDRP has been studied in animal viruses, its impact on plant virus evolutionary history remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the consequences of TDRP in plant viruses by applying the PoW model to reconstruct the evolutionary history of sobemoviruses, plant pathogens with significant importance due to their impact on agriculture and plant health. Our analysis showed that the Sobemovirus genus dates back over four million years, indicating an ancient origin. We found evidence that supports deep host jumps to Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Solanaceae occurring between tens to hundreds of thousand years ago, followed by specialization. Remarkably, the TDRP-corrected evolutionary history of sobemoviruses was extended far beyond previous estimates that had suggested their emergence during the Neolithic period. By incorporating sequences collected through metagenomic analyses, the resulting phylogenetic tree showcases increased genetic diversity, reflecting a deep history of sobemovirus species with major radiation events taking place during the Neolithic period, suggesting rapid diversification in that period. Our findings make a case for the possibility of deep evolutionary origins of plant viruses.",

The resulting droplets display liquid-like properties and are found in close proximity to chloroplast nucleoids.

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection requires passage of the viral core through the nuclear pore of the cell, a process that depends on functions of the viral capsid 1,2. Recent studies have shown that HIV-1 cores enter the nucleus prior to capsid disassembly 3-5. Interactions with the nuclear pore complex are necessary but not sufficient for nuclear entry, and the mechanism by which the viral core traverses the comparably sized nuclear pore is unknown. Here we show that the HIV-1 core is highly elastic and that this property is linked to nuclear entry and infectivity. Using atomic force microscopy-based approaches, we found that purified wild type cores rapidly returned to their normal conical morphology following a severe compression. Results from independently performed molecular dynamic simulations of the mature HIV-1 capsid also revealed its elastic property. Analysis of four HIV-1 capsid mutants that exhibit impaired nuclear entry revealed that the mutant viral cores are brittle. Suppressors of the mutants restored elasticity and rescued infectivity and nuclear entry. Elasticity was also reduced by treatment of cores with the capsid-targeting compound PF74 and the antiviral drug lenacapavir. Our results indicate that capsid elasticity is a fundamental property of the HIV-1 core that enables its passage through the nuclear pore complex, thereby facilitating infection. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 nuclear entry and the antiviral mechanisms of HIV-1 capsid inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella infection involves a cascade of attacks and defence measures. After breaching the intestinal epithelial barrier, Salmonella is phagocytosed by the macrophages, inside which, the bacteria face multiple stresses and, consequently, employ appropriate countermeasures. We show that, in Salmonella, the polyamine spermidine activates a stress response mechanism by regulating critical antioxidant genes. Salmonella Typhimurium mutants for spermidine transport and synthesis cannot mount an antioxidative response, resulting in high intracellular ROS levels. These mutants are also compromised in their ability to be phagocytosed by macrophages. Furthermore, it regulates a novel enzyme in Salmonella, Glutathionyl-spermidine synthetase (GspSA), which is known to prevent the oxidation of proteins in E.coli. Moreover, the spermidine mutants and the GspSA mutant show significantly reduced survival in the presence of hydrogen peroxide in vitro, and lesser organ burden in the mouse model of Salmonella infection. Conversely, in macrophages isolated from gp91phox-/- mice, we observed a rescue in the attenuated fold proliferation previously observed upon infection. Interestingly, Salmonella upregulates polyamine biosynthesis in the host, which also solves the mystery of the attenuated proliferation observed in spermidine transport mutants. Thus, inhibition of this pathway in the host abrogates the proliferation of Salmonella Typhimurium in macrophages. From a therapeutic perspective, inhibiting host polyamine biosynthesis using an FDA-approved chemopreventive drug, D,L--difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), reduces Salmonella colonization and tissue damage in the mouse model of infection, while enhancing the survival of infected mice. Therefore, our work provides a mechanistic insight into the critical role of spermidine in stress resistance of Salmonella. It also reveals a strategy of the bacteria in modulating host metabolism to promote their intracellular survival and shows the potential of DFMO to curb Salmonella infection.\n\nSignificanceA substantial duration of the infection cycle of Salmonella involves the macrophages, which present a very hostile environment to the bacteria. However, Salmonella is able to survive and proliferate within host macrophages and utilizes it to disseminate to secondary sites of infection. Our study identifies a novel strategy employed by Salmonella Typhimurium to counteract oxidative and nitrosative stress within the host. We demonstrate that spermidine is a critical regulatory molecule in Salmonella that regulates multiple antioxidative pathways along with a novel antioxidative enzyme (GspSA) in Salmonella, to prevent oxidative damage and assist in its virulence in mice. It further rewires host polyamine metabolism to prevent nitric oxide production and enhance its survival. In the era of anti-microbial resistance, this study further recognizes an FDA -approved chemopreventive drug, DFMO, which inhibits the host-polyamine metabolism, as a prospective antidote to treat Salmonella infection.",

    "abstract": "Dog is the oldest domesticated animal that established close relationships with humans. Due to its ancient origin, when, where, and whether a single or dual domestication event occurred is still under debate. The dogs in the Jomon period (Jomon dogs) in the Japanese archipelago had little change in morphology from 10,000 to 3,000 years ago. Therefore, we expected that the ancient genome of the Jomon dogs would provide a clue to reveal the characteristics of the ancient East Asian dogs. Here, we have sequenced the genomes of three 6000-year-old Jomon dogs, one 3000-4000-year-old Jomon dog, and four late 8th century dogs excavated in Japan. Our analyses suggest that the Jomon dogs are a distinct lineage from the previously known ancient dogs and are one of the oldest among the dogs in East Eurasian lineages. In addition, the genome of the Jomon dogs contained 9.5% of the genome of Japanese wolf ancestry due to a single introgression event. We estimated the proportion of the Jomon dog lineage genome in the genomes of dogs, which indicates that the genomic composition derived from the Jomon dog lineage is one of the major sources of modern dog genomes. Furthermore, we estimated the early admixture events of dogs in East Eurasia by analyzing the ancient genomes of the Jomon dogs. Due to the admixture events, the Jomon dog-derived genome has been one of the genomic sources of a wide range of modern dogs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is associated with large variability in the development and severity of both motor and nonmotor symptoms, including depression and impulse control disorder. Neuroinflammation might contribute to this heterogeneity, given its association with dopaminergic signalling, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and reward versus punishment learning. Here, we assessed the effect of inflammatory tone on probabilistic reinforcement learning and impulse control disorders in PD. We measured computational learning model-based neural reward prediction error and expected value signals in frontostriatal circuity during reinforcement learning using functional MRI. In addition, we acquired cerebral spinal fluid of 74 PD patients and screened for 13 inflammatory factors, including our primary marker of interest IL-6, previously implicated in reward learning signaling in the ventral striatum. In contrast to our prediction, we found no association between inflammatory tone and any of the behavioural or neural reinforcement learning parameters. Furthermore, we did we not find any correlation between inflammatory tone and depressive or impulsive PD symptoms. Exploratory analyses revealed a negative association between MCP-1 and reward prediction error signals in the ventral striatum, an observation that should be replicated in future work. The null findings might reflect the fact that measurements were taken ON medication, or that our sample consists of an early disease stage cohort that may be too small to detect these effects, or that IL-6 is a suboptimal marker for inflammatory tone, or a combination of these factors.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile remains a public health threat commonly observed following antibiotic use. Due to the importance of iron in many cell processes, most bacteria, including C. difficile, have multiple mechanisms of acquiring iron. Previous studies have examined ferrous iron uptake in C. difficile, here we focus on the role of siderophores. In a growth assay, we show that C. difficile can use a variety of siderophores as the sole iron source. In C. difficile, two ABC transporters induced under low iron conditions are predicted siderophore importers: FhuDBGC and YclNOPQ. We hypothesized that these transporters are responsible for the uptake of the siderophores we tested. To investigate the specificity of these transporters, we purified the substrate binding proteins and examined siderophore binding using thermal shift. We demonstrate increased stability between one siderophore binding protein, FhuD, and the siderophore ferrichrome, suggesting a binding interaction. This specificity correlates with the inability of an{Delta} fhuDBGC mutant to grow efficiently under iron limiting conditions in the presence of ferrichrome. While C. difficile used additional siderophores in our growth experiments, we did not observe increased thermal stability between the receptor proteins and any of the other siderophores tested, suggesting these siderophores do not bind these receptors and other siderophore import mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Redundancy in iron acquisition is a microbial survival adaptation to cope with the constant battle for iron within a host. Greater knowledge about how C. difficile acquires iron will provide insight about how C. difficile colonizes and persists in the colon.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study is the first example of C. difficile growing with siderophores as the sole iron source and describes the characterization of the ferric hydroxamate uptake ABC transporter (FhuDBGC). This transporter shows specificity to the siderophore ferrichrome. While not required for pathogenesis, this transporter highlights the redundancy in iron acquisition mechanisms which C. difficile uses to compete for iron during an infection.",

    "abstract": "Sports provide varying scenarios where athletes must interact with and avoid opposing players in dynamic environments. As such, sport-specific training can improve ones ability to integrate visual information which may result in improved collision avoidance behaviours. However, improved visuomotor capabilities are highly task dependent (i.e., athletes must be tested in sport-specific settings). The current study examined whether sport-specific training influenced individuals collision avoidance behaviours during a sport-specific task in virtual reality. Untrained young adults (N=21, 22.9{+/-}1.9 yrs, 11 males) and specifically trained athletes (N=18, 20{+/-}1.5 yrs, 7 males) were immersed in a virtual environment and were instructed to walk along a 7.5m path towards a goal located along the midline. Two virtual players positioned 2.83m to the left and right of the midline approached participants on a 45{degrees} angle at one of three speeds: 0.8x, 1.0x, or 1.2x each participants average walking speed. Participants were instructed to walk to a goal without colliding with the virtual players while performing a secondary task; reporting whether a shape changed above either of the virtual players heads. Results revealed that athletes had a higher percentage of correct responses on the secondary task compared to untrained young adults. However, there was no group differences in the average time to first avoidance or average minimum clearance, but athletes were more variable in their avoidance behaviours. Findings from this study demonstrate that athletes may be more adaptive in their behaviours and may perform better on attentionally demanding tasks in dynamic environments.",

However, it is unclear as to how the number, location, cellular origin, and size of these EVs within the circulation relate to the development of CVDs such as coronary artery disease (CAD). The current study compared these novel markers in arterial and venous blood samples in individuals undergoing coronary assessment with angiography..

    "abstract": "BackgroundInterleukin 11 (IL11) was initially thought important for platelet production, which led to recombinant IL11 being developed as a drug to treat thrombocytopenia. IL11 was later found to be redundant for haematopoiesis and its use in patients is associated with unexplained cardiac side effects. Here we identify previously unappreciated and direct cardiomyocyte toxicities associated with IL11 therapy.\n\nMethodsWe injected recombinant mouse lL11 (rmIL11) into mice and studied its molecular effects in the heart using immunoblotting, qRT-PCR, bulk RNA-seq, single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq. The physiological impact of IL11 was assessed by echocardiography in vivo and using cardiomyocyte contractility assays in vitro. To determine the activity of IL11 specifically in cardiomyocytes we made two cardiomyocyte-specific Il11ra1 knockout mouse models using either AAV9-mediated and Tnnt2-restricted (vCMKO) or Myh6 (m6CMKO) Cre expression and an Il11ra1 floxed mouse strain. In pharmacologic studies, we studied the effects of JAK/STAT inhibition on rmIL11-induced cardiac toxicities.\n\nResultsInjection of rmIL11 caused acute and dose-dependent impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction (saline (2 {micro}L/kg), 60.4%{+/-}3.1; rmIL11 (200 mcg/kg), 31.6%{+/-}2.0; p<0.0001, n=5). Following rmIL11 injection, myocardial STAT3 and JNK phosphorylation were increased and bulk RNA-seq revealed upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways (TNF, NF{kappa}B and JAK/STAT) and perturbed calcium handling. SnRNA-seq showed rmIL11-induced expression of stress factors (Ankrd1, Ankrd23, Xirp2), activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor genes and Nppb in the cardiomyocyte compartment. Following rmIL11 injection, ATAC-seq identified epigenetic enrichment of the Ankrd1 and Nppb genes and stress-responsive, AP-1 transcription factor binding sites. Cardiomyocyte-specific effects were examined in vCMKO and m6CMKO mice, which were both protected from rmIL11-induced left ventricular impairment and molecular pathobiologies. In mechanistic studies, inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling with either ruxolitinib or tofacitinib prevented rmIL11-induced cardiac dysfunction.\n\nConclusionsInjection of IL11 directly activates JAK/STAT3 in cardiomyocytes to cause acute heart failure.

    "abstract": "HOIL-1L deficiency was recently reported to be one of the causes of myopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the mechanisms by which myopathy and DCM develop have not been clearly elucidated. Here, we sought to elucidate these mechanisms using the murine myoblast cell line C2C12 and disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Myotubes were differentiated from control and HOIL-1L-KO C2C12 cells. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) were differentiated from control and patient-derived hiPSCs. We investigated the impact of HOIL-1L on differentiation of myotubes and CMs. Myotubes differentiated from HOIL-1L-KO C2C12 cells exhibited deteriorated differentiation and mitotic cell accumulation. CMs differentiaed from patient-derived hiPSCs had an abnormal morphology with a larger size and were excessively multinucleated compared with CMs differentiaed from control hiPSCs. Further analysis of hiPSC- derived CMs showed that HOIL-1L deficiency caused cell cycle alteration and mitotic cell accumulation. These results were supported by RNA sequencing of C2C12 cell-derived myotubes. In addition, SerpinE2, a cardiac fibrogenesis gene, was significantly upregulated in CMs differentiaed from patient-derived hiPSCs. These results demonstrate that abnormal cell maturation and fibrosis possibly contribute to the development of DCM and myopathy. In conclusion, HOIL-1L is an important intrinsic regulator of cell cycle-related myotube and CM maturation and cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPericytes are multifunctional contractile cells that reside on capillaries. Pericytes are critical regulators of cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier function, and pericyte dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of human neurological diseases including Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pericytes (iPericytes) are a promising tool for vascular research. However, it is unclear how iPericytes functionally compare to primary human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs). We differentiated iPSCs into iPericytes of either the mesoderm or neural crest lineage using established protocols. We compared iPericyte and HBVP morphologies, quantified gene expression by qPCR and bulk RNA sequencing, and visualised pericyte protein markers by immunocytochemistry. To determine whether the gene expression of neural crest iPericytes, mesoderm iPericytes or HBVPs correlated with their functional characteristics in vitro, we quantified EdU incorporation following exposure to the key pericyte mitogen, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and, contraction and relaxation in response to the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 or vasodilator adenosine, respectively. iPericytes were morphologically similar to HBVPs and expressed canonical pericyte markers. However, iPericytes had 1864 differentially expressed genes compared to HBVPs, while there were 797 genes differentially expressed between neural crest and mesoderm iPericytes. Consistent with the ability of HBVPs to respond to PDGF-BB signalling, PDGF-BB enhanced and PDGF receptor-beta inhibitors impaired iPericyte proliferation. Administration of endothelin-1 led to iPericyte contraction and adenosine led to iPericyte relaxation, of a magnitude similar to the response evoked in HBVPs. We determined that neural crest iPericytes were less susceptible to PDGFR beta inhibition, but responded most robustly to vasoconstrictive meditators. iPericytes express pericyte-associated genes and proteins and, exhibit an appropriate physiological response upon exposure to a key endogenous mitogen or vasoactive mediators. Therefore, the generation of functional iPericytes would be suitable for use in future investigations exploring pericyte function or dysfunction in neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Instead of employing telomerases to safeguard chromosome ends, dipteran species maintain their telomeres by transposition of telomeric-specific retrotransposons (TRs): in Drosophila, these are HeT-A, TART, and TAHRE. Previous studies have shown how these TRs create tandem repeats at chromosome ends, but the exact mechanism controlling TR transcription has remained unclear. Here we report the identification of multiple subunits of the transcription cofactor Mediator complex and transcriptional factors Scalloped (Sd, the TEAD homolog in flies) and E2F1-Dp as novel regulators of TR transcription and telomere length in Drosophila. Depletion of multiple Mediator subunits, Dp, or Sd increased TR expression and telomere length, while over-expressing E2F1-Dp or knocking down the E2F1 regulator Rbf1 (Retinoblastoma-family protein 1) stimulated TR transcription, with Mediator and Sd affecting TR expression through E2F1-Dp. The CUT&RUN analysis revealed direct binding of CDK8, Dp, and Sd to telomeric repeats. These findings highlight the essential role of the Mediator complex in maintaining telomere homeostasis by regulating TR transcription through E2F1-Dp and Sd, revealing the intricate coupling of TR transcription with the host cell-cycle machinery, thereby ensuring chromosome end protection and genomic stability during cell division.",

    "abstract": "Heterosynaptic plasticity, along with Hebbian homosynaptic plasticity, is an important mechanism ensuring stable operation of learning neuronal networks. However, whether heterosynaptic plasticity occurs in the whole brain in vivo, and what role(s) in brain function in vivo it could play, remains unclear. Here, we used an optogenetics approach to apply a model of intracellular tetanization, which was established and employed to study heterosynaptic plasticity in brain slices, to study plasticity of response properties of neurons in mouse visual cortex in vivo. We show that optogenetically evoked high-frequency bursts of action potentials (optogenetic tetanization) in principal neurons of the visual cortex induce long-term changes of responses to visual stimuli. Optogenetic tetanization had distinct effects on responses to different stimuli: responses to optimal and orthogonal orientations decreased, response to null direction did not change, and responses to oblique orientations increased. As a result, direction selectivity of the neurons decreased, and orientation tuning became broader. Since optogenetic tetanization was a purely postsynaptic protocol, applied in the absence of sensory stimulation, and thus without association of presynaptic activity with bursts of action potentials, the observed changes were mediated by mechanisms of heterosynaptic plasticity. We conclude that heterosynaptic plasticity can be induced in vivo and propose that it may play important homeostatic roles in operation of neural networks by helping to prevent runaway dynamics of responses to visual stimuli and to keep the tuning of neuronal responses within the range optimized for encoding of multiple features in population activity.",

Here, we investigate aspects of the function and neurobiology of sensory adaptation in olfaction using the honeybee Apis mellifera. By means of electroantennograms we set stimulation protocols that induced sensory adaptation. We show that activation patterns that encode mixtures of odorants in the antennal lobe are drastically altered after sensory adaptation, favoring the representation of stimuli that are present at sub-threshold concentrations. We investigate the effects that sensory adaptation has on the perception of odorant mixtures and show that adapting animals to one of the components of a binary mixture, reduces the appetitive learning of the adapted stimulus and enhances the detection and learning of the non-adapted stimulus in cases in which it would stay normally occluded. These results suggest that olfactory sensory adaptation is critical to allow detection of minor components present in complex mixtures, emphasizing its role as a fundamental mechanism to improve sensitivity to discrete stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Mixotrophic eukaryotes are important bacterivores in oligotrophic open oceans, but their significance as grazers in more nutrient-rich waters is less clear. Here we investigated the bacterivory partition between mixotrophs and heterotrophs in a productive, estuary-influenced coastal region in East China Sea. We found ubiquitous, actively feeding phytoplankton populations and taxa with mixotrophic potential, by identifying ingestion of fluorescent prey surrogate and analyzing community 18S rRNA gene amplicons. Potential and active mixotrophs accounted for 10-63% of total eukaryotic community and 17-69% of bacterivores observed, respectively, contributing 6-48% of estimated in situ bacterivory. The much higher mixotroph fitness outside of the turbid plume were potentially driven by increased light and decreased nutrients availability. Our results suggest that, although heterotrophs dominated overall in situ bacterivory, mixotrophs were abundant and important bacterivores in this low-latitude mesotrophic coastal region.\n\nScientific Significance StatementMixotrophy, the combing of photosynthetic and phagotrophic nutrition, can dramatically increase primary production and alter material movements in aquatic food webs. Understanding the distribution and fitness of phagotrophic mixotrophs in a range of habitats are therefore critical to properly understand the biogeochemical cycles of the ocean. We developed a robust method to estimate active mixotrophs in situ and demonstrate rapid shifts of bacterivory partition between mixotrophs and heterotrophs across an estuary-coast environment in East China Sea. Our results help fill the knowledge gap of mixotroph niches in mesotrophic coastal environments that are impacted by riverine discharge, shedding light on relationships among mixotrophy, light and nutrient conditions.",

    "abstract": "The sensory epithelium of the cochlea, the organ of Corti, has complex cytoarchitecture consisting of mechanosensory hair cells intercalated by support cells. The support cells provide important trophic and structural support to the hair cells and must be stiff yet compliant enough to modulate vibrations to the organ of Corti. Once the sensory cells are properly arranged, the support cells undergo significant remodeling to help the sensory epithelium transition from a simple epithelium into a structurally rigid epithelium with fluid-filled spaces. Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules that are necessary for sorting and connecting cells in an intact epithelium. To create the fluid-filled spaces, the cell adhesion properties of adjoining cell membranes between cells must change to allow the formation of spaces within an epithelium. However, the dynamic localization of cadherins has not been properly analyzed as these spaces are formed. There are three cadherins that are reported to be expressed during the first postnatal week of development when the tunnel of Corti forms in the cochlea. We characterized the dynamic localization of cadherins that are associated with the cytoskeletal remodeling at the contacting membranes of the inner and outer pillar cells flanking the tunnel of Corti.",

    "abstract": "The placenta is vital for proper embryonic development and successful pregnancy. Preimplantation alcohol exposure can negatively impact embryonic development and lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. We and others have demonstrated the adverse effects of preimplantation alcohol exposure on embryo morphology and molecular profiles at late gestation, but studies on the placenta are markedly lacking. Here, we used an established preclinical mouse model to assess the impact of preimplantation (8-cell stage) binge-like alcohol exposure on the morphology, DNA methylation, and gene expression patterns in male and female late-gestation placentas. While overall placental morphology was not affected, we uncovered numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs; n=991 in males; n=1309 in females) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs; n=1046 in males; n=340 in females) in the placentas. Remarkably, only 21 DMRs and 54 DEGs were common to both sexes, which were enriched for genes involved in growth factor response pathways. Using LASSO regression, we were able to precisely discriminate control and ethanol-exposed placentas based on their specific DNA methylation patterns. This is the first study demonstrating that preimplantation alcohol exposure alters the DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles of late-gestation placentas. Importantly, it reveals a placental DNA methylation signature that can detect prenatal alcohol exposure and provide appropriate support to prevent eventual impact.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=177 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/560198v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4e2ab3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d57902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fb9f5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b0f5a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This study focuses on individuals associated with BA metallurgical production, specifically the Seima-Turbino (ST) phenomenon ([~]2,200-1,900 BCE) associated with elaborate metal objects found across Northern Eurasia. The genetic profiles of nine ST-associated individuals vary widely ranging between ancestries maximized in individuals from the Eastern Siberian Late Neolithic/BA, and those of the Western Steppe Middle Late BA. The genetic heterogeneity observed is consistent with the current understanding of the ST metallurgical network as a transcultural phenomenon. The new data also shed light on the temporal and spatial range of an ancient Siberian genetic ancestry component, which is shared across many Uralic-speaking populations, and which we explore further via demographic modeling using additional genome-wide (2 individuals) and whole genome data (5 individuals, including a [~]30x genome) from northwestern Russia.",

    "abstract": "Polymeric heart valves offer the potential to overcome the limited durability of tissue based bioprosthetic valves and the need for anticoagulant therapy of mechanical valve replacement options. However, developing a single-phase material with requisite biological properties and target mechanical properties remains a challenge. In this study, a composite heart valve material was developed where an electrospun mesh provides tunable mechanical properties and a hydrogel coating confers an antifouling surface for thromboresistance. Key biological responses were evaluated in comparison to glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardium. Platelet and bacterial attachment were reduced by 38% and 98%, respectively, as compared to pericardium that demonstrated the antifouling nature of the hydrogel coating. There was also a notable reduction (59%) in the calcification of the composite material as compared to pericardium. A custom 3D printed hydrogel coating setup was developed to make valve composites for device-level hemodynamic testing. Regurgitation fraction (9.6 {+/-} 1.8%) and effective orifice area (1.52 {+/-} 0.34 cm2) met ISO 5840-2:2021 requirements. Additionally, the mean pressure gradient was comparable to current clinical bioprosthetic heart valves demonstrating preliminary efficacy. Although the hemodynamic properties are promising, it is anticipated that the random microarchitecture will result in suboptimal strain fields and peak stresses that may accelerate leaflet fatigue and degeneration. Previous computational work has demonstrated that bioinspired fiber microarchitectures can improve strain homogeneity of valve materials toward improving durability. To this end, we developed advanced electrospinning methodologies to achieve polyurethane fiber microarchitectures that mimic or exceed the physiological ranges of alignment, tortuosity, and curvilinearity present in the native valve. Control of fiber alignment from a random fiber orientation at a normalized orientation index (NOI) 14.2 {+/-} 6.9% to highly aligned fibers at a NOI of 85.1 {+/-} 1.4%. was achieved through increasing mandrel rotational velocity. Fiber tortuosity and curvilinearity in the range of native valve features were introduced through a post-spinning annealing process and fiber collection on a conical mandrel geometry, respectively. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential of hydrogel-polyurethane fiber composite as a heart valve material. Future studies will utilize the developed advanced electrospinning methodologies in combination with model-directed fabrication toward optimizing durability as a function of fiber microarchitecture.",

Together with quantitative tools, our approach revealed the existence of a coordinated spatiotemporal diffusion of the three different (co-)receptors prior to viral-engagement. By varying the temporal-windows of cumulated single-molecule localizations, we discovered that such a concerted diffusion impacts on the residence time of viruses on the host membrane and potential viral infectivity.

    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), commonly driven by KRAS mutations, is responsible for 7% of all cancer mortality. The first allele-specific KRAS inhibitors were recently approved in LUAD, but clinical benefit is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. LUAD predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which function as facultative alveolar stem cells by self-renewing and replacing alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples we found inhibition of KRAS promotes transition to a quiescent AT1-like cancer cell state in LUAD tumors. Similarly, suppressing Kras induced AT1 differentiation of wild-type AT2 cells upon lung injury. The AT1-like LUAD cells exhibited high growth and differentiation potential upon treatment cessation, whereas ablation of the AT1-like cells robustly improved treatment response to KRAS inhibitors. Our results uncover an unexpected role for KRAS in promoting intra-tumoral heterogeneity and suggest targeting alveolar differentiation may augment KRAS-targeted therapies in LUAD.\n\nSignificanceTreatment resistance limits response to KRAS inhibitors in LUAD patients. We find LUAD residual disease following KRAS targeting is composed of AT1-like cancer cells with the capacity to reignite tumorigenesis. Targeting the AT1-like cells augments responses to KRAS inhibition, elucidating a therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to KRAS-targeted therapy.",

Enrollment is an evolutionary staple of trilobites, and their biomineralized dorsal exoskeleton offers a versatile substrate for the evolution of interlocking devices. However, it is unknown whether trilobites also featured ventral adaptations for enrolment. Here, we report ventral exoskeletal adaptations that facilitate enrollment in exceptionally preserved trilobites from the Upper Ordovician Walcott-Rust Quarry in New York State, USA. Walcott-Rust trilobites reveal the intricate three-dimensional organization of the non-biomineralized ventral anatomy preserved as calcite casts, including the spatial relationship between the articulated sternites (i.e., ventral exoskeletal plates) and the wedge-shaped protopodites. Enrollment in trilobites is achieved by ventrally dipping the anterior margin of the sternites during trunk flexure, facilitated by the presence of flexible membranes, and the close coupling of the wedge-shaped protopodites. Comparisons with the ventral morphology of extant glomerid millipedes and terrestrial isopods reveal similar mechanisms used for enrollment. The wedge-shaped protopodites of trilobites closely resemble the gnathobasic coxa/protopodite of extant horseshoe crabs. We propose that the trilobites wedge-shaped protopodite simultaneously facilitates tight enrollment and gnathobasic feeding with the trunk appendages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShifts in pollinator occurrence and their pollen transport effectiveness drive the evolution of mating systems in flowering plants. A decline in pollinator numbers can lead to the phenotypic evolution of floral traits favoring self-pollination (selfing syndrome). Understanding the genomic basis involved in such shifts of the mating system is crucial for predicting a species persistence or extinction under changing biotic and abiotic stressors in natural populations. We investigated loci showing high genetic differentiation before and after selection in fast-cycling Brassica rapa that were associated with rapid phenotypic evolution toward the selfing syndrome (reduction in petal width, stamen and pistil length, and herkogamy). Combining a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach with a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we shed light onto the genetic basis associated with the mating system shift over nine generations of pollination by Episyphrus balteatus (hoverflies), an abundant pollinator of B. rapa. Moreover, we functionally validated the involvement of candidate genes associated with changes in floral morphology by studying corresponding mutants in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nResultsWe found that the mating system of B. rapa shifted from predominantly outcrossing to mixed mating with high rates of autonomous selfing, accompanied by a rapid reduction of floral morphological traits and herkogamy involving many loci. We found 31 candidate genes associated with the affected traits that were involved in a wide range of functions from DNA/RNA binding to transport. Our functional validation in A. thaliana confirmed that four of the identified genes are indeed involved in regulating the size of floral organs. Interestingly, two genes, both coding for the same protein complex responsible for active DNA methylation were successfully validated and closely linked to two correlated phenotypic traits, namely pistil and stamen length.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our study shows that hoverfly pollination leads to rapid evolutionary changes of the mating system through polygenic changes, highlighting the importance of using genomic approaches to understand pollinator-driven plant adaptation.",

Computational techniques including reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling were fit to observed behaviour. Reinforcement learning models revealed that increased synaptic serotonin reduced sensitivity specifically for outcomes in aversive but not appetitive contexts. Furthermore, increasing synaptic serotonin enhanced behavioural inhibition, and shifted bias towards impulse control during exposure to aversive emotional probes. These effects were seen in the context of overall improvements in memory for neutral verbal information. Our findings highlight the direct effects of increased synaptic serotonin on human behaviour, underlining its critical role in guiding decision-making within aversive and neutral contexts, and offering broad implications for longstanding theories of central serotonin function.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TDP-43 is a hallmark of TDP-proteinopathies including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Since TDP-43 aggregation and dysregulation are causative of neuronal death, there is a special interest in targeting this protein as a therapeutic approach. Previously, we found that TDP-43 extensively co-aggregated with the dual function protein (GEF (guanine exchange factor) and RBP) rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF) in ALS patients. Here, we show that a N-terminal fragment of RGNEF (NF242) interacts directly with the RNA recognition motifs (RRM) of TDP-43 competing with RNA, and that the IPT/TIG domain of NF242 is essential for this interaction. Genetical expression of NF242 in a fruit fly ALS model overexpressing TDP-43 suppressed the neuropathological phenotype increasing lifespan, abolishing motor defects, and preventing neurodegeneration. Intracerebroventricular injections of AAV9/NF242 in a severe TDP-43 murine model (rNLS8) improved lifespan and motor phenotype, and decreased neuroinflammation markers. Our results demonstrate an innovative way to target TDP-43 proteinopathies using a protein fragment with affinity for TDP-43, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for TDP-43 proteinopathies such as ALS and FTD.",

Most drift fence designs are semi-permanent or otherwise difficult to transport after initial installation. While these designs are effective for replicate trapping through time, most designs lack portability. Here, we propose a novel drift fence design that uses PVC pipes and fiberglass mesh screen. The combination of hollow PVC pipes and mesh screen creates a lightweight system that facilitates rapid deployment and redeployment across locations. Since the PVC pipes can be filled with topsoil from the site of trap installation, enhanced portability does not come at the cost of fence stability or wind resistance. We provide results on trap performance in a New Mexico flatland desert and discuss the efficacy and cost of our proposed drift fence design.",

    "abstract": "A variety of evolutionary processes shape the structure of cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers. Functionally important regulatory sequences tend to be conserved as result of negative selection against deleterious mutations and positive selection for better-canalized performance. However, some forms of stabilizing selection can maintain functional conservation of cis-regulatory elements for long periods of evolutionary time despite structural transcription binding sites turnover (Ludwig et al, 1998). In addition, compensatory evolution can even accelerate the substitution process in large populations to level greater than the neutral rate of substitution (Carter and Wagner, 2002). The effects of lethal mutations in cis-regulatory regions on viability in heterozygotes and the impact of such mutations on evolutionary processes have not been substantially addressed. We ask a fundamental biological question: How does a lethal mutant in an enhancer region affect viability when carried over a dominant normal allele? Here cis-regulatory mutation eve dMSE of even-skipped gene (eve) in D. melanogaster, that is lethal in homozygote, has been tested for relative viability in heterozygous state. In eve dMSE the 480-bp fragment corresponding to MSE (Minimal Stipe Element) of the eve stripe 2 enhancer was deleted and replaced with an unrelated DNA fragment (containing white+ gene marker) by ends-out homologous recombination (Ludwig et al, 2011). We discovered that relative viability of flies carrying cis-regulatory mutation eve dMSE in heterozygote was not reduced compared to the viability of wild-type flies. In contrast, the viability of heterozygotes carrying a homozygote-lethal nonsense eveR13 mutation (Fujioka et al, 1999) was significantly impacted. Our explanation to this surprising phenomenon relays on action of eve transcriptional autoregulation. The transcription factor (TF) EVE regulates its own expression level through the autoregulatory cis-regulatory module. It could elevate the expression level from one dose to the level sufficient to restore up to 100% fitness in the heterozygote with eve dMSE lethal allele. This example suggests that some cis-regulatory mutants (including the deleterious ones) may exist in populations as heterozygotes with high fitness for many generations, before possibly encountering an epistatic interaction with a compensatory mutation at a different site in the genome. Our study is consistent with the compensatory mechanisms of evolution for functionally important cis-regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater and anadromous fish have been identified as one of the most at-risk groups threatened by climate induced warming given their metabolic dependence on environmental temperature and limited ability to track favorable environmental conditions. The future of these fish will depend on their ability to adapt to new thermal regimes over biologically relevant timescales. However, the mechanistic understanding of temperature responses required to predict if adaption can keep pace with climate change is limited. To address this question, we investigated the mechanistic basis of thermal adaptation across multiple levels of biological organization in the iconic and endangered Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We uncovered a mechanistic basis of thermal adaptation centered on the thermal responsiveness of mitochondrial function which modulates the extent to which rising temperatures increase metabolic demand on the cardio-respiratory system. These insights demonstrate that the populations studied here are able to maintain high levels of physiological performance at temperatures several degrees above historic averages, indicating that the decline Chinook Salmon and failure to recover despite conservation efforts is unlikely to be due to increased temperatures as a consequence of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drivers are selfish genetic loci that can be transmitted to more than half of the viable gametes produced by a heterozygote. This biased transmission gives meiotic drivers an evolutionary advantage that can allow them to spread over generations until all members of a population carry the driver. This evolutionary power can also be exploited to modify natural populations using synthetic drivers known as  gene drives. Recently, it has become clear that natural drivers can spread within genomes to birth multicopy gene families. To understand intragenomic spread of drivers, we model the evolution of two distinct meiotic drivers in a population. We employ the wtf killer meiotic drivers from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which are multicopy in all sequenced isolates, as models. We find that a duplicate wtf driver identical to the parent gene can spread in a population unless, or until, the original driver is fixed. When the duplicate driver diverges to be distinct from the parent gene, we find that both drivers spread to fixation under most conditions. Finally, we show that stronger drivers make weaker drivers go extinct in most, but not all, polymorphic populations with absolutely linked drivers. These results reveal the strong potential for natural meiotic drive loci to duplicate and diverge within genomes. Our findings also highlight duplication potential as a factor to consider in the design of synthetic gene drives.",

However, the accurate constitution of complex shapes and internal anatomical features of specific organs, including their intricate blood vessels and nerves, remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the Matryoshka doll, we here introduce a new method called  Intra-Embedded Bioprinting (IEB), building upon existing embedded bioprinting methods. We used a xanthan gum-based material, which served a dual role as both a bioprintable ink and a support bath, due to its unique shear-thinning and self-healing properties. We demonstrated IEBs capabilities in organ modelling, creating a miniaturized replica of a pancreas using a photocrosslinkable silicone composite. Further, a head phantom and a Matryoshka doll were 3D printed, exemplifying IEBs capability to manufacture intricate, nested structures. Towards the use case of IEB and employing innovative coupling strategy between extrusion-based and aspiration-assisted bioprinting, we developed a breast tumor model that included a central channel mimicking a blood vessel, with tumor spheroids bioprinted in proximity. Validation using a clinically-available chemotherapeutic drug illustrated its efficacy in reducing the tumor volume via perfusion over time. This method opens a new way of bioprinting enabling the creation of complex-shaped organs with internal anatomical features.",

This study characterized the time course and relevance (to metabolic flux) of glucagon-mediated molecular events in the livers of conscious dogs. Glucagon was either infused into the hepato-portal vein at a 6-fold basal rate in the presence of somatostatin and basal insulin, or it was maintained at a basal level in control studies. In one control group glucose remained at basal while in the other glucose was infused to match the hyperglycemia that occurred in the hyperglucagonemic group. Elevated glucagon caused a rapid (30 min) but only partially sustained increase in hepatic cAMP over 4h, a continued elevation in G6P, and activation and deactivation of glycogen phosphorylase and synthase activities, respectively. Net hepatic glycogenolysis and HGP increased rapidly, peaking at 30 min, then returned to baseline over the next three hours (although glucagons stimulatory effect on HGP was sustained relative to the hyperglycemic control group). Hepatic gluconeogenic flux did not increase due to lack of glucagon effect on substrate supply to the liver.

    "abstract": "Many membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we report strong effects of cholesterol depletion and restoration on the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1 in excised patches but negligible effects in whole-cell configuration. Despite the presence of a putative cholesterol binding site, a CARC domain in the human voltage gated proton channel, hHV1, mutation of this domain did not affect cholesterol effects. The murine HV1 lacks a CARC sequence but displays similar cholesterol effects. These three results all argue against a direct effect of cholesterol on HV1. We propose that the data are explainable if HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains, or \"rafts.\" The rafts would be expected to concentrate in the membrane/glass interface and to be depleted from the electrically-accessible patch membrane. This idea is supported by evidence that HV1 channels can diffuse between seal and patch membranes when suction is applied. Suction pulls membrane constituents including HV1 into the patch. In whole-cell studies moderate osmotic stretch does not noticeably alter H+ currents. Simultaneous truncation of the large intracellular N- and C-termini greatly attenuated the cholesterol effect, but C-truncation only did not. We conclude that the N-terminus is the region of attachment to lipid domains. Searching for abundant raft-associated molecules led to stomatin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that hHV1 binds to stomatin. The stomatin-mediated association of HV1 with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains provides a mechanism for cells to direct HV1 to subcellular location where it is needed, such as the phagosome in leukocytes.\n\nSignificanceMany membrane proteins are modulated by cholesterol. Here we explore effects of cholesterol on the human voltage-gated proton channel, hHV1. Although we find little evidence for a direct effect, cholesterol was found to exert a strong influence over H+ current in excised membrane patches. These effects are explainable by hypothesizing that HV1 preferentially associates with cholesterol-dependent membrane lipid domains. We postulate that HV1 diffuses within the membrane and is concentrated in such domains that are anchored to the pipette glass by large membrane proteins. We find that HV1 co-immunoprecipitates with stomatin, a typical component of cholesterol dependent lipid domains. The association of HV1 with lipid domains provides a mechanism for directing HV1 to specific subcellular locations to perform specific functions.",

The MIR319b knockout line developed fewer gemma cups, while there was a decrease in the number of gemma produced per gemma cup in the MIR319a knockout line. It was predicted that miR319 targets MpRKD and MpR2R3-MYB21 mRNA and suppresses their expression.

We found that mMpRKD induced gemma/gemma cup-less liverworts but mMpR2R3-MYB21 did not. These results indicate that miR319 mainly targets and represses RKD expression rather than that of R2R3-MYB21.

    "abstract": "Spores are critical morphotypes required for long-term survival of most fungi. Under the right environmental conditions, spores can escape dormancy and differentiate into vegetatively growing cells through the process of germination. For fatal human fungal pathogens like Cryptococcus, germination is the key differentiation process required for spores to initiate vegetative growth and ultimately cause disease; however, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control germination. To this end, we performed an extensive characterization of Cryptococcus spore germination through the morphological assessment of germinating spores, the inhibition of key eukaryotic processes, and the detailed quantification of fungal spore germination kinetics under numerous nutrient conditions. We identified temporal associations between molecular and morphological events and determined that carbon metabolism pathways (both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation) were required from the beginning of germination. We further determined that carbon sources are primarily used as fuel rather than as simply triggers of germination  commitment, and identified spore-specific carbon source utilization that is absent in yeast. Finally, we discovered the first spore-specific enzyme, Nth2, a trehalase that is required for germination when trehalose is the primary available carbon source. Together this work provides an extensive characterization of Cryptococcus spore germination and suggests that germination is more than simply a  modified cell cycle but is rather a highly adapted differentiation process.",

    "abstract": "Beta adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) are G protein-coupled receptors that control processes as varied as heart rhythm and vascular tone by binding agonists such as norepinephrine to induce downstream signaling pathways. Beta blockers antagonize {beta}ARs to downregulate their activity, thus reducing heart rate and lowering vascular tone. We developed new Rosetta structural modeling protocol to develop state-specific models of {beta}1AR, expressed in cardiac myocytes, as well as {beta}2AR, expressed in the smooth muscle cells of vasculature and other tissues, and their atomistic-scale interactions with beta-blockers using RosettaLigand. We identified structural features of drug - receptor interactions, which may account for their receptor conformational state and drug stereospecific preferences. Furthermore, we estimated structural stabilities of our models using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In our recent study we validated our structural models of norepinephrine-bound {beta}2AR and its complex with stimulatory G protein via multi-microsecond MD simulations. Thus, here we mostly focused on state-dependent and stereospecific {beta}1AR interactions with beta-blocking drugs sotalol and propranolol. We observed expected inactive receptor state preferences and structural stabilities of our models in MD simulations, but neither those simulations nor RosettaLigand docking could clearly distinguish stereospecific preferences of those drugs. This warrants consideration of alternative hypotheses and enhanced sampling MD simulations, which we discussed as well. Nevertheless, our study provides basis for understanding conformational state selectivity and stereospecificity of beta-blockers for {beta}ARs, important pharmacological targets, and may be extended to other drug classes and receptor types.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/560334v1_fig0.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 0\">\nView larger version (82K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1234227org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cc1113org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@751e4corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1181804_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Norepinephrine (NE) bound active-state beta-1 adrenergic receptor (1AR) in complex with the stimulatory G protein (Gs) heterotrimer embedded in a lipid bilayer.\n\nWhen expressed at the plasma membrane, the 1AR is oriented such that the ligand binding pocket (*) is accessible to ligands from the extracellular side (Ex.) of the membrane.

    "abstract": "Changes to body size and shape have been identified as potential adaptive responses to climate change, but the pervasiveness of these responses is questioned. To address this, we measured body and appendage size from 5013 museum bird skins of ecologically and evolutionary diverse species. We found that morphological change is a shared response to climate change across birds. Birds increased bill surface area, tarsus length, and relative wing length through time, consistent with expectations of increasing appendage size in warmer climates. Furthermore, birds decreased in absolute wing length, consistent with the expectation of decreasing body size in warmer climates. Interestingly, these trends were generally consistent across different diets, foraging habitats, and migratory and thermoregulatory behaviours. Shorter-term responses to hot weather were contrary to long-term effects for appendages. Overall, our findings support that morphological adaptation is a widespread response to climate change in birds that is independent of other ecological traits.",

    "abstract": "Efficient pest management requires comprehensive knowledge of its biology, ecology, and evolution, particularly adaptation that exacerbating pest damage. Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) is a notorious pest that attacks more than 200 species, adapts to diverse environments, and has developed resistance to almost all applied insecticides. However, local adaptation of this species especially acclimatization was less investigated. Here, we analyzed genomic variation of Helicoverpa armigera in China and Oceania to identify adaptative loci in different lineages. Despite intensive gene flow, two differentiated Z chromosomal lineages in Central China (i.e., northern and southern lineages) were formed by chromosome inversion and local adaptation. Based on population genomic analysis, we identified genes related to circadian clock (period, cycle, cyr2 and daywake), insulin secretion (IGF2BP2) and energy metabolism (SLC25A25, CCG7766, D11DS, TSTP and CPQ) were under selection in northern lineage. These genes may have contributed to its adaptation to high latitudes. In the southern lineage however, the Z chromosome inversion harbours alleles of two clock genes (period and cycle) introgressed from Oceanian lineage (H. a. conferta) and may have disrupted clock oscillator for acclimatization. We further conducted selective sweep analysis in lineages from Northwestern China, Central China, and Oceania, and found several insecticide resistant genes that shared among different lineages were likely contributed by introgression. Nevertheless, many candidates, including a cadherin that involved in resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis protein in Oceanian populations, are lineage-specific. Our results highlight the importance of investigating local adaptation in effective pest control under globalization of agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are secondary metabolites associated with seed and flower color. A ternary MBW protein complex consisting of interfacing MYB, beta-helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and WD40 repeat (WDR) proteins controls the expression of late biosynthetic genes in the flavonoid pathway. P, the master regulator gene of flavonoid expression in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was recently determined to encode a bHLH protein. Two other genes, T and Z, are also historically considered regulators since they determine the distribution of color in seeds and flowers. These two genes were cloned using reverse genetics based on genetic mapping, candidate gene selection, phylogenetic analysis, and mutant analysis. Domain and AlphaFold2 structure analyses determined T encoded a seven-bladed {beta}-propeller WDR protein, while Z encoded a R2R3 MYB protein. Modeling of the Z MYB/P bHLH/T WDR MBW complex identified interfacing sequence domains and motif in all three genes that are conserved in dicots. One Z MYB motif is a possible {beta}-MoRF that only appears in a structured state when Z MYB is modeled in a MBW complex. Complexes containing mutant T and Z proteins changed the interaction of members of the complex in ways that would alter their role in regulating expression of genes in the flavonoid pathway.\n\nHighlightThe MBW complex of bean comprised of the classic Z, P, and T genes associated with seed coat patterning defines critical proteins interactions for flavonoid gene expression.",

Recent advancements in high throughput ex vivo drug profiling have accelerated interest in FPM. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study for an integrated experimental system that incorporates ex vivo treatment response with a single-cell gene expression output enabling barcoding of several drug conditions in one single-cell sequencing experiment. We demonstrate this through a proof-of-concept investigation focusing on the glucocorticoid-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) E/R+ Reh cell line. Three different single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches were evaluated, each exhibiting high cell recovery and accurate tagging of distinct drug conditions. Notably, our comprehensive analysis revealed variations in library complexity, sensitivity (gene detection), and differential gene expression detection across the methods. Despite these differences, we identified a substantial transcriptional response to fludarabine, a highly relevant drug for treating high-risk ALL, which was consistently recapitulated by all three methods. These findings highlight the potential of our integrated approach for studying drug responses at the single-cell level and emphasize the importance of method selection in scRNA-seq studies. Finally, our data encompassing 27,327 cells are freely available to extend to future scRNA-seq methodological comparisons.",

Here, we introduce a deep learning approach called Antibiotic Peptide de-Extinction (APEX) to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms (the \"extinctome\") searching for encrypted peptide (EP) antibiotics. APEX mined a total of 10,311,899 EPs and identified 37,176 sequences predicted to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. Chemical synthesis and experimental validation yielded archaic EPs (AEPs) with activity against dangerous bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which target the outer membrane. Notably, lead peptides, including those derived from the woolly mammoth, ancient sea cow, giant sloth, and extinct giant elk, exhibited anti-infective activity in preclinical mouse models.

Here we showcase the feasibility of an early-detection SEPARATOR sex sorting approach through using the non-model Tephritid pest, Ceratitis capitata.

The herein characterized strains have 100% desired phenotype outcomes, allowing accurate male-female separation during early development. Overall, we describe an antibiotic and temperature-independent sex-sorting system in C. capitata, which, moving forward, may be implemented in other non-model Tephritid pest species.

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are the most prevalent and life-threatening cancer; an early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors increases the chances of patient survival and treatment planning. However, manual tumor detection is a complex, cumbersome and time-consuming task and is prone to errors, which relies on the radiologists experience. As a result, the development of accurate and automatic system for tumor detection is critical. In this paper, we proposed a new model called Parallel Residual Convolutional Network (PRCnet) model to classify brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The PCRnet model uses several techniques (such as filters of different sizes with parallel layers, connections between layers, batch normalization layer, and ReLU) and dropout layer to overcome the over-fitting problem, for achieving accurate and automatic classification of brain tumors. The PRCnet model is trained and tested on two different datasets and obtained an accuracy of 94.77% and 97.1% for dataset A and dataset B, respectively which is way better as compared to the state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Although the structural rearrangement of the membrane-bound matrix (MA) protein trimers upon HIV-1 maturation has been reported, the consequences of MA maturation on the MA-lipid interactions are not well understood. Long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the MA multimeric assemblies of immature and mature virus particles with our realistic asymmetric membrane model have explored MA-lipid interactions and lateral organization of lipids around MA complexes. The number of stable MA-PS and MA-PIP2 interactions at the trimeric interface of the mature MA complex is observed to be greater compared to that of the immature MA complex. Our simulations identified an alternative PIP2 binding site in the immature MA complex where the multivalent headgroup of a PIP2 lipid with a greater negative charge binds to multiple basic amino acid residues such as, ARG3 residues of both the MA monomers at the trimeric interface, and HBR residues (LYS29, LYS31) of one of the MA monomers. Our enhanced sampling simulations have explored the conformational space of phospholipids at different binding sites of the trimeric interface of MA complexes. Unlike the immature MA complex, the sn-2 acyl tail of two PIP2 lipids at the trimeric interface of the mature MA complex is observed to sample stable binding pockets of MA consisting of helix4 residues. Together, our results provide molecular-level insights into the interactions of MA trimeric complexes with membrane and different lipid conformations at the specific binding sites of MA protein before and after viral maturation.",

    "abstract": "Double-stranded RNA is the end-product of template-based replication, and is also the functional state of some biological RNAs. Similarly to proteins and DNA, they can be denatured by temperature, with important physiological and technological implications. Here, we use an in silico strategy to probe the thermal denaturation of RNA duplexes. Following previous results that were obtained on a few different duplexes, and which nuanced the canonical 2-state picture of nucleic acid denaturation, we here specifically address three different aspects that improve our description of the temperature-induced dsRNA separation. First, we investigate the effect of the spatial distribution of weak and strong base-pairs among the duplex sequence. We show that the deviations from the two-state dehybridization mechanism are more pronounced when a strong core is flanked with weak extremities, while duplexes with a weak core but strong extremities exhibit a two-state behavior, which can be explained by the key role played by base fraying. This was later verified by generating artificial hairpin or circular states containing one or two locked duplex extremities, which results in an important reinforcement of the entire HB structure of the duplex and higher melting temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that our results are little sensitive to the employed combination of RNA and water forcefields. The trends in thermal stability among the different sequences as well as the observed unfolding mechanisms (and the deviations from a two-state scenario) remain the same regardless of the employed atomistic models. However, our study points to possible limitations of recent reparametrizations of the Amber RNA forcefield, which sometimes results in duplexes that readily denature under ambient conditions, in contradiction with available experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Androgen receptor-(AR-) indifference is a mechanism of resistance to hormonal therapy in prostate cancer (PC). Here we demonstrate that the HOX/CUT transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) activates resistance through multiple drivers associated with adenocarcinoma, stem-like and neuroendocrine (NE) variants. Direct OC2 targets include the glucocorticoid receptor and the NE splicing factor SRRM4, among others. OC2 regulates gene expression by promoter binding, enhancement of chromatin accessibility, and formation of novel super-enhancers. OC2 also activates glucuronidation genes that irreversibly disable androgen, thereby evoking phenotypic heterogeneity indirectly by hormone depletion. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC. Our findings support enhanced efforts to therapeutically target this protein as a means of suppressing treatment-resistant disease.\n\nSignificance StatementONECUT2 (OC2) is a master transcription factor that alters lineage identity by activating gene networks associated with both neuroendocrine prostate cancer and prostate adenocarcinoma. A small molecule inhibitor of OC2 represses the lineage plasticity program activated by enzalutamide, suggesting OC2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent emergence of treatment-resistant variants.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/560025v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143b135org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12749b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57354borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16bfd43_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphic AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a challenging environment where cells must cope with stressful conditions such as fluctuating pH levels, hypoxia, and free radicals. In response, stress pathways are activated, which can both promote and inhibit tumorigenesis. In this study, we set out to characterize the stress response landscape across four carcinomas: breast, pancreas, ovary, and prostate tumors, focusing on five pathways: Heat shock response, oxidative stress response, unfolded protein response, hypoxia stress response, and DNA damage response. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we create an atlas of the stress response landscape across various types of carcinomas. We find that stress responses are heterogeneously activated in the TME, and highly activated near cancer cells. Focusing on the non-immune stroma we find, across tumor types, that NRF2 and the oxidative stress response are distinctly activated in immune-regulatory cancer-associated fibroblasts and in a unique subset of cancer associated pericytes. Our study thus provides an interactome of stress responses in cancer, offering new ways to intersect survival pathways within the tumor, and advance cancer therapy.",

Our study shows that BRAF V600 mutated melanomas display heterogeneous biology, where the presence of an oncogene-induced senescence-like phenotype improves patient survival. Therefore, we propose a mortality-risk-based stratification, which may contribute to a more personalized approach to patient treatment.

    "abstract": "Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable and new therapeutic targets and drugs are needed. Viruses are associated with several cancer types, but their connection to prostate cancer is unclear. Here we show that human herpes virus cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common in the healthy prostate epithelium as well as in prostate cancer, with 85% of tumors being infected to varying degrees. The CMV gene locus UL122-UL123 upheld viral genome persistence in endogenously CMV infected prostate cancer cell lines. CMV promoted prostate cancer cell viability independently of androgen receptor status and anti-androgen resistance, partly through CMV UL97 and the androgen signaling pathway. DNA intercalation mitigated CMV infection and reduced CMV-dependent tumor size in xenotransplantation experiments. The anti-herpes drug aciclovir showed modest effects, but the well tolerated CMV UL97 kinase inhibitor maribavir partly mimicked CMV loss by inducing apoptosis and attenuating proliferation, resulting in reduced tumor growth in vivo. We conclude that CMV infects prostate cells in vivo and alters core prostate cancer cell properties, suggesting that it can be therapeutically targeted to improve prostate cancer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cells of the innate immune system retain memory of prior exposures through a process known as innate immune training. {beta}-glucan, a Dectin-1 ligand purified from the Candida albicans cell wall, has been one of the most widely utilized and well-characterized ligands for inducing innate immune memory. However, many Dectin-1 agonists exist, and it is not known whether all Dectin-1 ligands produce the same phenotype. Using a well-established in vitro model of trained immunity, we compared two commercially available Dectin-1 agonists, zymosan and depleted zymosan, with the gold standard {beta}-glucan in the literature. We found that depleted zymosan, a {beta}-glucan purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall through alkali treatment, produced near identical training effects as C. albicans {beta}-glucan. However, untreated zymosan produced a distinct training effect from {beta}-glucans at both the transcript and cytokine level. Training with zymosan diminished, rather than potentiated, induction of key cytokines such as TNF, IL-12, and IL-6. Zymosan activated NF{kappa}B and AP-1 transcription factors more strongly than {beta}-glucans. The addition of the toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand Pam3CSK4 was sufficient to convert the training effect of {beta}-glucans to a phenotype resembling training with zymosan. We conclude that differential activation of TLR signaling pathways determines the phenotype of innate immune training induced by Dectin-1. These findings bring clarity to the specific question of which Dectin-1 agonists produce prototypical training effects and provide broader insight into how signaling networks regulate innate immune training.",

    "abstract": "Global amphibian declines are largely driven by deadly disease outbreaks caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In the time since these disease outbreaks were first discovered, much has been learned about the roles of amphibian skin-produced antimicrobial components and skin microbiomes in controlling Bd. Yet almost nothing is known about the roles of skin-resident immune cells in anti-Bd defenses. Notably, mammalian mast cells reside within and serve as key immune sentinels in barrier tissues like the skin. Thus, they are critical to immune recognition of pathogens and to orchestrating the ensuing immune responses. Accordingly, we investigated the roles of Xenopus laevis frog mast cells during Bd infections. Our findings indicate that enrichment of X. laevis skin mast cells confers significant anti-Bd protection and ameliorates the inflammation-associated skin damage caused by Bd infection. Moreover, enriching X. laevis mast cells promotes greater mucin content within cutaneous mucus glands and protects frogs from Bd-mediated changes to their skin microbiomes. Together, this work underlines the importance of amphibian skin-resident immune cells in anti-Bd defenses and introduces a novel approach for investigating amphibian host-chytrid pathogen interactions.",

Typhimurium when was in filtered spent media from Lactobacillus spp., which return to normal when the spent media is neutralized. Using membrane destabilizers, we determined that acidic pH triggers a modified membrane permeability leading to the tolerance to azithromycin, whereas a distinct mechanism is responsible for the increased tolerance in the presence Lactobacilli. We used a high-throughput assay using the single gene deletion mutants of the S. Typhimurium collection (SGD) and the probiotic L. rhamnosus or pH 5.5 media to understand how S. Typhimurium was impacted in these conditions. Genes of importance in these two conditions were different and involved either cellular respiration or envelope homeostasis, which indicates a possible mechanism for the observed tolerance of S.

We hypothesized that altered functions of innate immune components in the human alveolar lining fluid of PLWH (HIV-ALF), drive susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection. Our results indicate a significant increase in oxidation of innate proteins and chemokine levels, and significantly lower levels and function of complement components and Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines in HIV-ALF vs. control-ALF (non-HIV infected people). We further found a deficiency of surfactant protein-D (SP-D) and reduced binding of SP-D to M.tb that had been exposed to HIV-ALF. Primary human macrophages infected with M.tb exposed to HIV-ALF were significantly less capable of controlling the infection, which was reversed by SP-D replenishment in HIV-ALF.

A subset of sperm small RNAs are thought to be acquired during epididymal transit. However, the transfer of RNAs from the somatic epididymis to sperm has been questioned, and the identity of the specific small RNAs transferred remains unclear. Here, we employ Cre/Lox genetics to generate germline- and epididymal-specific Dgcr8 conditional knockout mice to investigate the dynamics of sperm microRNAs and their function in the early embryo. Testicular sperm from germline specific Dgcr8 knockout mice have reduced levels of 98 microRNAs. Enthrallingly, following epididymal transit the abundance of 59% of these microRNAs are restored to control levels. Conversely, sperm from epididymal Dgcr8 knockouts displayed a reduction of > 3.4-fold in 25 miRNAs. This substantial loss of epididymal miRNAs in sperm was accompanied by transcriptomic changes in the embryo which was rescued by microinjection of epididymal miRNAs. These findings ultimately demonstrate the acquisition of miRNAs from the soma by sperm during epididymal transit and their subsequent regulation of post-fertilization embryonic gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Spermiogenesis is a critical, post-meiotic phase of male gametogenesis, in which the proper gene expression is essential for sperm maturation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression in the round spermatids remains elusive. Here, we identify that FBXO24, an orphan F-box protein, is highly expressed in the testis of humans and mice and interacts with the splicing factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to modulate the gene alternative splicing in the round spermatids. Genetic mutation of FBXO24 in mice causes many abnormal splicing events in round spermatids, thus affecting a large number of critical genes related to sperm formation that were dysregulated. Further molecular and phenotypical analyses revealed that FBXO24 deficiency results in aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid body (CB), and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along sperm flagella, ultimately leading to male sterility. In addition, we discovered that FBXO24 interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that FBXO24 depletion could lead to aberrant piRNA production in testes, which suggests FBXO24 is required for normal piRNA biogenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FBXO24 is essential for sperm formation and piRNA production by regulating mRNA alternative splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The soil microbiome plays a crucial role in protecting plants against various pests and pathogens. However, its impact on interactions between plants and parasitic weeds, such as Striga hermonthica, is poorly understood. In this study, sorghum plants susceptible to Striga were grown in 22 different field soils infested with parasite seeds. Significant variations in Striga infections were observed among the soils. When the most Striga-suppressive soil was gamma-irradiated, there was a significant increase in Striga attachments, highlighting the importance of the soil microbiome in disrupting parasite infection. In the presence of the soil microbiome, the Striga-susceptible sorghum plants performed similarly to three Striga-resistant genotypes. This effect was lost when the soil microbiome was eliminated by gamma-irradiation. Subsequent analysis revealed that Striga substantially affected the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome and that both the sorghum rhizosphere mycobiome and bacteriome composition significantly correlated with Striga attachment. Interestingly, certain fungal species in the sorghum rhizosphere mycobiome were only detected when Striga seeds were present. Further investigation showed that these fungal taxa originated from the Striga seeds and are known sorghum pathogens, suggesting a potential partnership between Striga and fungal pathogens to invade their shared host. Overall, our study demonstrated that the soil microbiome influences Striga infection and sorghum performance in a genotype-dependent manner, and the microbiome of Striga seeds affects the composition of the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome.",

Despite high prevalence in civilian and military populations, there is currently no effective treatment for VML but bioengineering interventions such as biomaterials that fill the VML defect to support tissue growth and repair are a promising strategy. However, traditional biomaterials developed for this purpose are rigid, non-porous constructs that hinder cell infiltration. In the present study, we test the effects of granular hydrogels on muscle repair - hypothesizing that their inherent porosity will support the invasion of native myogenic cells and their flowability will permit conformable filling of the defect site, leading to effective muscle repair. We used photocurable hyaluronic acid crosslinked with matched muscle stiffness to prepare small or large particle fragments via extrusion fragmentation and facile size sorting. In assembled granular hydrogels, particle size and degree of packing significantly influenced pore features including porosity, pore size, and pore density, as well as rheological behavior including storage moduli and yield strain. We tested the ability of granular hydrogels to support early-stage (satellite cell invasion) and late-stage (myofiber invasion) muscle repair compared to bulk hydrogels in a VML injury model in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of 12-14 week old mice. Histological evaluation revealed granular hydrogels supported these regenerative processes while control bulk hydrogels restricted them to the gel-tissue interface in line with the absence of invading cells. Together, these results highlight the promising potential of injectable and porous granular hydrogels in supporting endogenous repair after severe muscle injury.",

While the role of protein fragments as evolutionary units is well-established, their biophysical features necessary for generating a well-folded and stable protein are not clearly understood. In order to probe how fragments determine foldability and stability of recombined proteins, we investigated the stability, folding and dynamics of a synthetic chimera created by fusion of fragments of the chemotactic response regulator protein CheY that belongs to the flavodoxin-like fold and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase from histidine biosynthesis (HisF) which harbors the TIM-barrel fold. The chimera unfolds via an equilibrium intermediate. Mutation of a glycine residue present at the interface of the CheY and HisF fragments to a valine abrogates the equilibrium intermediate while mutation to isoleucine dramatically increases the native state kinetic stability without any significant change in the folding rate. Parts of the fragment interface in the chimera are found to be conformationally dynamic while hydrophobic mutations globally increase its conformational rigidity. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic mutation improves sidechain packing in a large cluster of isoleucine, leucine and valine (ILV) residues that spans the fragment interface. We also extrapolate that inheritance of large ILV clusters from parent proteins could be a key determinant of successful fragment recombination.",

In this report, we investigated whether hypoxia develops in the FK cornea and, by extension, if fungal hypoxia adaptation is essential for virulence in this setting. Methods: C57BL/6j mice were inoculated with Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani var petroliphilum via topical overlay or instrastromal injection. At various time points post-inoculation (p.i.), animals we were injected with pimonidazole for the detection of tissue hypoxia through immunofluorescence imaging. The A. fumigatus srbA gene was deleted through Cas9-mediated homologous recombination and its virulence was assessed in the topical infection model using slit-lamp microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Results: Topical inoculation with A. fumigatus resulted in diffuse pimonidazole staining across the epithelial and endothelial layers within 6 h. Stromal hypoxia was evident by 48 h p.i., which corresponded to leukocytic infiltration. Instrastromal inoculation with either A. fumigatus or F. solani similarly led to diffuse staining patterns across all corneal cell layers. The A. fumigatus srbA deletion mutant was unable to grow at oxygen levels below 3% in vitro, and corneas inoculated with the mutant failed to develop signs of corneal opacification, inflammation or fungal burden. Conclusions: These results suggest that fungal antigen rapidly drives the development of corneal hypoxia, thus rendering fungal SrbA or related pathways essential for the establishment of infection. Such pathways may therefore serve as targets for novel antifungal intervention.",

The two nearly perfect 220 bp repeats, designated Replication Risk Sequences or RRS, are each 650 kbp from the terminus sequence dif and flank the Ter macrodomain. RRS sequence and positioning is highly conserved in enterobacteria. At least one RRS appears to be essential unless a 200 kbp region encompassing one of them is amplified. The RRS produce lagging strand ssDNA gaps, [&le;]2000 bp long, upon replisome passage, regardless of genome placement. Deletion of both RRS elements has substantial effects on global genome structure and topology. We hypothesize that RRS elements serve as topological relief valves during chromosome replication and segregation. There have been no screens for genomic sequences that trigger transient gap formation. Functional analogs of RRS could be widespread, possibly including some enigmatic G-quadruplexes.",
