    "abstract": "We present a high-resolution 1D and 2D magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) study to characterize native Pseudomonas fluorescens colony biofilms at natural abundance without isotope-labelling. By using a high-resolution INEPT-based 2D 1H-13C ssNMR spectrum and thorough peak deconvolution approach at the 1D ssNMR spectra, approximately 80/134 (in 1D/2D) distinct biofilm chemical sites were identified. We compared CP and INEPT 13C ssNMR spectra to different signals originating from the mobile and rigid fractions of the biofilm, and qualitative determined dynamical changes by comparing CP buildup behaviors. Protein and polysaccharide signals were differentiated and identified by utilizing FapC signals as a template, a biofilm forming functional amyloid from Pseudomonas. We also attempted to identify biofilm polysaccharide species by using 1H/13C chemical shifts obtained from the 2D spectrum. This study marks the first demonstration of high-resolution 2D ssNMR spectroscopy for characterizing native bacterial biofilms and expands the scope of ssNMR in studying biofilms. Our experimental pipeline can be readily applied to other in vitro biofilm model systems and natural biofilms and holds the promise of making a substantial impact on biofilm research, fostering new ideas and breakthroughs to aid in the development of strategic approaches to combat infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The unknown identity of the entry receptors utilized by many coronaviruses has significantly impeded our comprehensive understanding of these important pathogens. We recently reported an unexpected usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), instead of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), for cellular entry by NeoCoV and PDF-2180, close relatives of MERS-CoV that infect African bats. However, the presence and distribution of other ACE2-using merbecoviruses remain enigmatic. In this study, through sequence and structural analyses, we predicted that two newly discovered merbecoviruses infecting European Pipistrellus bats (Pipistrellus nathusii), namely MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B, may also utilize ACE2 as their receptors. Functional profiling of 103 ACE2 orthologues from a variety of mammals confirmed that several ACE2 from bats efficiently facilitate the entry of MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B. Conversely, no binding or entry signals for both viruses were detected when assessing seven DPP4 orthologues from humans, hedgehogs, and bats. Characterization of Pteronotus davyi (P.dav) ACE2 mediated entry of MOW-15-22 reveals a significant exogenous protease dependence, which can be dose-dependently neutralized by soluble P.dav ACE2 recombinant protein and a broadly neutralizing S2-targeting antibody. Verification of the previously reported critical ACE2 determinants for NeoCoV recognition reveals that MOW-15-22 and PnNL2018B displayed a glycan-independent binding mode with significantly altered interaction details. This study sheds light on two additional ACE2-using merbecoviruses circulating among European bats and underscores the potential zoonotic risk associated with these viruses.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces are the primary source of bioactive specialized metabolites used in research and medicine, including many antimicrobials. These are presumed to be secreted and function as freely soluble compounds. However, increasing evidence suggests extracellular vesicles are an alternative secretion system. We assessed environmental and lab-adapted Streptomyces (sporulating filamentous actinomycetes) and found a majority of strains produce vesicles packaging antimicrobial compounds. The cargo included actinomycins, anthracyclines, candicidin, and actinorhodin, reflecting both diverse chemical properties and diverse antibacterial and antifungal activity. The production of the antimicrobials and vesicles was linked, although vesicle production continued in the absence of antimicrobials. We demonstrated that antimicrobial-containing vesicles achieve direct delivery of the cargo to other microbes. Notably, this delivery via membrane fusion occurred to a broad range of microbes including pathogenic bacteria and yeast. Vesicle encapsulation offers a broad and permissive packaging and delivery system for antimicrobial specialized metabolites, with important implications for ecology and translation.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=185 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/560488v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ebf8b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14831borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab7004org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1471a07_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG IMPORTANCEExtracellular vesicle encapsulation changes our picture of how antimicrobial metabolites function in the environment, and provides an alternative translational approach for delivery of antimicrobials. We find the majority of Streptomyces strains are capable of releasing antimicrobial vesicles, and at least four distinct classes of compounds can be packaged, suggesting this is widespread in nature. This is a striking departure from the primary paradigm of secretion and action of specialized metabolites as soluble compounds. Importantly the vesicles deliver antimicrobial metabolites directly to other microbes via membrane fusion, including to pathogenic bacteria and yeast. This suggests future applications in which lipid-encapsulated natural product antibiotics and antifungals could be used to solve some of the most pressing problems in drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved to be exquisitely adapted to survive within host macrophages. The capacity to damage the phagosomal membrane has emerged as central to Mtb virulence. While Mtb factors driving membrane damage have been described, host factors that repair that damage to contain the pathogen remain largely unknown. We used a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify novel host factors required to repair Mtb-damaged phagosomal membranes. Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 18 (Vps18), a member of the HOPS and CORVET trafficking complexes, was among the top hits. Vps18 colocalized with Mtb in macrophages beginning shortly after infection, and Vps18-knockout macrophages demonstrated increased damage of Mtb-containing phagosomes without impaired autophagy. Mtb grew more robustly in Vps18-knockout cells, and the first-line anti-tuberculosis antibiotic pyrazinamide was less effective. Our results identify Vps18 as required for phagosomal membrane integrity in Mtb-infected cells and suggest that modulating phagosome integrity may hold promise for improving the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for TB.",

    "abstract": "When the structural stability of a protein is compromised, the protein may form non-native interactions with other cell proteins and thus becomes a hazard to the cell. To mitigate this danger, destabilized proteins are targeted by the cellular protein quality control (PQC) network, which either corrects the folding defect or targets the protein for degradation. However, the details of how the protein folding and degradation systems collaborate to combat potentially toxic non-native proteins are unknown. To address this issue, we performed systematic studies on destabilized variants of the cytosolic aspartoacylase, ASPA, where loss-of-function variants are linked to Canavans disease, an autosomal recessive and lethal neurological disorder, characterized by the spongy degeneration of the white matter in the brain. Using Variant Abundance by Massively Parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), we determined the abundance of 6152 out of the 6260 ([~]98%) possible single-site missense and nonsense ASPA variants in cultured human cells. The majority of the low abundance ASPA variants are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and become toxic upon prolonged expression. Variant cellular abundance data correlates with predicted thermodynamic stability, evolutionary conservation, and separates most known disease-linked variants from benign variants. Systematic mapping of degradation signals (degrons) shows that inherent primary degrons in ASPA are located in buried regions, and reveals that the wild-type ASPA C-terminal region functions as a degron. Collectively, our data can be used to interpret Canavans disease variants and also offer mechanistic insight into how ASPA missense variants are targeted by the PQC system. These are essential steps towards future implementation of precision medicine for Canavans disease.",

    "abstract": "Although DNA in the genome is double-stranded, single-stranded DNA is generated during various processes including DNA replication and repair. Some single-stranded DNAs can form noncanonical structures. Various proteins bind to the single-stranded DNAs site-specifically and/or structure-specifically to regulate various DNA transactions. Because of the transient nature of single-stranded DNAs in the cell, current in vivo techniques may not reveal all such sequences, structures, and protein-DNA complexes. To explore such sequences and structures genome-wide, it is necessary to generate single-stranded DNA libraries. Current in vitro methods involve heat denaturation of libraries of double-stranded DNA fragments followed by cooling to prevent reannealing; however, a significant amount of DNA can reanneal to regenerate double-stranded DNAs. In ExoChew method, double-stranded DNA fragment libraries are enzymatically converted to single-stranded DNA libraries. Genomic DNA is sonicated to generate pools of double-stranded DNA fragments of required size. Each pool of double-stranded DNA fragments is then treated with either T7 exonuclease or E. coli exonuclease III. which recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA from 5 ends or 3 ends, generating single-stranded DNA pools, respectively. The enzymatically generated single-stranded DNA pools can be used for genome-wide studies of protein-DNA interactions and structural studies of DNA.",

We found higher rNMP incorporation in the nuclear genome of rnh201-G42S than in wild-type and rnh203-K46W-mutant cells, and an elevated rCMP content in both mutants. Moreover, we uncovered unique rNMP patterns in each mutant, highlighting a differential activity of the AGS mutants towards rNMPs embedded on the leading or on the lagging strand of DNA replication.

    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes are at epidemic levels and a significant proportion of these patients are diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy. CREB Regulated Transcription Co-activator (CRTC) is a key regulator of metabolism in mammalian hepatocytes, where it is activated by calcineurin (CaN) to increase expression of gluconeogenic genes. CaN is known its role in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, however, a role for CRTC in the heart has not been identified. In Drosophila, CRTC null mutants have little body fat and exhibit severe cardiac restriction, myofibrillar disorganization, cardiac fibrosis and tachycardia, all hallmarks of heart disease. Cardiac-specific knockdown of CRTC, or its coactivator CREBb, mimicked the reduced body fat and heart defects of CRTC null mutants. Comparative gene expression in CRTC loss- or gain-of-function fly hearts revealed contra-regulation of genes involved in glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism, suggesting that CRTC also acts as a metabolic switch in the heart. Among the contra-regulated genes with conserved CREB binding sites, we identified the fly ortholog of Sarcalumenin, which is a Ca2+-binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cardiac knockdown recapitulated the loss of CRTC cardiac restriction and fibrotic phenotypes, suggesting it is a downstream effector of CRTC we named thinman (tmn). Importantly, cardiac overexpression of either CaN or CRTC in flies caused hypertrophy that was reversed in a CRTC mutant background, suggesting CRTC mediates hypertrophy downstream of CaN, perhaps as an alternative to NFAT. CRTC novel role in the heart is likely conserved in vertebrates as knockdown in zebrafish also caused cardiac restriction, as in fl ies. These data suggest that CRTC is involved in myocardial cell maintenance and that CaN-CRTC- Sarcalumenin/tmn signaling represents a novel and conserved pathway underlying cardiac hypertrophy.",

    "abstract": "Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms that lack key features conventionally used to define the head-tail axis in free-living organisms, resulting in long standing questions regarding the true orientation of their main body axis. As adults, most tapeworms also exhibit a segmented body which has been considered an adaptation unique to the group. Anteroposterior (AP) patterning in free-living flatworms is controlled by {beta}-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling and positional control genes are expressed by their musculature in highly regionalised domains. Here we investigate the expression of Wnt and Hedgehog components during the strobilar phase of the tapeworm life cycle during which larval tissues are lost and replaced through the continuous production of new tissues. Results reveal previously unidentified centres of signalling associated with their neuromuscular system and show that segments are marked by secondary, AP axes in agreement with the polarity of the primary body axis. Neuromuscular expression and communication between Wnt and Hedgehog signalling is consistent with embryonic and regenerative growth in planarians and is a common mechanism for establishing AP-polarised boundaries in a diverse range of segmented animals. Taken together our results suggest that segmentation in tapeworms represents a modified form of posterior regeneration, a common feature among flatworms.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) followed by speciation allows us to examine the parallel evolution of ohnolog pairs. In the yeast family Saccharomycetaceae, HRR25 is a rare case of repeated ohnolog maintenance. This gene has reverted to a single copy in S. cerevisiae where it is now essential, but has been maintained as pairs in at least 7 species post WGD. In S. cerevisiae, HRR25 encodes the casein kinase (CK) 1{delta}/{epsilon} and plays a role in a variety of functions through its kinase activity and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We hypothesized that the maintenance of duplicated HRR25 ohnologs could be a result of repeated subfunctionalization. We tested this hypothesis through a functional complementation assay in S. cerevisiae, testing all pairwise combinations of 25 orthologs (including 7 ohnolog pairs). Contrary to our expectations, we observed no cases of pair-dependent complementation, which would have supported the subfunctionalization hypothesis. Instead, most post-WGD species have one ohnolog that failed to complement, suggesting their nonfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. The ohnologs incapable of complementation have undergone more rapid protein evolution, lost most PPIs that were observed for their functional counterparts and singletons from post and non-WGD species, and have non-conserved cellular localization, consistent with their ongoing loss of function. The analysis in N. castelli shows that the non-complementing ohnolog is expressed at a lower level and has become non-essential. Taken together, our results indicate that HRR25 orthologs are undergoing gradual nonfunctionalization.",

Endocrine systems that exhibit plastic changes in response to environmental variation may be subject to natural selection, but their evolution requires heritable variation. It is currently unknown if endocrine plasticity to environmental challenges is heritable. We tested whether glucocorticoid responsiveness to food restriction is heritable in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, by subjecting individuals to a standardized dietary restriction and selecting individuals according to their hormonal responsiveness to the treatments: into high plastic, low plastic, and control groups and let them reproduce. Using a cross-foster design, we compared the parental and the F1 generation to partition the heritability of glucocorticoid responsiveness into genetic and environmental sources of variation. We found moderate heritability (h2>20%) of glucocorticoid plasticity in response to food availability in both restricted and adequate food conditions. Environmental variance played a larger role under restricted than adequate food conditions, whereas residual variance was much higher under adequate food conditions. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of heritable individual variation in glucocorticoid plasticity that selection can act upon, especially in rapidly changing environments.",

MCAK (mitotic centromere-associated kinesin), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is an end-binding regulator of catastrophe frequency. It is intriguing how MCAK specifically binds to dynamic microtubule ends. Here, we measure the end-binding kinetics of MCAK using single-molecule imaging and reveal the end-binding preference. MCAK binds to the entire GTP cap, including the EB cap and the distalmost cap. Further analysis shows that MCAK strongly binds to GTP{gamma}S microtubules, suggesting that it could recognize the nucleotide-dependent feature of microtubules. Moreover, the binding preference is independent on the nucleotide state of MCAK, and this feature facilitates the high-affinity end-binding of MCAK. Finally, we show that despite partially sharing the binding regions, MCAK and XMAP215 function in an additive manner, demonstrating a simple logic of how the end-binding regulators work in coordination. In all, our results provide novel insights into understanding how MCAK regulates the dynamics of microtubule ends.",

Here we show that this interaction is divided into two stages, of which the first is a fast and reversible binding of the drug to phospholipid membrane in milliseconds and the second is a slow and irreversible insertion into membrane in minutes, only in the presence of the bacteria-specific lipid phosphatidylglycerol, to a saturating point where the ratio of the drug to phosphatidylglycerol is 1:2. Fluorescence-based titration showed that the antibiotic simultaneously binds two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol with a nanomolar binding affinity in the presence of calcium ion. The resulting stable complex is easily formed in a test tube and readily isolated from the membrane of drug-treated bacterial cells, strongly supporting a unique drug uptake mechanism in which daptomycin forms a stable multi-component complex with calcium and phosphatidylglycerol. Revelation of this novel uptake mechanism provides fresh insights into the mode of action of daptomycin and paves the way to new strategies to attenuate resistance to the drug.",

    "abstract": "Nocardia are gram-positive bacteria from the actinobacterial class. Some Nocardia species can infect humans and are usually considered opportunist pathogens as they often infect immunocompromised patients. Albeit, their clinical incidence is low, many Nocardia species are nowadays considered emerging pathogens. Primary sites of infection of Nocardia are the skin or the lungs but dissemination to other body parts is very frequent. These disseminated infections are very difficult to treat and thus, tackled with multiple classes of antibiotics, on top of the traditional treatment targeting the folate pathway. {beta}-lactams are often included in the regimen but many Nocardia species present moderate or strong resistance to some of this drug class. Genomics, microbiological, and biochemical studies have reported the presence of class A {beta}-lactamases (ABL) in a handful of Nocardia species but no structural investigation of Nocardia {beta}-lactamases has been performed yet. In this study, we report the expression, purification, and preliminary biochemical characterization of the ABL from a Nocardia cyriacigeorgica (BlaNcyr) clinical strain. We described, as well, the crystallization and the very high-resolution crystal structure of BlaNcyr. The protein sequence and structural analysis demonstrate that BlaNcyr belongs to {beta}-lactamase of class A1 and attest to very high conservation between ABL from other human pathogenic Nocardia species. In addition, the presence of one molecule of citrate tightly bound in the catalytic site of the enzyme is described. This structure may provide a solid basis for future drug development to specifically target Nocardia {beta}-lactamases.",

    "abstract": "Similar to plant pathogens, phloem-feeding insects such as aphids deliver effector proteins inside their hosts that act to promote host susceptibility and enable feeding and infestation. Despite exciting progress towards identifying and characterizing effector proteins from these insects, their functions remain largely unknown. The recent ground-breaking development in protein structure prediction algorithms combined with the availability of proteomics and transcriptomic datasets for agriculturally important pests, such as the aphid Myzus persicae (green peach aphid), provides new opportunities to explore the structural and functional diversity of effector repertoires. In this study, we sought to gain insight into the the M. persicae effector repertoire by predicting and analysing the structures of a set of 71 effector candidate proteins. We used two protein structure prediction methods, AlphaFold and OmegaFold, which produced mutually consistent results. We observed a wide continuous spectrum of sizes and structures among the effector candidates, from disordered proteins to globular enzymes. We made use of the structural information and state-of-the-art computational methods to predict M. persicae effector protein properties, including function and interaction with host plant proteins. Overall, our investigation provides novel insights into the structure, function, and interaction prediction of aphid effector repertoires and will guide the necessary experimental characterization to address new hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) cause early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's Disease (PD). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase which functions as a mitochondrial damage sensor and initiates mitochondrial quality control by accumulating on the damaged organelle. There, it will autophosphorylate and then phosphorylate ubiquitin chains, which in turn will recruit and activate Parkin, and E3 ubiquitin ligase also implicated in PD. Ubiquitylation of mitochondrial proteins leads to the autophagic degradation of the damaged organelle. Pharmacological modulation of PINK1 constitutes an appealing avenue to study its physiological function and develop PD therapeutics. In this study, we used a thermal shift assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors of PINK1. In vitro kinase activity assays demonstrate that these molecules are ATP competitive inhibitors that block ubiquitin phosphorylation. PRT062607 (a SYK inhibitor) is the most potent inhibitor of PINK1 in our screen and has an IC50 of 2 M against insect PINK1 and 1 M in HeLa cells expressing human PINK1. The crystal structures of PINK1 in complex with PRT062607 or CYC116 reveal how the compounds interact with the ATP-binding pocket. PRT062607 notably engages with the catalytic aspartate (type-1 inhibition) and causes a destabilization of insert-2 at the autophosphorylation dimer interface. Our findings provide a scaffold for the development of more selective and potent inhibitors of PINK1 that can be used as chemical probes.",

    "abstract": "The loss of function of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) mechanoenzymes has been linked to diseases, and small molecules that activate these proteins can be powerful tools to probe mechanisms and test therapeutic hypotheses. Unlike chemical inhibitors that can bind a single conformational state to block enzyme activity, activator binding must be permissive to different conformational states needed for enzyme function. However, we do not know how AAA proteins can be activated by small molecules. Here, we focus on valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a AAA unfoldase whose loss of function has been linked to protein aggregation-based disorders, to identify druggable sites for chemical activators. We identified VCP Activator 1 (VA1), a compound that dose-dependently stimulates VCP ATPase activity up to [~]3-fold. Our cryo-EM studies resulted in structures ([~]2.9-3.5 [A]-resolution) of VCP in apo and ADP-bound states, and revealed VA1 binding an allosteric pocket near the C-terminus in both states. Engineered mutations in the VA1 binding site confer resistance to VA1, and furthermore, modulate VCP activity to a similar level as VA1-mediated activation. The VA1 binding site can alternatively be occupied by a phenylalanine residue in the VCP C-terminal tail, a motif that is post-translationally modified and interacts with cofactors. Together, our findings uncover a druggable allosteric site and a mechanism of enzyme regulation that can be tuned through small molecule mimicry.\n\nSignificanceThe loss of function of valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), a mechanoenzyme from the AAA superfamily that hydrolyzes ATP and uses the released energy to extract or unfold substrate proteins, is linked to protein aggregation-based disorders. However, druggable allosteric sites to activate VCP, or any AAA mechanoenzyme, have not been identified. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of VCP in two states in complex with VA1, a compound we identified that dose-dependently stimulates VCPs ATP hydrolysis activity. The VA1 binding site can also be occupied by a phenylalanine residue in the VCP C-terminal tail, suggesting that VA1 acts through mimicry of this interaction. Our study reveals a druggable allosteric site and a mechanism of enzyme regulation.",

    "abstract": "Sea squirts or tunicates bodies are composed of cellulose nanofibers and gallol- functionalized proteins. These sea creatures are known to heal their injuries under seawater by forming crosslinks between gallols and functional groups from other proteins in their bodies. Inspired by their wound healing mechanism, herein, we have developed a tissue sealant using zein (a plant-based protein) and tannic acid (gallol-containing polyphenol). Except for fibrin- based sealants, most commercial surgical adhesives, and sealants available today are derived from petroleum products that compromise their biodegradability. They often have complicated and multi-step synthesis processes that ultimately affect their affordability. To overcome this challenge, we ensured that these sea squirt-inspired tissue sealants are bio-based, easily synthesized, and low-cost. The sealants were studied on their own and with a food-grade enzyme transglutaminase. The adhesion performances of the sealants were found to be higher than physiological pressures in seven out of nine different tissue substrates studied here. Their performance was also better than or on par with the FDA-approved fibrin sealant Tisseel. Ex vivo models demonstrate instant sealing of leaking wounds in less than a minute. The sealants were not only cytocompatible but also showed complete wound healing on par with sutures and Tisseel when applied in vivo on skin incisions in rats. Overall, these sea squirt-inspired bio-based sealants show great potential to replace currently available wound closure methods.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptome profile is a representative phenotype-based descriptor of compounds, widely acknowledged for its ability to effectively capture compound effects. However, the presence of batch differences is inevitable. Despite the existence of sophisticated statistical methods, many of them presume a substantial sample size. How should we design a transcriptome analysis to obtain robust compound profiles, particularly in the context of small datasets frequently encountered in practical scenarios? This study addresses this question by investigating the normalization procedures for transcriptome profiles, focusing on the baseline distribution employed in deriving biological responses as profiles. Firstly, we investigated two large transcriptome datasets, comparing the impact of different normalization procedures. Through an evaluation of the similarity between response profiles of biological replicates within each dataset and the similarity between response profiles of the same compound across datasets, we revealed that the baseline distribution defined by all samples within each batch under batch-corrected condition is a good choice for large datasets. Subsequently, we conducted a simulation to explore the influence of the number of control samples on the robustness of response profiles across datasets. The findings indicate that ideally, the number of control samples should be 6 or greater in small datasets. We believe that this study enhances our understanding of how to effectively leverage transcriptome profiles of compounds and promotes the accumulation of essential knowledge for the practical application of such profiles.",

    "abstract": "The nature of contact between human skin and external object (such as medical device, personal care device, fabric and so on) significantly influences the tactile perception and/or the functionality of the object. The contact mechanics depends strongly on the indenter properties and the mechanical properties of skin. Further, the topmost layer i.e., stratum corneum plays the most important role in tactile perception. In this study we use a representative volume element (RVE) based FEM model including the four layers of skin - stratum corneum, epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis - to simulate the contact mechanics between skin and a spherical indenter. The RVE model captures the mechanical properties of the microscopic constituents of the stratum corneum, which is the topmost layer of skin. We found that the RVE model can be used to simulate a variety of stratum corneum conditions (for example, dry and wet stratum corneum) and compositions. Using the RVE model in conjunction with an FEM model, we compute the frictional stress between skin and an indenter, as a function of stratum corneum microstructure, indentation depth, and local coefficient of friction. Both, the RVE model and the contact mechanics model predictions show good qualitative agreement with experimental findings in literature. Such studies will be very useful in in-silico design and optimization of devices that interact with skin. The current framework gives control over several parameters like skin microstructure, indenter or skin geometry and hence can be used to augment/substitute experimental testing.",

Here, we investigate how predictions derived from contextual information affect the separability of neural activity patterns in the macaque face-processing system, a 3-level processing hierarchy in ventral visual cortex. We find that in the presence of predictions, early stages of this hierarchy exhibit well separable and high-dimensional neural geometries otherwise characteristic only of the top of the hierarchy. This is accompanied by a systematic shift of tuning properties from higher to lower areas, endowing lower areas with higher-order, invariant representations instead of their feedforward tuning properties. Thus, top-down signals dynamically transform neural representations of faces into separable and high-dimensional neural geometries. Our results provide evidence how predictive context transforms flexible representational spaces to optimally use the computational resources provided by cortical processing hierarchies for better and faster distinction of facial identities.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPredictions increase pattern-separation and dimensionality in early face-processing areas.\nC_LIO_LIEarly face-processing areas dynamically inherit tuning properties from higher areas.\nC_LIO_LIPredictions enable top-down separability and invariance for identity recognition.\nC_LI",

However, at present we know very little about the connectivity of NDNF L1INs with other IN types, their input-output conversion, and the existence of potential NDNF L1IN subtypes. Here, we report pervasive inhibition of L2/3 INs (including PV- and VIPINs) by NDNF L1INs. Intersectional genetics revealed similar physiology and connectivity in the NDNF L1IN subpopulation co-expressing NPY. Finally, NDNF L1INs prominently and selectively engage in persistent firing, a physiological hallmark disconnecting their output from the current input.

    "abstract": "The human microbiome is predominantly composed of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria that live in hypoxic/anoxic polymicrobial biofilm communities. Given the oxidative sensitivity of large fractions of the human microbiota, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and related genetically-encoded fluorophores only offer limited utility for live cell imaging due the oxygen requirement for chromophore maturation. Consequently, new fluorescent imaging modalities are needed to study polymicrobial interactions and microbiome-host interactions within anaerobic environments. The fluorescence-activating and absorption shifting tag (FAST) is a rapidly developing genetically-encoded fluorescent imaging technology that exhibits tremendous potential to address this need. In the FAST system, fluorescence only occurs when the FAST protein is complexed with one of a suite of cognate small molecule fluorogens. To expand the utility of FAST imaging, we sought to develop a modular platform (Click-FAST) to democratize fluorogen engineering for personalized use cases. Using Click-FAST, investigators can quickly and affordably sample a vast chemical space of compounds, potentially imparting a broad range of desired functionalities to the parental fluorogen. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of the Click-FAST platform using a novel fluorogen, PLBlaze-alkyne, which incorporates the widely available small molecule ethylvanillin as the hydroxybenzylidine head group. Different azido reagents were clicked onto PLBlaze-alkyne and shown to impart useful characteristics to the fluorogen, such as selective bacterial labeling in mixed populations as well as fluorescent signal enhancement. Conjugation of an 80 [A] PEG molecule to PLBlaze-alkyne illustrates the broad size range of functional fluorogen chimeras that can be employed. This PEGylated fluorogen also functions as an exquisitely selective membrane permeability marker capable of outperforming propidium iodide as a fluorescent marker of cell viability.",

Three predation-resistant strains frequently caused extracellular infections of fruiting bodies but were not found within spores. Furthermore, infection by one of these species induces secondary infections and suppresses predation of otherwise edible bacteria. Another strain can persist inside of amoebae after being phagocytosed but is rarely ingested. We sequenced isolate genomes and discovered that predation-resistant isolates are not monophyletic. Many Pseudomonas isolates encode secretion systems and toxins known to improve resistance to phagocytosis in other species, as well as diverse secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters that may contribute to predation resistance. However, the distribution of these genes alone cannot explain why some strains are edible and others are not. Each lineage may employ a unique mechanism for resistance.",

    "abstract": "How the microaerobic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni establishes its niche and expands in the gut lumen during infection is poorly understood. Using six-week-old ferrets as a natural disease model, we examined this aspect of C. jejuni pathogenicity. Unlike mice, which require significant genetic or physiological manipulation to become colonized with C. jejuni, ferrets are readily infected without the need to disarm the immune system or alter the gut microbiota. Disease after C. jejuni infection in ferrets reflects closely how human C. jejuni infection proceeds. Rapid growth of C. jejuni and associated intestinal inflammation was observed within two-three days of infection. We observed pathophysiological changes that were noted by cryptic hyperplasia through the induction of tissue repair systems, accumulation of undifferentiated amplifying cells on the colon surface, and instability of HIF-1 in colonocytes, which indicated increased epithelial oxygenation. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that lactate levels in colon content were elevated in infected animals. A C. jejuni mutant lacking lctP, which encodes an L-lactate transporter, was significantly decreased for colonization during infection. Lactate also influences adhesion and invasion by C. jejuni to a colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116). The oxygenation required for expression of lactate transporter (lctP) led to discovery of a putative thiol based redox switch regulator (LctR) that may repress lctP transcription under anaerobic conditions. Our work provides new insights into the pathogenicity of C. jejuni.\n\nSignificanceThere is a gap in knowledge about the mechanisms by which C. jejuni populations expand during infection. Using an animal model which accurately reflects human infection without the need to alter the host microbiome or the immune system prior to infection, we explored pathophysiological alterations of the gut after C. jejuni infection. Our study identified the gut metabolite L-lactate as playing an important role as a growth substrate for C. jejuni during acute infection. We identified a DNA binding protein, LctR, that binds to the lctP promoter and may repress lctP expression, resulting in decreased lactate transport under low oxygen levels. This work provides new insights about C. jejuni pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is an enigmatic fungal pathogen, recently elevated to the critical priority group of pathogens by the World Health Organization. Of key concern is its ability to cause outbreaks within intensive and chronic care units, facilitated through its environmental persistence. We investigated the susceptibility of phenotypically distinct C. auris isolates to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) disinfection, and the subsequent role of biofilms in surviving disinfection using a dry-surface biofilm (DSB) model and transcriptomic profiling. Planktonic cells were tested for susceptibility to NaOCl in suspension, with biofilm formation using the DSB model consisting of consecutive 48 hr cycles with/without media across a 12-day period, assessed using viable counts, biomass assays, and microscopy. Disinfection efficacy was assessed using clinically relevant protocols of 500-1000ppm for 1-5min. RNA-sequencing was performed on untreated DSBs in comparison to planktonic cells. Isolates were found to be sensitive to NaOCl planktonically at concentrations [&le;]62.5 ppm, and grew robust biofilms using the DSB protocol. Biofilms developed tolerance to all NaOCl treatment parameters, with only 2-4 log10-reductions in viable cells observed at highest concentrations. Transcriptomics identified ABC transporters and iron acquisition pathways as strongly upregulated in DSBs relative to planktonic cells. Our novel findings have optimised a DSB protocol in which C. auris biofilms can mediate tolerance to adverse conditions such as NaOCl disinfection, suggesting a lifestyle through which this problematic yeast can environmentally persist and transmit. Mechanistically it has been shown for the first time that upregulation of small-molecule and iron transport pathways are potential facilitators of environmental survival.\n\nIMPORTANCECandida auris is a pathogenic yeast that has been responsible for outbreaks in healthcare facilities across the globe, predominantly affecting vulnerable patients. This organism displays a concerning ability to persist within the healthcare environment that is likely facilitated by attaching onto surfaces and developing protective microbial communities knows as biofilms. These communities allow cells to survive and tolerate disinfection with bleach. In this study, we show that C. auris forms robust biofilms on surfaces which promote survival up to 12 days, even with prolonged drying periods. We also demonstrate that development of these biofilms over time significantly reduces the efficacy of hypochlorite disinfection. By investigating the molecular mechanisms of biofilms, we have shown that these biofilms express efflux pumps, which may actively remove hypochlorite molecules from cells, allowing them to tolerate disinfection, and that uptake of iron from the external environment is also important for survival of these communities.",

    "abstract": "As global biodiversity declines continue, conservation efforts are increasingly important in megadiverse areas such as the Neotropics where biodiversity is especially imperiled. The accurate identification of specimens is critical to successful conservation plans. However, in groups such as freshwater fishes, different identification methodologies have documented challenges. Using a biodiversity survey of fishes from the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Costa Rica, we compared: (1) morphological identifications in the field, (2) morphological identifications in the lab by experts, (3) DNA barcode-based identifications, and (4) identifications based on an integrative approach. Our results suggest that both barcode-based identifications and field morphological identifications provided fewer correct species identifications than lab identifications performed by experts using morphology. We attribute shortfalls of DNA barcoding in this case to the misidentification of reference material, the use of outdated taxonomy for references sequences, and the non-uniform representation of groups in public databases across taxa. We suggest the use of an integrative approach to identify freshwater fishes in Costa Rica and other megadiverse areas of the Neotropics where similar issues with public barcode reference libraries exist. We also recommend the creation of regional curated barcode reference libraries to aid in the identification of traditionally difficult to identify species/specimens. We also provide the most up to date species list for the ichthyofauna of the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge identifying 51 species from 42 genera, 21 families, and 17 orders. Generating accurate species lists for protected areas and areas of importance will provide conservation practitioners with effective tools for tracking diversity changes over time.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SV) are genetic alterations that involve large-scale changes in the structure of a genome. These variations can encompass deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations, or complex rearrangements. While smaller structural variants are relatively well studied, much is unknown about the prevalence and effect of larger SV. Genome sequencing methods that are able to find large reorganization in the genome, e.g. using mate pair or long-reads, have shown inversions and translocations are more common than was previously expected. Reduced recombination between regions with different structural organizations leads to the rise of variant specific alleles. Studying the effect of the SV in isolation is obscured by their independent evolutionary histories. Tools are needed to introduce SVs without introducing correlated alleles. Here we describe a method to introduce specific inversions and rearrangements in the fission yeast Schizosacchromyces pombe using the modified CRISPR/Cas9 system SpEDIT to introduce multiple breakpoints with a single plasmid. Sequences for homologous recombination that guide repair resulting in the desired SVs are generated using an extended method for Golden Gate DNA shuffling for S. pombe. Our extension of the system from Kakui et al. is more efficient for integration, introduces more flexibility, and extends the system beyond single construct integrations. Additionally, we extend the set of promoters, tags, markers and terminators, specifically using DNA sequences from other fission yeast species, which avoid introduction of homologous sequences, thereby reducing the chance of non-allelic homologous recombination during sexual reproduction.",

However, there has been no quantitative evaluation of CETSA(R) in unprocessed human whole blood, which is preferred for clinical applications. Here we report two separate assay formats - Alpha CETSA(R) and MSD CETSA(R) - that require less than 100 L of whole blood per sample without PBMC isolation. We chose RIPK1 as a proof-of-concept target and, by measuring engagement of seven different inhibitors, demonstrate high assay sensitivity and robustness.

    "abstract": "Infection by intracellular pathogens can trigger activation of the IRE1 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which then modulates innate immunity and infection outcomes during bacterial or viral infection. However, the mechanisms by which infection activates IRE1 have not been fully elucidated. While recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns can activate IRE1, it is unclear whether this depends on the canonical role of IRE1 in detecting misfolded proteins. Here, we report that Candida albicans infection of macrophages results in IRE1 activation through C-type lectin receptor signaling, reinforcing a role for IRE1 as a central regulator of host responses to infection by a broad range of pathogens. However, IRE1 activation was not preceded by protein misfolding in response to either C. albicans infection or lipopolysaccharide treatment, implicating a non-canonical mode of IRE1 activation after recognition of microbial patterns. Investigation of the phenotypic consequences of IRE1 activation in macrophage antimicrobial responses revealed that IRE1 activity enhances the fungicidal activity of macrophages. Macrophages lacking IRE1 activity displayed inefficient phagolysosomal fusion, enabling C. albicans to evade fungal killing and escape the phagosome. Together, these data provide mechanistic insight for the non-canonical activation of IRE1 during infection, and reveal central roles for IRE1 in macrophage antifungal responses.",

    "abstract": "Organoids have been widely used for studying tissue growth and modeling diseases, but achieving physiologically relevant architecture, size, and function has remained a challenge. Here, we develop a next-generation organotypic culture method that enables the formation of a highly patterned, complex, branched tissue that is spatially organized to accurately recapitulate the morphology, scale, cellular, transcriptional, and tissue-level heterogeneity of human breast tissue. Hormone responsiveness of organoids is also a feature allowing for examination of androgen therapy or post-menopausal changes to breast tissue development and regeneration. Live imaging allows for studying stem cell dynamics during organoid formation and is adaptable to a high throughput setting. Real-time imaging of organoid formation reveals activation of latent epithelial organogenesis programs and inductive cellular dynamics that drive formation of a miniature breast tissue along with its mesenchyme akin to tissue stroma. By advancing human breast organoid technology, this model can elucidate cell- and tissue-level consequences to hormonal changes and therapy. In addition, this method can lead to new insights into the cellular, molecular, and tissue-level processes involved in organogenesis and regeneration, as well as disease.",

    "abstract": "Long-read sequencing is driving rapid progress in genome assembly across all major groups of life, including species of the family Drosophilidae, a longtime model system for genetics, genomics, and evolution. We previously developed a cost-effective hybrid Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing approach and used it to assemble 101 drosophilid genomes from laboratory cultures, greatly increasing the number of genome assemblies for this taxonomic group. The next major challenge is to address the laboratory culture bias in taxon sampling by sequencing genomes of species that cannot easily be reared in the lab. Here, we build upon our previous methods to perform amplification-free ONT sequencing of single wild flies obtained either directly from the field or from ethanol-preserved specimens in museum collections, greatly improving the representation of lesser studied drosophilid taxa in whole-genome data. Using Illumina Novaseq X Plus and ONT P2 sequencers with R10.4.1 chemistry, we set a new benchmark for inexpensive hybrid genome assembly at US $150 per genome while assembling genomes from as little as 35 ng of genomic DNA from a single fly. We present 183 new genome assemblies for 179 species as a resource for drosophilid systematics, phylogenetics, and comparative genomics. Of these genomes, 62 are from pooled lab strains and 121 from single adult flies. Despite the sample limitations of working with small insects, most single-fly diploid assemblies are comparable in contiguity (>1Mb contig N50), completeness (>98% complete dipteran BUSCOs), and accuracy (>QV40 genome-wide with ONT R10.4.1) to assemblies from inbred lines. We present a well-resolved multi-locus phylogeny for 360 drosophilid and 4 outgroup species encompassing all publicly available (as of August 2023) genomes for this group. Finally, we present a Progressive Cactus whole-genome, reference-free alignment built from a subset of 298 suitably high-quality drosophilid genomes. The new assemblies and alignment, along with updated laboratory protocols and computational pipelines, are released as an open resource and as a tool for studying evolution at the scale of an entire insect family.",

    "abstract": "To combat the global burden of malaria, development of new drugs to replace or complement current therapies are urgently required. As drug resistance to existing treatments and clinical failures continue to rise, compounds targeting multiple life cycle stages and species need to be developed as a high priority. Here we show that the compound MMV1557817 is a nanomolar inhibitor of both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax aminopeptidases M1 and M17, leading to inhibition of end stage haemoglobin digestion in asexual parasites. Multi-stage analysis confirmed that MMV1557817 can also kill sexual stage P. falciparum, while cross-resistance studies confirmed the compound targets a mechanism of action distinct to current drug resistance mechanisms. Analysis of cross reactivity to homologous human enzymes shows the compound exhibits a high level of selectivity, whilst safety as well as druggability was confirmed in the murine model P. berghei. MMV1557817-resistant P. falciparum parasites displayed only low-level resistance (<3-fold) and exhibited a slow growth rate that was quickly outcompeted by wild type parasites. MMV1557817-resistant parasites digest significantly more haemoglobin and possess a mutation in PfA-M17 that induces partial destabilisation of the PfA-M17 homohexamer, resulting in high-level resistance to specific PfA-M17 inhibition, but enhanced sensitivity to specific PfA-M1 inhibition, and importantly, these parasites were highly sensitive to artemisinin. Overall, these results confirm MMV1557817 as a potential lead compound for further drug development and highlight the potential of dual inhibition of M1 and M17 as an effective multi-species drug targeting strategy.",

Here, we present a compact neuromorphic synapse that combines photodetection, memory, and neurostimulation functionalities all-in-one. The artificial photoreception is facilitated by a photovoltaic device based on cell-interfacing InP/ZnS quantum dots, which induces photo-faradaic charge-transfer mediated plasticity. The device sends excitatory post-synaptic currents exhibiting paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation to the hippocampal neurons via the biohybrid synapse. The electrophysiological recordings indicate modulation of the probability of action potential firing due to biomimetic temporal summation of excitatory post-synaptic currents.
