    "abstract": "The Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) - Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway is the major transcriptional stress response system in cells against oxidative and electrophilic stress. NRF2 is frequently constitutively active in many cancers, rendering the cells resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the repressor protein KEAP1 are common in non-small cell lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma. While the mutations can occur throughout the gene, they are enriched in certain areas, indicating that these may have unique functional importance. In this study, we show that in the GSEA analysis of TCGA lung adenocarcinoma RNA-seq data, the KEAP1 mutations in R320 and R470 were associated with enhanced Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF) - Nuclear Factor kappa subunit B (NF{kappa}B) signaling as well as MYC and MTORC1 pathways. To address the functional role of these hotspot mutations, affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis of wild type (wt) KEAP1 and the mutants was employed to interrogate differences in the protein interactome. We identified TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) as a putative protein interaction partner. Both mutant KEAP1 forms showed increased interaction with TRAF2 and other anti-apoptotic proteins, suggesting that apoptosis signalling could be affected by the protein interactions. A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing mutant KEAP1 showed high TRAF2-mediated NF{kappa}B activity and increased protection against apoptosis, XIAP being one of the key proteins involved in anti-apoptotic signalling. To conclude, KEAP1 R320Q and R470C and its interaction with TRAF2 leads to activation of NF{kappa}B pathway, thereby protecting against apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter that exerts its biological function by binding to GABA receptors, which not only play an important role in neuromodulation, but also involved in regulating the development of tumors. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit delta (GABRD) encodes the delta subunit of GABAA receptor. its impact on breast cancer has not been clearly studied. This study is aiming to reveal the relationship between GABRD and breast cancer development. Methods: We performed a tissue microarray to quantify GABRD expression levels in tumor tissue and paracarcinoma tissue. The regulation of GABRD in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of breast cancer was examined by a loss-of-function study. A GeneChip microarray was used to probe GABRD for potential downstream molecules. The interaction between GABRD and CDK1 was verified by a set of functional tests and rescue experiments as well as coimmunoprecipitation. Results: GABRD was expressed at significantly higher levels in tumor tissues and was associated with advanced tumor progression. Silencing GABRD resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation and migration and an increase in apoptosis of breast cancer. GABRD regulated the cell cycle by directly interacting with CDK1, which was identified as an important downstream target. Conclusion: GABRD is a novel breast cancer-related gene and highlights the importance of the GABRD-CDK1 axis in regulating breast cancer proliferation, which provides potential for the development of novel therapeutics.",

Through an integrative ChIP and RNA-Seq analysis using patient-derived CIC-DUX4 cells, we define CIC-DUX4 mediated chromatin states and function. We show that CIC-DUX4 primarily localizes to proximal and distal cis-regulatory elements where it associates with active histone marks.

    "abstract": "Some species in the Sect. Oleifera of the genus Camellia L. known as oil-seed camellia because of their high oil content and economic value. Additional studies aimed at clarifying the phylogenetic relationships and chloroplast genomes of Camellia species are needed to hybridization, as well as improve the breeding, selection and interspecific hybridization of Camellia species. The complete chloroplast genomes (cpDNA) of the four oil-seed camellia species C. semiserrata, C. meiocarpa, C. suaveolens, and C. osmantha were resequenced to clarify their interspecific relationships. These cpDNA had typical tetrad structures, and they were highly conserved in various structural features. The total lengths of the cpDNA ranged from 156,965 to 157,018 bp, and 134 genes were annotated, including 88 protein-coding genes, 37 transfer RNA genes, and 8 messenger RNA genes. The average GC content of these genomes was 37.3%. The codons with the highest and lowest codon usage bias were UUA (which codes for leucine) and AGC (which codes for serine), respectively. The number of simple sequences repeats of the four Camelia species ranged from 38 to 40. Mononucleotide repeats were the most common repeat type, followed by tetranucleotide, trinucleotide, and hexanucleotide repeats. Our phylogenetic analysis of cpDNA, coupled with the results of previous ploidy analyses and artificial interspecific hybridization, revealed that C. semiserrata was most closely related to C. azalea, C. suaveolens was most closely related to C. gauchowensis, C. osmantha was most closely related to C. vietnamensis, and C. meiocarpa was most closely related to C. oleifera. The phylogenetic relationships between oil-seed camellia species with high oil content and economic value were characterized. Our analysis of the cpDNA provided new insights that will aid the use of artificial distant hybridization in camellia breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses have caused three severe epidemics since the start of the 21st century: SARS, MERS and COVID-19. The severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increasing likelihood of future coronavirus outbreaks motivates greater understanding of factors leading to severe coronavirus disease. We screened ten strains from the Collaborative Cross mouse genetic reference panel and identified strains CC006/TauUnc (CC006) and CC044/Unc (CC044) as coronavirus-susceptible and resistant, respectively, as indicated by variable weight loss and lung congestion scores four days post-infection. We generated a genetic mapping population of 755 CC006xCC044 F2 mice and exposed the mice to one of three genetically distinct mouse-adapted coronaviruses: clade 1a SARS-CoV MA15 (n=391), clade 1b SARS-CoV-2 MA10 (n=274), and clade 2 HKU3-CoV MA (n=90). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected F2 mice identified genetic loci associated with disease severity. Specifically, we identified seven loci associated with variation in outcome following infection with either virus, including one, HrS45, that is present in both groups. Three of these QTL, including HrS45, were also associated with HKU3-CoV MA outcome. HrS45 overlaps with a QTL previously reported by our lab that is associated with SARS-CoV outcome in CC011xCC074 F2 mice and is also syntenic with a human chromosomal region associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in humans GWAS. The results reported here provide: (a) additional support for the involvement of this locus in SARS-CoV MA15 infection, (b) the first conclusive evidence that this locus is associated with susceptibility across the Sarbecovirus subgenus, and (c) demonstration of the relevance of mouse models in the study of coronavirus disease susceptibility in humans.",

    "abstract": "Robust control over gene translation at arbitrary mRNA targets is an outstanding challenge in microbial synthetic biology. The development of tools that can regulate translation will greatly expand our ability to precisely control genes across the genome. In E. coli, most genes are contained in multi-gene operons, which are subject to polar effects where targeting one gene for repression leads to silencing of both genes. These effects pose a challenge for independently regulating individual genes in multi-gene operons. Here, we use CRISPR-dCas13 to address this challenge. We find that dCas13-mediated repression exhibits up to 6-fold lower polar effects compared to dCas9. We then show that we can selectively activate single genes in a synthetic multi-gene operon by coupling dCas9 transcriptional activation of an operon with dCas13 translational repression of individual genes within the operon. We also show that dCas13 and dCas9 can be multiplexed for improved biosynthesis of a medically-relevant human milk oligosaccharide. Taken together, our findings suggest that combining transcriptional and translational control can access effects that are difficult to achieve with either mode independently. These combined tools for gene regulation will expand our abilities to precisely engineer bacteria for biotechnology and perform systematic genetic screens.",

    "abstract": "Across healthy adult life our brains undergo gradual structural change in a pattern of atrophy that resembles accelerated brain changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, using four polygenic risk scores for AD (PRS-AD) in a longitudinal adult lifespan sample aged 30 to 89 years (2-7 timepoints), we show that healthy individuals who lose brain volume faster than expected for their age, have a higher genetic AD risk. We first demonstrate PRS-AD associations with change in early Braak regions, namely hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala, and find evidence these extend beyond that predicted by APOE genotype. Next, following the hypothesis that brain changes in ageing and AD are largely shared, we performed machine learning classification on brain change trajectories conditional on age in longitudinal AD patient-control data, to obtain a list of AD-accelerated features and model change in these in adult lifespan data. We found PRS-AD was associated with a multivariate marker of accelerated change in many of these features in healthy adults, and that most individuals above ~50 years of age are on an accelerated change trajectory in AD-accelerated brain regions. Finally, high PRS-AD individuals also high on a multivariate marker of change showed more adult lifespan memory decline, compared to high PRS-AD individuals with less brain change. Our results support a dimensional account linking normal brain ageing with AD, suggesting AD risk genes speed up the shared pattern of ageing- and AD-related neurodegeneration that starts early, occurs along a continuum, and tracks memory change in healthy adults.",

    "abstract": "Viral infection severity often varies with host factors such as age and sex. The pathogenesis of infections caused by a broad range of viruses, from neurotropic viruses like Rabies and Zika to respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, differ between the sexes and across the lifespan. Typically, older males are more susceptible to severe acute outcomes, while females are more vulnerable to the post-acute sequelae of infections. All of these complications can include neuroinflammation, stroke, cognitive dysfunction, and delirium. While these symptoms can be secondary to infection, recent studies suggest that even peripheral infections can lead to neuropathological changes in the brain. However, few studies have characterized the expression of viral receptors in the human brain or examined age- or sex-related differences in such expression. In this study, we used a publicly accessible transcriptomic database to assess the impact of age and sex on the expression of 67 viral host factor genes, associated with ten virus families. Analyzing data from 15 brain areas (n=33, F=14, M=19, age:4 mo-80 yrs), we determined the lifespan trajectory for each gene in each area via LOESS regressions. We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to determine if a brain-wide pattern or virus family pattern can be detected. Using Dense-tSNE, a dimension-reduction and visualization technique, we discovered four distinct developmental trajectories, clustering the areas into two mixed-sex subcortical clusters and one each of male and female cortical clusters. Applying Differential Expression Sliding Window Analysis (DeSWAN), we identified the genes driving these age- and sex-related differences. Many sex differences were noted in childhood, potentially impacting the brain's susceptibility to viral infections and underscoring a broader dimorphic organization of male and female brains. These insights contribute to our understanding of sex-specific responses to viral infections, offering the potential for more personalized treatment strategies.",

However, it is unknown precisely how RNase L inhibits viral infections. To isolate effects of RNase L from other effects of double-stranded RNA or virus, 2-5A was directly introduced into cells. Here we report that RNase L activation by 2-5A causes a ribotoxic stress response that requires the ribosome-associated MAP3K, ZAKa. Subsequently, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) JNK and p38a; are phosphorylated. RNase L activation profoundly altered the transcriptome by widespread depletion of mRNAs associated with different cellular functions, but also by SAPK-dependent induction of inflammatory genes.

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a substantial number of invasive infections globally each year. These infections are problematic because they are frequently recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, particularly when they are caused by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antibiotic tolerance, the ability for bacteria to persist despite normally lethal doses of antibiotics, is responsible for most antibiotic treatment failure in MRSA infections. To understand how antibiotic tolerance is induced, S. aureus biofilms exposed to multiple anti-MRSA antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftaroline, delafloxacin, and linezolid) were examined using both quantitative proteomics and transposon sequencing. These screens indicated that arginine metabolism is involved in antibiotic tolerance within a biofilm and led to the hypothesis that depletion of arginine within S. aureus communities can induce antibiotic tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, inactivation of argH, the final gene in the arginine synthesis pathway, induces antibiotic tolerance under conditions in which the parental strain is susceptible to antibiotics. Arginine restriction was found to induce antibiotic tolerance via inhibition of protein synthesis. Finally, although S. aureus fitness in a mouse skin infection model is decreased in an argH mutant, its ability to survive in vivo during antibiotic treatment with vancomycin is enhanced, highlighting the relationship between arginine metabolism and antibiotic tolerance during S. aureus infection. Uncovering this link between arginine metabolism and antibiotic tolerance has the potential to open new therapeutic avenues targeting previously recalcitrant S. aureus infections.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever is a devastating disease of domestic pigs that has spread across the globe since its introduction into Georgia in 2007. The etiological agent is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a genome of 170 to 180 kb in length depending on the isolate. Much of the differences in genome length between isolates are due to variations in the copy number of five different multigene families that are encoded in repetitive regions that are towards the termini of the covalently closed ends of the genome. Molecular epidemiology of ASFV is primarily based on Sanger sequencing of a few conserved and variable regions, but due to the stability of the dsDNA genome changes in the variable regions occur relatively slowly. Observations in Europe and Asia have shown that changes in other genetic loci can occur and that this could be useful in molecular tracking. ASFV has been circulating in Western Africa for at least forty years. It is therefore reasonable to assume that changes may have accumulated in regions of the genome other than the standard targets over the years. At present only one full genome sequence is available for an isolate from Western Africa, that of a highly virulent isolate collected from Benin during an outbreak in 1997. In Cameroon, ASFV was first reported in 1981 and outbreaks have been reported to the present day and is considered endemic. Here we report three full genome sequences from Cameroon isolates of 1982, 1994 and 2018 outbreaks and identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion-deletions that may prove useful for molecular epidemiology studies in Western Africa and beyond.",

After a preliminary screening based on HPLC, CR1 (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum) and GZ1 (Lactiplantibacillus pentosus) showed the highest nucleoside degrading rates and were therefore selected for further characterization. IDCC 2201 (S. thermophilus), which possessed the hpt gene encoding hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) and exhibited purine degradation, was also selected. These three selected strains were examined in terms of the effect of probiotics on lowering serum uric acid in a rat model of potassium oxonate (PO)-induced hyperuricemia. Among them, the level of serum uric acid was most reduced by IDCC 2201 (p < 0.05). Further, analysis of the microbiome showed that administration of IDCC 2201 recovered the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes in the intestinal microbial composition unbalanced by hyperuricemia and showed a difference in the intestinal microbial composition compared to the group administered with allopurinol. Moreover, intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were significantly increased. Ultimately, the findings show that IDCC 2201 lowers uric acid levels by degrading purine-nucleosides and restores intestinal flora and SCFAs, ultimately suggesting that IDCC 2201 is a promising candidate for use as an adjuvant treatment in patients with hyperuricemia.",

    "abstract": "In the face of climate change, mosquitoes will experience evolving climates including longer periods of drought. An important physiological response to dry environments is the protection against water loss or dehydration, here defined as desiccation tolerance. Various environmental factors including temperature are known to alter interactions between the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and the arboviruses it transmits, but little is known about how low humidity impacts arboviral infection. Here, we report that a gene upregulated in response to desiccation is important for controlling midgut infection. We have identified two genetically diverse lines of Ae. aegypti with marked differences in desiccation tolerance. To understand if the genetic basis underlying desiccation tolerance is the same between the contrasting lines, we compared gene expression profiles between desiccant treated and non-desiccant treated individuals in both the desiccation tolerant and susceptible lines by RNAseq. Gene expression analysis demonstrates that different genes are differentially expressed in response to desiccation stress between desiccation tolerant and susceptible lines. The most highly expressed transcript under desiccation stress in the desiccation susceptible line encodes a peritrophin protein, AePer50. Peritrophins plays a crucial role in peritrophic matrix formation after a bloodmeal. Gene silencing of AePer50 by RNAi demonstrates that expression of AePer50 is required for survival of the desiccation susceptible line under desiccation stress, but not for the desiccation tolerant line. Moreover, knock down of AePer50 results in higher infection rates and viral replication rates of ZIKV and higher infection rates of CHIKV. Finally, following a bloodmeal, the desiccation susceptible line develops a thicker peritrophic matrix than the desiccation tolerant line. Together these results provide a functional link between the protection against desiccation and midgut infection which has important implications in predicting how climate change will impact mosquito-borne viruses.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial membranes are complex and dynamic, arising from an array of evolutionary pressures. One enzyme that alters membrane compositions through covalent lipid modification is MprF. We recently identified that Streptococcus agalactiae MprF synthesizes lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) from anionic PG, and a novel cationic lipid, lysyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc-DAG), from neutral glycolipid Glc-DAG. This unexpected result prompted us to investigate whether Lys-Glc-DAG occurs in other MprF-containing bacteria, and whether other novel MprF products exist. Here, we studied protein sequence features determining MprF substrate specificity. First, pairwise analyses identified several streptococcal MprFs synthesizing Lys-Glc-DAG. Second, a restricted Boltzmann machine-guided approach led us to discover an entirely new substrate for MprF in Enterococcus, diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc2-DAG), and an expanded set of organisms that modify glycolipid substrates using MprF. Overall, we combined the wealth of available sequence data with machine learning to model evolutionary constraints on MprF sequences across the bacterial domain, thereby identifying a novel cationic lipid.",

    "abstract": "Branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) deficiency is a recently described inherited neurometabolic disorder of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism implying increased BCAA catabolism. It has been hypothesized that a severe reduction in systemic BCAA levels underlies the disease pathophysiology, and that BCAA supplementation may ameliorate disease phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we characterized a recent mouse model of BCKDK deficiency and evaluated the efficacy of enteral BCAA supplementation in this model. Surprisingly, BCAA supplementation exacerbated neurodevelopmental deficits and did not correct biochemical abnormalities despite increasing systemic BCAA levels. These data suggest that aberrant flux through the BCAA catabolic pathway, not just BCAA insufficiency, may contribute to disease pathology. In support of this conclusion, genetic re-regulation of BCAA catabolism, through Dbt haploinsufficiency, partially rescued biochemical and behavioral phenotypes in BCKDK deficient mice. Collectively, these data raise into question assumptions widely made about the pathophysiology of BCKDK insufficiency and suggest a novel approach to develop potential therapies for this disease.",

    "abstract": "ARPE-19 cells are derived from adult human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The response of these cells to the stress of serum deprivation mimics some important processes relevant to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here we extend the characterization of this response using RNASeq and EGSEA gene set analysis of ARPE-19 cells over nine days of serum deprivation. This experiment confirmed the up-regulation of cholesterol and lipid-associated pathways that increase cholesterol levels in these cells. The gene expression analysis also identified other pathways relevant to AMD progression. There were significant changes in extracellular matrix gene expression, notably a switch from expression of collagen IV, a key component of Bruch's membrane (part of the blood-retina barrier), to expression of a fibrosis-like collagen type I matrix. Changes in the expression profile of the extracellular matrix led to the discovery that amelotin is induced in AMD and is associated with the development of the calcium deposits seen in late-stage geographic atrophy. The transcriptional profiles of other pathways, including inflammation, complement, and coagulation, were also modified, consistent with immune response patterns seen in AMD. As previously noted, the cells resist apoptosis and autophagy but instead initiate a gene expression pattern characteristic of senescence, consistent with the maintenance of barrier function even as other aspects of RPE function are compromised. Other differentially regulated genes were identified that open new avenues for investigation. Our results suggest that ARPE-19 cells maintain significant stress responses characteristic of native RPE that are informative for AMD. As such, they provide a convenient system for discovery and for testing potential therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The gonadotropins follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are key regulators of sexual development and the reproductive cycle in vertebrates. Unlike most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), the FSHR and LHR have large extracellular domains containing multiple leucine-rich repeats, which leads to an elaborate mechanism of receptor activation via orthosteric sites that is difficult to manipulate synthetically. To bypass the orthosteric mechanism, in this study using carp as a model organism we identified allosteric sites capable of receptor activation on the transmembrane domain, which are spatially separated from the orthosteric sites. We have further generated pharmacophore hypothesis based on the structural motifs and exposed residues of these cavities. Using available online small compound libraries consisting of >70000 small molecules, we have thereon used receptor cavity-based hypothesis and other screening stages to identify potential modulators of the allosteric binding site on the carp FSHR and LHR in-silico. We then examined by in vitro transactivation assay the effect of four candidate compounds on FSHR and LHR, as compared to the activity of native ligands. Our results reveal both specific and dual effective allosteric modulators for FSHR and LHR, demonstrating the potential of our approach for efficient pharmacophore-based screening.",

    "abstract": "Argininosuccinate lyase is integral to the urea cycle detoxifying neurotoxic ammonia and the nitric oxide biosynthesis cycle. Inherited argininosuccinate lyase deficiency causes argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA), a rare disease with hyperammonaemia and nitric oxide deficiency. Patients present with developmental delay, epilepsy and movement disorders, associated with nitric oxide-mediated downregulation of central catecholamine biosynthesis. A neurodegenerative phenotype has been proposed in ASA. To better characterise this neurodegenerative phenotype in ASA, we conducted a retrospective study in six paediatric and adult metabolic centres in the UK in 2022. We identified 60 patients and specifically looked for movement disorders-related symptoms: movement disorders such as ataxia, tremor and dystonia, hypotonia and abnormal behaviour. We analysed neuroimaging with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an ASA patient with movement disorders. We assessed conventional and DTI MRI alongside single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) with dopamine analogue radionuclide 123I-ioflupane, in Asl-deficient mice treated by hASL mRNA with normalised ureagenesis. Movement disorders in ASA appears in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life, becoming more prevalent with ageing and independent from the age of onset of hyperammonaemia. Neuroimaging can show abnormal DTI features affecting both grey and white matter, preferentially basal ganglia. ASA mouse model with normalised ureagenesis did not recapitulate these DTI findings and showed normal 123I-ioflupane SPECT and cerebral dopamine metabolomics. Altogether these findings support the pathophysiology of a late-onset movement disorders with functional central catecholamine dysregulation but without or limited neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, making these symptoms amenable to targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Organisms sense harmful environmental conditions and employ strategies to safeguard themselves. Moreover, they can communicate this experience to the next generation or beyond via non-DNA sequence-based mechanisms, referred to as intergenerational or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, respectively. Using a specialist larval parasitoid, Leptopilina boulardi, and its host, Drosophila melanogaster, we show that the parental experience of parasitic stress results in an increased survivability of the immediate offspring of the host. Furthermore, we observe that the increased survivability in response to the parasitic stress is transmitted transgenerationally where the grandparents have been exposed to the parasitoid but not the parents. The increased survivability is primarily inherited through male parents, and at least one of the forms of the memory is better immune priming at larval stage. Our study suggests that the stress exposure during the pre-adult stage of the host has lifetime benefits for its progeny to deal with the future parasitic attack.",

Although enhancers have been extensively studied in isolation, a substantial number of genes have more than one simultaneously active enhancer, and it remains unclear how these cooperate to regulate transcription. Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model, we assay the activities of more than a thousand individual enhancers and a million enhancer pairs towards housekeeping and developmental core promoters with STARR-seq. We report that housekeeping and developmental enhancers show distinct modes of enhancer-enhancer cooperativity: while housekeeping enhancers are additive such that their combined activity mirrors the sum of their individual activities, developmental enhancers are synergistic and follow a multiplicative model of cooperativity. This developmental enhancer synergy is promiscuous and neither depends on the enhancers' endogenous genomic contexts nor on specific transcription factor motif signatures, but it saturates for the highest levels of enhancer activity. These results have important implications for our understanding of gene-regulation in complex multi-enhancer loci and genomically clustered housekeeping genes, providing a rationale for strong and mild transcriptional effects of mutations within enhancer regions.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new protein functions is crucial for the evolution of organisms. This process has been extensively researched for soluble enzymes, but it is largely unexplored for membrane transporters, even though the ability to acquire new nutrients from a changing environment requires evolvability of transport functions. Here, we demonstrate the importance of environmental pressure in obtaining a new activity or altering a promiscuous activity in members of the Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation (APC)-type yeast amino acid transporters family. We identify APC members that have broader substrate spectra than previously described. Using in vivo experimental evolution, we evolve two of these transporter genes, AGP1 and PUT4, towards new substrate specificities. Single mutations on these transporters are found to be sufficient for expanding the substrate range of the proteins, while retaining the capacity to transport all original substrates. Nonetheless, each adaptive mutation comes with a distinct effect on the fitness for each of the original substrates, illustrating a trade-off between the ancestral and evolved functions. Collectively, our findings reveal how substrate-adaptive mutations in membrane transporters contribute to fitness and provide insights into how organisms can use transporter evolution to explore new ecological niches.",

While hydrogel tools to probe many characteristics of the extracellular space have been developed, fabrication approaches remain challenging and time-consuming, limiting multiplexing or widespread adoption.

This approach enables in situ hydrogel mechanical characterization and was used to generate both elastic and viscoelastic hydrogels across a range of stiffnesses. Additionally, this fabrication method enabled a 3-fold reduction in polymer and up to an 8-fold reduction in fabrication time required per hydrogel replicate. The feasibility of this platform for cell culture applications was demonstrated by measuring both population-level and single cell-level metrics via microplate reader and high-content imaging. Finally, the 96-well hydrogel array was utilized for 3D cell culture, demonstrating the ability to support high cell viability.

The increasing availability of datasets and advancements in technology have prompted researchers to integrate existing annotated datasets with newly sequenced datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.

Although several methods have been developed for scRNA-seq data integration, there is currently a lack of tools that can simultaneously achieve the aforementioned objectives. Therefore, in this study, we have introduced a novel tool called scDIT, which leverages a conditional autoencoder and deep embedding clustering to effectively remove batch effects among different datasets. Moreover, scDIT utilizes homogeneous constraints to preserve the cell-type/clustering patterns observed in the old/reference datasets, while employing heterogeneous constraints to map cells in the new datasets to the annotated cell clusters in the reference datasets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that scDIT outperforms other methods in terms of data integration, as confirmed by evaluations on simulated and real datasets. Furthermore, we have shown that scDIT can be successfully applied to integrate multi-omics single-cell datasets. Based on these findings, we conclude that scDIT holds great promise as a tool for integrating single-cell datasets derived from different batches, experiments, times, or interventions.",

RESULTS: ERA patients demonstrated a superior frequency of circulating Tregs containing increased proportions of Treg39+ cells. Total ERA Tregs were more potent than HC Tregs and MTX further heightened their potency, with greater amplification in ERA vs HC; differences were reduced by adenosine pathway blockade. The potency of isolated Treg39+ and its enhancement by MTX were comparable for ERA and HC suggesting that the differences seen with total Tregs are due to the increased ERA Treg39+ frequency. Basal Treg39+ cell proportions > 39.3 associated with a good 12 month EULAR response [RR 13.4 (2.9-75.6)]. At 12 months, the ERA Treg39+ frequency had decreased to HC levels but its association with the clinical response remained. CONCLUSION: MTX cooperates with Treg39+ cells and the basal Treg39+ frequency is a predictor of clinical response. The increased circulating Treg39+ cells in untreated ERA would further facilitate the action of MTX thereby providing a slot for prompt MTX initiation.",

    "abstract": "Shigatoxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are important human pathogens causing disease ranging from diarrhea to severe hemolytic uremic syndrome. As STEC are transmitted via animals, food, and water, and may produce large outbreaks, their timely and qualified detection including isolate recovery is of high importance, but challenging and labor-intense. Thus, the availability of an easy-to-perform rapid test would be a tremendous advance. Since the common feature and major virulence factor of otherwise multifaceted STEC is the Shiga toxin (Stx), we developed a detection method for Stx, specifically for its catalytic RNA-N-glycosidase activity targeting the Sarcin Ricin Loop (SRL) of 28S ribosomal RNA. To this end, synthetic ssDNA substrates mimicking the SRL were designed and linked to a fluorophore and quencher pair, which conferred a fluorescence signal after cleavage by Stx. Optimal results using bacterial culture supernatants or single colonies were achieved for substrate StxSense 4 following 30 to 60 minutes incubation. Importantly, different Stx1 and Stx2 subtypes, diverse STEC serotypes, and Shigella were detected. In conclusion, the assay offers rapid and facile detection of STEC based on a real-time readout for Stx activity. Therefore, it may improve STEC risk evaluation, therapy decisions, outbreak and source detection, and simplify research for antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a global priority respiratory pathogen that kills over a million people annually and produces the pore-forming cytotoxin, pneumolysin (PLY). Host cells expel membrane assembled toxin by shedding microvesicles, but the composition and pathophysiological sequelae of the toxin-induced host extracellular vesicles (EVs) are unknown. Here, we found that EVs shed from PLY-challenged monocytes (PLY-EVs) harbor membrane-bound toxin that induced cytotoxicity upon fusion with recipient cells. EVs from monocytes challenged with recombinant PLY as well as PLY-expressing pneumococcal strains, but not the isogenic PLY mutant, primed dendritic cells and evoked higher pro-inflammatory cytokines upon infection. Proteomic analysis revealed that PLY-EVs are enriched for key antimicrobial and inflammatory host proteins such as IFI16, NLRC4, PTX3 and MMP9. In vivo, zebrafish and mice administered with PLY-EVs showed mortality, pericardial edema, tissue damage and inflammation. Our findings show that host EVs bearing the cytotoxin PLY constitute a previously unexplored mechanism of pneumococcal pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we identify RBM41 as a novel unique protein component of the minor spliceosome. RBM41 has no previously recognized cellular function but has been identified as a paralog of the U11/U12-65K protein, a known unique component of the minor spliceosome that functions during the early steps of minor intron recognition as a component of the U11/U12 di-snRNP. We show that both proteins use their highly similar C-terminal RRMs to bind to 3'-terminal stem-loops in U12 and U6atac snRNAs with comparable affinity. Our BioID data indicate that the unique N-terminal domain of RBM41 is necessary for its association with complexes containing DHX8, an RNA helicase, which in the major spliceosome drives the release of mature mRNA from the spliceosome. Consistently, we show that RBM41 associates with excised U12-type intron lariats, is present in the U12 mono-snRNP, and is enriched in Cajal bodies, together suggesting that RBM41 functions in the post-splicing steps of the minor spliceosome assembly/disassembly cycle. This contrasts with the U11/U12-65K protein, which uses the N-terminal region to interact with U11 snRNP during the intron recognition step. Finally, we show that while RBM41 knockout cells are viable, they show alterations in the splicing of U12-type introns, particularly differential U12-type 3' splice site usage. Together, our results highlight the role 3'-terminal stem-loop of U12 snRNA as a dynamic binding platform for the paralogous U11/U12-65K and RBM41 proteins, which function at distinct stages of minor spliceosome assembly/disassembly cycle.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the conservation status of a species is important for designing effective conservation measures. Consequently, it is often vital to review it to update biodiversity management. Formicivora acutirostris is a bird from coastal marshes and related habitats of Brazil's southern flood plains. It is considered endangered in Brazil but near threatened globally. In 2007, its area of occupancy (AOO) and population size were estimated based on assessment of aerial photographs from 1978 and 1980. Since the species is threatened and occupies a small area scattered across a coastal pressured region, we aimed to reassess its conservation status and assess its Green Status. We compiled new records, conducted new density estimates, and compared the previous mapping with orbital imagery to estimate the current AOO, habitat loss, population size, and review its conservation status based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria. The species is distributed across 10 populations, including two new populations from the southern coast of Santa Catarina to the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul. We estimated the AOO at 4,102 ha and the population as 6,284 mature territorial individuals. The previously mapped AOO has decreased by 1,535 ha due to ecological succession. The loss of habitat due to invasion by exotic grasses is the main anthropogenic impact. We recommend that the species be considered vulnerable. The Green Status indicates that the Conservation Legacy of actions taken thus far and the Conservation Dependence of ongoing actions are null, but it highlights the importance of future actions for species conservation. We propose the establishment of exotic-free zones as small geographic areas with a significant amount of minimally invaded environments, which we suggest as priority areas for the conservation of the species due to their cost-effective management potential. We also propose assisted colonization to enhance its long-term conservation.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is well-established that spinal microglia and peripheral macrophages play critical roles in the etiology of neuropathic pain; however, growing evidence suggests sex differences in pain hypersensitivity owing to microglia and macrophages. Therefore, it is crucial to understand sex- and androgen-dependent characteristics of pain-related myeloid cells in mice with nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. Methods: The current study was performed using normal male and female mice, as well as gonadectomized (GDX) male mice. To deplete microglia and macrophages, pexidartinib (PLX3397), an inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, was orally administered, and mice were subjected to partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL). Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize microglia and macrophages, and PSL-induced mechanical allodynia was evaluated using the von Frey test. Results: Following PSL induction, healthy male and female mice and male GDX mice exhibited similar levels of spinal microglial activation, peripheral macrophage accumulation, and mechanical allodynia. Treatment with PLX3397 significantly suppressed mechanical allodynia in normal males; this was not observed in female and GDX male mice. Sex- and androgen-dependent differences in the PLX3397-mediated preventive effects were observed on spinal microglia and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) macrophages, as well as in expression patterns of pain-related inflammatory mediators in these cells. Conversely, no sex- or androgen-dependent differences were detected in sciatic nerve macrophages, and inhibition of peripheral CC-chemokine receptor 5 prevented neuropathic pain in both sexes. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings demonstrate the presence of considerable sex- and androgen-dependent differences in the etiology of neuropathic pain in spinal microglia and DRG macrophages but not in sciatic nerve macrophages. Given that the mechanisms of neuropathic pain may differ among experimental models and clinical conditions, accumulating several lines of evidence is crucial to comprehensively clarifying the sex-dependent regulatory mechanisms of pain.",

    "abstract": "Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Vesicular Monoamine Transport Disease (BVMTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BVMTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.",

These novel environments are likely to present a suite of biotic and abiotic stressors during rehabilitation. In this study, we longitudinally monitored the faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of three koala joeys within the context of potential stressors at the Magnetic Island Koala Hospital, Queensland, Australia. A total of 92 faecal samples were analysed for FCMs using a polyclonal R4866 cortisol enzyme-immunoassay which has been previously validated in koalas. The iterative baseline method was used to establish FCM profiles of all individuals, and to identify significant peaks in FCM concentrations. Visitor events were identified and confirmed as an acute stressor based on the FCM profiles of the koala joeys. All three koala joeys elicited a significant rise in FCM concentrations after each visitor encounter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the acute stress response of koala joeys to visitors. We recommend that visitor encounters be kept to a minimum, and perhaps avoided altogether especially for joeys that are being rehabilitated to be released back into the wild.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underpinning short-term muscle disuse atrophy remain to be elucidated, but perturbations in lipid metabolism may be involved. Specifically, positive muscle non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) balance has been implicated in the development of disuse-induced insulin and anabolic resistance. Our aim was to determine the impact of acipimox administration (i.e. pharmacologically lowering circulating NEFA availability) on muscle amino acid metabolism and insulin sensitivity during short-term disuse. Eighteen healthy individuals (age 22 +/- 1 years, BMI 24.0 +/- 0.6 kg.m-2) underwent 2 days of forearm cast immobilization with placebo (PLA; n = 9, 5M/4F) or acipimox (ACI; 250 mg Olbetam; n = 9, 4M/5F) ingestion four times daily. Before and after immobilization, whole-body glucose disposal rate (GDR), forearm glucose uptake (FGU, i.e. muscle insulin sensitivity), and amino acid kinetics were measured under fasting and hyperinsulinaemic-hyperaminoacidaemic-euglycaemic clamp conditions using arteriovenous forearm balance and intravenous L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine infusions. Immobilization did not affect GDR but decreased insulin-stimulated FGU in both groups, but to a greater degree in ACI (from 53 +/- 8 to 12 +/- 5 umol/min) than in PLA (from 52 +/- 8 to 38 +/- 13 umol/min; P less than or equal to 0.05). In ACI only, fasting arterialised NEFA concentrations were elevated to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mmol.L-1 post-immobilization (P less than or equal to 0.05), and fasting forearm NEFA balance increased ~4-fold (P = 0.10). Forearm phenylalanine net balance tended to decrease following immobilization (P less than or equal to 0.10), driven by increases in phenylalanine rates of appearance (from 32+/- 5 (fasting) and 21 +/- 4 (clamp) pre-immobilization to 53 +/- 8 and 31 +/- 4 post-immobilization; P less than or equal to 0.05) while rates of disappearance were unaffected and no effects of acipimox observed. Altogether, we show disuse-induced insulin resistance is accompanied by early signs of negative net muscle amino acid balance, which is driven by accelerated muscle amino acid efflux. Acutely elevated NEFA availability worsened muscle insulin resistance without affecting muscle amino acid kinetics, suggesting that disuse-associated increased muscle NEFA uptake may contribute to inactivity-induced insulin resistance but does not represent an early mechanism causing anabolic resistance.",

AT2 cells undergo transcriptional and epigenetic maturation postnatally. Without CEBPA, both neonatal and mature AT2 cells reduce the AT2 program, but only the former reactivate the SOX9 progenitor program. Sendai virus infection bestows mature AT2 cells with neonatal plasticity where Cebpa mutant, but not wild type, AT2 cells express SOX9, as well as more readily proliferate and form KRT8/CLDN4+ transitional cells. CEBPA promotes the AT2 program by recruiting the lung lineage TF NKX2-1. The temporal change in CEBPA-dependent plasticity reflects AT2 cell developmental history. The ontogeny of AT2 cell plasticity and its transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms have implications in lung regeneration and cancer.",

    "abstract": "The course and outcome of evolution are critically determined by the fitness landscape, which maps genotype to fitness. Most theory has considered static fitness landscapes or fitness landscapes that fluctuate according to abiotic environmental changes. In the presence of biotic interactions between coexisting genotypes, the fitness landscape becomes dynamic and frequency-dependent. We here introduce a fitness landscape model that incorporates ecological interactions between individuals in a population. In the model, fitness is determined by individuals competing for resources according to a set of traits they possess. The genotype determines the trait values through a Rough Mount Fuji model, allowing for tunable epistasis (i.e., non-additive gene interaction) and trait correlations (i.e., whether there are tradeoffs or synergies in the ability to use resources). Focusing on the effects of epistasis and trait correlations, we compare the resulting eco-evolutionary dynamics under simulated Wright-Fisher dynamics (i.e., including genetic drift, mutation, and selection) with a similar model without ecological interactions. Whereas the non-ecological model ultimately leads to the maintenance of one main genotype, evolution in the ecological model can lead to the long-term coexistence of several genotypes at intermediate frequencies across much of the parameter range. Including ecological interactions increases steady-state diversity whenever the trait correlations are not too strong. However, strong epistasis can hinder coexistence, and additive genotype-trait maps yield the highest haplotype diversity at the steady state. Interestingly, we frequently observe long-term coexistence also in the absence of induced trade-offs in the ability to consume resources. In summary, our simulation study presents a new dynamic fitness landscape model that highlights the complex eco-evolutionary consequences of a (finite) genotype-phenotype-fitness map in the presence of biotic interactions.",
