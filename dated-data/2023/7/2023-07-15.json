    "abstract": "We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in free-ranging wildlife populations in Northeastern Minnesota on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation and Isle Royale National Park. 120 nasal samples were collected from white-tailed deer, moose, gray wolves, and black bears monitored for conservation efforts during 2022-2023. Samples were tested for viral RNA by RT-qPCR using the CDC N1/N2 primer set. Our data indicate that no wildlife samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Continued surveillance is therefore crucial to better understand the changing landscape of zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 in the Upper Midwest.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 and influenza both cause enormous disease burdens, and vaccines are the primary measures for their control. Since these viral diseases are transmitted through the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract, developing an effective and convenient mucosal vaccine should be a high priority. We previously reported a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based bivalent vaccine (v-EM2/SP{Delta}C1Delta) that protects animals from both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses via intramuscular and intranasal immunization. Here, we further investigated the immune response induced by oral immunization with this vaccine and its protective efficacy in mice. The results demonstrated that the oral cavity delivery, like the intranasal route, elicited strong and protective systemic immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. This included high levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, as well as strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and anti-influenza M2 ADCC responses in mice sera. Furthermore, it provided efficient protection against challenge with influenza H1N1 virus in a mouse model, with a 100% survival rate and a significant low lung viral load of influenza virus. All these findings provide substantial evidence for the effectiveness of oral immunization with the rVSV bivalent vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Marine macroalgae (seaweeds) are key components of marine ecosystems with vital roles in costal habitats. As they release dissolved organic matter and other molecules, seaweeds are under strong settlement pressure by micro- and macro-epibionts. Uncontrolled epibiosis causes surface fouling with detrimental effects on the health and well-being of the organism. Seaweeds control surface epibionts directly by releasing antifouling and antimicrobial metabolites onto their surfaces, and indirectly by recruiting beneficial microorganisms that produce antimicrobial/antifouling metabolites. Three species of the brown algal genus Fucus, F. vesiculosus (FV), F. serratus (FS) and F. distichus subsp. evanescens (FE) form the Fucus belt habitat in the Kiel Fjord, Germany. They often co-occur in the same spot but their blades are fouled differently; we observed FE to be the least fouled, and FV to be the most fouled species. This study was designed to investigate the potential factors underlying different fouling intensities on the surfaces of the three co-occurring Fucus spp. Their surface metabolomes were analysed by comparative untargeted UPLC-MS/MS based metabolomics to identify marker metabolites influencing the surface fouling. The epiphytic microbial communities of the Fucus spp. were also comparatively characterized by high-throughput amplicon sequencing to identify the differences in the surface microbiome of the algae. By employing these omics methods, integrated with multivariate analyses, we identified discriminant metabolites and microbial taxa associated with FE surface, including antimicrobial polar lipids, the fungal genera Mucor, Alternaria, and bacterial genus Yoonia-Loktanella. These taxa have been previously reported to produce antimicrobial and antifouling compounds, suggesting their potential involvement in the fouling resistance (least fouled) observed on the FE surface relative to the co-occurring algae FS and FV. These findings shed light on the surface metabolome and microbiome of Fucus spp. and their influence in different fouling intensities and also have implications for the conservation of coastal habitats.",

The dynamics of the stored population at a point in a river, waiting for their upward migration, increases by the inflow from the downstream/ocean and decreases by the outflow due to their upstream migration. The inflow is assumed to occur at a constant rate until an Erlang-distributed termination time. The outflow is modeled by a self-exciting jump process to incorporate the flocking and social interactions in fish migration. Harvested cases are also studied for fisheries applications. We derive the backward Kolmogorov equations and the associated finite-difference method to compute various performance indices including the mean migration period and harvested populations. Detailed numerical and sensitivity analysis are conducted to study the spring upstream migration of the diadromous Ayu Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis.",

Understanding the causes and factors of GEI allows the utilization of genotype adaptations in the target population of environments through environmental features and Factor-Analytic (FA) models. Here, we present a novel predictive breeding approach called GIS-FA that integrates geographic information systems (GIS) techniques, FA models, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, and Enviromics to predict phenotypic performance in untested environments. The GIS-FA approach allows: (i) predict the phenotypic performance of tested genotypes in untested environments; (ii) select the best-ranking genotypes based on their over-all performance and stability using the FA selection tools; (iii) draw thematic maps showing overall or pairwise performance and stability for decision-making. We exemplify the usage of GIS-FA approach using two datasets of rice [Oryza sativa (L.)] and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in MET spread over tropical areas. In summary, our novel predictive method allows the identification of new breeding scenarios by pinpointing groups of environments where genotypes have superior predicted performance and facilitates/optimizes the cultivar recommendation by utilizing thematic maps.",

    "abstract": "Kin-recognition is observed across diverse species forming an important behavioral adaptation influencing organismal interactions. In most species, proximate level mechanisms are poorly characterized, but in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus molecular components regulating its kin-recognition system have been identified which determine its predatory behaviors. This ability prevents the killing of kin however, its impact on other interactions including collective behaviors is unknown. Utilizing pairwise aggregation assays between distinct strains of P. pacificus, we observed aggregation between kin but not distantly related con-specifics. In these assays, only one strain aggregates with solitary behavior induced in the rival. Abolishing predation through Ppa-nhr-40 mutations results in rival strains successfully aggregating together. Additionally, interactions between P. pacificus populations and Caenorhabditis elegans are dominated by P. pacificus which also disrupts C. elegans aggregation dynamics. Thus, aggregating strains of P. pacificus preferentially group with kin, revealing competition and nepotism as previously unknown components influencing collective behaviors in nematodes.",

Finally, we conduct computational simulations and find a parsimonious model for the humans adaptation strategy in our experiments, providing a hypothesis that can be tested in future studies.

However, existing computational methods for integrative analysis of these high-dimensional multi-modal data are either computationally expensive or limited in interpretation ans scope. These limitations pose challenges in the implementation of these methods in large-scale studies and hinder a more in-depth understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms.\n\nResultsHere, we propose TriTan (Triple inTegrative fast non-negative matrix factorisation), an efficient joint factorisation method for single-cell multiomics data. TriTan implements a highly efficient triple non-negative matrix factorisation algorithm which greatly enhances its computational speed, and facilitates interpretation by clustering both the cells and features simultaneously as well as identifying signature feature sets for each cell cluster. Additionally, three matrix factorisation produced by TriTan helps in finding associations of features across modalities, facilitating the prediction of cell type specific regulatory networks. We applied TriTan to single-cell multi-modal data obtained from different technologies and benchmarked it against the state-of-the-art methods where it shows highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we showed a range of downstream analyses that can be conducted utilising the outputs from TriTan.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/maxxxxxxxin/TriTan online.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCapsella bursa-pastoris, a cosmopolitan weed of hybrid origin, is an emerging model object for the study of early consequences of polyploidy, being a fast growing annual and a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. The development of this model is hampered by the absence of a reference genome sequence.\n\nResultswe present here a subgenome-resolved chromosome-scale assembly and a genetic map of the genome of Capsella bursa-pastoris. It shows that the subgenomes are mostly colinear, with no massive deletions, insertions or rearrangements in any of them. A subgenome-aware annotation reveals the lack of genome dominance - both subgenomes carry similar number of genes. While most chromosomes can be unambiguously recognized as derived from either paternal or maternal parent, we also found homeologous exchange between two chromosomes. It led to an emergence of two hybrid chromosomes; this event is shared between distant populations of C. bursa-pastoris. The whole-genome analysis of 119 samples belonging to C. bursa-pastoris and its parental species C. grandiflora/rubella and C. orientalis reveals introgression from C. orientalis but not from C. grandiflora/rubella.\n\nConclusionsC. bursa-pastoris do not show genome dominance. In the earliest stages of evolution of this species a homeologous exchange occurred; its presence in all present-day populations of C. bursa-pastoris indicates on a single origin of this species. The evidence coming from whole-genome analysis challenges the current view that C. grandiflora/rubella was a direct progenitor of C. bursa-pastoris; we hypothesize that it was an extinct (or undiscovered) species sister to C. grandiflora/rubella.",

We develop one such specification in order to quantify the effects of surrogate selection assays, which we confirm may lead to an enrichment for amplified, potentially disease-relevant T cell clones. Our specification couples within-clonotype birth-death processes with an exchangeable model across clonotypes. Beyond enrichment questions about the surrogate selection design, our framework enables a study of sampling properties of elementary sample diversity statistics; it also points to new statistics that may usefully measure the burden of somatic genomic alterations associated with clonal expansion.

    "abstract": "Plant molecular systematics relies on using DNA barcodes for studying the evolutionary relationship between species Sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions have been used widely in molecular phylogenetic studies because of their high variability compared to plastid sequences. Elaeocarpus is a diverse genus within the family Elaeocarpaceae and is widely distributed worldwide among tropical and subtropical climatic zones. Elaeocarpus ganitrus has important medicinal and religious values in India. However, Elaeocarpus ganitrus evolutionary relationship with other Elaeocarpus species is not much explored, especially at the molecular and phylogenetic levels. The present research successfully amplified the nuclear gene ITS2, sequenced and submitted it to NCBI Genbank after using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning (ASAP) resulted in different numbers of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs). The lowest score of ASAP (4.5) segregated the sequences into 31 MOTUs with the Threshold dist. value of 0.003524. This study establishes an evolutionary relationship between Elaeocarpus ganitrus and other species belonging to the same genus through the neighbor-joining method. The 38 Elaeocarpus samples were clustered into seven major groups based on ITS2 sequence: Group I is represented by Elaeocarpus ganitrus along with Elaeocarpus sylvestris, Elaeocarpus glabripetalus, Elaeocarpus duclouxii, Elaeocarpus decipiens, and Elaeocarpus zollingeri. Group II is characterized by Elaeocarpus austroyunnanensis and Elaeocarpus glaber. Group III comprises Elaeocarpus sphaericus, Elaeocarpus angustifolius, Elaeocarpus grandis, Elaeocarpus ptilanthus, and Elaeocarpus sphaerocarpus. Three accessions of Elaeocarpus hookerianus are placed in group IV. Elaeocarpus largiflorens and Elaeocarpus thelmae represent group V. Groupr VI contains three species: Elaeocarpus sylvestris, Elaeocarpus dubius, and Elaeocarpus johnsonii. Group VII comprises five species which include Elaeocarpus glabripetalus, Elaeocarpus rugosus, Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, Elaeocarpus hainanensis, and Elaeocarpus angustifolius. The study concludes with the possibility of correctly using the ITS2 gene to identify, discriminate, and documentation of Elaeocarpus ganitrus and other species of the same genus.",

    "abstract": "RNase T2 is found in almost all organisms and non-living viruses. Although enzymatic activity is simple, RNase T2 involves diverse and essential roles in each species. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase T2, known as Rny1p, is localized in vacuoles and mediates rRNA degradation during autophagy of ribosomes. However, whether the ribosomal degradation is selective or non-selective or whether the two pathways coexist is still being determined. We found that most ribosomes are selectively degraded, and Rsa1p involves the degradation. As described, Rny1p is vacuolar-localized; however, some are secreted outside the cell and anchored to the host cell wall. Rny1p is characteristic of having a C-terminal extension with an unknown biological role. Our biochemical analyses indicated that the C-terminal extension is not required for the rRNA degradation but for anchoring Rny1p to the cell wall. Moreover, the predicted structure of the C-terminal extension of Rny1p superimposed well with sugar-binding domain-containing proteins, suggesting that Rny1p binds the sugar chain of the cell wall using the C-terminal extension. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that fungal RNase T2 evolved independently of RNase T2 from other species. Besides, structures of C-terminal extensions of other fungal RNase T2 proteins are almost identical to that of Rny1p. RNase T2 proteins from other than fungi also have C-terminal extensions. However, their sequences, structures, and biological functions differ from fungi. As the structures of the RNase domain of eukaryotic RNase T2 proteins are almost identical, the C-terminal extension confers species-specific functions to RNase T2.",

    "abstract": "The first activation of gene expression during development (zygotic genome activation, ZGA) is accompanied by massive changes in chromosome organization. The connection between these two processes remains unknown. Using Hi-C for zebrafish embryos, we found that chromosome folding starts by establishing \"fountains\", novel elements of chromosome organization, emerging selectively at enhancers upon ZGA. Using polymer simulations, we demonstrate that fountains can emerge as sites of targeted cohesin loading and require two-sided, yet desynchronized, loop extrusion. Specific loss of fountains upon loss of pioneer transcription factors that drive ZGA reveals a causal connection between enhancer activity and fountain formation. Finally, we show that fountains emerge in early Medaka and Xenopus embryos; moreover, we found cohesin-dependent fountain pattern on enhancers of mouse embryonic stem cells. Taken together, fountains are the first enhancer-specific elements of chromosome organization; they constitute starting points of chromosome folding during early development, likely serving as sites of targeted cohesin loading.",

    "abstract": "Most carbon cycle models do not consider animal-mediated effects, focusing instead on carbon exchanges among plants, microbes, and the atmosphere. Yet, a growing body of empirical evidence from diverse ecosystems points to pervasive animal effects on ecosystem carbon cycling and shows that ignoring them could lead to misrepresentation of an ecosystems carbon cycle. We develop a new theoretical framework to account for animal effects on ecosystem carbon cycling. We combine a classic ecosystem compartment modeling approach with a classic carbon model to account for carbon flux and storage among plant, animal, and soil microbial trophic compartments. We show, by way of numerical analyses of steady state conditions, that herbivore presence alters the dominant pathways of control over carbon storage and capture. This altered control arises via direct, consumptive effects and especially via indirect, non-consumptive pathways by instigating faster nutrient recycling. This leads to a quantitative change in the ecosystems carbon balance, increasing the amount of carbon captured and stored in the ecosystem by 2-3 fold. The modeling shows that animals could play a larger role in ecosystem carbon cycle than previously thought. Our framework provides further guidance for empirical research aimed at quantifying animal-mediated control of carbon cycling and to inform the development of nature-based climate change solutions that leverage animal influence on the carbon cycle to help mitigate climate change.",

    "abstract": "When the effect of various posttranslational histone tail modifications (PTMs) on nucleosome stability was compared in an in situ assay involving agarose-embedded nuclei, the promoter proximal H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H4K8ac positive nucleosomes exhibited relative sensitivity to intercalators as compared to bulk H3-GFP or nucleosomes carrying any of the following marks: H3K27me1, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me0, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K9ac, and H3K14ac. Nickase or DNase I treatment of the nuclei, or bleomycin treatment of live cells, did not affect the stability of nucleosomes carrying H3K4me3 or H3K27ac, while those of the second group were all destabilized upon treatment with intercalators. These observations support the possibility that the promoter proximal marks specify dynamic nucleosomes accomodating relaxed DNA sequences due to DNA breaks generated in vivo. In line with this interpretation, endogeneous, 3OH nicks were mapped within the nucleosome free region of promoters controlling genes active in human mononuclear cells, a conclusion supported by superresolution colocalization studies. The +1 nucleosomes were stabilized and the incidence of nicks was decreased at the promoters upon KDM4a,b,c KO induction (Pedersen et al, EMBO J, 2016) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mES). While etoposide did not further destabilize +1 nucleosomes in control mES, their stabilized state in the KO state was reversed by the drug. A significant fraction of the DNA breaks comprises TOP2-generated nicks according to the results of molecular combing experiments. The chromatin regions harboring nicks are topologicaly separated from the domains containing superhelical chromatin. These observations lend support for a model where the role of DNA strand discontinuities in transcriptional regulation and in higher-order chromatin organization are integrated.",

Genomic resources for creek chub and other leuciscid species are currently limited. However, advancements in DNA sequencing now allow us to create genomic resources at a historically low cost. Here, we present a high quality 239 contig reference genome for the common creek chub, created with PacBio HiFi sequencing. We compared the assembly quality of two pipelines: Pacific Biosciences Improved Phase Assembly (IPA; 873 contigs) and Hifiasm (239 contigs). Quality and completeness of this genome is comparable to the zebrafish (Danioninae) and fathead minnow (Leuciscidae) genomes. The creek chub genome is highly syntenic to the zebrafish and fathead minnow genomes, and while our assembly does not resolve into the expected 25 chromosomes, synteny with zebrafish suggests that each creek chub chromosome is likely represented by 1-4 large contigs in our assembly. This reference genome is a valuable resource that will enhance genomic bio-diversity studies of creek chub and other non-model leuciscid species common to disturbed environments.",

Here, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structures of inactive monomeric and active tetrameric Crenotalea thermophila SPARTA complexes, revealing mechanisms underlying SPARTA assembly, RNA-guided recognition of target single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and subsequent SPARTA tetramerization, as well as tetramerization-dependent NADase activation. The small RNA guides Ago to recognize its ssDNA target, inducing SPARTA tetramerization via both Ago- and TIR-mediated interactions and resulting in a two-stranded, parallel, head-to-tail TIR rearrangement primed for NAD+ hydrolysis. Our findings thus identify the molecular basis for target ssDNA-mediated SPARTA activation, which will facilitate the development of SPARTA-based biotechnological tools.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine sulfation (sY) is a post-translational modification (PTM) catalysed by Golgi-resident Tyrosyl Protein SulfoTransferases (TPSTs). Information on protein tyrosine sulfation is currently limited to [~]50 human proteins with only a handful having verified sites of sulfation. The contribution of this chemical moiety for the regulation of biological processes, both inside and outside the cell, remains poorly defined, in large part due to analytical limitations. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is the method of choice for PTM analysis, but has yet to be applied for the systematic investigation and large-scale analysis of biomolecular sulfation (constituting the  sulfome), primarily due to issues associated with discrimination of sY-from phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides. In this study, we developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow centred on the characterization of sY-peptides, incorporating optimised Zr4+-IMAC and TiO2 enrichment strategies. Extensive characterization of a panel of sY- and pY-peptides using an array of MS fragmentation regimes (CID, HCD, EThcC, ETciD, UVPD) highlights differences in the ability to generate site-determining product ions, which can be exploited to differentiate sulfated peptides from nominally isobaric phosphopeptides based on precursor ion neutral loss at low collision energy. Application of our analytical workflow to a HEK-293 cell extracellular secretome facilitated identification of 21 new sulfotyrosine-containing proteins, several of which we validate enzymatically using in vitro sulfation assays. This study demonstrates the applicability of our strategy for confident, high-throughput,  sulfomics studies, and reveals new sY interplay between enzymes relevant to both protein and glycan sulfation.",

    "abstract": "A primary cilium, made of nine microtubule doublets enclosed in a cilium membrane, is a mechanosensing organelle that bends under an external mechanical load and sends an intracellular signal through transmembrane proteins activated by cilium bending. The nine microtubule doublets are the main load-bearing structural component, while the transmembrane proteins on the cilium membrane are the main sensing component. No distinction was made between these two components in all existing models, where the stress calculated from the structural component (nine microtubule doublets) was used to explain the sensing location, which may be totally misleading. For the first time, we developed a microstructure-based primary cilium model by considering these two components separately. First, we refined the analytical solution of bending an orthotropic cylindrical shell for individual microtubule, and obtained excellent agreement between finite element simulations and the theoretical predictions of a microtubule bending as a validation of the structural component in the model. Second, by integrating the cilium membrane with nine microtubule doublets, we found that the microtubule doublets may twist significantly as the whole cilium bends. Third, besides being cilium-length-dependent, we found the mechanical properties of the cilium are also highly deformation-dependent. More important, we found that the cilium membrane near the base is not under pure in-plane tension or compression as previously thought, but has significant local bending stress. This challenges the traditional model of cilium mechanosensing, indicating that transmembrane proteins may be activated more by membrane curvature than membrane stretching. Finally, we incorporated imaging data of primary cilia into our microstructure-based cilium model, and found that comparing to the ideal model with uniform microtubule length, the imaging-informed model shows the nine microtubule doublets interact more evenly with the cilium membrane, and their contact locations can cause even higher bending curvature in the cilium membrane than near the base.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEFactors regulating the mechanical response of a primary cilium to fluid flow remain unclear. Modeling the microtubule doublet as a composite of two orthotropic shells and the ciliary axoneme as an elastic shell enclosing nine such microtubule doublets, we found that the length distribution of microtubule doublets (inferred from cryogenic electron tomography images) is the primary determining factor in the bending stiffness of primary cilia, rather than just the ciliary length. This implies ciliary-associated transmembrane proteins may be activated by membrane curvature changes rather than just membrane stretching. These insights challenge the traditional view of ciliary mechanosensation and expands our understanding of the different ways in which cells perceive and respond to mechanical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Sex disparities have been observed in many tumor types affecting non-reproductive organs. Typically, the incidence and mortality rates of such cancers are higher in men. Although differences in lifestyle and environmental exposures are known contributors, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms driving sexual dimorphism in tumor development and therapy response remains limited. To address this question, we comprehensively studied the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene, a male-specific gene that is critical in development. First, we screened 2,448 samples from 11 cancer types to identify those with a higher incidence in men and increased expression of SRY. In cases of high-grade glioma and melanoma, men with tumors exhibiting high SRY expression had a worse prognosis. Our results suggest that SRY target genes show altered expression when SRY is overexpressed. These gene sets are linked to cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, and repression of tumor suppressor pathways (TP53 activation and activity of immune cells). In summary, we present the first comprehensive investigation of SRY expression and its association with clinical outcomes in men with high-grade glioma and melanoma. Our results shed light on the molecular basis for sex disparities and lay the foundation for investigation of various target genes and novel cancer treatments in men with high-grade glioma and melanoma.",

LRRK2 levels have become an appealing target for potential PD-therapeutics with LRRK2 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) now in clinical trials. However, LRRK2 has been suggested to play a fundamental role in peripheral immunity, and it is currently unknown if targeting increased LRRK2 levels in peripheral immune cells will be beneficial or deleterious. Furthermore, the precise role of LRRK2 in immune cells is currently unknown, although it has been suggested that LRRK2-mediated lysosomal function may be crucial to immune responses. Here, it was observed that G2019S macrophages exhibited increased stimulation-dependent lysosomal tubule formation (LTF) and MHC-II trafficking from the perinuclear lysosome to the plasma membrane in an mTOR dependent manner with concomitant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Both ASO-mediated knock down of mutant Lrrk2 and LRRK2 kinase inhibition ameliorated this phenotype and decreased these immune responses in control cells. Given the critical role of antigen presentation, lysosomal function, and cytokine release in macrophages, it is likely LRRK2-targetting therapies may have therapeutic value with regards to mutant LRRK2 but deleterious effects on the peripheral immune system, such as altered pathogen control and infection resolution.",

Multiple therapeutic strategies are in clinical development to restore PGRN levels in the CNS, including gene therapy. However, a limitation of current gene therapy approaches aimed to alleviate FTLD-associated pathologies may be their inefficient brain exposure and biodistribution. We therefore developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting the liver (L) to achieve sustained peripheral expression of a transferrin receptor (TfR) binding, brain-penetrant (b) PGRN variant (AAV(L):bPGRN) in two mouse models of FTLD-GRN, namely Grn knockout and GrnxTmem106b double knockout mice. This therapeutic strategy avoids potential safety and biodistribution issues of CNS-administered AAVs while maintaining sustained levels of PGRN in the brain following a single dose. AAV(L):bPGRN treatment reduced several FTLD-GRN associated disease pathologies including severe motor function deficits, aberrant TDP-43 solubility and phosphorylation, dysfunctional protein degradation, lipid metabolism, gliosis and neurodegeneration in the brain. Translatability of our findings was confirmed in a novel human in vitro model using co-cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia lacking PGRN and TMEM106B and wild-type hiPSC-derived neurons. As in mice, aberrant TDP-43, lysosomal dysfunction and neuronal loss were ameliorated after treatment with exogenous TfR-binding protein transport vehicle fused to PGRN (PTV:PGRN). Together, our studies suggest that peripherally administered brain-penetrant PGRN replacement strategies can ameliorate FTLD-GRN relevant phenotypes including TDP-43 pathology, neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits. Our data provide preclinical proof of concept for the use of this AAV platform for treatment of FTLD-GRN and potentially other CNS disorders.\n\nOne sentence summaryPeripheral AAV-mediated delivery of brain-penetrant PGRN rescues TDP-43 pathology, neurodegeneration and motor phenotypes in FTLD-GRN models.",

Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor (ER) at Ser118 through its disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) activates its transcriptional function, but it is challenging to rationalize how this modification regulates ER activity. Using biophysical approaches of small-angle X-ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that Ser118 phosphorylation triggers long-range conformational changes in ER-NTD, particularly between two hydrophobic clusters of residual structures. Alanine substitution of hydrophobic amino acids near Ser118 produces similar conformational alterations and rescues impaired ER activity caused by a phosphorylation-deficient mutant.

Sepcifically, BRD4 mediated PDGF-BB signaling in GSK stimulation through transcriptional regulation from RNA polymerase II activity with PI3K as target, and thus not only canonical {beta} -catenin/TCF4 signaling, but also non-canonical {beta} -catenin conjunction complex response was activated by BRD4 in nucleus involved in promoting cell proliferation. Our study delineated a signaling axis that may allow soft-tissue tumor cells to escape apoptosis during colonization by activating PDGFBB-BRD4-GSK-{beta} -catenin and non-canonical-{beta}-catenin pathway through BRD4 in cancer cells. An efficient treatment for soft-tissue tumors could be accomplished by targeting PDGF and BRD4 survival pathways on soft-tissue tumor cells.",

By connecting laboratory equipment to the cloud, we introduce students to experimentation in pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids in two different settings: Using microscopy to monitor organoid growth in an introductory tissue culture course, and using high density multielectrode arrays to perform neuronal stimulation and recording in an advanced neuroscience mathematics course. We demonstrate that this approach develops interest in stem cell and neuroscience in the students of both courses.

    "abstract": "The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) are widely expressed in the central nervous system. It is well documented that neurons express BDNF and full-length TrkB (TrkB.FL), and a lower level of truncated TrkB (TrkB.T). With conflicting results, glial cells also have been reported to express BDNF and TrkB. In the current study, we employed a more sensitive and reliable genetic method to characterize the expression of BDNF and TrkB in glial cells in the mouse brain. We utilized three Cre mouse strains in which Cre recombinase is expressed in the same cells as BDNF, TrkB.FL, or all TrkB isoforms, and crossed them to Cre-dependent EGFP reporter mice to label BDNF- or TrkB-expressing cells. We performed immunohistochemistry with glial cell markers to examine the expression of BDNF and TrkB in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Surprisingly, we found no BDNF- or TrkB-expressing microglia in the brain and spinal cord. Consistent with previous studies, most astrocytes only express TrkB.T in the adult brain. Moreover, there are a small number of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that express BDNF, the function of which is to be determined. We also found that oligodendrocyte precursor cells, but not mature oligodendrocytes, express both TrkB.FL and TrkB.T in the adult brain. These results not only clarify the expression of BDNF and TrkB in glial cells, but also open opportunities to investigate previously unidentified roles of BDNF and TrkB in glial cells.",

To enhance our understanding of this disease within a closed culture system on the northern coast of Peru, we conducted a comparative analysis of the gut microbiomes between healthy and diseased postlarvae. Diseased postlarvae were obtained through exposure to an AHPND-causing strain of V. parahaemolyticus. Five healthy and five diseased postlarvae were randomly sampled from experimental rearing tanks, and their medial guts were extracted. High-throughput sequencing targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was employed for amplicon library construction, and assessments of alpha and beta diversities, as well as taxonomic composition, were conducted. Our results revealed reduced diversity and distinct compositional profiles in the gut microbiomes of diseased postlarvae. The order Rhodobacteriales was dominant in the gut microbiomes of healthy postlarvae, while the order Vibrionales (including an unassigned genus within Vibrionales, Vibrio, and Pseudoalteromonas) exhibited the highest abundance in diseased postlarvae. In conclusion, exposure to an AHPND-causing strain of V. parahaemolyticus induces significant dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of whiteleg shrimp postlarvae.",

Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntraspecific phenotypic differentiation is of common place occurrence, but the degree to which it reflects phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation remains often unclear. To be considered as adaptive, the differentiation must be genetically based and exceed what could be expected by neutral processes only. Using laboratory reared full-sib family data from replicate nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations, we show that freshwater and marine fish display genetically based adaptive differentiation in head size and shape. Utilising identity-by-descent relationships among full-sibs as estimated with the aid of molecular markers, we further show that the studied traits are also highly heritable in all populations indicating and that they can respond to future episodes of natural selection. The head shape and size of pond fish suggests that observed adaptive differentiation has been driven by selection favoring limnetic feeding strategy among the pond fish. Analyses of gill-raker morphology were less conclusive: genetic differentiation was found in gill-raker length (pond > marine) and number, but the degree of divergence in these traits did not exceed neutral expectations. Yet, the direction of divergence in gill raker traits are suggestive of the limnetic feeding mode of pond fish, aligning with the inference from the head morphology analyses.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein complexes highly conserved across all domains of life. The size differences of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) can be mainly attributed to variable regions termed expansion segments (ESs) protruding out from the ribosomal surface. The ESs were found to be involved in a range of processes including ribosome biogenesis and maturation, translation, and co-translational protein modification. Here, we analyze the rRNAs of the yeasts from the Magnusiomyces/Saprochaete clade belonging to the basal lineages of the subphylum Saccharomycotina. We find that these yeasts are missing more than 400 nt from the 25S rRNA and 150 nt from the 18S rRNAs when compared to their canonical counterparts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The missing regions mostly map to ESs, thus representing a shift toward a minimal rRNA structure. Despite the structural changes in rRNAs, we did not identify dramatic alterations of the ribosomal protein inventories. We also show that the size-reduced rRNAs are not limited to the species of the Magnusiomyces/Saprochaete clade, indicating that the shortening of ESs happened independently in several other lineages of the subphylum Saccharomycotina.\n\nSignificanceExpansion segments are variable regions present in the ribosomal RNAs involved in the ribosome biogenesis and translation. Although some of them were shown to be essential, their functions and the evolutionary trajectories leading to their expansion and/or reduction are not fully understood. Here, we show that the yeasts from the Magnusiomyces/Saprochaete clade have truncated expansion segments, yet the protein inventories of their ribosomes do not radically differ from the species possessing canonical ribosomal RNAs. We also show that the loss of expansion segments occurred independently in several phylogenetic lineages of yeasts pointing out their dispensable nature. The differences identified in yeast ribosomal RNAs open a venue for further studies of these enigmatic elements of the eukaryotic ribosome.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis (hTB), is currently classed as the thirteenth leading cause of death worldwide. Mycobacterium bovis, a close evolutionary relative of M. tuberculosis, causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and is one of the most damaging infectious diseases to livestock agriculture. Previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of bTB disease is comparable to hTB disease, and that the bovine and human alveolar macrophage (bAM and hAM, respectively) transcriptomes are extensively reprogrammed in response to infection with these intracellular mycobacterial pathogens. However, although M. bovis and M. tuberculosis share over 99% identity at the genome level, the innate immune responses to these pathogens have been shown to be different in human or cattle hosts.\n\nIn this study, a multi-omics integrative approach was applied to encompass functional genomics and GWAS data sets across the two primary hosts (Bos taurus and Homo sapiens) and both pathogens (M. bovis and M. tuberculosis). Four different experimental infection groups were used, each with parallel non-infected control cells: 1) bAM infected with M. bovis, 2) bAM infected with M. tuberculosis, 3) hAM infected with M. tuberculosis, and 4) human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) infected with M. tuberculosis. RNA-seq data from these experiments 24 hours post-infection (24 hpi) was analysed using three separate computational pipelines: 1) differentially expressed genes, 2) differential gene expression interaction networks, and 3) combined pathway analysis. The results of these analyses were then integrated with high-resolution bovine and human GWAS data sets to detect novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to mycobacterial infection and resilience to disease. Results from this study revealed common and unique response macrophage pathways for both pathogens and identified 32 genes (12 bovine and 20 human) significantly enriched for SNPs associated with disease resistance, the majority of which encode key components of the NF-{kappa}B signalling pathway and that also drive formation of the granuloma.",

    "abstract": "Genomic instability caused by chromosomal rearrangements has severe consequences for organismal fitness and progression of cancerous cell lines. The triggers of destabilized chromosomes remain poorly understood but are often assumed to be associated with fragile sites. Here, we retrace a runaway chromosomal degeneration process observed in a fungal pathogen using telomere-to-telomere assemblies across an experimental pedigree. We show that the same fragile sites triggered reproducible, large-scale rearrangements through non-allelic recombination. Across the four-generation pedigree, chromosomal rearrangements were accompanied by non-disjunction events and caused aneuploid progeny to carry up to four chromosomal copies. We identify a specific transposable element as the most likely trigger for the repeated chromosomal degeneration. The element is associated with higher virulence of the pathogen and has undergone a burst increasing copy numbers across the genome. Chromosome sequences are also targeted by a genome defense mechanism active on duplicated sequences, which may contribute to decay. Our work identifies the exact sequence triggers initiating chromosome instability and perpetuating degenerative cycles. Dissecting proximate causes leading to run-away chromosomal degeneration expands our understanding of chromosomal evolution beyond cancer lines.",

Tilting the specimen stage during data collection is a generalizable solution but has historically led to substantial resolution attenuation. Here, we develop updated data collection and image processing workflows and demonstrate, using multiple specimens, that resolution attenuation is negligible or significantly reduced across tilt angles. Reconstructions with and without the stage tilted as high as 60{degrees} are virtually indistinguishable. These strategies allowed the reconstruction to 3 [A] resolution of a bacterial RNA polymerase with preferred orientation. Furthermore, we present a quantitative framework that allows cryo-EM practitioners to define an optimal tilt angle for dataset acquisition.

Nucleosome core histones limit DNA accessibility by structurally blocking half of the DNA surface and altering its topology, but how nucleosomes affect target search by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) remains enigmatic. Here, we used multi-color smFRET to investigate how Drosophila GAGA Factor (GAF) locates its targets. On free DNA, GAF rapidly diffuses in 1D to a single cognate motif but escapes after subsecond transient association. Nucleosomes effectively block 1D diffusion into its core, but GAF can bind, with surprisingly prolonged residence, at internal cognate sites by direct association from 3D. Our findings demonstrate the occlusive power of nucleosomes to 1D sliding and reveal that a combination of 1D and 3D diffusion by a zinc finger TF enables efficient target search on chromatin.",

    "abstract": "The signaling pathway of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF{beta}) plays crucial roles in the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, making anti-TGF{beta} agents a significant area of interest in cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical translation of current anti-TGF{beta} agents that target upstream cytokines and receptors remains challenging. Therefore, the development of small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting SMAD4, the downstream master regulator of TGF{beta} pathway, would offer an alternative approach with significant therapeutic potential for anti-TGF-{beta} signaling. In this study, we present the development of a cell lysate-based multiplexed time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay in an ultrahigh-throughput screening (uHTS) 1536-well plate format. This assay enables simultaneous monitoring of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between SMAD4 and SMAD3, as well as the protein-DNA interaction (PDI) between SMADs and their consensus DNA binding motif. The multiplexed TR-FRET assay exhibits high sensitivity, allowing the dynamic analysis of the SMAD4-SMAD3-DNA complex at single amino acid resolution. Moreover, the multiplexed uHTS assay demonstrates robustness for screening small molecule inhibitors. Through a pilot screening of an FDA-approved and bioactive compound library, we identified gambogic acid and gambogenic acid as potential hit compounds. These proof-of-concept findings underscore the utility of our optimized multiplexed TR-FRET platform for large-scale screening to discover small molecule inhibitors that target the SMAD4-SMAD3-DNA complex as novel anti-TGF{beta} signaling agents.",

However, the role of NGFR in humoral response is not well defined. In this work, we have studied the effect of Ngfr KO in LNs organization and function. Ngfr KO led to spontaneous GC formation and expansion of GC B-cell compartment which were related to Ngfr depletion in non-hematopoietic radioresistant compartment. In agreement, Ngfr KO mice showed alterations in LSC with an increased frequency of FDCs harboring an activated phenotype characterized by the overexpression of CD21/35, MAdCAM-1, and VCAM-1. Moreover, Ngfr KO mice showed GC ectopic location, loss of polarization, impaired high-affinity antibody production, and increased circulating autoantibodies. In addition, Ngfr KO/Bcl2 Tg mice displayed increased levels of autoantibodies, higher incidence of autoimmunity, and decreased overall survival. Our work shows that NGFR maintains GC structure and functionality, being involved in the regulation of antibody production and immune tolerance.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown rapid advancements and gained clinical approval for use in cancer immunotherapy. CAR, a synthetic receptor integrated into autologous T cells, has yielded highly successful results in patients with leukemia. The significant potential of CAR-T cells has been validated through clinical trials in adult and pediatric cancer treatments. Our therapy developed specifically for CD19-specific Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) has shown promising results in in vitro and in vivo tests. To enhance the response against cancer, provide a bistimulatory effect, and increase stability, we designed two different CAR structures specific to CD19. These designs incorporate the CD28 and 41BB costimulatory domains. Through in vitro analysis, we evaluated the population ratios and cytotoxic activities of Central Memory T cells (TCM) and Stem Cell Memory T cells (TSCM) in CAR-T (CAR1928-T and CAR19BB-T) cells. Our initial design, CAR1928-T, produced an effective anti-tumor response. With our second design, CAR19BB-T, we not only achieved an anti-tumor effect but also conferred memory capabilities, leading to a comprehensive treatment approach. We demonstrated that CAR-T cells produced using Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) exhibited increased persistence in vitro and in vivo compared to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. The use of PHA to activate CAR19BB-T cells developed a long-lasting and effective CAR-T cell production method in vivo using cancerous animal models. CAR-T cell-treated mice survived tumor-free for up to 60 days, surpassing the survival of mice that received tumors only. Additionally, CAR19BB-T cell production with PHA remained stable over time. These results highlight a novel CAR-T cell production approach with a high-memory T cell profile capable of delaying or preventing cancer relapse. We optimized the method for the production of long-term and effective CAR-T cells and tested it in preclinical experiments. As a result, it was demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated with PHA, when administered as a co-stimulatory dose, can provide continuous proliferation and long-term persistence without compromising their anti-cancer efficacy. Preclinical studies have been completed to obtain valuable data for enhancing the long-term effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in clinical trials and transitioning to clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Malaria genomic surveillance often estimates parasite genetic relatedness using metrics such as Identity-By-Decent (IBD). Yet, strong positive selection stemming from antimalarial drug resistance or other interventions may bias IBD-based estimates. In this study, we utilized simulations, a true IBD inference algorithm, and empirical datasets from different malaria transmission settings to investigate the extent of such bias and explore potential correction strategies. We analyzed whole genome sequence data generated from 640 new and 4,026 publicly available Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates. Our findings demonstrated that positive selection distorts IBD distributions, leading to underestimated effective population size and blurred population structure. Additionally, we discovered that the removal of IBD peak regions partially restored the accuracy of IBD-based inferences, with this effect contingent on the populations background genetic relatedness. Consequently, we advocate for selection correction for parasite populations undergoing strong, recent positive selection, particularly in high malaria transmission settings.",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of key genes is pivotal in biological research. Here, we introduce machine learning to the field of functional gene identification, enabling precise prediction of bacterial shape based on genomic information. Our machine learning model successfully predicts bacterial shape, and we determine the influence of various protein domains on shape using the model. This approach facilitates the identification of candidate genes involved in regulating bacterial shape. Through targeted knockout experiments on eight potential key regulatory genes (pal, yicC, mreB, tolQ, ftsX, amiC, yddB, and rpoZ) in Escherichia coli, we observe significant alterations in rod-shaped morphology upon individual knockout of pal and mreB genes. E. coli transitions from rod-shaped to spherical or cell wall-deficient protoplasmic states. Experimental validations validate the robustness of our newly developed method. This study establishes an innovative avenue for exploring functional genes, harnessing large-scale genomic information to promptly uncover key genes governing shared traits across species.",
