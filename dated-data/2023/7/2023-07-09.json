    "abstract": "Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are essential components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In terms of protein targeting and assembly, the current dogma holds that a \"{beta}-signal\" imprinted in the final {beta}-strand of the OMP engages the {beta}-barrel assembly machinery (BAM complex) to initiate membrane insertion and assembly of the OMP into the outer membrane. Here, we reveal an additional rule, that signals equivalent to the {beta}-signal are repeated in other, internal {beta}-strands within bacterial OMPs. The internal signal is needed to promote the efficiency of the assembly reaction of these OMPs. BamD, an essential subunit of the BAM complex, recognizes the internal signal and the {beta}-signal, arranging several {beta}-strands for rapid OMP assembly. The internal signal-BamD ordering system is not essential for bacterial viability but is necessary to retain the integrity of the outer membrane against antibiotics and other environmental insults.\n\nTEASERBacterial outer membrane proteins are recognized and bound by BamD at specific signals located in multiple {beta}-strands at the C-terminus of these proteins.",

    "abstract": "Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1, closer to CA2) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1, closer to the subiculum). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. We also show that dCA1 local field potentials (LFPs) show higher power in theta range compared to pCA1 LFPs. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest that theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space is task-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is a common feature of many solid tumors due to aberrant proliferation and angiogenesis and has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Most of the well-known hypoxia effects are mediated through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but the long-lasting effect of hypoxia beyond the immediate HIF regulation remains less understood. Here we show that hypoxia exerts a prolonged effect to promote metastasis. Using breast cancer patient-derived circulating tumor cell (CTC) lines and common breast cancer cell lines, we found that hypoxia downregulates tumor intrinsic type I interferon (IFN) signaling and its downstream antigen presentation (AP) machinery in luminal breast cancer cells, via both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent mechanisms. Hypoxia induced IFN/AP suppression can last longer than the hypoxic exposure, presenting a \"hypoxic memory\" phenotype. Hypoxic memory of IFN/AP downregulation is established by specific hypoxic priming, and cells with hypoxic memory have an enhanced ability for tumorigenesis and metastasis. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Entinostat can erase the hypoxic memory and improve the immune clearance of tumor cells when combined with checkpoint immunotherapies in a syngeneic breast cancer mouse model. These results point to a novel mechanism for hypoxia facilitated tumor progression, through a long-lasting memory that provides advantages for CTCs during the metastatic cascade.\n\nSignificance: We revealed a novel hypoxic memory of prolonged suppression of tumor intrinsic type I IFN and AP signals that promote tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting novel mechanistic understanding of the immune evasive properties of CTCs.",

    "abstract": "Pinus taeda (loblolly pine [LP]), a long-lived tree species, is one of the worlds most economically important forest trees. Among growth traits, volume is the most widely considered in tree improvement programs. The challenge of revealing the genetic variants involved in growth trait variation is even greater in conifers such as LP because of the extremely large size and high complexity of their genomes. Here, we present a comprehensive genetic analysis of LP involving genetic markers associated with volume (via genome-wide association studies [GWASs] and machine learning [ML]) to reveal pathways involved in high-performance phenotypes. We used a population of LP in the 2nd cycle of breeding composed of full-sib progenies established at seven sites. A total of 1,692 individuals were phenotyped and genotyped using sequence capture probes. A total of 31,589 SNPs were identified and used to perform a GWAS through a multilocus mixed model. A precision core marker set with 7,864 SNPs selected through ML, i.e., feature selection (FS), was used for genomic selection (GS), providing a predictive accuracy of approximately 0.79. For genomic annotation and the construction of gene coexpression networks, three transcriptomes were assembled. We selected genes associated with the target trait and assessed the cascade of related molecular mechanisms within gene coexpression networks. These results advance the understanding of the genetics of growth traits, reveal candidate genes for future functional studies in LP, and increase the understanding of quantitative genetics and the genomics of complex phenotypic variations in LP.\n\nKey MessageFrom the combination of GWAS and ML, we identified genetic markers associated with volume trait in loblolly pine, providing information into its genetic architecture and enabling more efficient breeding strategies for improved plant growth.",

    "abstract": "The National Cancer Institutes Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) provides unique opportunities for cancer target discovery using protein expression. Proteomics data from CPTAC tumor types have been primarily generated using a multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT) approach, which is designed to provide protein quantification relative to reference samples. However, relative protein expression data is suboptimal for prioritization of targets within a tissue type, which requires additional reprocessing of the original proteomics data to derive absolute quantitation estimation. We evaluated the feasibility of using differential protein analysis coupled with intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) to identify tumor-enriched and highly expressed cell surface antigens, employing tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics data from CPTAC. Absolute quantification derived from TMT proteomics data was highly correlated with that of label-free proteomics data from the CPTAC colon adenocarcinoma cohort, which contains proteomics data measured by both approaches. We validated the TMT-iBAQ approach by comparing the iBAQ value to the receptor density value of HER2 and TROP2 measured by flow cytometry in about 30 selected breast and lung cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Collections of these tumor-enriched and highly expressed cell surface antigens could serve as a valuable resource for the development of cancer therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates and immunotherapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Evidenced in zebrafishes skin and Mimulus petal, Turing-like mechanisms are suspected to be responsible for many periodic colour patterns of Eukaryotes. They are characterised by the mathematical relationships linking their cellular or molecular actors, the periodicity and the geometrical range of the patterns they produce: spots, stripes or mazes. Nevertheless, some periodic patterns such as leopard iconic rosettes required additional ingredients to explain their formation. Growth being the main candidate, we extensively explore its multiple facets, at the Eukaryotes scale. We show that far beyond the particular feline coat pattern, putative-growth Turing colour patterns are present in many diverse lineages of plants and animals and seem absent in Fungi and unicellular lineages. Using models, we show the many ways growth can induce new shapes and colours, and that putative-growth pattern locations correlates with tissue hot spots of growth, suggesting the latter as the underlying mechanism. By reverse reasoning, we show that growth effects could reveal crucial information about pattern formation. We show how putative growth patterns can contribute to influence organisms visibility, thereby improving camouflage or aposematism. Our results demonstrate the range of morphogenetic roles that tissue expansion can take, by interacting with a scale-sensitive mechanism, here Turing-like patterning. Considering this extensive overview of its biological importance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, links between growth and form might more than ever needed to be explored.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUnderstanding natural selection in humans and other species is a major focus for the use of machine learning in population genetics. Existing methods rely on computationally intensive simulated training data. Unlike efficient neutral coalescent simulations for demographic inference, realistic simulations of selection typically requires slow forward simulations. Because there are many possible modes of selection, a high dimensional parameter space must be explored, with no guarantee that the simulated models are close to the real processes. Mismatches between simulated training data and real test data can lead to incorrect inference. Finally, it is difficult to interpret trained neural networks, leading to a lack of understanding about what features contribute to classification.\n\nHere we develop a new approach to detect selection that requires relatively few selection simulations during training. We use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained to simulate realistic neutral data. The resulting GAN consists of a generator (fitted demographic model) and a discriminator (convolutional neural network). For a genomic region, the discriminator predicts whether it is \"real\" or \"fake\" in the sense that it could have been simulated by the generator. As the \"real\" training data includes regions that experienced selection and the generator cannot produce such regions, regions with a high probability of being real are likely to have experienced selection. To further incentivize this behavior, we \"fine-tune\" the discriminator with a small number of selection simulations. We show that this approach has high power to detect selection in simulations, and that it finds regions under selection identified by state-of-the art population genetic methods in three human populations. Finally, we show how to interpret the trained networks by clustering hidden units of the discriminator based on their correlation patterns with known summary statistics. In summary, our approach is a novel, efficient, and powerful way to use machine learning to detect natural selection.",

Here, we used whole-brain fMRI to examine activations due to value memory as participants passively viewed objects before, minutes after, and 1-70 days following value training. Significant value memory for objects was evident in the behavioral performance, which nevertheless faded over the days following training. Minutes after training, the occipital, ventral temporal, interparietal, and frontal areas showed strong value discrimination. Days after training, activation in the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions decreased, whereas the parietal areas showed sustained activation. In addition, days-long value responses emerged in certain subcortical regions, including the caudate, ventral striatum, and thalamus. Resting-state analysis revealed that these subcortical areas were functionally connected. Furthermore, the activation in the thalamo-striatal cluster was positively correlated with participants performance in days-long value memory. These findings shed light on the neural basis of value memory in humans with implications for object habit formation and cross-species comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are seeing increased use as methods to predict mutational effects or allowed mutations in proteins. The models commonly used for these purposes include large language models (LLMs) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These two model types have very different architectures and are commonly trained on different representations of proteins. LLMs make use of the transformer architecture and are trained purely on protein sequences whereas 3D CNNs are trained on voxelized representations of local protein structure. While comparable overall prediction accuracies have been reported for both types of models, it is not known to what extent these models make comparable specific predictions and/or generalize protein biochemistry in similar ways. Here, we perform a systematic comparison of two LLMs and two structure-based models (CNNs) and show that the different model types have distinct strengths and weaknesses. The overall prediction accuracies are largely uncorrelated between the sequence- and structure-based models. Overall, the two structure-based models are better at predicting buried aliphatic and hydrophobic residues whereas the two LLMs are better at predicting solvent-exposed polar and charged amino acids. Finally, we find that a combined model that takes the individual model predictions as input can leverage these individual model strengths and results in significantly improved overall prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Proteasomes are multi-subunit, multi-catalytic protein complexes present in eukaryotic cells that degrade misfolded, damaged, or unstructured proteins. In this study, we used an activity-guided proteomic methodology based on a fluorogenic peptide substrate to characterize the composition of proteasome complexes in WT yeast, and the changes these complexes undergo upon the deletion of Pre9 ({Delta}3) or of Sem1 ({Delta}Sem1).\n\nA comparison of whole-cell proteomic analysis to activity-guided proteasome profiling indicates that the amounts of proteasomal proteins and proteasome interacting proteins in the assembled active proteasomes differ significantly from their total amounts in the cell as a whole. Using this activity-guided approach, we characterized the changes in the abundance of subunits of various active proteasome species in different strains, quantified the relative abundance of active proteasomes across these strains, and charted the overall distribution of different proteasome species within each strain. The distributions obtained by our mass spectrometry-based quantification were markedly higher for some proteasome species than those obtained by activity-based quantification alone, suggesting that the activity of some of these species is impaired. The impaired activity appeared mostly among 20SBlm10 proteasome species which account for 20% of the active proteasomes in WT.\n\nTo identify the factors behind this impaired activity, we mapped and quantified known proteasome-interacting proteins. Our results suggested that some of the reduced activity might be due to the association of the proteasome inhibitor Fub1. Additionally, we provide novel evidence for the presence of non-mature and therefore inactive proteasome protease subunits {beta}2 and {beta}5 in the fully assembled proteasomes.\n\nSignificance StatementProteasomes, essential protein complexes in eukaryotic cells, degrade misfolded, damaged, or unstructured proteins. Here we present an activity-guided proteomic method to characterize the composition and abundance of proteasomes. When applied to yeast proteasomes, this method revealed discrepancies between proteasome distributions determined by mass spectrometry and peptidase activity. This implies that a substantial portion of the proteasomes may exhibit reduced activity. Our findings indicate that these changes in proteasome activity could be linked to proteasome inhibition by Fub1. Furthermore, we identified signature peptides that indicate incomplete maturation of some of the {beta}2 and {beta}5 proteolytic subunits in fully assembled proteasomes, suggesting that proteasome core particle assembly can proceed even without the complete maturation of all {beta} subunits.",

We develop a novel computational model that couples SD and CSF flow. We first use high order numerical simulations to solve a system of physiologically realistic reaction-diffusion equations which govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of ions in the extracellular and intracellular spaces of the brain cortex during SD. We then couple the SD wave with a 1D CSF flow model that captures the change in cross-sectional area, pressure, and volume flow rate through the PVSs. The coupling is modelled using an empirical relationship between the excess potassium ion concentration in the extracellular space following SD and the vessel radius. We find that the CSF volumetric flow rate depends intricately on the length and width of the PVS, as well as the vessel radius and the angle of incidence of the SD wave. We derive analytical expressions for pressure and volumetric flow rates of CSF through the PVS for a given SD wave and quantify CSF flow variations when two SD waves collide. Our numerical approach is very general and could be extended in the future to obtain novel, quantitative insights into how CSF flow in the brain couples with slow waves, functional hyperemia, seizures, or externally applied neural stimulations.",

    "abstract": "One prerequisite for generating recombinant antibodies for therapeutic and non-therapeutic purposes from hybridoma clones is the reliable, efficient, and cost-effective sequencing of the hybridoma clone that produces the desired antibody. However, many hybridoma fusion partners produce aberrant endogenous mRNA transcripts most of which resemble kappa chains. These aberrant kappa chain mRNAs can interfere with or even prevent the determination of the functional murine antibody kappa chain cDNA sequences during the PCR amplification step. In this paper, we report the development of a rapid and cost-effective CRISPR/Cas9 based method to eliminate the aberrant endogenous sequence. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by significantly reducing the number of an endogenous aberrant kappa chain transcript known as the aberrant SP2/0 kappa chain. This transcript is produced by the commonly used fusion partner known as SP2/0 which is a myeloma-derived cell line. Here, we first cloned and sequenced two hybridoma clones using this method (clones A1E7 and A9E11). Our results showed a 24 to 25 percent reduction of the aberrant chain sequences (method 1) from the sequencing results. We then optimized this method (method 2) and used it to clone and sequence a third hybridoma clone (clone 262). This optimized method allowed us to achieve an 88% reduction of the aberrant kappa chain sequences.",

    "abstract": "Cofilin family proteins have essential roles in remodeling the cytoskeleton through filamentous actin depolymerization and severing. The short unstructured N-terminal region of cofilin is critical for actin binding and harbors the major site of inhibitory phosphorylation. Atypically for a disordered sequence, the N-terminal region is highly conserved, but the aspects of cofilin functionality driving this conservation are not clear. Here, we screened a library of 16,000 human cofilin N-terminal sequence variants for their capacity to support growth in S. cerevisiae in the presence or absence of the upstream regulator LIM kinase. Results from the screen and subsequent biochemical analysis of individual variants revealed distinct sequence requirements for actin binding and regulation by LIM kinase. While the presence of a serine, rather than threonine, phosphoacceptor residue was essential for phosphorylation by LIM kinase, the native cofilin N-terminus was otherwise a suboptimal LIM kinase substrate. This circumstance was not due to sequence requirements for actin binding and severing, but rather appeared primarily to maintain the capacity for phosphorylation to inactivate cofilin. Overall, the individual sequence requirements for cofilin function and regulation were remarkably loose when examined separately, but collectively restricted the N-terminus to sequences found in natural cofilins. Our results illustrate how a regulatory phosphorylation site can balance potentially competing sequence requirements for function and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are crucial for life, and measuring their abundance at the single-cell level can facilitate a high-resolution understanding of biological mechanisms in cellular processes and disease progression. However, current single-cell proteomic technologies face challenges such as limited coverage, throughput, and sensitivity, as well as batch effects, high costs, and stringent experimental operations. Drawing inspiration from the translation procedure of both natural language processing (NLP) and the genetic central dogma, we propose a pre-trained, large generative model named scTranslator (single-cell translator). scTranslator is align-free and capable of generating multi-omics data by inferring the missing single-cell proteome based on the transcriptome. Systematic benchmarking confirms the accuracy, stability, and flexibility of scTranslator across various quantification techniques, cell types, and conditions. Furthermore, scTranslator has demonstrated its superiority in assisting various downstream analyses and applications, including gene/protein interaction inference, gene pseudo-knockout, cell clustering, batch correction, and cell origin recognition on pan-cancer data.",

Exploring the potential variations in the spatial co-occurrence or co-localization of different cell types across distinct tissue or disease classes can provide significant pathological insights, paving the way for intervention strategies. However, the existing methods in this context either rely on stringent statistical assumptions or suffer from a lack of generalizability.\n\nResultsWe present a highly powerful method to study differential spatial co-occurrence of cell types across multiple tissue or disease groups, based on the theories of the Poisson point process (PPP) and functional analysis of variance (FANOVA). Notably, the method accommodates multiple images per subject and addresses the problem of missing tissue regions, commonly encountered in such a context due to the complex nature of the data-collection procedure. We demonstrate the superior statistical power and robustness of the method in comparison to existing approaches through realistic simulation studies. Furthermore, we apply the method to three real datasets on different diseases collected using different imaging platforms. In particular, one of these datasets reveals novel insights into the spatial characteristics of various types of precursor lesions associated with colorectal cancer.\n\nAvailabilityThe associated R package can be found here, https://github.com/sealx017/SpaceANOVA.\n\nContactsealso@musc.edu\n\nSupplementary informationThe supplementary material is attached.",

From a sample size of 400 individuals, growth parameters such as asymptotic length, growth rate and growth performance index were estimated as 80.01 cm, 0.810 per year and 3.71 per year while the potential longevity was estimated as 4.6 years. The mortality parameters such as total, natural and fishing mortality were estimated as 2.88 /year, 1.05/ year and 1.83 / year respectively. The length at 25 %, 50% and 75% susceptibility to capture was estimated as 40.87 cm, 38.11 cm and 35.34 cm respectively. The fishing mortality and exploitation beyond optimum level and maximum sustainable exploitation ratio (Emax) indicate the overly exploitation of Mahseer resources in their breeding and nursery grounds. This indicates that the examined breeding and nursery grounds in Western Himalaya are facing intense \"growth and recruitment overfishing\" which may result in stock collapse in the forthcoming years.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+ leak from cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via hyperactive resting cardiac ryanodine receptor channels (RyR2) is pro-arrhythmic. An exogenous peptide, (DPc10) detects leaky RyR2 in cardiomyocytes. Conversely, calmodulin (CaM) inhibits RyR2 leak. These observations have led to designing a FRET biosensor for drug discovery targeting RyR2. Here we used FRET to understand the molecular mechanism driving the DPc10-CaM interdependence when binding RyR2 in SR vesicles. We used donor-FKBP12.6 (D-FKBP) to resolve RyR2 binding of acceptor-CaM (A-CaM). In low nanomolar Ca2+, DPc10 decreased both FRETmax (under saturating [A-CaM]) and the CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. In micromolar Ca2+, DPc10 decreased FRETmax without affecting CaM/RyR2 binding affinity. This correlates with analysis of fluorescence-lifetime-detected FRET indicating that DPc10 lowers occupancy of the RyR2 CaM-binding sites in nanomolar (not micromolar) Ca2+ and lengthens D-FKBP/A-CaM distances independent of [Ca2+]. To observe DPc10/RyR2 binding, we used acceptor-DPc10 (A-DPc10). CaM weakens A-DPc10/RyR2 binding, this effect being larger in micromolar vs. nanomolar Ca2+. Moreover, A-DPc10/RyR2 binding is cooperative in CaM- and FKBP-dependent manner, suggesting that both endogenous modulators promote concerted structural changes between RyR2 protomers for channel regulation. Aided by analysis of cryo-EM structures, these insights inform further development of the DPc10-CaM paradigm for therapeutic discovery targeting RyR2.",

    "abstract": "High-content imaging (HCI) is a popular technique that leverages high throughput datasets to uncover phenotypes of cell populations in vitro. When the differences between populations (such as a healthy and disease state) are completely unknown, it is crucial to build very large HCI screens to account for individual (donor) variation, as well as having enough replicates to create a reliable model. One approach to highlight phenotypic differences is to reduce images into a set of features using unbiased methods, such as embeddings or autoencoders. These methods are powerful at preserving the predictive power contained in each image while removing most of the unimportant image features and noise (e.g., background). However, they do not provide interpretable information about the features driving the decision process of the AI algorithm used. While tools have been developed to address this issue, such as CellProfiler, scaling this tool to large sample batches containing hundreds of thousands of images poses computational challenges. Additionally, the resulting feature vector, computationally expensive to have generated, is very large in size (containing over 3000 features) with many redundant features, making it challenging to perform further analysis and identify the truly relevant features. Ultimately, there is an increased risk of overfitting due to the presence of too many non-meaningful features that can ultimately skew downstream predictions.\n\nTo address this issue, we have developed ScaleFExSM, a Python pipeline that extracts multiple generic fixed features at the single cell level that can be deployed across large high-content imaging datasets with low computational requirements. This pipeline efficiently and reliably computes features related to shape, size, intensity, texture, granularity as well as correlations between channels. Additionally, it allows the measurement of additional features specifically related to mitochondria and RNA only, as they represent important channels with characteristics worth to be measured on their own. The measured features can be used to not only separate populations of cells using AI tools, but also highlight the specific interpretable features that differ between populations. We applied ScaleFExSM to identify the phenotypic shifts that multiple cell lines undergo when exposed to different compounds. We used a combination of recursive feature elimination, logistic regression, correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction representations to narrow down to the most meaningful features that described the drug shifts. Furthermore, we used the best scoring features to extract images of cells for each class closest to the average to visually highlight the phenotypic shifts caused by the drugs. Using this approach, we were able to identify features linked to the drug shifts in line with literature, and we could visually validate their involvement in the morphological changes of the cells.\n\nScaleFExSM can be used as a powerful tool to understand the underlying phenotypes of complex diseases and subtle drug shifts at the single cell level, bringing us a step closer to identifying disease-modifying compounds for the major diseases of our time.",

Among them, lysosomes stand out as they integrate metabolic sensing with gene regulation and secretion of proteases. Yet, how the function of lysosomes is linked to their position and how this controls metastatic progression remains elusive. Here, we analyzed lysosome subcellular distribution in micropatterned patient-derived melanoma cells and found that lysosome spreading scales with their aggressiveness. Peripheral lysosomes promote invadopodia-based matrix degradation and invasion of melanoma cells which is directly linked to their lysosomal and cell transcriptional programs. When controlling lysosomal positioning using chemo-genetical heterodimerization in melanoma cells, we demonstrated that perinuclear clustering impairs lysosomal secretion, matrix degradation and invasion. Impairing lysosomal spreading in a zebrafish metastasis model significantly reduces invasive outgrowth. Our study provides a mechanistic demonstration that lysosomal positioning controls cell invasion, illustrating the importance of organelle adaptation in carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Molecular understanding of the vertebrate Organizer, a tissue center critical for inductive signaling during gastrulation, has so far been limited to transcripts and some proteins due to limitations in detection and sensitivity. The Spemann-Mangold Organizer (SMO) in the South African Clawed Frog (X. laevis), a popular model of development, has long been discovered to induce the patterning of the central nervous system. Molecular screens on the tissue have identified several genes, such as goosecoid, chordin, and noggin, with independent ability to establish a body axis. A comprehensive study of proteins and metabolites produced in the SMO and their functional roles has been lacking. Here, we pioneer a deep discovery proteomic and targeted metabolomic screen of the SMO in comparison to the rest of the embryo using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Quantification of [~]4,600 proteins and a panel of metabolites documented differential expression for [~]450 proteins and multiple intermediates of energy metabolism in the SMO. Upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and redox regulatory proteins gave rise to elevated oxidative stress and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the Organizer. Imaging experiments corroborated these findings, discovering enrichment of hydrogen peroxide in the SMO tissue. Chemical perturbation of the redox gradient affected mesoderm involution during early tissue movements of gastrulation. HRMS expands the bioanalytical toolbox of cell and developmental biology, providing previously unavailable information on molecular classes to challenge and refine our classical understanding of the Organizer and its function during early patterning of the embryo.",

These motor reflexive measures can only accurately represent a pain response if motor function in also intact. The commonly used spared nerve injury (SNI) model, however, damages the tibial and common peroneal nerves that should result in motor phenotypes (i.e., an immobile or \"flail\" foot) not typically captured in sensory assays. To test the extent of these issues, we used DeepLabCut, a deep learning-based markerless pose estimation tool to quantify spontaneous limb position in C57BL/6J mice during tail suspension following either SNI or sham surgery. Using this granular detail, we identified the expected flail foot-like impairment, but we also found SNI mice hold their injured limb closer to the body midline compared to shams. These phenotypes were not present in the Complete Freunds Adjuvant model of inflammatory pain and were not reversed by multiple analgesics with different mechanisms of action, suggesting these SNI-specific phenotypes are not directly related to pain. Together these results suggest SNI causes previously undescribed phenotypes unrelated to altered sensation that are likely underappreciated while interpreting preclinical pain research outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a global infection primarily transmitted among domestic and wild ruminant populations through Culicoides spp. midges. Infection is highly prevalent across temperate and tropical regions; however, significant changes in the global distribution of BTV have been observed in recent years. We aimed to evaluate the national BTV seroprevalence and its risk factors among domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) in Peru. Ruminant sera (cattle= 3 452, sheep= 2 786 and goats=1 568) were collected using a random, two-stage clustering method and analyzed by c-ELISA. The national BTV seroprevalence was 12.7% (95% CI: 11.00-14.63%) and the seropositivity rate for each species was 19.29% (95% CI: 16.0%-31.1%) in cattle, 8.4 (95% CI: 6.6%-10.5%) in sheep, and 9.2% (95% CI: 5.6%-14.8%) in goats. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate risk factors for BTV seropositivity and to estimate Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% CI. We found that age, altitude, and maximum temperature were identified as crucial factors influencing the prevalence of BTV seroprevalence in cattle, sheep and goats. Older animals, particularly cattle and goats between 6 and 24 months and above 24 months, exhibited a significantly higher likelihood of BTV infection. Additionally, higher altitudes above 3000 masl played a protective role, reducing the risk of BTV transmission. Furthermore, increased maximum temperatures, especially exceeding 30 {degrees}C, were associated with a greater prevalence of BTV. This study lays the groundwork for identifying BTV serotypes and Culicoides spp. in different regions, including altitudes above 3000 masl, to enhance BTV surveillance in Peru.",

    "abstract": "The propensity of bacteria to grow collectively in communities known as biofilms and their ability to overcome clinical treatments in this condition has become a major medical problem, emphasizing the need for anti-biofilm strategies. Antagonistic microbial interactions have extensively served as searching platforms for antibiotics, but their potential as sources for anti-biofilm compounds has barely been exploited. By screening for microorganisms that in agar-set pairwise interactions could antagonize Escherichia colis ability to form macrocolony biofilms, we found that the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis strongly inhibits the synthesis of amyloid fibers -known as curli-, which are the primary extracellular matrix (ECM) components of E. coli biofilms. We identified bacillaene, a B. subtilis hybrid non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide metabolite, previously described as a bacteriostatic antibiotic, as the effector molecule. We found that bacillaene combines both antibiotic and anti-curli functions in a concentration-dependent order that potentiates the ecological competitiveness of B. subtilis, highlighting bacillaene as a metabolite naturally optimized for microbial inhibition. Our studies revealed that bacillaene inhibits curli by directly impeding the assembly of the CsgB and CsgA curli subunits into amyloid fibers. Moreover, we found that curli inhibition occurs despite E. coli attempts to reinforce its protective ECM by inducing curli genes via a RpoS-mediated competition sensing response trigged by the threatening presence of B. subtilis. Overall, our findings illustrate the relevance of exploring microbial interactions not only for finding compounds with novel and unique activities, but for uncovering additional functions of compounds previously categorized as antibiotics.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhile traditionally serving as sources for novel antibiotics, microbial interactions have a great potential -yet to be more intensely exploited- as sources for compounds with anti-biofilm activities among other functions. Exploring such potential, we uncovered an anti-curli amyloid activity of bacillaene, a B. subtilis secondary metabolite, that prevents E. coli biofilm morphogenesis. We demonstrated that bacillaene inhibits curli by interfering with the assembly of curli subunits into amyloid fibers and that such inhibition occurs despite E. coli fights to reinforce its protective amyloid matrix. Moreover, we showed that bacillaene combines this anti-curli activity with a previously assigned antibiotic activity in a concentration-dependent order that potentiates the inhibitory effect against curli-based E. coli biofilms. The finding of additional activities of compounds previously characterized as antibiotics, as here demonstrated for bacillaene, is relevant to understand both the actual roles of secondary metabolites in modulating microbial interactions in natural niches and the potential implications of the combined activities in therapeutic applications to treat bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "The Totiviridae family of viruses has a unique genome consisting of double-stranded RNA with two open reading frames that encode the capsid protein (Cap) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Most virions in this family are isometric in shape, approximately 40 nm in diameter, and lack envelope. There are five genera within this family, including Totivirus, Victorivirus, Giardiavirus, Leishmaniavirus, and Trichomonasvirus. While Totivirus and Victorivirus primarily infect fungi, Giardiavirus, Leishmaniavirus, and Trichomonasvirus infect diverse hosts, including protists, insects, and vertebrates. Recently, new totivirus-like species have been discovered in fish and plant hosts, and through metagenomic analysis, a novel totivirus-like virus (named Tianjin totivirus) has been isolated from bat guano. Interestingly, Tianjin totivirus causes cytopathic effects in insect cells but cannot grow in mammalian cells, suggesting that it infects insects consumed by insectivorous bats. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing and identified totivirus-like viruses in liver tissue from Molossus molossus bats () in the Amazon region of Brazil. Comparative phylogenetic analysis based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region revealed that the viruses identified in Molossus bats belong to two distinct phylogenetic clades, possibly comprising different genera within the Totiviridae family. Notably, the mean similarity between Tianjin totivirus and the totiviruses identified in Molossus bats is less than 18%. These findings suggest that the diversity of totiviruses in bats is more extensive than previously recognized and highlight the potential for bats to serve as reservoirs for novel toti-like viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPolygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) potentially improve cardiovascular risk prediction. However, their relationship with histopathologic features of CAD has never been examined systematically.\n\nMethodsFrom 4,327 subjects referred to CVPath by the State of Maryland Office Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for sudden death between 1994 and 2015, 2,455 cases were randomly selected for genotyping. We generated PRS from 291 known CAD risk loci. Detailed histopathologic examination of the coronary arteries was performed in all subjects. The primary study outcome measurements were histopathologic plaque features determining severity of atherosclerosis, including %stenosis, calcification, thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA), and thrombotic CAD.\n\nResultsAfter exclusion of cases with insufficient DNA sample quality or with missing data, 954 cases (mean age 48.8{+/-}14.7; 75.7% men) remained in the final study cohort. Subjects in the highest PRS quintile exhibited more severe atherosclerosis compared to subjects in the lowest quintile, with greater %stenosis (80.3%{+/-}27.0% vs. 50.4%{+/-}38.7%; adjusted p<0.001) and a higher frequency of calcification (69.6% vs. 35.8%; adjusted p=0.004) and TCFAs (26.7% vs. 9.5%; adjusted p=0.007). Even after adjustment for traditional CAD risk factors subjects within the highest PRS quintile had higher odds of severe atherosclerosis (i.e., [&ge;]75% stenosis; adjusted OR 3.77; 95%CI 2.10-6.78; p<0.001) and plaque rupture (adjusted OR 4.05; 95%CI 2.26-7.24; p<0.001). Moreover, subjects within the highest quintile had higher odds of CAD-associated cause of death, especially among those aged 50 years and younger (adjusted OR 4.08; 95%CI 2.01-8.30; p<0.001). No associations were observed with plaque erosion.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first autopsy study investigating associations between PRS and atherosclerosis severity at the histopathologic level in subjects with sudden death. Our pathological analysis suggests PRS correlates with plaque burden and features of advanced atherosclerosis and may be useful as a method for CAD risk stratification, especially in younger subjects.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIn this autopsy study including 954 subjects within the CVPath Sudden Death Registry, high PRS correlated with plaque burden and atherosclerosis severity.\nC_LIO_LIThe PRS showed differential associations with plaque rupture and plaque erosion, suggesting different etiologies to these two causes of thrombotic CAD.\nC_LIO_LIPRS may be useful for risk stratification, particularly in the young.

    "abstract": "Germ granules, condensates of phase-separated RNA and protein, are organelles essential for germline development in different organisms The patterning of the granules and its relevance for germ cell fate are not fully understood. Combining three-dimensional in vivo structural and functional analyses, we study the dynamic spatial organization of molecules within zebrafish germ granules. We find that localization of RNA molecules to the periphery of the granules, where ribosomes are localized depends on translational activity at this location. In addition, we find that the vertebrate-specific Dead end (Dnd1) protein is essential for nanos3 RNA localization at the condensates periphery. Accordingly, in the absence of Dnd1, or when translation is inhibited, nanos3 RNA translocates into the granule interior, away from the ribosomes, a process that is correlated with loss of germ cell fate. These findings highlight the relevance of sub-granule compartmentalization for posttranscriptional control, and its importance for preserving germ cell totipotency.",

    "abstract": "The Linearbandkeramik (LBK) Neolithic communities were the first to spread farming across large parts of central Europe, settling fertile regions from Ukraine to France during the second half of the 6th millennium BCE. The LBK had a high degree of material culture uniformity, albeit with regional differences in settlement patterns, subsistence, and mortuary practices. To date, ancient DNA data from LBK individuals have been generated for a limited number of locations and often in small sample sizes, making it challenging to study variation within and across sites. We report genome-wide data for 178 LBK individuals, from the Alfold Linearbankeramik Culture (ALPC) eastern LBK site of Polgar-Ferenci-hat in Hungary, the western LBK site of Nitra in Slovakia, and the enclosed western LBK settlement and massacre site of Schletz in Austria, as well as 42 LBK individuals from 18 other sites. We also report genome-wide data for 28 Early Neolithic Koros and Star[c]evo individuals from 13 sites, viewed as the predecessors of the LBK. We observe a higher percentage of western hunter-gatherer (WHG) admixture among individuals in the eastern LBK than in the far more widely distributed western LBK, showing that these two archaeologically distinct cultures also had different genetic trajectories. Most WHG-farmer mixture occurred just before the dawn of the LBK culture and there is no evidence that the WHG ancestry came systematically more from males or females. However, we do find strong genetic evidence for patrilocality among the LBK, extending previous findings based on isotopic analysis, with more genetic structure across sites on the male than on the female line, and a higher rate of within-site relatives for males. At Schletz we detect almost no first-degree relatives despite reporting data from almost every skeleton present at the site, showing that this massacre involved people from a large population, not a small community.",

    "abstract": "Research Data Management (RDM) is a system for the effective handling of research data that enables scientists to structure their research questions and ensure best practices throughout the data lifecycle, from acquisition, computation and annotation to data publication and re-use. Data management plans (DMPs) are documents that formally set out the RDM of a project and are required by many funding bodies. DMPs help to organize and structure RDM strategies, thus promoting data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). Although DMPs incorporate methods and standards that can be reused by different research projects, the standardization of DMP content is not as evident as the standardization of RDM practices and data/metadata. To address this issue in the plant sciences, we developed DataPLAN - a tool that combines a questionnaire with pre-written standardized responses. We wrapped the questionnaire in a serverless single-page web application that can then generate standardized responses from DMP templates. The current templates cater to plant research grant proposals for Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). In the future the range of templates will be extended to accommodate other funding schemes, thereby enabling more users to generate their own templates. The DataPLAN web application is open-source and does not require an internet connection. By utilizing DataPLAN, the workload associated with creating, updating, and adhering to DMPs is significantly reduced.",

    "abstract": "Forebrain neurons deprived of activity become hyperactive when activity is restored. Rebound activity has been linked to spontaneous seizures in vivo following prolonged activity blockade. Here we measured the time course of rebound activity and the contributing circuit mechanisms using calcium imaging, synaptic staining and whole cell patch clamp in organotypic slice cultures of mouse neocortex. Calcium imaging revealed hypersynchronous activity increasing in intensity with longer periods of deprivation. While activity partially recovered three days after slices were released from five days of deprivation, they were less able to recover after ten days of deprivation. However, even after the longer period of deprivation, activity patterns eventually returned to baseline levels. The degree of deprivation-induced rebound was age-dependent, with the greatest effects occurring when silencing began in the second week. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors indicated that hypersynchronous rebound activity did not require Hebbian plasticity evoked. In single neuron recordings, input resistance roughly doubled with a concomitant increase in intrinsic excitability. Synaptic imaging of pre- and postsynaptic proteins revealed dramatic reductions in the number of presumptive synapses with a larger effect on inhibitory than seen in excitatory synapses. Putative excitatory synapses colocalizing PSD-95 and Bassoon declined by 39% and 56% following five and ten days of deprivation, but presumptive inhibitory synapses colocalizing gephyrin and VGAT declined by 55% and 73% respectively. The results suggest that with prolonged deprivation, a progressive reduction in synapse number is accompanied by a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition and increased cellular excitability.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen cortical activity is silenced during development, lifelong seizures often result. Here we explored whether these seizures result from overcompensation of homeostatic recovery mechanisms. Prior work showed that neurons briefly deprived of the ability to fire action potentials compensate by becoming more excitable, increasing synaptic drive and intrinsic excitability. We found that prolonged silencing of cortex produced a profound loss of synapse density, especially for inhibitory synapses, pointing to a circuit unable to maintain excitatory/inhibitory balance. These results show that homeostatic responses, which are normally restorative, can result in maladaptive circuit configurations when brought to extremes.",

    "abstract": "Fraser Syndrome is a rare, multisystemic autosomal recessive disorder characterized by disrupted epithelial-mesenchymal associations upon loss of Fraser Complex genes. Disease manifestation and affected organs are highly variable. Digit malformations such as syndactyly are common but of unclear developmental origins. We explored if zebrafish fraser extracellular matrix complex subunit 1 (fras1) mutants model Fraser Syndrome-associated appendicular skeleton patterning defects. Approximately 10% of fras1 mutants survive to adulthood, displaying striking and varied fin abnormalities, including endochondral bone fusions, ectopic cartilage, and disrupted caudal fin symmetry. The fins of surviving fras1 mutants frequently have fewer and unbranched bony rays. fras1 mutant fins regenerate to their original size but with exacerbated ray branching and fin symmetry defects. Single cell RNA-Seq analysis, in situ hybridizations, and antibody staining show specific Fraser complex expression in the basal epidermis during regenerative outgrowth. Fras1 and Fraser Complex component Frem2 accumulate along the basal side of distal-most basal epidermal cells. Greatly reduced and mislocalized Frem2 accompanies loss of Fras1 in fras1 mutants. The Sonic hedgehog signaling between distal basal epidermis and adjacent mesenchymal pre-osteoblasts that promotes ray branching persists upon Fraser Complex loss. However, fras1 mutant regenerating fins exhibit extensive sub-epidermal blistering associated with a disorganized basal epidermis and adjacent pre-osteoblasts. We propose Fraser Complex-supported tissue layer adhesion enables robust integrated tissue morphogenesis involving the basal epidermis and osteoblasts. Further, we establish zebrafish fin development and regeneration as an accessible model to explore mechanisms of Fraser Syndrome-associated digit defects and Fraser Complex function at epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of spatial transcriptomic technologies has opened new avenues to investigate gene activities while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Utilizing data generated by such technologies, the identification of spatially variable (SV) genes is an essential step in investigating tissue landscapes and biological processes. Particularly in typical experimental designs such as case-control or longitudinal studies, identifying SV genes between groups is crucial for discovering significant biomarkers or developing targeted therapies for diseases. However, current methods available for analyzing spatial transcriptomic data are still in their infancy, and none of the existing methods are capable of identifying SV genes between groups. To overcome this challenge, we developed SPADE for spatial pattern and differential expression analysis to identify SV gene in spatial transcriptomic data. SPADE is based on a machine learning model of Gaussian process regression with a gene-specific Gaussian kernel, enabling the detection of SV genes both within and between groups. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated the superior performance of SPADE compared to existing methods in detecting SV genes within and between groups.

    "abstract": "Pharmacological administration of Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) alters food choice, including that it decreases the consumption of sucrose and other sweet tastants. Conversely, endogenous secretion of FGF21 by the liver is modulated by diet, such that plasma FGF21 is increased after eating foods that have a low dietary protein: total energy (P: E) ratio. Together, these findings suggest a strategy to promote healthy eating, in which the macronutrient content of a pre-load meal could reduce the later consumption of sweet desserts. Here, we tested the prediction that individuals eating a low P: E pre-load meal, and next offered a highly palatable sweet  dessert, would eat less of the sugary snack compared to controls, due to increased FGF21 signaling. In addition to decreasing sweet intake, FGF21 increases the consumption of dietary protein. Thus, we predicted that individuals eating a low protein pre-load meal, and subsequently offered a very high-protein pellet as  dessert or snack, would eat more of the high protein pellet compared to controls, and that this depends on FGF21. We tested this in C57Bl/6J, and liver-specific FGF21-null (FGF21{Delta}L) null male and female mice and littermate controls. Contrary to expectation, eating a low protein pre-load did not reduce the later consumption of a sweet solution in either males or females, despite robustly increasing plasma FGF21. Rather, eating the low protein pre-load increased later consumption of a high protein pellet. This was more apparent among males and was abrogated in the FGF21{Delta}L mice. We conclude that physiologic induction of hepatic FGF21 by a low protein pre-load is not sufficient to reduce later consumption of sweet dessert, though it effectively increases the subsequent intake of dietary protein in male mice.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveChildhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a paediatric generalized epilepsy disorder with a confounding feature of resolving in adolescence in a majority of cases. In this study, we modelled how the small-scale (synapse-level) effect of progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone induces a large-scale (network-level) effect on a thalamocortical circuit associated with this disorder. In particular, our goal was to understand the role of sex steroid hormones in the spontaneous remission of CAE.\n\nMethodsThe conductance-based computational model consisted of single-compartment cortical pyramidal, cortical interneurons, thalamic reticular and thalamocortical relay neurons, each described by a set of ordinary differential equations. Excitatory and inhibitory synapses were mediated by AMPA, GABAa and GABAb receptors. The model was implemented using the NetPyne modelling tool and the NEURON simulator.\n\nResultsThe action of allopregnanolone on individual GABAa-receptor mediated synapses has an ameliorating effect on spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with absence seizures. This effect is region-specific and most significant in the thalamus, particularly the synapses between thalamic reticular neurons.\n\nSignificanceThe remedying effect of allopregnanolone on SWDs may possibly be true only for individuals that are predisposed to remission due to intrinsic connectivity differences or differences in tonic inhibition. These results are a useful first-step and prescribe directions for further investigation into the role of ALLO together with these differences to distinguish between models for CAE-remitting and non-remitting individuals.",

    "abstract": "Calcium and Integrin-Binding Protein 2 (CIB2) is an essential subunit of the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) complex in mammalian auditory hair cells. CIB2 binds to pore-forming subunits of the MET channel, TMC1/2 and is required for their transport and/or retention at the tips of mechanosensory stereocilia. Since genetic ablation of CIB2 results in complete loss of MET currents, the exact role of CIB2 in the MET complex remains elusive. Here, we generated a new mouse strain with deafness-causing p.R186W mutation in Cib2 and recorded small but still measurable MET currents in the cochlear outer hair cells. We found that R186W variant causes increase of the resting open probability of MET channels, steeper MET current dependence on hair bundle deflection (I-X curve), loss of fast adaptation, and increased leftward shifts of I-X curves upon hair cell depolarization. Combined with AlphaFold2 prediction that R186W disrupts one of the multiple interacting sites between CIB2 and TMC1/2, our data suggest that CIB2 mechanically constraints TMC1/2 conformations to ensure proper force sensitivity and dynamic range of the MET channels. Using a custom piezo-driven stiff probe deflecting the hair bundles in less than 10 {micro}s, we also found that R186W variant slows down the activation of MET channels. This phenomenon, however, is unlikely to be due to direct effect on MET channels, since we also observed R186W-evoked disruption of the electron-dense material at the tips of mechanotransducing stereocilia and the loss of membrane-shaping BAIAP2L2 protein from the same location. We concluded that R186W variant of CIB2 disrupts force sensitivity of the MET channels and force transmission to these channels.",

    "abstract": "Predation by mammalian carnivores can have cascading, regulatory effects across ecological communities. An understanding of predator diet can therefore provide crucial information regarding their ecology and conservation, as well as their impacts on prey populations. Using scats collected between 2019 and 2023, coupled with estimates of prey abundance from aerial surveys, we characterized lion prey-consumption and preference in Tsavo, Kenya. A lion-specific biomass model applied to prey frequencies in scats revealed that more than 85% of lion diet consisted of large ungulates weighing over 150 kg. While large ungulates were also preferred prey items in terms of their availability, we found a disproportionately high consumption and preference of lions for the endangered hirola and Grevys zebra-- species that were introduced in Tsavo as part of ex-situ conservation programs. Hirola and Grevys zebra populations have historically remained small in Tsavo despite strong recovery efforts, and our results likely indicate a disproportionate impact of lion predation on these small but crucial populations. Preferential predation, coupled with high availability of alternative prey, may trap hirola and Grevys zebra within a predator-pit. Our findings have strong implications for understanding lion diet, optimal foraging, and the potential effects predators have on endangered prey species in a landscape of critical conservation importance.",

We employ the use of residual networks and vision transformer encoders for the normal vs AMD binary classification, integrating four unique domain adaptation techniques to address domain shift issues caused by heterogeneous data distribution in different institutions. Experimental results indicate that FL strategies can achieve competitive performance similar to centralized models even though each local model has access to a portion of the training data. Notably, Adaptive Personalization FL strategy stood out in our FL evaluations, consistently delivering high performance across all tests due to its additional local model. Furthermore, the study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of simpler architectures in image classification tasks, particularly in scenarios where data privacy and decentralization are critical using both encoders. It suggests future exploration into deeper models and other FL strategies for a more nuanced understanding of these models performance.",

    "abstract": "Searching vast and rapidly growing sets of nucleotide content in data resources, such as runs in Sequence Read Archive and assemblies for whole genome shotgun sequencing projects in GenBank, is currently impractical in any reasonable amount of time or resources available to most researchers. We present Pebblescout, a tool that navigates such content by providing indexing and search capabilities. Indexing uses dense sampling of the sequences in the resource. Search finds subjects that have short sequence matches to a user query with well-defined guarantees. Reported subjects are ranked using a score that considers the informativeness of the matches. Six databases that index over 3.5 petabases were created and used to illustrate the functionality of Pebblescout. Here we show that Pebblescout provides new research opportunities and a data-driven way for finding relevant subsets of large nucleotide resources for analysis, some of which are missed when relying only on sample metadata or tools using pre-defined reference sequences. For two computationally intensive published studies, we show that Pebblescout rejects a significant number of runs analyzed without changing the conclusions of these studies and finds additional relevant runs.

    "abstract": "The identification of bleaching tolerant traits among individual corals is a major focus for many restoration and conservation initiatives but often relies on large scale or high-throughput experimental manipulations which may not be accessible to many front-line restoration practitioners. Here we evaluate a machine learning technique to generate a predictive model which estimates bleaching severity using non-destructive chlorophyll-a fluorescence photophysiological metrics measured with a low-cost and open access bio-optical tool. First, a four-week long thermal bleaching experiment was performed on 156 genotypes of Acropora palmata at a land-based restoration facility. Resulting bleaching responses (percent change in Fv/Fm or Absorbance) significantly differed across the four distinct phenotypes generated via a photophysiology-based dendrogram, indicating strong concordance between fluorescence-based photophysiological metrics and future bleaching severity. Next, these correlations were used to train and then test a Random Forest algorithm-based model using a bootstrap resampling technique. Correlation between predicted and actual bleaching responses in test corals was significant (p < 0.0001) and increased with the number of corals used in model training (Peak average R2 values of 0.42 and 0.33 for Fv/Fm and absorbance, respectively). Strong concordance between photophysiology-based phenotypes and future bleaching severity may provide a highly scalable means for assessing reef corals.",

    "abstract": "When facing challenges, vertebrates activate an evolutionarily conserved hormonal stress response that can dramatically alter behavior and physiology. Although this response can be costly, conceptual models suggest that it can also recalibrate the stress response system, priming more effective responses to future challenges. Little is known about whether this process occurs in wild animals, particularly in adulthood, and if so, how information about prior experience with stressors is encoded. One potential mechanism is hormonally-mediated changes to DNA methylation. We simulated the spikes in corticosterone that accompany an acute stress response using non-invasive dosing in female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and monitored the phenotypic effects one year later, and DNA methylation both shortly after treatment and a full year later. The year after treatment, experimental females had stronger negative feedback and initiated breeding earlier - traits that are associated with stress resilience and reproductive performance in our population - and higher baseline corticosterone. We also found that natural variation in stress-induced corticosterone predicted patterns of DNA methylation, including methylation of the MC2R gene, which encodes the adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor. Finally, corticosterone treatment causally influenced methylation on short (1-2 weeks) and long (1 year) time scales; however, many of these changes did not have clear links to functional regulation of the stress response. Taken together, our results are consistent with corticosterone-induced priming of future stress resilience, and support DNA methylation as a potential mechanism. Uncovering the mechanisms linking experience with the response to future challenges has implications for understanding the drivers of stress resilience.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEA stress response to an environmental challenge can preserve an individuals fitness and may even prime them to survive similar challenges in the future. What mechanisms underlie priming is unclear, but epigenetic alterations to stress-related genes are one possibility. We experimentally tested whether increasing corticosterone in free-living swallows had lasting phenotypic or epigenetic effects. A year after treatment, females who received corticosterone had altered stress physiology and bred earlier than control birds, traits that are associated with higher fitness. Treatment also altered DNA methylation and methylation of the MC2R gene was correlated with stress physiology. This study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that epigenetic changes are key to animals response to a changing environment.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular dysfunction has been implicated as a major contributor to Alzheimers Disease (AD) pathology, with cerebral endothelial cell (cEC) stress promoting ischemia, cerebral-blood flow impairments and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Recent evidence suggests that cardiovascular (CV)/cerebrovascular risk factors, including hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy), exacerbate AD pathology and risk. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms for this interaction remain unclear. Our lab has demonstrated that amyloid beta 40 (A{beta}40) species, and particularly A{beta}40-E22Q (vasculotropic Dutch mutant), promote death receptor 4 and 5 (DR4/DR5)-mediated apoptosis in human cECs, barrier permeability and angiogenic impairment. Previous studies show that Hhcy also induces EC dysfunction, but it remains unknown whether A{beta} and homocysteine function through common molecular mechanisms. We tested the hypotheses that Hhcy exacerbates A{beta}-induced cEC DR4/5-mediated apoptosis, barrier dysfunction, and angiogenesis defects. This study was the first to demonstrate that Hhcy specifically potentiates A{beta}40-E22Q-mediated activation of the DR4/5-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway in cECs, including DR4/5 expression, caspase 8/9/3 activation, cytochrome-c release and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, we revealed that Hhcy intensifies the deregulation of the same cEC junction proteins mediated by A{beta}, precipitating BBB permeability. Furthermore, Hhcy and A{beta}40-E22Q, impairing VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling and VEGFR2 endosomal trafficking, additively decrease cEC angiogenic capabilities. Overall, these results show that the presence of the CV risk factor Hhcy exacerbates A{beta}-induced cEC apoptosis, barrier dysfunction, and angiogenic impairment. This study reveals specific mechanisms through which amyloidosis and Hhcy jointly operate to produce brain EC dysfunction and death, highlighting new potential molecular targets against vascular pathology in comorbid AD/CAA and Hhcy conditions.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal inclusions comprised of aggregated alpha-synuclein (syn) represent a key histopathological feature of neurological disorders collectively termed \"synucleinopathies\", which includes Parkinsons disease (PD). Mutations and amplifications in the SNCA gene encoding syn cause familial forms of PD and a large body of evidence indicate a correlation between syn accumulation and disease. Decreasing syn expression is recognized as a valid target for PD therapeutics, with down-regulation of SNCA expression potentially attenuating downstream cascades of pathologic events. Honokiol (HKL) is a polyphenolic compound derived from magnolia tree bark that has demonstrated neuroprotective properties. Here, we describe potential beneficial effects of HKL on syn levels in multiple experimental models. Using human neuroglioma cells stably overexpressing syn and mouse primary neurons, we demonstrate that HKL treatment results in a significant decrease in syn expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. Our data support a mechanism whereby HKL acts by post-transcriptional modulation of SNCA rather than modulating syn protein degradation. Additionally, transcriptional profiling of mouse cortical neurons treated with HKL identified several differentially expressed genes (DEG) as potential targets to modulate SNCA expression. Overall, these data highlight a viable strategy to reduce syn levels, which represents a promising target to modify disease progression in PD and other synucleinopathies. In addition, HKL acts as a powerful tool for investigating SNCA gene modulation and its downstream effects.",

    "abstract": "The immune system plays a critical role in protecting the host against pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system, for example by altering their surface proteins or by producing enzymes that can interfere with the immune response. These evasion strategies enable pathogens to escape detection and destruction by the immune system, which allows them to establish serious infections. Thus, there is a critical need for new strategies for developing antimicrobial agents. Here, we describe a novel strategy for targeting pathogens, by labeling them with a general peptide functioning as a bacterial binder, conjugated to a protein tag recognizable by the complement system, thereby activating the immune system against the target pathogen. To that end, we screened several pathogenic bacteria to find complement-resistant bacterial strain. A selected peptide binder was crosslinked with the C3b complement protein using glutaraldehyde. We show by an ELISA assay that the resulting complex binds the C5 complement protein with high affinity. We posited that by binding C5, this complex will be capable of initiating the alternative complement downstream proteolytic cascade, thereby inducing the formation of the membrane attack complex. Using this methodology, we were able to eradicate 90% of complement-resistant E. coli bacterial cells. By showing enhancement of complement sensitivity in complement-resistant pathogens, this work demonstrates the basis for new therapeutic approach capable of targeting pathogenic bacteria and activating the immune system against them.",

The disease is associated with oral lesions in chicks and has caused significant morbidity and mortality. DS is widespread among yellow-eyed penguin chicks on mainland New Zealand yet appears to be absent from the subantarctic population. Corynebacterium spp. have previously been suspected as a causative agent yet, due to inconsistent cultures and inconclusive pathogenicity, its role in DS is unclear. Herein, we used a metatranscriptomic approach to identify potential causative agents of DS by revealing the presence and abundance of all viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa - together, the infectome. Oral and cloacal swab samples were collected from presymptomatic, symptomatic and recovered chicks along with a control group of healthy adults. Two novel viruses from the Picornaviridae were identified, one of which - yellow-eyed penguin megrivirus - was highly abundant in chicks irrespective of health status but not detected in healthy adults. Tissue from biopsied oral lesions also tested positive for the novel megrivirus upon PCR. We found no overall clustering among bacteria, protozoa and fungi communities at the genus level across samples, although Paraclostridium bifermentans was significantly more abundant in oral microbiota of symptomatic chicks compared to other groups. The detection of a novel and highly abundant megrivirus has sparked a new line of enquiry to investigate its potential association with DS.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWastewater samples possess substantial potential as a valuable resource for the isolation of bacteria with the capacity to produce protease enzymes. Gaining insights into the proteolytic capabilities of these bacteria holds considerable significance for a wide range of industrial applications. Enhancing our understanding of the microbial diversity and protease production potential within wastewater can pave the way for the creation of customized enzymatic solutions tailored specifically for industrial needs.\n\nPurposeThe purpose of this study was to isolate and identify protease-producing bacteria from wastewater samples collected at Obafemi Awolowo University Campus in Nigeria. The study involved isolating bacteria from the wastewater, identifying them, evaluating their growth on protease-supporting agar, determining their proteolytic activities, and screening bacterial colonies for protease production using skim milk agar medium.\n\nMethodsWastewater samples were aseptically collected from various locations within Obafemi Awolowo University Campus, located in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. Bacterial isolation from the wastewater was performed using the serial dilution technique. The samples were progressively diluted and plated onto nutrient agar media for bacterial growth. Skim milk agar media was specifically used to isolate protease-producing bacteria. Following the isolation, screening was conducted to identify potential protease-producing bacteria. Zonal inhibition methods were employed using skim milk agar media during the screening process. The objective was to select bacterial isolates that exhibited clear zones around their colonies, indicating protease activity. To identify the potential protease-producing bacteria, morphological and biochemical tests were conducted. These tests included observations of colonial morphology, cellular morphology, and biochemical characteristics. The Bergeys Manual was used as a reliable reference for taxonomic classification during the identification process.\n\nResultsAmong the ten bacterial colonies obtained from the wastewater samples, eight exhibited clear zones, indicating protease activity. Morphological and biochemical tests identified the protease-producing bacteria as Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Further characterization revealed that the Bacillus licheniformis isolate from Water Sample D1 (WSD1) displayed the highest protease activity. Bacillus subtilis isolates also showed significant protease production, while Pseudomonas spp. exhibited lower protease production.\n\nConclusionsWastewater samples from the OAU Campus yielded protease-producing bacteria, with Bacillus licheniformis showing the highest activity. The findings highlight the industrial potential of the isolated Bacillus licheniformis strain and emphasize the significance of utilizing wastewater as a source for obtaining bacteria with protease production capabilities. Further studies on individual strains within the Bacillus and Pseudomonas genera may lead to the discovery of strains with enhanced protease production, enabling tailored enzymatic solutions for various industrial sectors. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of protease-producing microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Human ageing is associated with metabolic dysfunction, sarcopenia and frailty that taken together reduce healthspan. For age-associated diseases and lifespan, ERK, AMPK and mTORC1 represent critical pathways, across species1-7. Here we examined the hypothesis that IL11, recently shown to regulate ERK/mTORC1, is an inflammaging factor important for healthspan. As mice age, IL11 is progressively upregulated in liver, skeletal muscle, and fat to stimulate an ERK/AMPK/mTORC1 axis of cellular, tissue- and organismal-level ageing pathologies. In old mice, deletion of Il11 or Il11ra1 protects against metabolic multi-morbidity, sarcopenia, and frailty. Administration of anti-IL11 therapy to elderly mice for six months reactivates an age-repressed program of white fat beiging, reverses metabolic dysfunction, restores muscle function, and reduces frailty. Across studies, inhibition of IL11 lowers epigenetic age, reduces telomere attrition, and preserves mitochondrial function. Towards clinical translation, we generated, humanised, and engineered a neutralising, high-affinity IL11 antibody. These studies identify IL11 as a key inflammaging factor and therapeutic target for mammalian healthspan.",

    "abstract": "The cancer-specific fusion oncoprotein SS18-SSX1 disturbs chromatin accessibility by hijacking the chromatin-remodeling BAF complex from the promoters or enhancers to the H2AK119Ub-marked polycomb-repressed chromatin regions. Relocation of the BAF complex was achieved through selective recognition of the H2AK119Ub nucleosomes by the synovial sarcoma X breakpoint 1 protein SSX1, which neither has a ubiquitin (Ub)-binding domain nor binds to free Ub. To elucidate the mechanism by which SSX1 selectively recognizes H2AK119Ub nucleosomes, here we report the cryo-EM structure of SSX1 bound to H2AK119Ub nucleosomes at a resolution of 3.1 [A]. The structure reveals that the SSX1 N-terminal basic region (residues W164, R167, L168, R169) is anchored to the H2A/H2B acidic patch, while the aromatic amino acid (residue Y177) in the middle of SSX1 interacts with the hydrophobic pocket formed by the H2A 2 and 3 helixes. Ub recognition by SSX1 is unique and depends on a cryptic basic groove formed by H3 (residues R49, R52, K56) and the Ub motif (residues R42, R72, R74) on the H2AK119 site. Our results describe a novel mode of site-specific ubiquitinated nucleosome recognition that underlies the specific hijacking of the BAF complex to polycomb regions by SS18-SSX1 in synovial sarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) can target and stimulate recombination reactions in genomic DNA. We have reported that gamma ({gamma})-PNA oligomers possessing the diethylene glycol {gamma}-substituent show improved efficacy over unmodified PNAs in stimulating recombination-induced gene modification. However, this structural modification poses a challenge because of the inherent racemization risk in O-alkylation of the precursory serine side chain. To circumvent this risk and improve {gamma}PNA accessibility, we explore the utility of {gamma}PNA oligomers possessing the hydroxymethyl-{gamma} moiety for gene editing applications. We demonstrate that a {gamma}PNA oligomer possessing the hydroxymethyl modification, despite weaker preorganization, retains the ability to form a hybrid with the double-stranded DNA target of comparable stability and with higher affinity to that of the diethylene glycol-{gamma}PNA. When formulated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, the hydroxymethyl-{gamma}PNA stimulates higher frequencies ([&ge;] 1.5-fold) of gene modification than the diethylene glycol {gamma}PNA in mouse bone marrow cells.",

    "abstract": "Several species of sacoglossan sea slugs possess the incredible ability to sequester chloroplasts from the algae they consume. These  photosynthetic animals incorporate stolen chloroplasts, called kleptoplasts, into the epithelial cells of tubules that extend from their digestive tracts throughout their bodies. The mechanism by which these slugs maintain functioning kleptoplasts in the absence of an algal nuclear genome is unknown. Here, we report a draft genome of the saccoglossan slug Elysia crispata morphotype clarki, a morphotype native to the Florida Keys that can retain photosynthetically active kleptoplasts for several months without feeding. We used a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads and Illumina short reads to produce a 786 Mbp assembly containing 68,514 predicted protein-coding genes. A phylogenetic analysis found no evidence of horizontal acquisition of genes from algae. We performed gene family and gene expression analyses to identify E. crispata genes unique to kleptoplast-containing slugs that were more highly expressed in fed versus unfed developmental life stages. Consistent with analyses in other kleptoplastic slugs, our investigation suggests that genes encoding lectin carbohydrate-binding proteins and those involved in regulation of reactive oxygen species and immunity may play a role in kleptoplast retention. Lastly, we identified four polyketide synthase genes that could potentially encode proteins producing UV- and oxidation-blocking compounds in slug cell membranes. The genome of E. crispata is a quality resource that provides potential targets for functional analyses and enables further investigation into the evolution and mechanisms of kleptoplasty in animals.",

    "abstract": "Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses are currently unclear given the reductionist behavior elicited by most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. To investigate defensive ethograms more thoroughly, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6J mice to a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm that pairs footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared the paired SCS-footshock group with control groups that either received randomly presented SCS and footshock presentations (unpaired) or received only footshocks during conditioning (shock-only). After conditioning, only the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive flight responses comprised of jumping and darting behavior during the WN period. The unpaired group expressed no cue-induced freezing and significantly less freezing overall. Furthermore, the unpaired group reduced freezing but rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, only the paired group decreased tone-induced freezing. During WN, the paired group rapidly transitioned from escape jumping to freezing and darting. Comparatively, the unpaired and shock-only groups displayed stress-induced tail rattling to SCS, eschewing freezing and jumping. These findings demonstrate that while non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, associative pairings are required for robust cue-induced freezing and flight expression.",

    "abstract": "Glycan microarrays of sequence-defined glycans are the most widely used approach for high-throughput studies of interactions of glycans with glycan binding proteins. Currently nitrocellulose (NC) coated or N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) functionalized glass slides are the two most commonly used surfaces for immobilizing glycan probes as noncovalent and covalent arrays, respectively. The mode of glycan presentation can have an influence on the microarray readouts and is an important consideration in the glycan recognition knowledgebase. Here we present the development of glycan probes, tagged with a novel type of tri-functional Fmoc-amino-azido (FAA) linker, which can be readily converted into lipid-tagged or amino-terminating glycan probes for generating neoglycolipid (NGL)-based noncovalent arrays as well as covalent arrays. The azido functionality in the FAA glycan probes provides a means to  light up the glycans via biorthogonal  Click chemistry so that they become  scanner-readable on the covalent arrays, which represents an advance in array quality control. Here analyses were carried out with a diverse set of 36 glycan binding proteins (GBPs) to compare the performance of 44 glycans presented in a liposomal formulation as noncovalent arrays on NC coated slides and on two types of NHS slides as covalent arrays. With most of anti-glycan antibodies and plant lectins investigated, there were negligible or subtle differences in the binding detected in different arrays. However, there were some striking differences observed between the covalent and noncovalent arrays. These include binding of Lotus Tetragonolobus Lectin (LTL) on the covalent but not the noncovalent arrays, and a clear preference observed for glycans on the noncovalent array in the binding of adhesins (VP1 proteins) of two human polyomaviruses JCPyV and BKPyV, and the human immune lectins Siglecs 7 and 9. Subtle yet significant differences in the binding to low affinity glycan ligands were also observed with three bacterial toxins in different arrays. These results revealed interesting insights into the binding behaviour of different GBPs on the noncovalent and covalent arrays and highlight the importance to consider different array platforms in elucidating glycan mediated interactions. The FAA glycan probes can be readily rendered fluorescent via  Click chemistry in solution, enabling the detection of GBPs at the surface of cells.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=149 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/548266v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f2a49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1212409org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c4ea39org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ed6a88_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG A new trifunctional linker can present glycans on different array surfaces for analyses of soluble glycan binding proteins or as fluorescent probes for binding by proteins at the surface of cells.",

    "abstract": "Sea lice infestation is one of the major fish health problems during the grow-out phase in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture. In this study, we integrated different genomic approaches, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), genotype imputation and meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with sea lice count in Atlantic salmon. Different sets of trait-associated SNPs were prioritized and compared against randomly chosen markers, based on the accuracy of genomic predictions for the trait. Lice count phenotypes and dense genotypes of five breeding populations challenged against sea lice were used. Genotype imputation was applied to increase SNP density of challenged animals to WGS level. The summary statistics from GWAS of each population were then combined in a meta-analysis to increase the sample size and improve the statistical power of associations. Eight different genotyping scenarios were considered for genomic prediction: 70K_array: 70K standard genotyping panel; 70K_priori: 70K SNPs with the highest p-values identified in the meta-analysis; 30K_priori: 30K SNPs with the highest p-values identified in the meta-analysis; WGS: SNPs imputed to whole-genome sequencing level; and the remaining four scenarios were the same SNP sets with a linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning filter: 70K_array_LD; 70K_priori_LD; 30K_priori_LD and WGS_LD, respectively. Genomic prediction accuracy was evaluated using a five-fold cross-validation scheme in two different populations excluding them from the meta-analysis to remove possible validation-reference bias. Results showed significant genetic variation for sea lice counting in Atlantic salmon across populations, with heritabilities ranging from 0.06 to 0.24. The meta-analysis identified several SNPs associated with sea lice resistance, mainly in Ssa03 and Ssa09 chromosomes. Genomic prediction using the GWAS-based prioritized SNPs showed higher accuracy compared to using the standard SNP array in most of scenarios, achieving up to 57% increase in accuracy. Accuracy of prioritized scenarios was higher for the 70K_priori in comparison to 30K_priori. The use of WGS data in genomic prediction presented marginal or negative accuracy gain compared to the standard SNP array. The LD-pruning filter presented no benefits, reducing accuracy in most of scenarios. Overall, our study demonstrated the potential of prioritized of imputed sequence variants from multi-population GWAS meta-analysis to improve prediction accuracy for sea lice count in Atlantic salmon. The findings suggest that incorporating WGS data and prioritized SNPs from GWAS meta-analysis can accelerate the genetic progress of selection for polygenic traits in salmon aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Changes in transcriptional gene expression is a dominant mode of evolution, mostly driven by mutations at cis-regulatory regions. Mutations can affect gene expression in multiple cell types if the same cis-regulatory elements are used by different cell types. As a consequence, changes in gene expression in one cell type may be associated with similar gene expression changes in another cell type. Correlated gene expression change can explain correlated character evolution, as for instance the correlation between placental invasion and vulnerability to cancer malignancy. Here we test this hypothesis using a comparative and an experimental data set. Specifically, we investigate gene expression in dermal skin fibroblasts (SF) and uterine endometrial stomal fibroblasts (ESF). The comparative dataset consists of transcriptomes from cultured SF and ESF from 9 mammalian species. We calculated the independent phylogenetic contrasts (PIC) for each gene and cell type. We find that evolutionary changes in gene expression in SF and ESF are highly correlated, supporting the hypothesis that the correlated gene expression changes are a prevalent feature of gene expression evolution. The experimental data set derives from a SCID mouse strain that was selected for slow cancer growth which led to substantial changes in the SF compared to wild type SCID mice. We isolated SF and ESF from wild type and evolved SCID mice and compared their gene expression profiles. We find a significant correlation between the gene expression contrasts of SF and ESF, which supports the hypothesis that gene expression variation in SF and ESF is correlated. We discuss the implications of these findings for the hypothesized correlation between placental invasiveness and vulnerability to metastatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "3D cell culture models have gained popularity in recent years as an alternative to animal and 2D cell culture models for pharmaceutical testing and disease modeling. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a cost-effective and accessible molding material for 3D cultures; however, routine PDMS molding may not be appropriate for extended culture of contractile and metabolically active tissues. Failures can include loss of culture adhesion to the PDMS mold and limited culture surfaces for nutrient and waste diffusion. In this study, we evaluated PDMS molding materials and surface treatments for highly contractile and metabolically active 3D cell cultures. PDMS functionalized with polydopamine allowed for extended culture duration (14.8 {+/-} 3.97 days) when compared to polyethylamine/glutaraldehyde functionalization (6.94 {+/-} 2.74 days); Additionally, porous PDMS extended culture duration (16.7 {+/-} 3.51 days) compared to smooth PDMS (6.33 {+/-} 2.05 days) after treatment with TGF-{beta}2 to increase culture contraction. Porous PDMS additionally allowed for large (13 mm tall x 8 mm diameter) constructs to be fed by diffusion through the mold, resulting in increased cell density (0.0210 {+/-} 0.0049 mean nuclear fraction) compared to controls (0.0045 {+/-} 0.0016 mean nuclear fraction). As a practical demonstration of the flexibility of porous PDMS, we engineered a vascular bioartificial muscle model (VBAM) and demonstrated extended culture of VBAMs anchored with porous PDMS posts. Using this model, we assessed the effect of feeding frequency on VBAM cellularity. Feeding 3x/week significantly increased nuclear fraction at multiple tissue depths relative to 2x/day. VBAM maturation was similarly improved in 3x/week feeding as measured by nuclear alignment (23.49{degrees} {+/-} 3.644) and nuclear aspect ratio (2.274 {+/-} 0.0643) relative to 2x/day (35.93{degrees} {+/-} 2.942) and (1.371 {+/-} 0.1127), respectively.

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity (long term potentiation/depression (LTP/D)), is a cellular mechanism underlying learning. Two distinct types of early LTP/D (E-LTP/D), acting on very different time scales, have been observed experimentally - spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), on time scales of tens of ms; and behavioral time scale plasticity(BTSP), on time scales of seconds. BTSP is a candidate for the mechanism for rapid learning of spatial location by hippocampal place cells. Here a computational model of the induction of E-LTP/D at a spine head of a synapse of a hippocampal pyramidal neuron is developed. The single compartment model represents two interacting biochemical pathways for the activation (phosphorylation) of the kinase (CaMKII) with a phosphatase, with Ion inflow described by NMDAR, CaV1, and Na channels. The biochemical reactions are represented by a deterministic system of differential equations. This single model captures realistic responses (temporal profiles with the differing timescales) of STDP and BTSP and their asymmetries for each (STDP or BTSP) signaling protocol. The simulations detail several mechanisms underlying both STDP and BTSP, including i) the flow of Ca2+ through NMDAR vs CaV1 channels, and ii) the origin of several time scales in the activation of CaMKII. The model also realizes a priming mechanism for E-LTP that is induced by Ca2+ flow through CaV1.3 channels. Once in the spine head, this small additional Ca2+ opens the compact state of CaMKII, placing CaMKII \"in the ready\" for subsequent induction of LTP.",
