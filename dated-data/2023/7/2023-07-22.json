    "abstract": "The language network, comprised of brain regions in the left frontal and temporal cortex, responds robustly and reliably during language comprehension but shows little or no response during many non-linguistic cognitive tasks (e.g., Fedorenko & Blank, 2020). However, one domain whose relationship with language remains debated is semantics--our conceptual knowledge of the world. Given that the language network responds strongly to meaningful linguistic stimuli, could some of this response be driven by the presence of rich conceptual representations encoded in linguistic inputs? In this study, we used a naturalistic cognition paradigm to test whether the cognitive and neural resources that are responsible for language processing are also recruited for processing semantically rich non-verbal stimuli. To do so, we measured BOLD responses to a set of [~]5-minute-long video and audio clips that consisted of meaningful event sequences but did not contain any linguistic content. We then used the inter-subject correlation (ISC) approach (Hasson et al., 2004) to examine the extent to which the language network  tracks these stimuli, i.e. exhibits stimulus-related variation. Across all the regions of the language network, non-verbal meaningful stimuli elicited reliable ISCs. These ISCs were higher than the ISCs elicited by semantically impoverished non-verbal stimuli (e.g., a music clip), but substantially lower than the ISCs elicited by linguistic stimuli. Our results complement earlier findings from controlled experiments (e.g., Ivanova et al., 2021) in providing further evidence that the language network shows some sensitivity to semantic content in non-verbal stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Lipid environments can be chemically impacted by peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a reactive species generated under nitrative stress. Molecular tools used for investigating ONOO- reactivity in biological membranes remain underdeveloped, available probes lack the ability of subcellular localization, and the standard methods for detecting ONOO- in vivo are indirect. Here we investigated ONOO- in diverse lipid environments (biomimetic giant vesicles, live mammalian cells, and within the lung lining) using a biocompatible and membrane-localized phospholipid named DPPC-TC-ONOO-. This designer lipid and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine self-assemble to giant vesicles that respond to ONOO- by generating fluorescence. These vesicles remain intact after sensing ONOO- and exhibit excellent selectivity against other redox species. We delivered DPPC-TC-ONOO- into live HeLa and RAW cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Cytokine-induced nitrative stress led to enhanced fluorescence of the lipid clusters, primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum. These LNPs allowed the detection of ONOO- reactivity and nitrative stress around bronchioles within precision cut lung slices in response to acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore, the use of the LNPs allowed for the detection of pulmonary macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage following ALI in C57BL6/J but not in Nos2-/- mice. These investigations revealed significant advantages of DPPC-TC-ONOO- over its non-amphiphilic analog. Our work presents (i) an unprecedented function for biomimetic membranes, (ii) the potential of LNPs for delivering designer lipids into cells and tissues, (iii) real-time imaging of endogenous ONOO- at the organelle level in mammalian cells, and (iv) a direct method of studying nitrative stress due to ALI ex vivo and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons causes a reduced motor output from the primary motor cortex (M1), underlying the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, cellular and circuitry mechanisms of M1 dysfunction in PD remain undefined. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we found that DA degeneration induces cell-subtype- and inputs-specific reduction of thalamic excitation to M1 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Physiological and anatomical analyses suggest that DA degeneration induces a loss of thalamocortical synapses to M1 PT neurons, resulting in an impaired thalamic driving of their activities. Moreover, we showed that the decreased thalamocortical connectivity are mediated by an excessive activation of NMDA receptors of M1 PT neurons. Further, the decreased thalamocortical transmission in parkinsonism can be rescued by chemogenetically suppressing basal ganglia outputs. Together, our data suggest that the reduced motor cortical outputs in parkinsonism are not only an immediate consequence of basal ganglia inhibition but also involves specific local circuitry adaptations within M1. This study reveals novel insight in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor deficits.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is characterised at the molecular level by six transcriptional  hallmarks of ageing, that are commonly described as progressively affected as time passes. By contrast, the  Smurf assay separates high-and-constant-mortality risk individuals from healthy, zero-mortality risk individuals, based on increased intestinal permeability. Performing whole body total RNA sequencing, we found that Smurfness distinguishes transcriptional changes associated with chronological age from those associated with biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age in non-Smurf individuals preceding the other five hallmarks of ageing, that are specifically associated with the Smurf state. Using this approach, we also devise targeted pro-longevity genetic interventions delaying entry in the Smurf state. We anticipate that increased attention to the evolutionary conserved Smurf phenotype will bring about significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517330v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27685dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134d7b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3d5aa0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e995_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG The two-phase model of ageing allows to study separately the effect of chronological and physiological age.\n\n(A) Classic approaches for studying ageing tend to consider it as a black box affecting all individuals progressively from birth to death. Instead, the Smurf phenotype shows that life can be divided into two consecutive phases separated by an abrupt transition. (B) All individuals undergo this transition at a different moment in their life, prior to death. This allows us to switch from population based approaches, comparing bulks of age-matched individuals through time, to individuals-centred approaches relying on direct access to their transition status. (C) Such paradigm shift shows that hallmarks of ageing long thought to progressively change with age are actually mostly affected in a growing proportion of Smurfs, allowing for the identification of the chain of events accompanying ageing and death from natural causes. (D) By studying the behaviour of the ageing transcriptome as a function of chronological age and Smurfness separately, we demonstrate that the progressively changing transcriptional ageing signature, as described in Frenk & Houseley (2018), is in fact the convolution changes accompanying chronological age signature (increased transcriptional noise) and changes associated with Smurfness (or biological age) signature (increased stress response and inflammation, decreased expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes). We also identified a hallmark partially associated with only old Smurfs (ATH5), suggesting that chronological age can affect, late in life, the Smurf response.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Late in neural development, the expression of growth/differentiation factor (GDF) 15 increases in the germinal epithelium of the murine ganglionic eminence (GE), especially in progenitors with characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the function of GDF15 in this region is still unknown. We here show that apical progenitors in the E18 GE also express the GDF15 receptor and that ablation of GDF15 promotes proliferation and cell cycle progression of apically and subapically dividing progenitors. A similar phenotype was also observed in the adult ventricular subventricular zone (V-SVZ). At both ages, increased proliferation leads to the transient generation of more neuronal progenitors, which is compensated by cell death, and to a permanent increase in the number of ependymal cells and apical NSCs. We also found that GDF15 receptor-expressing cells display immunoreactivity for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is also involved in progenitor proliferation, and that manipulation of GDF15 affects the expression of EGFR in mutant progenitors. Moreover, our data indicate that EGFR signalling in WT and mutant progenitors relies on distinct transduction modes. However, only exposure to exogenous GDF15, but not to EGF, normalized proliferation and the number of apical progenitors, indicating that alteration in EGFR signalling is not the main mechanism by which GDF15 affects proliferation in the embryonic GE.\n\nTaken together, GDF15 directly regulates proliferation of apical progenitors in the developing GE, thereby affecting the number of total ependymal cells and NSCs in this region.",

    "abstract": "The rise of large-scale multi-species genome sequencing projects promises to shed new light on how genomes encode gene regulatory instructions. To this end, new algorithms are needed that can leverage conservation to capture regulatory elements while accounting for their evolution. Here we introduce species-aware DNA language models (LMs), which we trained on more than 800 species spanning over 500 million years of evolution. Investigating their ability to predict masked nucleotides from context, we show that DNA LMs distinguish transcription factor and RNA-binding protein motifs from background non-coding sequence. Owing to their flexibility, DNA LMs capture conserved regulatory elements over much further evolutionary distances than sequence alignment would allow. Remarkably, DNA LMs reconstruct motif instances bound in vivo better than unbound ones and account for the evolution of motif sequences and their positional constraints, showing that these models capture functional high-order sequence and evolutionary context. We further show that species-aware training yields improved sequence representations for endogenous and MPRA-based gene expression prediction, as well as motif discovery. Collectively, these results demonstrate that species-aware DNA language models are a powerful, flexible, and scalable tool to integrate information from large compendia of highly diverged genomes.",

Here by employing cell-type-specific neuronal recording and manipulation in mice trained in a choice task, we demonstrate that multiple dynamic interactions from the direct and indirect pathways control the action selection. While the direct pathway regulates the behavioral choice in a linear manner, the indirect pathway exerts a nonlinear inverted-U-shaped control over action selection, depending on the inputs and the network state. We propose a new center (direct) - surround (indirect) - context (indirect) \"Triple control\" functional model of basal ganglia, which can replicate the physiological and behavioral experimental observations that cannot be simply explained by either the traditional \"Go/No-go\" or more recent \"Co-activation\" model. These findings have important implications on understanding the basal ganglia circuitry and action selection in health and disease.\n\nIn BriefUsing behavior analysis, in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics and computational modeling in mice, Li and Jin unveiled the neuronal dynamics of basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways underlying action selection, and proposed a new \"Triple-control\" functional model of basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "Pattern forming networks have diverse roles in cell biology. Rod-shaped fission yeast cells use pattern formation to control the localization of mitotic signaling proteins and the cytokinetic ring. During interphase, the kinase Cdr2 forms membrane-bound multiprotein complexes termed nodes, which are positioned in the cell middle due in part to the node inhibitor Pom1 enriched at cell tips. Node positioning is important for timely cell cycle progression and positioning of the cytokinetic ring. Here, we combined experimental and modeling approaches to investigate pattern formation by the Pom1-Cdr2 system. We found that Cdr2 nodes accumulate near the nucleus, and Cdr2 undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling when cortical anchoring is reduced. We generated particle-based simulations based on tip inhibition, nuclear positioning, and cortical anchoring. We tested model predictions by investigating Pom1-Cdr2 localization patterns after perturbing each positioning mechanism, including in both anucleate and multinucleated cells. Experiments show that tip inhibition and cortical anchoring alone are sufficient for the assembly and positioning of nodes in the absence of the nucleus, but that the nucleus and Pom1 facilitate the formation of unexpected node patterns in multinucleated cells. These findings have implications for spatial control of cytokinesis by nodes and for spatial patterning in other biological systems.",

    "abstract": "In layer 5 of the neocortex, ACh promotes cortical output to the thalamus and brainstem by preferentially enhancing the postsynaptic excitability of pyramidal tract (PT) neurons relative to neighboring intratelencephalic (IT) neurons. Less is known about how ACh regulates the excitatory synaptic drive of IT and PT neurons. To address this question, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs) were recorded in pairs of IT and PT neurons in slices of prelimbic cortex from adult female and male mice. ACh (20 {micro}M) enhanced sEPSP amplitudes, frequencies, rise-times, and half-widths preferentially in PT neurons. These effects were blocked by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine (1 {micro}M). When challenged with pirenzepine (1 {micro}M), an antagonist selective for M1-type muscarinic receptors, ACh instead reduced sEPSP frequencies. The cholinergic increase in sEPSP amplitudes and frequencies in PT neurons was not sensitive to blockade of GABAergic receptors with gabazine (10 {micro}M) and CGP52432 (2.5 {micro}M), but was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 {micro}M), suggesting that ACh enhances action-potential-dependent excitatory synaptic transmission in PT neurons. ACh also preferentially promoted the occurrence of synchronous sEPSPs in pairs of PT neurons relative to IT-PT and IT-IT pairs. Finally, selective chemogenetic silencing of hM4Di-expressing PT, but not IT, neurons with clozapine-N-oxide (5 {micro}M) blocked cholinergic enhancement of sEPSP amplitudes and frequencies in PT neurons. These data suggest that, in addition to enhancing the postsynaptic excitability of PT neurons, M1 receptor activation promotes corticofugal output by preferentially amplifying recurrent excitation within networks of PT neurons.",

It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines (Laflamme et al., 2019) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, demonstrates that: i) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more tests, ii) yet, [~]50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and iii) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.

Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market.

    "abstract": "The gut might play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) as gastrointestinal alterations often precede the development of neuropathological changes in the brain and correlate with disease progression in animal models. The gut has an immense capacity to generate free radicals whose role in the etiopathogenesis of AD is well known; however, it remains to be clarified whether gastrointestinal redox homeostasis is associated with the development of AD. The aim was to i) examine gastrointestinal redox homeostasis in the presymptomatic and symptomatic Tg2576 mouse model of AD; ii) investigate the effects of chronic oral D-galactose previously shown to alleviate cognitive deficits and metabolic changes in animal models of AD; iii) investigate the association between gastrointestinal redox biomarkers and behavioral alterations in Tg2576 mice. Presymptomatic Tg2576 have a heightened gastrointestinal electrophilic tone reflected in increased lipid peroxidation and activity of Mn/Fe-SOD. Chronic oral D-galactose treatment was associated with detrimental effects on redox homeostasis only in the wild-type controls. In the symptomatic stage, Tg2576 mice demonstrate compensated redox disbalance characterized by normalized lipid peroxidation and increased hydrogen peroxide dissociation capacity but diminished total antioxidant reserve alleviated with chronic oral D-galactose treatment. Conversely, D-galactose reduced antioxidant capacity and increased lipid peroxidation in the controls. Total antioxidant capacity was associated with greater spatial memory, while other biomarkers had a complex relationship with exploration, nesting, and grooming. Gut redox homeostasis might be involved in the development and progression of AD pathophysiology and should be further explored in this context.",

    "abstract": "The basal breast cancer subtype is enriched for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays consistent large chromosomal deletions. Here, we characterize the evolution and maintenance of chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss in basal breast cancer. TCGA data analysis showed recurrent deletion of chr4p in basal breast cancer. Phylogenetic analysis of a unique panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancer revealed early evolution of chr4p deletion. Chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation and immune evasion. We characterized an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppressed proliferation when overexpressed and is a member of a novel PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module, and we refer to it as PGCA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames, identified chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner. Together this sheds light on the early emergence of complex aneuploid karyotypes involving chr4p and adaptive landscapes shaping breast cancer genomes.",

    "abstract": "While physiologic stress has long been known to impair mammalian reproductive capacity through hormonal dysregulation, mounting evidence now suggests that stress experienced prior to or during gestation may also negatively impact the health of future offspring. Rodent models of gestational physiologic stress can induce neurologic and behavioral phenotypes that persist for up to three generations, suggesting that stress signals can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline. Treatment with glucocorticoid stress hormones is sufficient to recapitulate the transgenerational phenotypes seen in physiologic stress models. These hormones are known to bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor, thus implicating GR-mediated signaling as a potential contributor to the transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced phenotypes. Here we demonstrate dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of GR expression in the mouse germline, showing expression in the fetal oocyte as well as the perinatal and adult spermatogonia. Functionally, we find that fetal oocytes are intrinsically buffered against changes in GR signaling, as neither genetic deletion of GR nor GR agonism with dexamethasone altered the transcriptional landscape or the progression of fetal oocytes through meiosis. In contrast, our studies revealed that the male germline is susceptible to glucocorticoid-mediated signaling, specifically by regulating RNA splicing within the spermatogonia, although this does not abrogate fertility. Together, our work suggests a sexually dimorphic function for GR in the germline, and represents an important step towards understanding the mechanisms by which stress can modulate the transmission of genetic information through the germline.",

    "abstract": "Important efforts have been made to describe the neural and cognitive features of healthy and clinical populations. However, the neural and cognitive features of socially vulnerable individuals remain largely unexplored, despite their proneness to developing neurocognitive disorders. Socially vulnerable individuals can be characterised as socially deprived, having a low socioeconomic status, suffering from chronic social stress, and exhibiting poor social adaptation. While it is known that such individuals are likely to perform worse than their peers on executive function tasks, studies on healthy but socially vulnerable groups are lacking. In the current study, we explore whether neural power and connectivity signatures can characterise executive function performance in healthy but socially vulnerable individuals, shedding light on the impairing effects that chronic stress and social disadvantages have on cognition. We measured resting-state electroencephalography and executive functioning in 38 socially vulnerable participants and 38 matched control participants. Our findings indicate that while neural power was uninformative, lower delta and theta phase synchrony are associated with worse executive function performance in all participants, whereas delta phase synchrony is higher in the socially vulnerable group compared to the control group. Finally, we found that delta phase synchrony and years of schooling are the best predictors for belonging to the socially vulnerable group. Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to chronic stress due to socioeconomic factors and a lack of education are associated with changes in slow-wave neural connectivity and executive functioning.",

    "abstract": "Light is well established for control of bond breakage, but not for control of specific bond formation in complex environments. We previously engineered diffusion-limited reactivity of SpyTag003 peptide with its protein partner SpyCatcher003 through spontaneous transamidation. This system enables precise and irreversible assembly of biological building blocks, with applications from biomaterials to vaccines. Here, we establish a system for rapid control of this amide bond formation with visible light. We have generated a caged SpyCatcher003, which allows light triggering of covalent bond formation to SpyTag003 in mammalian cells. Photocaging is achieved through site-specific incorporation of an unnatural coumarin-lysine at the reactive site of SpyCatcher003. We showed uniform specific reaction in cell lysate upon light activation. We then used the spatiotemporal precision of a 405 nm confocal laser for uncaging in seconds, probing the earliest events in mechanotransduction by talin, the key force sensor between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Reconstituting talin induced rapid biphasic extension of lamellipodia, revealing the kinetics of talin-regulated cell spreading and polarization. Thereafter we determined the hierarchy of recruitment of key components for cell adhesion. Precise control over site-specific protein reaction with visible light creates diverse opportunities for cell biology and nanoassembly.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric cell division (ACD) allows daughter cells of a polarized mother to acquire different developmental fates. In C. elegans, the Wnt/{beta}-catenin Asymmetry (W{beta}A) pathway oversees many embryonic and larval ACDs; here, a Wnt gradient induces an asymmetric distribution of Wnt signaling components within the dividing mother cell. One terminal nuclear effector of the W{beta}A pathway is the transcriptional activator SYS-1/{beta}-catenin. SYS-1 is sequentially negatively regulated during ACD; first by centrosomal regulation and subsequent proteasomal degradation and second by asymmetric activity of the {beta}-catenin \"destruction complex\" in one of the two daughter cells, which decreases SYS-1 levels in the absence of W{beta}A signaling. However, the extent to which mother cell SYS-1 influences cell fate decisions of the daughters is unknown. Here, we quantify inherited SYS-1 in the differentiating daughter cells and the role of SYS-1 inheritance in Wnt-directed ACD. Photobleaching experiments demonstrate the GFP::SYS-1 present in daughter cell nuclei is comprised of inherited and de novo translated SYS-1 pools. We used a photoconvertible DENDRA2::SYS-1, to directly observe the dynamics of inherited SYS-1. Photoconversion during mitosis reveals that SYS-1 clearance at the centrosome preferentially degrades older SYS-1, and this accumulation is regulated via dynein trafficking. Photoconversion of the EMS cell during Wnt-driven ACD shows daughter cell inheritance of mother cell SYS-1. Additionally, loss of centrosomal SYS-1 increased inherited SYS-1 and, surprisingly, loss of centrosomal SYS-1 also resulted in increased levels of de novo SYS-1 in both EMS daughter cells. Lastly, we show that daughter cell negative regulation of SYS-1 via the destruction complex member APR-1/APC is key to limit both the de novo and the inherited SYS-1 pools in both the E and the MS cells. We conclude that regulation of both inherited and newly translated SYS-1 via centrosomal processing in the mother cell and daughter cell regulation via Wnt signaling are critical to maintain sister SYS-1 asymmetry during ACD.",

Nevertheless, fundamental features are shared across vertebrate taxa, such as the presence of distinct regions including the pallium, subpallium, and olfactory structures.

Here we combine spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to generate a spatially-resolved transcriptional atlas of the cichlid fish telencephalon. We then compare cell-types and anatomical regions in the cichlid telencephalon with those in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. We uncover striking transcriptional similarities between cell populations in the fish telencephalon and subpallial, hippocampal, and cortical cell populations in tetrapods.

    "abstract": "Metagenomic long-read sequencing is gaining popularity for various applications, including pathogen detection and microbiome studies. To analyze the large data created in those studies, software tools need to taxonomically classify the sequenced molecules and estimate the relative abundances of organisms in the sequenced sample. Due to the exponential growth of reference genome databases, the current taxonomic classification methods have large computational requirements. This issue motivated us to develop a new data structure for fast and memoryefficient querying of long reads. Here we present Taxor as a new tool for long-read metagenomic classification using a hierarchical interleaved XOR filter data structure for indexing and querying large reference genome sets. Taxor implements several k-mer-based approaches such as syncmers for pseudoalignment to classify reads and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for metagenomic profiling. Our results show that Taxor outperforms competing shortand long-read tools regarding precision, while having a similar recall. Most notably, Taxor reduces the memory requirements and index size by more than 50% and is among the fastest tools regarding query times. This enables real-time metagenomics analysis with large reference databases on a small laptop in the field. Taxor is available at https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/taxor.",

    "abstract": "A rise in blood glucose is the early warning signs of underlying pancreatic cancer (PC), which could be the externalization of genetic events in PC progression. But there is still a vacancy in the field of mechanism research on pancreatic cancer-associated new-onset diabetes (PCAND). Using siRNA-mediated gene knockdown in vitro, we made MIN6 cells incubated with conditioned media from transfected PC cells, and detected its response. Immunological techniques were used to explore the interaction between sorcin and STAT3. Human cytokine array was performed to explore the inflammatory cytokines downstream of sorcin. In the present study, we have identified a PCAND driver gene SRI. In PC cells, sorcin and STAT3 form a positive feedback loop to enhance the transcription of serpin E1 and CCL5, which can impair nearby islet {beta}-cells, likely by activating the p38 pathway. In 88 biopsies, expression of sorcin was elevated in PC tissues, especially so in PCAND patient samples. Furthermore, clinical-SRI gene combination model can better distinguish PCAND from T2DM, and serpin E1 level is higher in the peripheral blood samples from PCAND than T2DM. Thus, Sorcin could be the key driver in PCAND, and figuring out sorcin-STAT3-serpin E1/CCL5 signaling axis can help us better understand the pathogenesis of PCAND and identify potential biomarkers.\n\nStatement of significanceThis study mapped out a novel sorcin-STAT3-Serpin E1/CCL5 signaling axis in pancreatic cancer cells, which explains how early pre-symptomatic pancreatic cancer may coincide with new-onset diabetes in some patients.",

Therefore, it is crucial to identify new therapeutic targets to increase their survival. This study aim was to identify the most relevant regulators of mPCa onset by performing two high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screenings. Furthermore, some of the top hits were validated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, with protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) being the best candidate. Its inhibition or depletion via CRISPR significantly reduced mPCa cell capacities in vitro. Moreover, PRMT7 ablation reduced mPCa appearance in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and mouse xenograft assays. Molecularly, PRMT7 reprograms the expression of several adhesion molecules through methylation of several transcription factors, such as FoxK1 or NR1H2, which results in primary tumor PCa cell adhesion loss and motility gain. Importantly, PRMT7 is upregulated in advanced stages of Spanish PCa tumor samples and PRMT7 pharmacological inhibition reduces the dissemination of mPCa cells. Thus, here is shown that PRMT7 is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker of mPCa.",

Publicly available data from previous transposon sequencing assays were used to identify regulators of metabolism in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. For the AraC-family regulators (AFRs) represented in this data, we posited AFR/promoter/inducer groupings. Eleven promoters were characterized for a response to their proposed inducers in P. putida, and the resultant data were used to create and test nine two-plasmid sensor systems in E. coli. Several of these were further developed into a palette of single-plasmid inducible systems. From these experiments, we observed an unreported inducer response from a previously characterized AFR, demonstrated that the addition of a P. putida transporter improved the sensor dynamics of an AFR in E. coli, and identified an uncharacterized AFR with a novel potential inducer specificity. Finally, targeted mutations in an AFR, informed by structural predictions, enabled further diversification of these inducible plasmids.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/550116v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b70d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2dec26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eab2e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@85f626_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pang et al. (2023) present novel analyses demonstrating that brain dynamics can be understood as resulting from the excitation of geometric modes, derived from the shape of the brain. Notably, they demonstrate that linear combinations of geometric modes can reconstruct patterns of fMRI data more accurately, and with fewer dimensions, than comparable connectivity-derived modes. Equipped with these results, and underpinned by neural field theory, the authors contend that the geometry of the cortical surface provides a more parsimonious explanation of brain activity than structural brain connectivity. This claim runs counter to prevailing theories of information flow in the brain, which emphasize the role of long-distance axonal projections and fasciculated white matter in relaying signals between cortical regions (Honey et al. 2009; Deco et al. 2011; Seguin et al., 2023). While we acknowledge that cortical geometry plays an important role in shaping human brain function, we feel that the presented work falls short of establishing that the brains geometry is \"a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity\" (Pang et al. 2023). Here, we provide 1) a brief critique of the papers framing and 2) evidence showing that their methodology lacks specificity to the brains orientation and shape. Ultimately, we recognize that the geometric mode approach is a powerful representational framework for brain dynamics analysis, but we also believe that there are key caveats to consider alongside the claims made in the manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Plants and their associated microbes live in complicated, changeable, and unpredictable environments. They usually interact with each other in many ways by proceeding in multi-dimensional, multi-scale and multi-level coupling manners, leading to challenges of the co-existence of randomness and determinism, or continuity and discreteness. Gaining a deeper understanding of these diverse interaction mechanisms can facilitate the development of new data mining theories and methods for complex systems, new coupled modelling for the system with different spatiotemporal scales and functional properties, or even universal theory of information and information interactions. In this study, we use a \"close-loop\" model to present a plant-microbe interaction system and describe the probable functions from the microbial natural products. Specifically, we report a rhizosphere species, Streptomyces ginsengnesis G7, which produces polyketide lydicamycins and other active metabolites. Interestingly, these distinct molecules have the potential to function both as antibiotics and herbicides for crop protection. Detailed laboratory experiments combined with comprehensive bioinformatics analysis allow us to rationalise a model for this specific plant-microbe interaction process. Our work reveals the benefits of exploring otherwise neglectable resources for the identification of novel functional molecules and provides a good reference to better understand the system biology in the complex ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The sclerotome in vertebrates comprises an embryonic population of cellular progenitors that give rise to diverse adult tissues including the axial skeleton, ribs, intervertebral discs, connective tissue, and vascular smooth muscle. In the thorax, this cell population arises in the ventromedial region of each of the segmented tissue blocks known as somites. How and when sclerotome adult tissue fates are specified and how the gene signatures that predate those fates are regulated has not been well studied. We have identified a previously unknown role for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in regulating sclerotome patterning in zebrafish. Mechanistically, CaMKII regulates the activity of parallel signaling inputs that pattern sclerotome gene expression. In one downstream arm, CaMKII regulates distribution of the established sclerotome-inductive morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh), and thus Shh-dependent sclerotome genes. In the second downstream arm, we show a previously unappreciated inductive requirement for Bmp signaling, where CaMKII activates expression of bmp4 and consequently Bmp activity. Bmp activates expression of a second subset of stereotypical sclerotome genes, while simultaneously repressing Shh-dependent markers. Our work demonstrates that CaMKII promotes parallel Bmp and Shh signaling as a mechanism to first promote global sclerotome specification, and that these pathways subsequently regionally activate and refine discrete compartmental genetic programs. Our work establishes how the earliest unique gene signatures that likely drive distinct cell behaviors and adult fates arise within the sclerotome.",

    "abstract": "Platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) plays a crucial role in the morphogenesis and differentiation of the fetal testis, but the molecular signaling involved in these processes remains unclear. Here, we use XY Pdgfra-null knock-in (KI) gonads to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Pdgfra-mediated testis cord formation and development of fetal Leydig cells (FLCs). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, a well-known mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, was significantly inhibited in XY Pdgfra KI gonads, suggesting that ERK signaling is activated downstream of PDGFRA. Using ex vivo whole-organ culture, small interfering RNA (siRNA) cell culture methods, transwell assays and a genetic mouse model to disrupt ERK signaling in gonadal cells, we found that the ERK pathway promoted testis cord formation via early growth response 1 (Egr1)-mediated cell migration and regulated the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in FLCs via activating the transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB; official name CREB1). These findings highlight the significance of PDGFRA and its downstream signaling in fetal testis morphogenesis and cellular differentiation, thus providing insights into the etiology of and potential therapeutic targets for disorders related to gonadal development.",

We demonstrated the applicability of our approach for tissue dissociation and cell analysis using three flow cytometry platforms, and by using broadly used non-species-specific cell labeling reagents.

They typically store nectar and can limit the access of pollinators to this reward, resulting in pollination specialization that can lead to speciation in both pollinator and plant lineages.\n\nDespite the ecological and evolutionary importance of nectar spurs, the cellular mechanisms involved during spur development have only been described in detail in a handful of species, primarily with respect to epidermal cells. These studies show that the mechanisms involved are taxon-specific.\n\nUsing confocal microscopy and automated 3D image analysis, we studied spur morphogenesis in Staphisagria picta (Ranunculaceae) and showed that the process is marked by an early phase of dominant cell proliferation, followed by a phase of anisotropic (directional) cell expansion.\n\nThe comparison with Aquilegia, another taxon of Ranunculaceae with spurred petals, revealed that the convergence in form between the spurs of both taxa is obtained by partially similar developmental processes. The analytical pipeline designed here is an efficient method to visualize in 3D each cell of a developing organ, paving the way for future comparative studies of organ morphogenesis in multicellular eukaryotes.\n\nHighlightA new method of 3D analysis of plant tissues at the cellular level revealed that spur morphogenesis in Staphisagria picta is marked by an early phase of dominant cell proliferation, followed by a phase of anisotropic cell expansion.

The SSCOs resembled the morphogenetic features of spine and spinal cord along the anterior-posterior axis, and showed the chondro-osteogenic and neural trajectories consistent with developmental dynamics of spine and spinal cord in gestational embryo through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

    "abstract": "Nanodiscs are nanoscale structures consisting of a lipid bilayer surrounded by membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs). They are widely used in the study of membrane proteins (MPs) because they provide a stable lipid environment. However, the precise mechanism governing MP behavior within the nanodisc remains elusive. Here, we examined the cryo-EM structures of various MPs reconstituted in nanodiscs from an electron microscopy database (EMPIAR). By analyzing the heterogeneity and interactions in the nanodiscs, we found that MPs within nanodiscs display a distinct spatial preference toward the edges of the nanodisc shells. Furthermore, we observed that MPs can establish direct, amphipathic interactions with the MSPs, promoting protein stability. These interactions may induce a rearrangement of the MSP-MSP interactions, leading to the formation of MP-MSP interactions Collectively, our study provides structural and biophysical insights into how nanodiscs contribute to MP structural behavior and stability.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEBy thoroughly examining multiple deposited datasets of membrane proteins (MPs) reconstituted in nanodiscs, we have gathered compelling evidence that MPs exhibit a clear spatial inclination toward the periphery of the nanodisc shells. Moreover, we have observed that MPs establish direct and amphipathic interactions with membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs). These interactions have the potential to induce a rearrangement of the MSP-MSP interactions, consequently forming MP-MSP interactions. Through quantitative analysis, we have successfully characterized the significant role played by these interactions in ensuring the overall stability of the proteins.",

This fasting-induced 3D genome reorganization requires inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway, a major regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of transcription by RNA Pol I, but not RNA Pol II nor Pol III, induces a similar 3D genome reorganization in fed animals, and prevents the restoration of the fed-state architecture upon restoring nutrients to fasted animals.\n\nOur work documents the first large-scale chromatin reorganization triggered by fasting and reveals that mTOR and RNA Pol I shape genome architecture in response to nutrients.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling the genetic sources of gene expression variation is essential to better understand the origins of phenotypic diversity in natural populations. Genome-wide association studies identified thousands of variants involved in gene expression variation, however, variants detected only explain part of the heritability. In fact, variants such as low-frequency and structural variants (SVs) are poorly captured in association studies. To assess the impact of these variants on gene expression variation, we explored a half-diallel panel composed of 323 hybrids originated from pairwise crosses of 26 natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates. Using short- and long-read sequencing strategies, we established an exhaustive catalog of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SVs for this panel. Combining this dataset with the transcriptomes of all hybrids, we comprehensively mapped SNPs and SVs associated with gene expression variation. While SVs impact gene expression variation, SNPs exhibit a higher effect size with an overrepresentation of low-frequency variants compared to common ones. These results reinforce the importance of dissecting the heritability of complex traits with a comprehensive catalog of genetic variants at the population level.",

    "abstract": "T-cell specificity to differentiate between self and non-self relies on T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptides presented by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Investigations into the three-dimensional (3D) structures of peptide:MHC (pMHC) complexes have provided valuable insights of MHC functions. Given the limited availability of experimental pMHC structures and considerable diversity of peptides and MHC alleles, it calls for the development of efficient and reliable computational approaches for modeling pMHC structures. Here we present an update of PANDORA and the systematic evaluation of its performance in modelling 3D structures of pMHC class II complexes (pMHC-II), which play a key role in the cancer immune response. PANDORA is a modelling software that can build low-energy models in a few minutes by restraining peptide residues inside the MHC-II binding groove. We benchmarked PANDORA on 136 experimentally determined pMHC-II structures covering 44 unique {beta} chain pairs. Our pipeline achieves a median backbone Ligand-Root Mean Squared Deviation (L-RMSD) of 0.42 [A] on the binding core and 0.88 [A] on the whole peptide for the benchmark dataset. We incorporated software improvements to make PANDORA a pan-allele framework and improved the user interface and software quality. Its computational efficiency allows enriching the wealth of pMHC binding affinity and mass spectrometry data with 3D models. These models can be used as a starting point for molecular dynamics simulations or structure-boosted deep learning algorithms to identify MHC-binding peptides.

The venom of African spitting cobras often causes permanent injury via tissue-destructive dermonecrosis at the bite site, which is ineffectively treated by current antivenoms. To address this therapeutic gap, we identified the aetiological venom toxins responsible for causing local dermonecrosis. While cytotoxic three-finger toxins were primarily responsible for causing spitting cobra cytotoxicity in cultured keratinocytes, their potentiation by phospholipases A2 toxins was essential to cause dermonecrosis in vivo. This evidence of probable toxin synergism suggests that a single toxin-family inhibiting drug could prevent local envenoming. We show that local injection with the repurposed phospholipase A2-inhibiting drug varespladib significantly prevents local tissue damage caused by several spitting cobra venoms in murine models of envenoming. Our findings therefore provide a new therapeutic strategy to more effectively prevent life-changing morbidity caused by snakebite in rural Africa.\n\nTeaserInhibiting PLA2 toxicity provides a new therapeutic strategy for treating dermonecrotic pathology of local snakebite envenoming.",

Preclinical models of ethanol consumption are instrumental for understanding how acute and repeated drinking affects PFC structure and function. Recent advances in genetically encoded sensors of neuronal activity and neuromodulator release combined with functional microscopy (multiphoton and one-photon widefield imaging) allow multimodal in-vivo PFC recordings at subcellular and cellular scales. While these methods could enable a deeper understanding of the relationship between alcohol and PFC function/dysfunction, they require animals to be head-fixed. Here, we present a method in mice for binge-like ethanol consumption during head-fixation. Male and female mice were first acclimated to ethanol by providing home cage access to 20% ethanol (v/v) for 4 or 8 days. After home cage drinking, mice consumed ethanol from a lick spout during head-fixation.

Drinking modulated activity rates in a subset of neurons on slow (minutes) and fast (seconds) time scales but the majority of neurons were unaffected. Moreover, ethanol intake did not significantly affect network level interactions in the PFC as assessed through inter-neuronal pairwise correlations.

    "abstract": "The brain exploits acoustic temporal regularities in the environment to enable prediction of the timing of future events and to optimize sensory processing and behavior. Periodic sensory inputs have been shown to entrain oscillatory brain activity. But to what extent is this entrainment mechanism instrumental to temporal prediction and under top-down control?\n\nThe current study addresses these questions by investigating whether the brain can use a cue to predict the precision of a beat, thereby exerting flexible endogenous control via neural entrainment according to the precision needed in the given sensory context. Using sound cues, we informed participants about the acoustic shape (sharp or smooth) of the upcoming target sound, thus inducing two alternative levels of predicted temporal precision: high or low. Participants were asked to detect the delay of a target sound relative to a series of preceding isochronous sounds that were physically constant across all conditions.\n\nThe results show that the information of the cue modulated the prediction of beat precision. Pre-target beta (15-25 Hz) power, as well as beta and alpha (8-12 Hz) phase locking, was enhanced if the listener predicted a target sound with a high compared to a low temporal precision. Interestingly, pre-target beta power correlated positively with behavioral performance in the delay-detection task but negatively with the variability of the perceptual center (P-center) of the sounds, demonstrating the tight relation between beta oscillations and perceptual temporal precision. This study provides new insight into the predictive processes underlying entrainment to different levels of temporal precision during beat perception and shows for the first time that these processes are in fact under top-down control.\n\nSignificance StatementNeural entrainment offers a parsimonious explanation for the temporal prediction of strictly periodic events, but most temporal regularities are quasi-isochronous. How does the brain allow for perceptual flexibility in the anticipation of the temporal precision of an auditory rhythm, and to what extent is this mechanism under top-down control? By employing human electroencephalography and auditory cues in a delay-detection task, we investigated the neural mechanisms supporting the prediction of beat precision. We found that neural entrainment via beta activity is under top-down control and enables the prediction of temporal precision. Critically, behavior was influenced by the anticipated temporal precision and correlated with beta power. These results provide evidence that beta oscillations--an important neural substrate for beat entrainment--are instrumental to the top-down prediction of beat precision.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral neurons are heterogeneous and functionally diverse, but all share the capability to switch to a pro-regenerative state after nerve injury. Despite the assumption that the injury response is similar among neuronal subtypes, functional recovery may differ. Understanding the distinct intrinsic regenerative properties between neurons may help to improve the quality of regeneration, prioritizing the growth of axon subpopulations to their targets. Here, we present a comparative analysis of regeneration across four key peripheral neuron populations: motoneurons, proprioceptors, cutaneous mechanoreceptors, and nociceptors. Using Cre/Ai9 mice that allow fluorescent labelling of neuronal subtypes, we found that nociceptors showed the greater regeeneration after a sciatic crush, followed by motoneurons, mechanoreceptors and, finally, proprioceptors. By breeding these Cre mice with Ribotag mice, we isolated specific translatomes and defined the regenerative response of these neuronal subtypes after axotomy. Only 20% of the regulated genes were common, revealing a diverse response to injury among neurons, which was also supported by the differential influence of neurotrophins among neuron subtypes. Among differentially regulated genes, we proposed MED12 as a specific regulator of the regeneration of proprioceptors. Altogether, we demonstrate that the intrinsic regenerative capacity differs between peripheral neuron subtypes, opening the door to selectively modulate these responses.",

However, it remains unknown whether the auditory processing of innate begging calls changes in seasonal songbirds from non-breeding to breeding season when hormonal neuromodulation of the auditory forebrain occurs.\n\nAn fMRI experiment was set up to expose male and female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to recordings of seasonal conspecific nestling begging calls in the breeding and non-breeding season.

    "abstract": "Seasonal animal dormancy, hibernation or diapause, is widely interpreted as a physiological response for surviving energetic challenges during the harshest times of the year. However, there are other mutually non-exclusive hypotheses to explain the timing of animal dormancy over time, that is, entry into and emergence from hibernation (i.e. dormancy phenology). Other survival advantages of dormancy that have been proposed are reduced risks of predation and competition (the \"life-history\" hypothesis), but comparative tests across animal species are not yet available. Under this hypothesis, dormancy phenology is influenced by a trade-off between the reproductive advantages of being active and the survival benefits of being in dormancy. Thus, species may emerge from dormancy when reproductive benefits occur, regardless of the environmental conditions for obtaining energy. Species may go into dormancy when these environmental conditions would allow continued activity, if there were benefits from reduced predation or competition. Within a species, males and females differ in the amount of time and energy they invest in reproduction. Thus, the trade-off between reproduction and survival may be reflected in sex differences in phenology of dormancy.\n\nUsing a phylogenetic comparative method applied to more than 20 hibernating mammalian species, we predicted that differences between the sexes in hibernation phenology should be associated with differences in reproductive investment, regardless of energetic status. Consistent with the life-history hypothesis, the sex that spent the less time in activities directly associated with reproduction (e.g. testicular maturation, gestation) or indirectly (e.g. recovery from reproductive stress) spent more time in hibernation. This was not expected if hibernation phenology were solely influenced by energetic constraints. Moreover, hibernation sometimes took place at times when the environment would allow the maintenance of a positive energy balance. We also compiled, initial evidence consistent with the life history hypothesis to explain the dormancy phenology of ectotherms (invertebrates and reptiles). Thus, dormancy during non-life-threatening periods that are unfavorable for reproduction may be more widespread than previously appreciated.",

AlphaFold Protein Structure Database and ESM Metagenomic Atlas contain hundreds of millions of structures stored in CIF and/or PDB formats. When compressed with a general-purpose utility like gzip, this translates to tens of terabytes of data which hinders the effective use of predicted structures in large-scale analyses.\n\nResultsHere, we present ProteStAr, a compressor dedicated to CIF/PDB as well as, supplementary PAE files. Its main contribution is a novel approach to predict atom coordinates on the basis of the previously analyzed atoms. This allows efficient encoding of the coordinates which are the largest component of the protein structure files. By default, the compression is lossless, though the lossy mode with a controlled maximum error of coordinates reconstruction is also present. Compared to the competing packages, i.e., BinaryCIF, Foldcomp, PDC, our approach offers superior compression ratio at established reconstruction accuracy. By the efficient use of threads at both compression and decompression stages, the algorithm takes advantage of multicore architecture of current central processing units and operates with speeds about 1 GB/s. The presence of C++ API further increases the usability of the presented method.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe source code of ProteStAr is available at https://github.com/refresh-bio/protestar.",

    "abstract": "The production of influenza vaccines in plants is achieved through transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression of viral hemagglutinins (HAs). These proteins are produced and matured through the secretory pathway of plant cells, before being trafficked to the plasma membrane where they induce formation of virus-like particles (VLPs). Production of VLPs unavoidably impacts plant cells, as do viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that are often co-expressed to increase protein yields. However, little information is available on host molecular responses to these foreign proteins. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of transcriptomic, metabolic, and signaling changes occurring in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells transiently expressing the VSR P19, or co-expressing P19 and an influenza HA. Our data identifies generic responses to Agrobacterium-mediated expression of foreign proteins, including shutdown of chloroplast gene expression, activation of oxidative stress responses, and reinforcement of the plant cell wall through lignification. Our results also indicate that P19 expression promotes salicylic acid (SA) signaling, a process apparently antagonized by co-expression of HA. As the latter induces specific signatures, with effects on lipid metabolism, lipid distribution, and oxylipin signaling, dampening of P19 responses suggests crosstalk between SA and oxylipin pathways. Consistent with the upregulation of oxidative stress-related genes and proteins, we finally show that reduction of oxidative stress damage through exogenous application of ascorbic acid improves plant biomass quality during production of VLPs.\n\nOne-sentence summaryAgrobacterium-mediated expression of influenza virus-like particles induces a unique molecular signature in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells.",

In addition to these symptoms, PD patients often suffer from non-motor co-morbidities including sleep and psychiatric disturbances, which are thought to depend on concomitant alterations of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission. A primary locus of serotonergic neurons is the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), providing brain-wide serotonergic input. Here, we identified electrophysiological and morphological parameters to classify serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the murine DRN under control conditions and in a PD model, following striatal injection of the catecholamine toxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Electrical and morphological properties of both neuronal populations were altered by 6-OHDA. In serotonergic neurons, most changes were reversed when 6-OHDA was injected in combination with desipramine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, protecting the noradrenergic terminals. Our results show that the depletion of both noradrenaline and dopamine in the 6-OHDA mouse model causes changes in the DRN neural circuitry.",

Upon induction of T cell exhaustion in response to persistent antigen, prominently in the anti-tumor immune response, many are expressed simultaneously. Key inhibitory receptors are CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG3, TIM3 and TIGIT, as investigated here. These receptors are important as central therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy. Inhibitory receptors are not constitutively expressed on the cell surface, but substantial fractions reside in intracellular vesicular structures. It remains unresolved to which extent the subcellular localization of different inhibitory receptors is distinct. Using quantitative imaging of subcellular distributions and plasma membrane insertion as complemented by proximity proteomics and a biochemical analysis of the association of the inhibitory receptors with trafficking adaptors, the subcellular distributions of the five inhibitory receptors were discrete. The distribution of CTLA-4 was most distinct with preferential association with lysosomal-derived vesicles and the sorting nexin 1/2/5/6 transport machinery. With a lack of evidence for the existence of specific vesicle subtypes to explain divergent inhibitory receptor distributions, we suggest that such distributions are driven by divergent trafficking through an overlapping joint set of vesicular structures. This extensive characterization of the subcellular localization of five inhibitory receptors in relation to each other lays the foundation for the molecular investigation of their trafficking and its therapeutic exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Wild and domestic ungulates can be infected with the same species of gastrointestinal parasitic nematodes. These parasites have a free leaving stage in the environment that contributes to the ease of transmission among different host species. In addition, gastrointestinal nematodes have developed resistance to anthelmintics which is now considered a major problem for the livestock sector. In a context where wild and domestic ungulates share the same pastures, the maintenance and circulation of resistant gastrointestinal nematodes between species have rarely been explored.\n\nIn the European Alps, domestic sheep are driven in the high-altitude summer pastures leaving in sympatry with wild ungulates for several months. In this study we investigated the nemabiome of domestic sheep and Alpine ibex, Capra ibex, in three different areas of the French Alps to evaluate the parasites circulation between the two host species. The Alpine ibex is a protected mountain ungulate that is phylogenetically related to sheep and hosts nematode species common to sheep.\n\nUsing internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) nemabiome metabarcoding, we found sheep and ibex sharing similar gastrointestinal nematodes, except for a few species, such as Marshallagia marshalli and Trichostrongylus axei. This suggests that the long-term co-occurrence of sheep and ibex on mountain pastures has promoted the exchange of gastrointestinal nematodes between the two hosts. Based on the sequencing of the isotype 1 of the beta tubulin gene, associated with benzimidazole resistance, we found resistant nematodes in all sheep farms and in all Ibex populations. Our results demonstrated that Ibex can host and shed resistant strains before transhumant sheep arrive on pastures, and then can act as a reservoir or refugia for resistant gastrointestinal nematodes. The relative role of ibex to the nemabiome and in particular to the maintenance and circulation of resistant strains in sheep remain to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced as a secondary effect of bactericidal antibiotics are hypothesized to play a role in killing bacteria. However, the role of ROS in the development of de novo resistance as a result of sublethal levels of bactericidal antibiotics has barely been investigated. Here, we report that single-gene knockout strains with reduced ROS scavenging exhibited enhanced ROS accumulation and more rapid acquisition of resistance when exposed to sublethal levels of bactericidal antibiotics. Consistent with this observation, the ROS scavenger thiourea in the medium decelerated resistance development. Thiourea downregulated the transcriptional level of error-prone DNA polymerase and DNA glycosylase MutM, which counters the incorporation and accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-HOdG) in the genome. The level of 8-HOdG significantly increased following incubation with bactericidal antibiotics but decreased after treatment with the ROS scavenger thiourea. These observations suggest that in E. coli sublethal levels of ROS stimulate de novo development of resistance, providing a mechanistic basis for hormetic responses induced by antibiotics.\n\nImportanceExposure to sublethal concentrations of antimicrobials is known to result in de novo resistance development against the specific compound. Particularly, the use of antibiotics as feed additives to enhance productivity may result in the development of drug resistance in environmental and veterinary microorganisms, which could subsequently transfer to human populations. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying de novo resistance development have not been extensively explored. In this study, we indicate the role of ROS in promoting the formation of resistance to bactericidal antibiotics and show the potential of ROS scavengers to reduce mutation rates and slow down resistance formation under long-term selection. Thus, the supplementary use of antioxidants during prolonged antibiotic administration potentially contributes to mitigating the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication in bacteria takes place on highly compacted chromosomes, where segregation, transcription, and repair must occur simultaneously. Within this dynamic environment, colocalization of sister replisomes has been observed in many bacterial species, driving the hypothesis that a physical linker may tether them together. However, replisome splitting has also been reported in many of the same species, leaving the principles behind replisome organization a long-standing puzzle. Here, by tracking the replisome {beta}-clamp subunit in live Caulobacter crescentus, we find that rapid DNA segregation can give rise to a second focus which resembles a replisome, but does not replicate DNA. Sister replisomes can remain colocalized, or split apart to travel along DNA separately upon disruption of chromosome inter-arm alignment. Furthermore, chromosome arm-specific replication-transcription conflicts differentially modify replication speed on the two arms, facilitate the decoupling of the two replisomes. With these observations, we conclude that the dynamic chromosome organization flexibly shapes the organization of sister replisomes, and we outline principles which can help to reconcile previously conflicting models of replisome architecture.",

Bacterial internalization is predominantly orchestrated by the Salmonella SPI-1 Type III secretion system (T3SS). The SPI-1 T3SS transports effectors directly through the host cell membrane and into its cytosol to trigger Salmonella uptake. Here, we demonstrate that Salmonella rapidly synthesizes SPI-1 components as they encounter potential host macrophages, priming the bacteria for host invasion. Assembly of the T3SS in the host membrane results in transient pore formation. We show that this leads to the surge of translational induction of host transcription factors, including Egr1. In macrophages, the rapid synthesis of EGR1 results in the suppression of immune response and pro-apoptotic genes.

    "abstract": "Integrator cleaves nascent RNA, triggering RNA polymerase II transcription termination, but how cleavage is regulated is poorly understood. Here we show hnRNPUL1 ensures efficient Integrator-mediated cleavage of nascent RNA downstream of snRNA genes and, in the case of U2 snRNA, binds a terminal stem-loop involved in this process. In the nucleoplasm, hnRNPUL1 binds U4 snRNA and SART3 and enables efficient reformation of the U4:U6 di-snRNP for further rounds of pre-mRNA splicing. Sustained hnRNPUL1 loss leads to reduced levels of snRNAs, defects in histone mRNA 3' end processing and loss of Cajal bodies. hnRNPUL1 binds RNA through multiple domains, including a globular central domain comprising tightly juxtaposed SPRY and dead polynucleotide kinase folds. This latter fold allows binding to 5'-monophosphorylated RNAs in a mutually exclusive manner with ATP binding and functions as an XRN2 antagonist when overexpressed. We identify a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients harbouring disruptive mutations in hnRNPUL1. SMN loss in spinal muscular atrophy and hnRNPUL1 loss both disrupt snRNP biogenesis, leading to motor neuron death, suggesting a common aetiology.",

    "abstract": "The interchromatin space in the cell nucleus contains various membrane-less nuclear bodies. Recent findings indicate that nuclear speckles, a distinct nuclear body, exhibit preferential interactions with chromatin in a ground state, potentially priming specific genes for speckle-mediated gene expression and induction. Key questions are how this preferred ground state of chromatin-nuclear speckle association is established and what are the gene regulatory roles of this layer of nuclear organization. We report that chromatin structural factors CTCF and cohesin are required for full ground association between DNA and nuclear speckles. Disruption of ground state DNA-speckle contacts via CTCF or cohesin depletion had minor effects on ground expression of speckle-associated genes, however we found strong negative effects on stimulus-dependent induction of speckle-associated genes. In contrast, disruption of the cohesin releasing factor WAPL, which stabilizes cohesin on chromatin, led to enhanced inducibility of speckle-associated genes. Thus, our findings support a role of ground state chromatin-speckle association in promoting gene inducibility. We also observed similar disruption of the chromatin-nuclear speckle association in cell lines derived from patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a congenital neurodevelopmental disease, in which cohesin pathways are involved, here revealing nuclear speckles as a new potential avenue of therapeutic inquiry. In summary, our findings uncover a novel mechanism underlying a new layer of regulation of chromatin organization and gene expression, mediated by chromatin-nuclear speckle association with relevance to human disease.",

    "abstract": "The density and distribution of regulatory information in non-coding DNA of eukaryotic genomes is largely unknown. Evolutionary analyses have estimated that [~]60% of nucleotides in intergenic regions of the D. melanogaster genome is functionally relevant. This estimate is difficult to reconcile with the commonly accepted idea that enhancers are compact regulatory elements that generally encompass less than 1 kilobase of DNA. Here, we approached this issue through a functional dissection of the regulatory region of the gene shavenbaby (svb). Most of the [~]90 kilobases of this large regulatory region is highly conserved in the genus Drosophila, though characterized enhancers occupy a small fraction of this region. By analyzing the regulation of svb in different contexts of Drosophila development, we found that the regulatory architecture that drives svb expression in the abdominal pupal epidermis is organized in a dramatically different way than the information that drives svb expression in the embryonic epidermis. While in the embryonic epidermis svb is activated by compact and dispersed enhancers, svb expression in the pupal epidermis is driven by large regions with enhancer activity, which occupy a great portion of the svb cis-regulatory DNA. We observed that other developmental genes also display a dense distribution of putative regulatory elements in their regulatory regions. Furthermore, we found that a large percentage of conserved non-coding DNA of the Drosophila genome is contained within putative regulatory DNA. These results suggest that part of the evolutionary constraint on non-coding DNA of Drosophila is explained by the density of regulatory information.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi apparatus, an essential cellular organelle, is fundamental in protein sorting and lipid metabolism. Comprising stacked, flattened sack-like structures, or cisternae, the Golgi displays distinct polarity with cis- and trans-faces that orchestrate different protein maturation and transport stages. Crucial to the Golgi integrity and organisation are the Golgi Matrix Proteins (GMPs), predominantly composed of Golgins and GRASPs. These proteins contribute to the Golgis distinctive stacked, polarised structure and ensure the appropriate localisation of resident Golgi enzymes, which are key for accurate protein processing. Even though the Golgi apparatus was unveiled over a century ago, the detailed mechanisms that control its structure remain elusive. Here, we highlight the significant prevalence of intrinsically disordered regions within GMPs across Eukarya. Intriguingly, these regions are linked to a high propensity for those proteins to form liquid-like condensates via Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS). Biomolecular condensates are crucial in organising intracellular components into membrane-less organelles, such as Lewy bodies, the Corneal lens, and the nucleolus. Our findings pave the way for future investigations into the roles of disorder and LLPS in GMPs. Moreover, they provide a framework for understanding how these proteins might shape the architecture of the Golgi apparatus and the regulatory implications of phase separation in these processes.",

Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes involve multiple regulatory pathways related to IS pathogenesis, including redox, amino acid metabolism, and cell cycle. Subsequently, DUOX2, MDM2, EGFR, MAP3K14, and TRIM46 were identified as core marker genes among the 22 DE-FRGs by lasso and SVM-RFE algorithms. The construction of the nomogram using the five marker genes had excellent diagnostic value. In addition, CIBERSORT analysis showed that changes in the immune microenvironment of IS patients might be associated with TRIM46, MDM2, and DUOX2. In addition, a total of 66 drugs targeting two characteristic FRGs were obtained. The ceRNA networks revealed complex regulatory relationships based on characteristic FRGs.

    "abstract": "While single-cell experiments provide deep cellular resolution within a single sample, some single-cell experiments are inherently more challenging than bulk experiments due to dissociation difficulties, cost, or limited tissue availability. This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell-type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses.\n\nWe evaluated BuDDIs performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples. In each experiment, BuDDI outperformed all other comparative methods and baselines. As more reference atlases are completed, BuDDI provides a path to combine these resources with bulk-profiled treatment or disease signatures to study perturbations, sex differences, or other factors at single-cell resolution.",

We demonstrate that SoPIP2;1s structure, thermodynamics, kinetics, and water transport are altered as a function of each membrane constructs ensemble properties. Notably, the realistic bilayer provides stabilization of non-functional SoPIP2;1 metastable states. Hydrophobic mismatch and lipid order parameter calculations further explain how lipid ensemble properties manipulate SoPIP2;1 behavior.

In the present study we performed statistical analyses to assess sequence correlates of polyreactivity of >600 antibodies cloned from different B cell types of healthy humans.

The most prominent identified patterns were increased number of basic amino acid residues, reduced frequency of acidic residues, increased number of aromatic and hydrophobic residues, as well as longer length of CDR L1. Importantly, our study revealed that antibodies isolated from different B cell population used distinct sequence patterns (or combinations of them) for polyreactive antigen binding. Furthermore, we combined the data from sequence analyses with molecular modeling of selected polyreactive antibodies, and demonstrate that human antibodies can use multiple pathways for achieving antigen binding promiscuity. These data reconcile some contradictions in literature regarding the determinants of antibody polyreactivity. Moreover, our study demonstrates that mechanism of polyreactivity of antibodies evolves during immune response and might be tailored to specific functional properties of different B cell compartments.

T4P are built from thousands of copies of the major pilin subunit and tipped by a complex composed of minor pilins and in some systems also the PilY1 adhesin. While the major pilins of structurally characterized T4P have lengths of up to 161 residues, the major pilin PilA of Myxococcus xanthus is unusually large with 208 residues. All major pilins have a highly conserved N-terminal domain and a highly variable C-terminal domain, and the additional residues in the M. xanthus PilA are due to a larger C-terminal domain. We solved the structure of the M. xanthus T4P (T4PMx) at a resolution of 3.0 [A] using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The T4PMx follows the structural blueprint observed in other T4P with the pilus core comprised of the extensively interacting N-terminal 1-helices while the globular domains decorate the T4P surface. The atomic model of PilA built into this map shows that the large C-terminal domain has much more extensive intersubunit contacts than major pilins in other T4P. As expected from these greater contacts, the bending and axial stiffness of the T4PMx is significantly higher than that of other T4P and supports T4P-dependent motility on surfaces of different stiffnesses. Notably, T4PMx variants with interrupted intersubunit interfaces had decreased bending stiffness and strongly reduced motility on all surfaces. These observations support an evolutionary scenario whereby the large major pilin enables the formation of a rigid T4P that expands the environmental conditions in which the T4P system functions.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is altering ecosystems in unprecedented ways and necessitates the development of strategies that model ecosystems and allow for the evaluation of environmental impacts of perturbations: including climate events, novel approaches to agronomy or ecosystem management, and impacts of bio-industry and biotechnology innovations. Mesocosms present a platform to model some of the complexity of an ecosystem, while still being controlled and reproducible enough that they can be used to ask targeted questions and systematically assess the impacts of perturbation events. Herein, we established a methodological pipeline to assess the impact of three perturbation events (hydration, nutrification, contamination) upon plant-associated microbial communities using a terrestrial mesocosm. Mesocosms were assessed over a 30-day time-course following environmental perturbations, including modeling contamination with a foreign microbe via the introduction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed and applied a suite of diagnostic and bioinformatic analyses, including digital droplet PCR, microscopy, and phylogenomic analyses to assess the impacts of a perturbation event in a system that models a terrestrial ecosystem. The resultant data show that our mesocosms are dynamic yet reproducible, and that the analysis pipeline presented here allowed for a longitudinal assessment of microbial population dynamics and abiotic soil characteristics following perturbations, as well as the fate of yeast in the soil. Notably, our data indicate that a single perturbation event can have long-lasting impact upon soil composition and underlying microbial populations. Thus, this approach can be used to ask targeted questions as well as gain insights on broader ecological trends of soil perturbation events.\n\nImportanceSoils are key to a healthy environment, but the impact of human activities and climate change upon soil microbiomes remains unclear. It is challenging to model the complexity of an ecosystem in a laboratory; however, to gain insight on how ecosystems are impacted by outside perturbations it is valuable to develop approaches that mimic an environmental system. Here, we developed a mesocosm that uses readily accessible components that come together to model a terrestrial ecosystem which is coupled with an analysis pipeline to assess how various perturbations impact the soil. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by tracking the effects of three perturbations (water, nutrition, contamination with yeast) on the soil over the course of 30 days. Our results demonstrate that these treatments can have lasting impacts on the soil. These findings and the methods presented here could be useful to other researchers assessing how ecosystems respond to perturbations.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe developed a pipeline using terrestrial mesocosms that allow for the analysis of how perturbations impact soil systems and demonstrate that it is effective for targeted detection of a microbe of interest as well as global phylogenomic observation of ecological changes due to external perturbation events.\nC_LIO_LIdigital droplet PCR was adapted to track a low abundance, non-native microbe in soil mesocosms.\nC_LIO_LITemporal sampling allowed for the longitudinal observation of soil response to a one-time perturbance.\nC_LIO_LIIntroduction of yeast and its associated growth media conferred an expansion of total biomass and increase in alpha-diversity and shifts in the beta-diversity of the soil microbiome.\nC_LIO_LITreatment with media or yeast resulted in the expansion in the relative contribution of fungal biomass and an increase in the relative abundances of Saccharomycetes and Trellomycetes, with decreases in Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Eurotomycetes\nC_LIO_LIMedia or yeast introduction also resulted in an expansion of the relative abundances of Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, and Bacteroidia, and decreases in Actinomycetia and Acidobacteria.\nC_LI",

Zmiz1 is critical for a variety of biological processes including vascular development. However, its role in the lymphatic vasculature is unknown. In this study, we utilized human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) and an inducible, lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific Zmiz1 knockout mouse model to investigate the role of Zmiz1 in LECs. Transcriptional profiling of Zmiz1-deficient HDLECs revealed downregulation of genes crucial for lymphatic vessel development. Additionally, our findings demonstrated that loss of Zmiz1 results in reduced expression of proliferation and migration genes in HDLECs and reduced proliferation and migration in vitro. We also presented evidence that Zmiz1 regulates Prox1 expression in vitro and in vivo by modulating chromatin accessibility at Prox1 regulatory regions. Furthermore, we observed that loss of Zmiz1 in mesenteric lymphatic vessels significantly reduced valve density. Collectively, our results highlight a novel role of Zmiz1 in LECs and as a transcriptional regulator of Prox1, shedding light on a previously unknown regulatory factor in lymphatic vascular biology.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is an important contributor to global food security, and further improvements are required to feed a growing human population. New functional genetics and genomics tools can help us to understand the function of different genes and to engineer beneficial changes. In this study, we used a promoter capture assay to sequence 2-kb regions upstream of all high-confidence annotated genes from 1,513 mutagenized plants from the tetraploid wheat variety Kronos. We identified 4.3 million induced mutations with an accuracy of 99.8%, resulting in a mutation density of 41.9 mutations per kb. We also remapped Kronos exome capture reads to Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.1, identified 4.7 million mutations, and predicted their effects on annotated genes. Using these predictions, we identified 59% more non-synonymous substitutions and 49% more truncation mutations than in the original study. To show the biological value of the new promoter dataset, we selected two mutations within the promoter of the VRN-A1 vernalization gene. Both mutations, located within transcription factor binding sites, significantly altered VRN-A1 expression, and one reduced the number of spikelets per spike. These publicly available sequenced mutant datasets provide rapid and inexpensive access to induced variation in the promoters and coding regions of most wheat genes. These mutations can be used to understand and modulate gene expression and phenotypes for both basic and commercial applications, where limited governmental regulations can facilitate deployment. These mutant collections, together with gene editing, provide valuable tools to accelerate functional genetic studies in this economically important crop.\n\nSignificance StatementWe sequenced 4.3 million induced mutations in the promoters and 4.7 million in the coding regions of most wheat genes.

    "abstract": "Single particle tracking is an important image analysis technique widely used in biomedical sciences to follow the movement of sub-cellular structures, which typically appear as individual particles in fluorescence microscopy images. In practice, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of fluorescence microscopy images as well as the high density and complex movement of subcellular structures pose substantial technical challenges for accurate and robust tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based single particle tracking method called Motion Transformer Tracker (MoTT). By using its attention mechanism to learn complex particle behaviors from past and hypothetical future tracklets (i.e., fragments of trajectories), MoTT estimates the matching probabilities between each live/established tracklet and its multiple hypothesis tracklets simultaneously, as well as the existence probability and position of each live tracklet. Global optimization is then used to find the overall best matching for all live tracklets. For those tracklets with high existence probabilities but missing detections due to e.g., low SNRs, MoTT utilizes its estimated particle positions to substitute for the missed detections, a strategy we refer to as relinking in this study. Experiments have confirmed that this strategy substantially alleviates the impact of missed detections and enhances the robustness of our tracking method. Overall, our method substantially outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods on the ISBI Particle Tracking Challenge datasets. It provides a powerful tool for studying the complex spatiotemporal behavior of subcellular structures. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/imzhangyd/MoTT.git.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of automation in cellular assays and cell culture presents significant opportunities to enhance the scale and throughput of imaging assays, but to do so, reliable data quality and consistency are critical. Realizing the full potential of automation will thus require the design of robust analysis pipelines that span the entire workflow in question. Here we present FocA, a deep learning tool that, in near real-time, identifies in-focus and out-of-focus images generated on a fully automated cell biology research platform, the NYSCF Global Stem Cell Array(R). The tool is trained on small patches of downsampled images to maximize computational efficiency without compromising accuracy, and optimized to make sure no sub-quality images are stored and used in downstream analyses. The tool automatically generates balanced and maximally diverse training sets to avoid bias. The resulting model correctly identifies 100% of out-of-focus and 98% of in-focus images in under 4 seconds per 96-well plate, and achieves this result even in heavily downsampled data ([~]30 times smaller than native resolution). Integrating the tool into automated workflows minimizes the need for human verification as well as the collection and usage of low-quality data. FocA thus offers a solution to ensure reliable image data hygiene and improve the efficiency of automated imaging workflows using minimal computational resources.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of cellular energetics, including lipid synthesis mediated through de novo lipogenesis, is a feature of many cancers. Here we report that acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo lipogenesis, is a key regulator of breast cancer progression and cancer cell phenotype. Mammary epithelial-specific deletion of ACC1 impaired tumour progression and decreased cancer cell proliferation in the PyMT model of breast cancer in vivo. ACC1 knockout in human breast cancer cell lines resulted in decreased cell number and altered cell and membrane morphology. Lipidomic profiling demonstrated reduced levels of acyl-carnitines (CARs) and several phospholipid (PL) classes, whilst also shifting the lipid profiles to exhibit more elongated and less saturated lipids in ACC1 knockout breast cancer cells. Palmitate rescue of ACC1 deletion phenotypes demonstrated a critical role for ACC1 driven de novo lipogenesis in breast cancer cell function. Analysis of human breast tumour-microarrays identified strong ACC1 expression at all breast cancer stages, grade and metastasis, compared to normal adjacent tissue. Together our data demonstrate a novel role for ACC1 in breast cancer progression and cancer cell function, mediated through its lipogenic role, that together with its expression profile, identify ACC1 as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\nStatement of significanceThis study investigates the impact of ACC1 deletion in breast cancer progression, revealing the importance of ACC1-derived lipids in breast cancer cell phenotypes and identifies ACC1 as a potential novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The Mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is known as a tumor suppressive pathway and genes involved in MMR are commonly mutated in hereditary colorectal or other cancer types. However, the function of MMR genes/proteins in breast cancer progression and metastasis are largely unknown. We found that MSH2, but not MLH1, is highly enriched in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) and that its protein expression is inversely correlated with overall survival time (OS). MSH2 expression is frequently elevated due to genomic amplification or gain-of-expression in BLBC, which results in increased MSH2 protein that pairs with MSH6 (collectively referred to as MutS). Genetic deletion of MSH2 or MLH1 results in a contrasting phenotype in metastasis, with MSH2-deletion leading to reduced metastasis and MLH1-deletion to enhanced liver or lung metastasis. Mechanistically, MSH2-deletion induces the expression of a panel of chemokines in BLBC via epigenetic and/or transcriptional regulation, which leads to an immune reactive tumor microenvironment (TME) and elevated immune cell infiltrations. MLH1 is not correlated with chemokine expression and/or immune cell infiltration in BLBC, but its deletion results in strong accumulation of neutrophils that are known for metastasis promotion. Our study supports the differential functions of MSH2 and MLH1 in BLBC progression and metastasis, which challenges the paradigm of the MMR pathway as a universal tumor suppressive mechanism.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhile the benefits of early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in perinatally infected infants are well documented, early ART initiation is not always possible in postnatal pediatric HIV infections, which account for the majority of pediatric HIV cases worldwide. The timing of onset of ART initiation is likely to affect the size of the latent viral reservoir established, as well as the development of adaptive immune responses, such as the generation of neutralizing antibody responses against the virus. How these parameters impact the ability of infants to control viremia and the time to viral rebound after ART interruption is unclear. To gain insight into the dynamics, we utilized mathematical models to investigate the effect of time of ART initiation via latent reservoir size and autologous virus neutralizing antibody responses in delaying viral rebound when treatment is interrupted. We used an infant nonhuman primate Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) infection model that mimics breast milk HIV transmission in human infants. Infant Rhesus macaques (RMs) were orally challenged with SHIV.C.CH505 375H dCT and either given ART at 4-7 days post-infection (early ART condition), at 2 weeks post-infection (intermediate ART condition), or at 8 weeks post-infection (late ART condition). These infants were then monitored for up to 60 months post-infection with serial viral load and immune measurements. We develop a stochastic mathematical model to investigate the joint effect of latent reservoir size, the autologous neutralizing antibody potency, and CD4+ T cell levels on the time to viral rebound and control of post-rebound viral loads. We find that the latent reservoir size is an important determinant in explaining time to viral rebound by affecting the growth rate of the virus. The presence of neutralizing antibodies also can delay rebound, but we find this effect for high potency antibody responses only.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogenic bacteria often have a narrow host range, which can vary among different isolates within a population. Here we investigated the host range of the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis (Cm). We determined the genome sequences of 40 tomato Cm isolates and screened them for pathogenicity on tomato and eggplant. Our screen revealed that out of the tested isolates, five were unable to cause disease on any of the hosts, 33 were exclusively pathogenic on tomato, and two were capable of infecting both tomato and eggplant. Through comparative genomic analyses, we identified that the five non-pathogenic isolates lacked the chp/tomA pathogenicity island, which has previously been associated with virulence in tomato. In addition, we found that the two eggplant-pathogenic isolates encode a unique allelic variant of the serine protease chpG (chpGC), an effector that is recognized in eggplant. Introduction of chpGC into a chpG inactivation mutant in the eggplant-non-pathogenic strain Cm101, failed to complement the mutant, which retained its ability to cause disease in eggplant and failed to elicit hypersensitive response (HR). Conversely, introduction of the chpG variant from Cm101 into an eggplant pathogenic isolate (CmC48), eliminated its pathogenicity on eggplant, and enabled CmC48 to elicit HR.

    "abstract": "Precision-guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT) is an extremely promising vector control intervention that can reduce and potentially eliminate the unacceptable malaria burden, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Here we explore the cost effectiveness of using this approach in Africa using mathematical modeling and economical analysis. Overall, we find that pgSIT represents a cost-effective and promising approach to A. gambiae control in The Gambia, with the potential to deliver significant economic and social benefits.\n\nSummaryPrecision-guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT) is an extremely promising vector control intervention that can reduce and potentially eliminate the unacceptable malaria burden, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. pgSIT is a safe, innovative, and highly targeted approach to mosquito control that combines the principles of the sterile insect technique (SIT) with advanced state-of-the-art technologies of genetic engineering (Akbari et al. 2023; M. Li et al. 2021; Kandul, Liu, and Akbari 2021; Kandul et al. 2019, 2022). The technique involves inundative releases of genetically sterile male mosquitoes into the environment to mate with their wild counterparts, sterilizing them in the process. After multiple releases, this method can suppress, and even eradicate pest populations without the use of chemical pesticides or other less specific agents. The use of pgSIT has the potential to be a lasting, safe, cost-effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly method to suppress a target species, acting as a chemical-free, species-specific insecticide.\n\nBefore this work is considered for field application, however, we need to have a robust, data-driven modeling framework that will accurately predict the outcome of pgSIT release scenarios for malaria control, and we need an assessment of the costs and health benefits of implementing this technology in a region in Africa. This cost assessment evaluates the economic feasibility of both capacity building and establishing the infrastructure for a pgSIT facility in The Gambia to control the deadly malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. We focused on the Upper River region (URR) for three key reasons: (1) this area is known to have the highest per capita malaria rates in The Gambia (2) this region has more comprehensive historical and current data on malaria incidence and prevalence, malaria-associated healthcare and prevention costs, and human demographic data and (3) its location could feasibly demonstrate that a single pgSIT production facility can support phased suppression on a regional scale and then upon local extinction be repurposed to support vector suppression on a country or continent-wide scale.\n\nThe pgSIT treatment of the URR ([~]2069 km2) is predicted to prevent approximately 230 deaths and over 48,000 sick days per year. This estimate is based on a model for localized extinction of A. gambiae, reaching full epidemiological impact by the third year. There are multiple ways to calculate the value of this intervention monetarily, from the value of statistical life (VSL) to quality adjusted life years (QALY), which ranges from 334 million to 784 million USD saved in the first ten years of the facility being active. Other metrics such as willingness-to-pay (WTP), estimates the willingness of locals to contribute to malaria prevention financially, and estimates based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth predict this model to save either 47 million or 551 million USD, respectively, in the first ten years of intervention. This model assumes localized extinction of A. gambiae by the second year of intervention with repeated releases to maintain extinction despite seasonal mosquito migration from beyond the treatment area. Localized extinction, however, is expected to have a year-to-year suppression effect making it easier to suppress mosquito populations with reduced sterile male releases in subsequent years. It is, therefore, likely an underestimate of the costs and benefits of pgSIT sterile male releases. In later years, the release of sterile males from this facility could be redirected to new areas to expand the suppression region. Additionally, this facility would have a significant off-season where the facility is not producing sterile male A. gambiae. This off-season could, therefore, produce sterile males to suppress A. gambiae populations in other regions with seasonal malaria during the off-season in The Gambiae. It could even be used to mass produce pgSIT sterile males for other mosquito species, such as the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, which have eggs that can be stored for many months and consequently can be stockpiled to aid in the suppression of dengue outbreaks, which are also common in the area. Initially, however, the off-season can be used to build local capacity for genetically engineered (GE) mosquitos, which would consist of training staff, optimizing procedures, and troubleshooting any issues that arose during the higher production phases.\n\nThe costs for this approach will vary as there are some unknowns and variability in the expected efficiencies of the facility, equipment, and procedures. In particular, mosquito survival rates and fecundity may vary more widely at scale and selection of the rearing equipment and protocols, and the mosquito sorting technology will dictate production levels and procedures. This variability is factored into the cost, and, therefore, a range of technologies and costs are considered. The expected start-up costs range from 8.4 to 20 million USD, which includes all necessary development, field trials, equipment, facility construction, staffing, and other establishment costs. The major upfront costs vary by facility size and capital equipment, much of which is dependent on mosquito rearing efficiencies. The annual estimated operational costs range from approximately 780,000 to 1,300,000 USD, depending on equipment selection and the size of the facility. Annually, this intervention costs a little over 3 USD per person to suppress mosquitoes in the URR and prevent malaria transmission, which is about 21-36% of a malaria prevention WTP based on current interventions or 0.7-3.3% when using the VSL or QALY metrics. WTP is ten-fold less than the predicted benefits demonstrated by other metrics but shows that this facility could be made locally sustainable long term by local funding.\n\nOverall, the estimates of the capital and operational costs associated with the production of pgSIT sterile males, and the construction and management of the production facility indicate the cost savings associated with the annual decrease in morbidity and mortality (value of life) resulting from the use of pgSIT are significantly higher than the implementation costs. These estimates suggest that pgSIT represents a cost-effective and promising approach to A. gambiae control in The Gambia, with the potential to deliver significant economic and social benefits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe previously reported a modification of the CUT&Tag method (NTU-CAT) that allows genome-wide histone modification analysis in individual preimplantation embryos. In the present study, NTU-CAT was further simplified by taking advantage of the Well-of-the-Well (WOW) system, which enables the processing of multiple embryos in a shorter time with less reagent and cell loss during the procedure (WOW-CUT&Tag, WOW-CAT).\n\nResultsWOW-CAT allowed histone modification profiling from not only a single blastocyst but also from a portion of it. WOW-CAT generated similar H3K4me3 profiles as NTU-CAT, but they were closer to the profiles produced by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, such as a valley-like trend, indicating that WOW-CAT may attenuate the bias of Tn5 transposase to cut open chromatin regions. Simultaneous WOW-CAT of two halves of single blastocysts was conducted to analyze two different histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) within the same embryo. Furthermore, trophectoderm cells were biopsied and subjected to WOW-CAT in anticipation of preimplantation diagnosis of histone modifications. WOW-CAT allowed the monitoring of epigenetic modifications in the main body of the embryo. For example, analysis of H3K4me3 modifications of XIST and DDX3Y in trophectoderm biopsies could be used to sex embryos in combination with quantitative PCR, but without the need for deep sequencing.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest the applicability of WOW-CAT for flexible epigenetic analysis of individual embryos in preimplantation epigenetic diagnosis.",
