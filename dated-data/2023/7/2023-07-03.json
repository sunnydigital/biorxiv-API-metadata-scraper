    "abstract": "We combined subcellular calcium imaging and connectomic reconstruction to understand the flow of information through a plexus of excitatory VGluT3-expressing mouse retinal amacrine cells (VG3s). We found that VG3s received inputs from all nearby bipolar cell types but exhibited a strong preference for the fast type 3a bipolar cells. We used our connectivity map and physiological recordings to predict the influence of these bipolar cells on different types of RGCs innervated by VG3s and found that the depth of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendritic arbor stratification determined the RGCs view of bipolar cells through the VG3 plexus. We also found that both VG3s and their RGC targets were often innervated by the same bipolar cells. RGCs that extend processes into the middle layers of the inner plexiform layer, therefore, encounter a plexus of small object motion selective glutamatergic excitation that is complementary to the local bipolar cell input.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to hyperexcitability and dysfunction in spinal sensory processing. As hyperexcitable circuits can become epileptiform elsewhere, we explored whether such activity emerges in spinal sensory circuits in a thoracic SCI contusion model of neuropathic pain. Recordings from spinal sensory axons in multiple below-lesion segmental dorsal roots (DRs) demonstrated that SCI facilitated the emergence of spontaneous ectopic burst spiking in afferent axons, which synchronized across multiple adjacent DRs. Burst frequency correlated with behavioral mechanosensitivity. The same bursting events were recruited by afferent stimulation, and timing interactions with ongoing spontaneous bursts revealed that recruitment was limited by a prolonged post-burst refractory period. Ectopic bursting in afferent axons was driven by GABAA receptor activation, presumably via shifting subthreshold GABAergic interneuronal presynaptic axoaxonic inhibitory actions to suprathreshold spiking. Collectively, the emergence of stereotyped bursting circuitry with hypersynchrony, sensory input activation, post-burst refractory period, and reorganization of connectivity represent defining features of epileptiform networks. Indeed, these same features were reproduced in naive animals with the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). We conclude that SCI promotes the emergence of epileptiform activity in spinal sensory networks that promotes profound corruption of sensory signaling. This corruption includes downstream actions driven by ectopic afferent bursts that propagate via reentrant central and peripheral projections and GABAergic presynaptic circuit hypoexcitability during the refractory period.",

Yet the reliability of the measures we use in cognitive neuroscience, a crucial component of this brain-behavior relationship, is often assumed but not directly tested. Here, we evaluate the reliability of different cognitive tasks on a large dataset of over 250 participants, who each completed a multi-day task battery. We show how reliability improves as a function of number of trials, and describe the convergence of the reliability curves for the different tasks, allowing us to score tasks according to their suitability for studies of individual differences.

    "abstract": "Katanin catalytic subunit A1 like 2 (KATNAL2) is a high-risk gene associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), however its impact on brain development and disease remains unclear. The present study revealed an unexpected role of KATNAL2 in regulating ependymal ciliary motion and cerebrospinal fluid flow during brain development, an important contributing factor for ASD. We discovered a distinct expression pattern of KATNAL2 in multiciliated ependymal cells of both human and mouse brains. Notably, an ASD-associated mutation of Katnal2 disrupted its molecular function and resulted in ASD-related behavioral deficits in mice. Additionally, this mutation affected the polarized organization and beating of ependymal cilia, leading to delayed cerebrospinal fluid flow and sustained ventricular enlargement from the early postnatal stage. Conditional ablation of Katnal2 specifically in the ependymal cells of neonatal mice is sufficient to cause ventricular dilation, whereas no such effect was observed in adult mice. Our findings highlight the importance of ependymal motile cilia and hydrocephalus in ASD, offering insights into its pathogenesis and potential intervention.",

    "abstract": "We present ReTrace, a novel graph matching-based topological evaluation and validation method for tractography algorithms. ReTrace uses a Reeb graph whose nodes and edges capture the topology of white matter fiber bundles. We evaluate the performance of 96 algorithms from the ISMRM Tractography Challenge and the the standard algorithms implemented in DSI Studio for the population-averaged Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The existing evaluation metrics such as the f-score, bundle overlap, and bundle overreach fail to account for fiber continuity resulting in high scores even for broken fibers, branching artifacts, and mis-tracked fiber crossing. In contrast, we show that ReTrace effectively penalizes the incorrect tracking of fibers within bundles while concurrently pinpointing positions with significant deviation from the ground truth. Based on our analysis of ISMRM challenge data, we find that no single algorithm consistently outperforms others across all known white matter fiber bundles, highlighting the limitations of the current tractography methods. We also observe that deterministic tractography algorithms perform better in tracking the fundamental properties of fiber bundles, specifically merging and splitting, compared to probabilistic tractography. We compare different algorithmic approaches for a given bundle to highlight the specific characteristics that contribute to successful tracking, thus providing topological insights into the development of advanced tractography algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Information is processed by networks of neurons in the brain. On the timescale of sensory processing, those neuronal networks have relatively fixed anatomical connectivity, while functional connectivity, which defines the interactions between neurons, can vary depending on the ongoing activity of the neurons within the network. We thus hypothesized that different types of stimuli, which drive different neuronal activities in the network, could lead those networks to display stimulus-dependent functional connectivity patterns. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed electrophysiological data from the Allen Brain Observatory, which utilized Neuropixels probes to simultaneously record stimulus-evoked activity from hundreds of neurons across 6 different regions of mouse visual cortex. The recordings had single-cell resolution and high temporal fidelity, enabling us to determine fine-scale functional connectivity. Comparing the functional connectivity patterns observed when different stimuli were presented to the mice, we made several nontrivial observations. First, while the frequencies of different connectivity motifs (i.e., the patterns of connectivity between triplets of neurons) were preserved across stimuli, the identities of the neurons within those motifs changed. This means that functional connectivity dynamically changes along with the input stimulus, but does so in a way that preserves the motif frequencies. Secondly, we found that the degree to which functional modules are contained within a single brain region (as opposed to being distributed between regions) increases with increasing stimulus complexity. This suggests a mechanism for how the brain could dynamically alter its computations based on its inputs. Altogether, our work reveals unexpected stimulus-dependence to the way groups of neurons interact to process incoming sensory information.",

    "abstract": "We derive a next generation neural mass model of a population of quadratic-integrate-and-fire neurons, with slow adaptation, and conductance-based AMPAR, GABAR and nonlinear NMDAR synapses. We show that the Lorentzian ansatz assumption can be satisfied by introducing a piece-wise polynomial approximation of the nonlinear voltage-dependent magnesium block of NMDAR current. We study the dynamics of the resulting system for two example cases of excitatory cortical neurons and inhibitory striatal neurons. Bifurcation diagrams are presented comparing the different dynamical regimes as compared to the case of linear NMDAR currents, along with sample comparison simulation time series demonstrating different possible oscillatory solutions. The omission of the nonlinearity of NMDAR currents results in a shift in the range (and possible disappearance) of the constant high firing rate regime, along with a modulation in the amplitude and frequency power spectrum of oscillations. Moreover, nonlinear NMDAR action is seen to be state-dependent and can have opposite effects depending on the type of neurons involved and the level of input firing rate received. The presented model can serve as a computationally efficient building block in whole brain network models for investigating the differential modulation of different types of synapses under neuromodulatory influence or receptor specific malfunction.\n\nStatements and DeclarationsThe authors have no competing interests to declare.\n\nFundingWe acknowledge support by H2020 Research and Innovation Action grants Human Brain Project SGA3 number 945539.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with significant genetic predispositions. Among these, loss-of-function mutations of the chromatin remodeling gene SRCAP have been identified in individuals with ASD, but their pathogenic mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we established a germline mutant mouse model harboring a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the Srcap gene (Srcap+/-). The Srcap+/- mice exhibited notable impairments in social novelty, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, anxiety, and learning and memory deficits. We observed a decreased number of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons in their retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, abnormalities in dendritic structure, synaptic density, and synaptic transmission were noted in the DG of Srcap+/- mice. RNA sequencing revealed that the expression of 27 genes, implicated in ASD, was dysregulated in the Srcap haploinsufficiency mice. Among these genes, we found that Srcap haploinsufficiency resulted in decreased Satb2 expression due to diminished H2A.z-binding within the promoter region of Satb2. Remarkably, intervention through retro-orbital injection of AAV vectors expressing Satb2 in newborn Srcap+/- mice reversed autistic-like behaviors and developmental defects in the RSC and DG regions. Similarly, in adolescent Srcap+/- mice, stereotactic injection of AAV expressing Satb2 into the RSC ameliorated deficits in social novelty. Collectively, these findings highlight the crucial role of the Srcap in neurodevelopment by regulating Satb2 expression, particularly impacting the development of RSC and DG regions.",

    "abstract": "Rare early onset lower urinary tract disorders include defects of functional maturation of the bladder. Current treatments do not target the primary pathobiology of these diseases. Some have a monogenic basis, such as urofacial, or Ochoa, syndrome (UFS). Here, the bladder does not empty fully because of incomplete relaxation of its outflow tract, and subsequent urosepsis can cause kidney failure. UFS is associated with biallelic variants of HPSE2, encoding heparanase-2. This protein is detected in pelvic ganglia, autonomic relay stations that innervate the bladder and control voiding. Bladder outflow tracts of Hpse2 mutant mice display impaired neurogenic relaxation. We hypothesized that HPSE2 gene transfer soon after birth would ameliorate this defect and explored an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based approach. AAV9/HPSE2, carrying human HPSE2 driven by CAG, was administered intravenously into neonatal mice. In the third postnatal week, transgene transduction and expression were sought, and ex vivo myography was undertaken to measure bladder function. In mice administered AAV9/HPSE2, the transduced genome was detected in pelvic ganglia, where human HPSE2 was also expressed. Moreover, heparanase-2 became detectable in pelvic ganglia of treated mutant mice. On autopsy, untreated mutant mice had distended urinary bladders, consistent with bladder outflow obstruction, but AAV9/HPSE2- administered mice did not, thus resembling wild-type mice. AAV9/HPSE2 significantly ameliorated impaired neurogenic relaxation of Hpse2 mutant bladder outflow tracts. Impaired neurogenic contractility of mutant detrusor smooth muscle was also significantly ameliorated by AAV9/HPSE2. These results constitute first steps towards curing UFS, a clinically devastating genetic disease featuring a bladder autonomic neuropathy.",

Here, we show that serotonin differentially affects fear learning and communication in the extended amygdala of male and female mice. Females showed higher sensitivity to the effects of pharmacologically increasing serotonin during auditory fear conditioning, which enhanced fear memory recall in both sexes. Optogenetic stimulation of dorsal raphe terminals in the anterior dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (adBNST) during fear conditioning increased c-Fos expression in the BNST and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and enhanced fear memory recall via activation of adBNST 5-HT2C receptors in females only. Likewise, in females only, serotonin stimulation during learning enhanced adBNST-CeA high gamma (90-140Hz) synchrony and adBNST-to-CeA communication in high gamma during fear memory recall. We conclude that sex differences in the raphe-BNST-CeA circuit may increase risk of PTSD in women.",

Small GTPases are particularly potent regulators of dendritic spine formation, stability, and morphology in hippocampal neurons. Through the use of small GTPase protein profiling in mice, we identify increased levels of synaptic Rap1 in the hippocampal CA3 region in response to escalating, intermittent stress. We then demonstrate that increased Rap1 in the CA3 is sufficient in and of itself to produce stress-relevant dendritic spine and cognitive phenotypes. Further, using super-resolution imaging, we investigate how the pattern of Rap1 trafficking to synapses likely underlies its effects on the stability of select dendritic spine subtypes. These findings illuminate the involvement of aberrant Rap1 regulation in the hippocampus in contributing to the psychobiological effects of stress.",

We focused our analysis on sleep architecture and electrocorticography (ECoG) patterns based on their relevance to extracting physiological measurements during sleep. We found that circadian activity is unaltered in the mutant mice, although their sleep parameters and ECoG patterns are modified. The L7Cre;Vgatfx/fx mutant mice have decreased wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is increased. The mutant mice have an extended latency to REM sleep, which is also observed in human ataxia patients. Spectral analysis of ECoG signals revealed alterations in the power distribution across different frequency bands defining sleep. Therefore, Purkinje cell dysfunction may influence wakefulness and equilibrium of distinct sleep stages in ataxia. Our findings posit a connection between cerebellar dysfunction and disrupted sleep and underscore the importance of examining cerebellar circuit function in sleep disorders.\n\nSummary StatementUtilizing a precise genetic mouse model of ataxia, we provide insights into the cerebellums role in sleep regulation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for motor disorders-related sleep disruptions.",

Understanding the mechanisms of why such a compact nuclease is active for genome editing would facilitate its rational engineering.

The detailed mechanisms for dimer formation, PAM recognition, and sgRNA accommodation are elucidated. Leading by the structural knowledge, we extensively engineer the AsCas12f1 nuclease and its corresponding sgRNA, resulting in an evolved AsCas12f1-sgRNA combination with drastically enhanced genome editing activity in human cells.

We identified 23 myometrial cell subpopulations, including novel contractile capillary, venous capillary, immune-modulated fibroblasts, and nervous system regulatory fibroblasts.

We observed altered myometrial cell-to-cell communication as an aging hallmark associated with the loss of 25/229 signaling pathways, including those related to angiogenesis, tissue repair, contractility, immunity, and nervous system regulation. These insights may contribute to a better understanding of the complications faced by older women during pregnancy and labor.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary relationships among extinct African hominin taxa are highly debated and largely unresolved, due in part to a lack of molecular data. Even within taxa, it is not always clear, based on morphology alone, whether ranges of variation are due to sexual dimorphism versus potentially undescribed taxonomic diversity. For Paranthropus robustus, a Pleistocene hominin found only in South Africa, both phylogenetic relationships to other taxa 1,2 and the nature of intraspecific variation 3-6 are still disputed. Here we report the mass spectrometric (MS) sequencing of enamel proteomes from four ca. 2 million year (Ma) old dental specimens attributed morphologically to P. robustus, from the site of Swartkrans. The identification of AMELY-specific peptides and semi-quantitative MS data analysis enabled us to determine the biological sex of all the specimens. Our combined molecular and morphometric data also provide compelling evidence of a significant degree of variation within southern African Paranthropus, as previously suggested based on morphology alone 6. Finally, the molecular data also confirm the taxonomic placement of Paranthropus within the hominin clade. This study demonstrates the feasibility of recovering informative Early Pleistocene hominin enamel proteins from Africa. Crucially, it also shows how the analysis of these proteins can contribute to understanding whether hominin morphological variation is due to sexual dimorphism or to taxonomic differences. We anticipate that this approach can be widely applied to geologically-comparable sites within South Africa, and possibly more broadly across the continent.",

Hence, the evaluation of cell morphology is of the utmost significance for better understanding of industrial processes involving filamentous bacteria. In the present study, effect of glass beads and silica particle addition have been seen in the enhancement of lipstatin production along with alterations in the morphology. The addition of glass beads and silica particles directed the morphology of Streptomyces toxytricini KD18 towards the formation of small pellets (0.3 to 0.4mm) with dispersed mycelia as compared to the control conditions (0.04 to 2mm). A four-fold increase in lipstatin production was achieved due to mechanical stress caused by glass beads and silica particles. The addition of natural precursors, i.e., Aloe vera pulp, Hibiscus cannabinus leaves and flowers improved the production of lipstatin from 2.06 mg/ml to 6.76 mg/ml, 11.4 mg/ml and 14.09 mg/ml, respectively along with alteration in the pellet morphology in 500 ml shake flask.",

While many computational methods exist for constructing the pangenome from a bacterial genome collection, speed and scalability still remain an issue for the fast-growing genomic collections. Here, we present PanTA, a efficient method to build and analyze pangenomes of bacteria strains. We show that PanTA exhibits an unprecedented 10 times speed up and 2 times more memory efficient over the current state of the art methods. More importantly, PanTA enables the progressive pangenome construction where new samples are added into an existing pangenome without the need of rebuilding the accumulated collection from the scratch. The progressive building of pangenomes can further reduce the memory requirements by half. We demonstrate that PanTA can build the pangenome of the Escherichia coli species from the entire collection of over 28000 high quality genomes collected from the RefSeq database. Crucially, the whole analysis is performed on a modest laptop computer within two days, highlighting the scalability and practicality of PanTA.",

Studies of the location and distribution of biofilms in tonsil specimens have thus far been limited to either high-magnification methods such as electron microscopy, which enables high resolution imaging but only from a tiny tissue volume, or lower magnification techniques such as light microscopy, which allow imaging of larger specimens but with poor spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we report the use of multimodal optical mesoscopy to visualize and quantify the number and spatial distribution of gram-positive biofilms in fresh, excised paediatric tonsils. This methodology supports simultaneous imaging of both the tonsil host and biofilms in whole mounts of tissue up to 5 mm x 5 mm x 3 mm with subcellular resolution throughout. A quantitative assessment of thirty-six tonsil specimens revealed no statistically significant difference between biofilm presence on the tonsil surface and the interior of the tonsil. This new quantitative mesoscale imaging approach may prove useful in understanding the role of biofilms in tonsillar diseases and other infections.",

Frameworks like the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have begun to drive structural changes in engineering education, including new ABET accreditation focused on sustainability. The new field of conservation technology allows engineers to develop sustainability competencies and identities as conservationists and environmentalists.\n\nPurposeThis manuscript describes an assessment of student identity development in conservation and environmentalism in the GaTech4Wildlife Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) course at Georgia Tech. The course uses the principles of Human-Centered Design along with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and project-based learning to solve conservation-oriented, real-world problems and develop sustainability-minded engineers.\n\nDesign/MethodUndergraduate students participated in the course and utilizing both in-person interviews and post-course assessment, students were assessed for course themes and identities. The sample consisted of students from the College of Engineering and the College of Computing.\n\nResultsSince 2019, over 50 students have participated in this Tech4Wildlife course. Based on surveys and interviews of nearly 20 of the most recent students, students transitioned from identifying as engineers and coders with no sustainability knowledge to nearly doubling their identity measures as conservationists and environmentalists after only one semester.\n\nConclusionsTo teach the next generation of sustainability-minded engineers, interdisciplinary, project-based courses grounded in Sustainable Development Goals may offer a meaningful pathway for students to develop both technical skills and conservationist identities.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenesis of inflammatory, chronic and common skin disease Psoriasis involves immune cells, skin cells (keratinocytes) and cytokines secreted by them. Hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes are believed to be a hallmark of it. Roles of several cytokines such as TNF, IL-15, IL-17 and IL-23 in Psoriasis have been explored through mathematical/computational models as well as experimentally. However, the role of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36 is still elusive, especially in the case of General Pustular Psoriasis, a prevalent type of Psoriasis. To explore the role of that here, we construct a network embodying indirect cell-cell interactions of a few immune and skin cells mediated by IL-36 based on the existing knowledge. Further, we develop a mathematical model for the network and study the steady-state behaviour of that. Our results demonstrate that an increase in the level of IL-36 could lead to the hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes and, thus, Psoriasis. In addition, the analysis suggests that the plaque formation and progression of Psoriasis could occur via a gradual or switch-like increase in the population of keratinocytes. The switch-like increase would be due to the bistable behaviour of the network and could be used as a novel treatment strategy, as proposed and demonstrated earlier.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that subcortical structures play a role in high-level cognitive functions such as the allocation of spatial attention. While there is abundant evidence in humans for posterior alpha band oscillations being modulated by spatial attention, little is known about how subcortical regions contribute to these oscillatory modulations, particularly under varying conditions of cognitive challenge. In this study, we combined MEG and structural MRI data to investigate the role of subcortical structures in controlling the allocation of attentional resources by employing a cued spatial attention paradigm with varying levels of perceptual load. We asked whether hemispheric lateralization of volumetric measures of the thalamus and basal ganglia predicted the hemispheric modulation of alpha-band power. Lateral asymmetry of the globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus predicted attention-related modulations of posterior alpha oscillations. When the perceptual load was applied to the target and the distractor was salient caudate nucleus asymmetry predicted alpha-band modulations. Globus Pallidus was predictive of alpha-band modulations when either the target had a high load, or the distractor was salient, but not both. Finally, the asymmetry of the thalamus predicted alpha band modulation when neither component of the task was perceptually demanding. In addition to delivering new insight into the subcortical circuity controlling alpha oscillations with spatial attention, our finding might also have clinical applications. We provide a framework that could be followed for detecting how structural changes associated with neurological disorders in subcortical regions can be reflected in the modulation of oscillatory brain activity.",

Here, we found that the aPVT projects broadly to the mNAcSh and that the aPVT-mNAcSh circuit encodes positive valence, such that in vivo manipulations of the circuit modulated both innately programmed and learned behavioral responses to positively and negatively valenced stimuli, particularly in females. Further, the endogenous activity of aPVT presynaptic terminals in the mNAcSh was greater in response to positively than negatively valenced stimuli, and the probability of synaptic glutamate release from aPVT neurons in the mNAcSh was higher in females than males. In contrast, we found that the pPVT-mNAcSh circuit encodes stimulus salience regardless of valence. While pPVT-mNAcSh circuit inhibition suppressed behavioral responses in both sexes, circuit activation increased behavioral responses to stimuli only in males. Our results point to circuit-specific stimulus feature encoding by parallel PVT-mNAcSh circuits that have sex-dependent biases in organization and function.",

These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model. Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.",

    "abstract": "Kveik is the common name of yeast that has been used in traditional farmhouse brewing of western Norway for generations. Its fast fermentation, increased flocculation, temperature tolerance, and rich flavor profile have led to growing interest in recent years. Previous genetic analyses have shown that kveik forms a distinct group within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tree and placed its origins within the Beer I clade of industrial brewing yeasts, although with signs of mixed ancestry.\n\nIn this study, we revisited the phylogenetic position of kveik within the S. cerevisiae tree. We searched for traditional farm breweries in western Norway and collected ten samples of potential kveik yeast.\n\nUsing Illumina whole genome shotgun sequencing, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of kveik based on de novo genome assemblies and variant calls of our new kveik samples, along with published wild and domesticated S. cerevisiae strains. We calibrated and used sequential computational experiments at different thresholds to determine the most probable phylogenetic position of kveik yeast.\n\nPreviously sequenced kveik genotypes form a clade with our new samples clustering partially by place of origin. Our results indicate that kveik is indeed a compact clade within S. cerevisiae with significantly reduced polymorphism compared to common brewing yeasts and wild strains. Contrary to what was previously thought, our analyses support a more ancient divergence of kveik and place it closer to the root of the S. cerevisiae tree.\n\nIn conclusion, our genetic analyses suggest that kveik is a unique and ancient yeast group, distinct from other domesticated S. cerevisiae strains. Considering a possible far east origin of kveik yeast, the apparent endemism to western Norway remains as a big paradox These findings have important implications for the understanding of yeast domestication and the use of kveik in modern brewing practices.",
