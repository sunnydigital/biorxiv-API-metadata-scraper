    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCurrent agricultural practices and change are the major cause of biodiversity loss. An important change associated with the intensification of agriculture in the last 50 years is the spatial homogenization of the landscape with substantial loss of such biodiversity-rich elements as seminatural linear feature (hedgerows, field margins, grass strips, etc.). In Europe, management prescriptions serve to increase heterogeneity by the creation of these seminatural and linear features which are not being used primarily for agricultural production. However, these elements are not equal in their support for biodiversity according to their structure and composition. The aim of this study is to determine the importance of landscape heterogeneity and specifically linear features on the spatial distribution of red-legged partridges, a small game species in decline in Europe. Through GPS-monitoring of adult birds, we first assess home range size throughout the year and during the breeding season, in relation to breeding status and to linear features density (semi-natural linear vegetation and tracks-roads for human traffic). Then, we focus on habitat selection in relation to linear landscape features during the breeding period. We found that linear elements shape the use of space by red-legged partridges according to their reproductive status. Traffic routes and semi-natural features structured by both herbaceous and woody cover, negatively influenced home range size. Further, breeding birds select linear elements with herbaceous cover while non-breeders select linear elements with woody cover, underlining the different needs of birds according to their breeding status. All birds selected areas near tracks, but non-breeders seemed to avoid roads. This study shows the importance for this species of the linear components that structure the agricultural landscape. We propose recommendations to promote the presence of the red-legged partridge in this agricultural environment but also of the biodiversity in general.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide measures of genetic disruption such as tumour mutation burden (TMB) and mutation signatures are emerging as useful biomarkers to stratify patients for treatment. Clinicians commonly use cancer gene panels for tumour mutation burden estimation, and whole genome sequencing is the gold standard for mutation signature analysis. However, the accuracy and cost associated with these assays limits their utility at scale. Using in silico library simulations we demonstrate that restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) may be a cost-effective solution to improve accuracy of TMB estimation and derivation of mutation profiles when compared to a derived FDA approved cancer gene panel TMB score. Using simulated immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) trials, we show that inaccurate tumour mutation burden estimation leads to a reduction in power for deriving an optimal TMB cutoff to stratify patients for immune checkpoint blockade treatment. Additionally, prioritisation of APOBEC hypermutated tumours in these trials optimises TMB cutoff determination for breast cancer. Finally, the utility of RADseq in an experimental setting is also demonstrated, based on characterisation of an APOBEC mutation signature in an APOBEC3A transfected mouse cell line. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that RADseq has the potential to be used as a cost-effective, accurate solution for TMB estimation and mutation signature analysis by both clinicians and basic researchers.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, generation and accumulation of petabase-scale high-throughput sequencing data have resulted in ethical and technical challenges, including access to human data, and transfer, storage, and sharing of enormous amount of data. To promote data-driven research in biology, the Korean government announced that all the biological data generated from government-funded research projects should be deposited in the Korea BioData Station (K-BDS), which consists of multiple databases for individual data types. We introduce the Korean Nucleotide Archive (KoNA), a repository for nucleotide sequence data. As of July 2022, the Korean Read Archive in KoNA has collected over 477 TB of raw next generation sequencing data from several national genome projects. To ensure data quality and prepare for international alignment, a standard operating procedure (SOP) was adopted, which is similar to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. The SOP includes quality control processes for submitted data and metadata using an automated pipeline followed by manual examination. To ensure fast and stable data transfer, a high-speed transmission system called GBox is used in KoNA. Furthermore, the data uploaded to or downloaded from KoNA through GBox can be readily processed in a cloud-computing service for genomic data analysis called Bio-Express. This seamless coupling of KoNA, GBox, and Bio-Express enhances data experience including submission, access, and analysis of raw nucleotide sequences. KoNA not only satisfies the unmet needs for a national sequence repository in Korea, but also provides datasets to researchers globally and contribute to advances in genomics. KoNA is available at https://www.kobic.re.kr/kona/.",

    "abstract": "Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an invasive species that damages native aquatic ecosystems. Advances in genetic engineering have led to novel genetic biocontrol methods that have the potential to aid in the control of carp and other invasive species. Research and development of these technologies is proceeding in parallel with outreach activities which aim to inform and engage the public. Public perceptions on the ethics, economics, and policy decisions surrounding the possible application of genetic control technologies are important in decision-making processes. Here we report results from a survey of more than 1,300 adults that measures the perceptions of risks, benefits, and overall comfort with a panel of existing and proposed carp control methods. Our population sample largely agrees that carp control is an important issue that demands action. We observe trends suggesting that comfort levels with the possible future implementation of genetic biocontrol for common carp are strongly influenced by the perception of benefits compared to other methods, in particular effectiveness and environmental safety. No statistically significant correlations between comfort levels and river/lake use habits nor demographics are observed. There is a need for further research to identify how respondents from similar backgrounds come to different knowledge and attitudes on the matter.",

    "abstract": "There remains little consensus about the relationship between sex and brain structure, particularly in childhood. Moreover, few pediatric neuroimaging studies have analyzed both sex and gender as variables of interest - many of which included small sample sizes and relied on binary definitions of gender. The current study examined gender diversity with a continuous felt-gender score and categorized sex based on X and Y allele frequency in a large sample of children ages 9-11 years-old (N=7693). Then, a statistical model-building approach was employed to determine whether gender diversity and sex independently or jointly relate to brain morphology, including subcortical volume, cortical thickness, gyrification, and white matter microstructure. The model with sex, but not gender diversity, was the best-fitting model in 75% of gray matter regions and 79% of white matter regions examined. The addition of gender to the sex model explained significantly more variance than sex alone with regard to bilateral cerebellum volume, left precentral cortical thickness, as well as gyrification in the right superior frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and several regions in the left parietal lobe. For mean diffusivity in the left uncinate fasciculus, the model with sex, gender, and their interaction captured the most variance. Nonetheless, the magnitude of variance accounted for by sex was small in all cases and felt-gender score was not a significant predictor on its own for any white or gray matter regions examined. Overall, these findings demonstrate that at ages 9-11 years-old, sex accounts for a small proportion of variance in brain structure, while gender diversity is not directly associated with neurostructural diversity.\n\nHighlightsO_LISex-related variance in regional human brain structure is widespread at ages 9-11\nC_LIO_LITogether, sex and gender diversity accounted for more variance in only a few regions\nC_LIO_LIFelt-gender diversity itself was not significantly related to any outcome at ages 9-11\nC_LIO_LIEffect sizes for sex and felt-gender estimates were small\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microglia are resident immune cells of the brain that play important roles in mediating inflammatory responses in several neurological diseases via direct and indirect mechanisms. One indirect mechanism may involve extracellular vesicle (EV) release, so that the molecular cargo transported by microglia-derived EVs can have functional effects by facilitating intercellular communication. The molecular composition of microglia-derived EVs, and how microglial activation states impacts EV composition and EV-mediated effects in neuroinflammation, remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that microglia-derived EVs have unique molecular profiles that are determined by microglial activation state. Using size-exclusion chromatography to purify EVs from BV2 microglia, combined with proteomic (label-free quantitative mass spectrometry or LFQ-MS) and transcriptomic (mRNA and non-coding RNA seq) methods, we obtained comprehensive molecular profiles of microglia-derived EVs. LFQ-MS identified several classic EV proteins (tetraspanins, ESCRT machinery, and heat shock proteins), in addition to over 200 proteins not previously reported in the literature. Unique mRNA and microRNA signatures of microglia-derived EVs were also identified. After treating BV2 microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-10, or transforming growth factor beta, to mimic pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, or homeostatic states, respectively, LFQ-MS and RNA seq revealed novel state-specific proteomic and transcriptomic signatures of microglia-derived EVs. Particularly, LPS treatment had the most profound impact on proteomic and transcriptomic compositions of microglia-derived EVs. Furthermore, we found that EVs derived from LPS-activated microglia were able to induce pro-inflammatory transcriptomic changes in resting responder microglia, confirming the ability of microglia-derived EVs to relay functionally-relevant inflammatory signals. These comprehensive microglia-EV molecular datasets represent important resources for the neuroscience and glial communities, and provide novel insights into the role of microglia-derived EVs in neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Obesity increases the morbidity and mortality of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We performed a detailed analysis of transcriptomic changes in the brain and adipose tissue to examine the interactive effects between high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) and TBI in relation to central and peripheral inflammatory pathways, as well as neurological function. Adult male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks prior to experimental TBI and continuing after injury. Combined TBI and HFD resulted in additive dysfunction in the Y-Maze, novel object recognition (NOR), and Morris water maze (MWM) cognitive function tests. We also performed high-throughput transcriptomic analysis using Nanostring panels of cellular compartments in the brain and total visceral adipose tissue (VAT), followed by unsupervised clustering, principal component analysis, and IPA pathway analysis to determine shifts in gene expression programs and molecular pathway activity. Analysis of cellular populations in the cortex and hippocampus as well as in visceral adipose tissue during the chronic phase after combined TBI-HFD showed amplification of central and peripheral microglia/macrophage responses, including superadditive changes in select gene expression signatures and pathways. These data suggest that HFD-induced obesity and TBI can independently prime and support the development of altered states in brain microglia and visceral adipose tissue macrophages, including the disease-associated microglia/macrophage (DAM) phenotype observed in neurodegenerative disorders. The interaction between HFD and TBI promotes a shift toward chronic reactive microglia/macrophage transcriptomic signatures and associated pro-inflammatory disease-altered states that may, in part, underlie the exacerbation of cognitive deficits. Targeting of HFD-induced reactive cellular phenotypes, including in peripheral adipose tissue macrophages, may serve to reduce microglial maladaptive states after TBI, attenuating post-traumatic neurodegeneration and neurological dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}) directly acts on naive, effector and memory T cells to control cell fate decisions, which was shown using genetic abrogation of TGF-{beta} signaling. TGF-{beta} availability is altered by infections and cancer, however the dose-dependent effects of TGF-{beta} on memory CD8 T cell (Tmem) reactivation are still poorly defined. We examined how activation and TGF-{beta} signals interact to shape the functional outcome of Tmem reactivation. We found that TGF-{beta} could suppress cytotoxicity in a manner that was inversely proportional to the strength of the activating TCR or pro-inflammatory signals. In contrast, even high doses of TGF-{beta} had a comparatively modest effect on IFN-{gamma} expression in the context of weak and strong reactivation signals. Since CD8 Tmem may not always receive TGF-{beta} signals concurrently with reactivation, we also explored whether the temporal order of reactivation versus TGF-{beta} signals is of importance. We found that exposure to TGF-{beta} prior to as well as after an activation event were both sufficient to reduce cytotoxic effector function. Concurrent ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed that TGF-{beta} altered [~]10% of the regulatory elements induced by reactivation and also elicited transcriptional changes indicative of broadly modulated functional properties. We confirmed some changes on the protein level and found that TGF-{beta}-induced expression of CCR8 was inversely proportional to the strength of the reactivating TCR signal. Together, our data suggest that TGF-{beta} is not simply suppressing CD8 Tmem, but modifies functional and chemotactic properties in context of their reactivation signals and in a dose-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection disrupts cortical actin, which balances osmotic and mechanical forces to provide an architectural scaffold that dictates T cell morphology and migration. HIV-1 infected cells have significantly less F-actin1, lose their polarization2, have reduced velocity2,3 and directionality3,4, and lose their ability to traverse endothelial barriers2,3 and migrate in more complex dense environments3. Although HIV-1 induced morphological changes in primary and oncogenic CD4+ T cells on 2D surfaces are reported to lose their polarization4, infected cell migration in vivo show prolonged cell polarization4,5. These discrepancies arise from cell type observed, environmental complexity of the system, and the time scale of observation. Here, we unify these disparate findings with time-lapse and ultrastructural microscopy showing that HIV-1 infection of primary CD4+ T cells causes at least five progressive morphological differences as a result of virally induced cortical cytoskeleton disruption. Although PAK2 and cofilin activity altered by Nef has previously been linked to these structural changes, viral mechanisms outside of Nef likely exist. Infection with a Nef-deleted ({Delta}Nef) virus partially abrogated the dysfunctional phenotype in infected cells. Along with a recently reported lamellipodial blebbing phenotype4, we observe a fifth unreported pathological morphology distinct to HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells. These two morphologies phenocopy migrating cells which contain genetic determinants of specific T cell primary immunodeficiencies that affect the actin cytoskeleton, particularly diseases affecting the ARP2/3 complex. The branched actin nucleator ARP2/3 is an important component of the lamellipodia during migration as well as the T cell immune synapse during activation and is frequently targeted by intracellular bacteria and enveloped viruses6,7. The mechanically destabilized cellular cortex found in leukocytes from PID and following HIV-1 infection may provide context into cellular and systemic pathologies that drive similar clinical manifestations observed in primary and acquired immunodeficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Autofluorescence is an intrinsic feature of cells, caused by the natural emission of light by its cellular content, that can complicate analysis of flow cytometry data. Different cell types have different autofluorescence spectra and even within one cell type heterogeneity of autofluorescence spectra can be present, for example as a consequence of activation status or metabolic changes. By using full spectrum flow cytometry, the emission spectrum of a fluorochrome is captured by a set of detectors across a range of wavelengths, creating an unique spectrum for this fluorochrome, that is used to unmix the signal of a full stained sample into the signals of the different fluorochromes. Importantly, this technology can also be used to identify the aut-ofluorescence signal of an unstained sample, which can be used for unmixing purposes and to separate the autofluorescence signal from the fluorophore signals. However, this only works if the sample has one homogeneous autofluorescence spectrum. To analyze samples with a heterogeneous autofluorescence spectral profile, we here setup an unbiased workflow to detect all different autofluorescence spectra present in a sample to take them along as  autofluorescence signatures during the unmixing of the full stained samples. First, clusters of cells with similar autofluorescence spectra are identified by unbiased dimensional reduction and clustering. Then, unique autofluorescence clusters are determined and are used to improve the unmixing accuracy of the full stained sample. This unbiased method allows for the identification of all autofluorescence spectra present in a sample, independent of cell types and intensity of the autofluorescence spectra. Furthermore, this method is equally useful for spectral analysis of different biological samples, including tissue cell suspensions, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in vitro cultures of (primary) cells.",

    "abstract": "In patients suffering from cerebral ischemic stroke, there is an urgent need for treatments to protect brain cells. Recently, treatment strategies that induce neuronal activity have been shown to be neuroprotective. However, the biological mechanisms underlying the benefit from neuronal activation are unknown. We hypothesized that neuronal activation might trigger the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle, whereby lactate is released from astrocytes to support the energy requirements of hypoxic neurons, and this leads to the observed neuroprotection. We tested this by establishing a human cell based in vitro model of the ischemic penumbra. We found that lactate transporters are involved in the neuroprotective effect mediated by neuronal activation, that lactate exogenously administered before hypoxia correlated with neuroprotection, and that stimulation of astrocyte with consequent endogenous production of lactate resulted in neuroprotection. We presented evidence that lactate contributes to neuroprotection during hypoxia providing a potential basis for therapeutic approaches in ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "A unique and defining characteristic of the olfactory sensory circuit is its functionally organized topographic map, which requires widely dispersed olfactory sensory neurons with the same identity to converge their axons into one neuropil, a class-specific glomerulus. Understanding the process of how neuronal identity confers circuit organization is a major endeavor in the field of neurobiology due to its intricate connection to neurodegeneration and neuronal dysfunction. In the olfactory system, many aspects of circuit organization, from axon guidance to synaptic matching, are regulated by a variety of cell surface proteins (for example Robo/Slit and Toll receptors). In this paper, weve identified a novel atypical cadherin protein, Fat2 (also known as Kugelei), as a regulator of class-specific axon organization. Fat2 is expressed in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and local interneurons (LNs) within the olfactory circuits, but little to no expression is found in projection neurons (PNs). Fat2 expression levels vary in a neuronal class-specific manner and peak during pupal development. In fat2 null mutants, ORN axon terminals belonging to different ORN classes present with varying phenotypic severity with the highest fat2 expressing classes being most severely affected. In the most extreme cases, fat2 mutations lead to ORN degeneration. We then show evidence that suggests Fat2 intracellular domain is necessary for Fat2 function in ORN axon organization. Within the developmental context, Fat2 is required starting at early stages of olfactory circuit development specifically for precise axon retraction to further condense class-specific glomeruli. Weve also shown that PNs and LNs expression of Fat2 likely does not contribute to ORN organization 1. Lastly, we narrow down potential Fat2 intracellular domain interactors, APC family proteins (Adenomatous polyposis coli) and dop (Drop out), that likely orchestrate the cytoskeletal remodeling required for axon retraction during protoglomerular development. Altogether, we provide a foundational understanding of how Fat2 functions in olfactory circuit organization and implicate the critical role of axon retraction during glomerular maturation.",

Understanding the evolutionary origin of pathogens is essential to the prediction of future disease emergence and the potential of pathogens to disperse. The fungus Pyrenophora teres f. teres causes net form net blotch (NFNB), an economically significant disease of barley. In this study, we have used 104 P. teres f. teres genomes from four continents to explore the population structure and demographic history of the fungal pathogen. We showed that P. teres f. teres is structured into populations that tend to be geographically restricted to different regions. Using Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent and machine learning approaches we demonstrated that the demographic history of the pathogen correlates with the history of barley, highlighting the importance of human migration and trade in spreading the pathogen. Exploring signatures of natural selection, we identified several population-specific selective sweeps that colocalized with genomic regions enriched in putative virulence genes, and loci previously identified as determinants of virulence specificities by quantitative trait locus analyses. This reflects rapid adaptation to local hosts and environmental conditions of P. teres f. teres as it spread with barley. Our research highlights how human activities can contribute to the spread of pathogens that significantly impact the productivity of field crops.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly-hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth-- namely that highly-hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly-hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and morphology (hops are not equally effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria), and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.",

This phenotypic distribution within a single clonal complex makes CC8 an ideal clade to study the emergence of mutations important for antibiotic resistance and community spread. Gene level analysis comparing USA300 against MSSA and HA-MRSA strains have revealed key horizontally acquired genes important for its rapid spread in the community. However, efforts to define the contributions of point mutations and indels have been confounded by strong linkage disequilibrium resulting from clonal propagation. To break down this confounding effect, we combined genetic association testing with a model of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) to find candidate mutations that may have led to changes in gene regulation. First, we used a De Bruijn graph genome-wide association study (DBGWAS) to enrich mutations unique to the USA300 lineages within CC8. Next, we reconstructed the TRN by using Independent Component Analysis on 670 RNA sequencing samples from USA300 and non-USA300 CC8 strains which predicted several genes with strain-specific altered expression patterns. Examination of the regulatory region of one of the genes enriched by both approaches, isdH, revealed a 38 base pair deletion containing a Fur binding site and a conserved SNP which likely led to the altered expression levels in USA300 strains. Taken together, our results demonstrate the utility of reconstructed TRNs to address the limits of genetic approaches when studying emerging pathogenic strains.",

Necroptosis is a highly proinflammatory form of programmed necrosis due to the release of intracellular molecules called alarmins, which can act as inflammatory mediators. However, their role in necroptosis-induced skin inflammation remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that alarmin IL-33 and its receptor ST2 are essential early mediators of necroptosis-induced skin inflammation. Genetic ablation of Il-33 or St2 dramatically delays lesion development and improves survival of caspase-8EKO animals. IL-33 is highly expressed in necroptotic epidermis of caspase-8EKO mice and induces immune cell recruitment in the skin upon keratinocyte necroptosis. Impairment of the IL33-ST2 axis does not affect epidermal necroptosis but reduces the recruitment of TNF-producing infiltrating immune cells and subsequent amplification of cutaneous inflammation. Collectively, our findings highlight a pivotal role for IL-33 and ST2 in necroptosis-induced skin inflammation.\n\nTeaserInhibition of IL-33/ST2 axis alleviates necroptosis-induced skin inflammation by reducing TNF production in the dermis.",

To uncover how these stem cells switch from a pro-regenerative to pro-degenerative role we perform single-cell mRNA sequencing of human FAPs from healthy and injured muscles across a spectrum of injury. We identify multiple subpopulations with progenitor, adipogenic, or fibrogenic gene signatures. We utilize full spectrum flow cytometry to identify distinct FAP subpopulations based on highly multiplexed protein expression. We uncover that injury severity increases adipogenic commitment of FAP subpopulations and is driven by the downregulation of DLK1. Treatment of FAPs with DLK1 reduces adipogenesis, suggesting that during injury, reduced DLK1 within a subpopulation of FAPs may drive adipogenic degeneration. This work highlights how stem cells perform varied functions depending on tissue context, by dynamically regulating subpopulation fate commitment, which can be targeted improve patient outcomes after injury.",

Here we demonstrate that deficiency of I{kappa}B imposes a profound chromatin rewiring defect that impacts on DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and transcriptional regulation, stabilizing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a ground state of pluripotency while preventing them from pluripotency exit and differentiation. By engineering separation-of-function mutants of I{kappa}B with specific binding to either NF-{kappa}B or histones, we demonstrate that regulation of pluripotency state by I{kappa}B is independent of NF-{kappa}B but requires the chromatin-related I{kappa}B function.",

Enhancing chromosome instability and subsequent cancer cell death via centrosome unclustering and multipolar divisions is an aimed-for therapeutic approach. Here we show that centrosome amplification favors responses to conventional chemotherapy independently of multipolar divisions and chromosome instability. We perform single-cell live imaging of chemotherapy responses in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and observe increased cell death when centrosome amplification is induced. By correlating cell fate with mitotic behaviors, we show that enhanced cell death occurs independently of chromosome instability. We identify that cells with centrosome amplification are primed for apoptosis. We show they are dependent on the apoptotic inhibitor BCL-XL, and that this is not a consequence of mitotic stresses associated with centrosome amplification. Given the multiple mechanisms that promote chemotherapy responses in cells with centrosome amplification, we assess such a relationship in an epithelial ovarian cancer patient cohort. We show that high centrosome numbers associate with improved chemotherapy responses and longer overall survival.

We show that whole genome sequencing can be used to identify and remove hybrid segments of DNA, when used as part of the breeding policy in a captive breeding program. The proposed policy uses a generalised measure of kinship or heterozygosity accounting for local ancestry, that is, whether a specific genetic location was inherited from from the target of conservation. We then show that optimising these measures would minimise undesired ancestry whilst also controlling undesired kinship or heterozygosity respectively, in a simulated breeding population. The process is applied to real data representing the hybridized Scottish wildcat breeding population, with the result that it should be possible to breed out the domestic cat ancestry. The ability to reverse introgression is a powerful new tool brought about from both sequencing and computational advances in ancestry estimation. Since it works best when applied early in the process, important decisions need to be made about which genetically distinct populations should benefit from it and which should be left to reform into a single population.",

    "abstract": "The potential of engineered enzymes in practical applications is often constrained by limitations in their expression levels, thermal stability, and the diversity and magnitude of catalytic activities. De-novo enzyme design, though exciting, is challenged by the complex nature of enzymatic catalysis. An alternative promising approach involves expanding the capabilities of existing natural enzymes to enable functionality across new substrates and operational parameters. To this end we introduce CoSaNN (Conformation Sampling using Neural Network), a novel strategy for enzyme design that utilizes advances in deep learning for structure prediction and sequence optimization. By controlling enzyme conformations, we can expand the chemical space beyond the reach of simple mutagenesis. CoSaNN uses a context-dependent approach that accurately generates novel enzyme designs by considering non-linear relationships in both sequence and structure space. Additionally, we have further developed SolvIT, a graph neural network trained to predict protein solubility in E.Coli, as an additional optimization layer for producing highly expressed enzymes. Through this approach, we have engineered novel enzymes exhibiting superior expression levels, with 54% of our designs expressed in E.Coli, and increased thermal stability with more than 30% of our designs having a higher Tm than the template enzyme. Furthermore, our research underscores the transformative potential of AI in protein design, adeptly capturing high order interactions and preserving allosteric mechanisms in extensively modified enzymes. These advancements pave the way for the creation of diverse, functional, and robust enzymes, thereby opening new avenues for targeted biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Plant genomes include large numbers of transposable elements. One particular type of these elements is flanked by two Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) and can translocate using RNA. Such elements are known as LTR-retrotransposons; they are the most abundant type of transposons in plant genomes. They have many important functions involving gene regulation and the rise of new genes and pseudo genes in response to severe stress. Additionally, LTR-retrotransposons have several applications in biotechnology. Due to the abundance and the importance of LTR-retrotransposons, multiple computational tools have been developed for their detection. However, none of these tools take advantages of the availability of related genomes; they process one chromosome at a time. Further, recently nested LTR-retrotransposons (multiple elements of the same family are inserted into each other) cannot be annotated accurately -- or cannot be annotated at all -- by the currently available tools. Motivated to overcome these two limitations, we built Look4LTRs, which can annotate LTR-retrotransposons in multiple related genomes simultaneously and discover recently nested elements. The methodology of Look4LTRs depends on techniques imported from the signal-processing field, graph algorithms, and machine learning with a minimal use of alignment algorithms. Four plant genomes were used in developing Look4LTRs and eight plant genomes for evaluating it in contrast to three related tools. Look4LTRs is the fastest while maintaining better or comparable F1 scores (the harmonic average of recall and precision) to those obtained by the other tools. Our results demonstrate the added benefit of annotating LTR-retrotransposons in multiple related genomes simultaneously and the ability to discover recently nested elements. Expert human manual examination of six elements -- not included in the ground truth -- revealed that three elements belong to known families and two elements are likely from new families. With respect to examining recently nested LTR-retrotransposons, three out of five were confirmed to be valid elements. Look4LTRs -- with its speed, accuracy, and novel features -- represents a true advancement in the annotation of LTR-retrotransposons, opening the door to many studies focused on understanding their functions in plants.",

    "abstract": "It is known that pre-mRNAs in eukaryotic cells can be processed to circular RNAs by a back- splicing mechanism. Circular RNAs have great stability and can sequester proteins or small RNAs to exert functions on cellular pathways. Because viruses often exploit host pathways, we explored whether the RNA genome of the cytoplasmic hepatitis C virus is processed to yield virus-derived circRNAs (vcircRNAs). Computational analyses of RNA-seq experiments predicted that the viral RNA genome is fragmented to generate hundreds of vcircRNAs. More than a dozen of them were experimentally verified by rolling-circle amplification. VcircRNAs that contained the viral internal ribosome entry site were found to be translated into novel proteins that displayed pro-viral functions. Furthermore, a highly abundant, non-translated vcircRNA was shown to enhance viral RNA abundance. These findings argue that novel vcircRNA molecules modulate viral amplification in cells infected by a cytoplasmic RNA virus.\n\nSignificance StatementProcessing of an RNA viral genome into hundreds of circular RNAs provides novel pro-viral functions and can promote translation of novel viral peptides.",

    "abstract": "Cells must sense and respond to sudden maladaptive environmental changes--stresses--to survive and thrive. Across eukaryotes, stresses such as heat shock trigger conserved responses: growth arrest, a specific transcriptional response, and biomolecular condensation of protein and mRNA into structures known as stress granules under severe stress. The composition, formation mechanism, adaptive significance, and even evolutionary conservation of these condensed structures remain enigmatic. Here we provide an unprecedented view into stress-triggered condensation, its evolutionary conservation and tuning, and its integration into other well-studied aspects of the stress response. Using three morphologically near-identical budding yeast species adapted to different thermal environments and diverged by up to 100 million years, we show that proteome-scale biomolecular condensation is tuned to species-specific thermal niches, closely tracking corresponding growth and transcriptional responses. In each species, poly(A)-binding protein--a core marker of stress granules--condenses in isolation at species-specific temperatures, with conserved molecular features and conformational changes modulating condensation. From the ecological to the molecular scale, our results reveal previously unappreciated levels of evolutionary selection in the eukaryotic stress response, while establishing a rich, tractable system for further inquiry.",

    "abstract": "Non-genetic variation is the phenotypic variation induced by the differential expression of a genotype in response to varying environmental cues and is broadly categorized into two types: phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise. These variation aspects have been suggested to play an important role in adaptive evolution; however, the mechanisms by which these two types of non-genetic variations influence the evolutionary process are currently poorly understood. Using a machine-learning based phenotyping tool, we independently quantified the phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in the wing morphological traits of a fruit fly Drosophila simulans. Utilizing a rearing experiment, we demonstrated plastic responses in both wing size and shape as well as non-zero heritability of both phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, which suggests that adaptive phenotypic plasticity can evolve via genetic accommodation in the wing morphology of D. simulans. We found a positive correlation between phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, while the correlation between the plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors that were examined (nutrient condition, temperature, and light-dark cycle) were poor. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise contribute to evolvability in a similar manner, however, the mechanisms that underlie the correspondence between these two variation types remains to be elucidated.\n\nLay SummaryNon-genetic variations consist of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, and these variations have been suggested to influence the direction and the rate of evolution. However, the role of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in evolutionary process is still poorly understood. Using a rearing experiment, we examined the heritability of plasticity and developmental noise, the correlation of the strength of plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors, and the relationship between plasticity and developmental noise in wing size and wing shape in Drosophila simulans. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise were heritable, and positively correlated with each other. Our results suggest that there two non-genetic variations dependently affect the direction and the rate of evolution together.",

Recently, a selective thiosulfate uptake pathway involving membrane protein YeeE (TsuA) was characterized. However, the precise function of YeeE and a putative cofactor in the thiosulfate ion uptake pathway remained unclear. Here, we assessed selective thiosulfate transport via YeeE in vitro and characterized YeeD (TsuB) as an adjacent and essential cofactor for YeeE-mediated thiosulfate uptake in vivo. We further showed that YeeD possesses thiosulfate decomposition activity and that a conserved cysteine in YeeD was modified in several forms in the presence of thiosulfate. Finally, the crystal structure of a YeeE-YeeD fusion protein at 2.6-[A] resolution revealed their interactions. The association was evaluated by a binding assay using purified proteins. Based on these results, a model of the sophisticated uptake of thiosulfate ions by YeeE and YeeD is proposed.",

These P. aeruginosa cell clusters are in vitro models of the chronic P. aeruginosa infections found in adult cystic fibrosis patients, which display resistance to antibiotic treatments, leading to exacerbated morbidity and mortality. This resistance has been partially attributed to periphery sequestration, where antibiotics are unable to penetrate biofilm cell clusters. The underlying physical phenomena driving this periphery sequestration have not been definitively established. This paper introduces mathematical models to account for two proposed physical phenomena driving periphery sequestration: biofilm matrix attachment and volume-exclusion due to variable biofilm porosity. An antibiotic accumulation model which incorporated these phenomena was able to better fit observed periphery sequestration data compared to previous models.",

Prior studies have demonstrated that AF-multimer (AFm) can predict accurate protein complexes in only up to 43% of cases. 1 In this work, we combine AlphaFold as a structural template generator with a physics-based replica exchange docking algorithm. Using a curated collection of 254 available protein targets with both unbound and bound structures, we first demonstrate that AlphaFold confidence measures can be repurposed for estimating protein flexibility and docking accuracy for multimers. We incorporate these metrics within our ReplicaDock 2.0 protocol 2 to complete a robust in-silico pipeline for accurate protein complex structure prediction. AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking) successfully docks failed AF predictions including 97 failure cases in Docking Benchmark Set 5.5. AlphaRED generates CAPRI acceptable-quality or better predictions for 66% of benchmark targets. Further, on a subset of antigen-antibody targets, which is challenging for AFm (19% success rate), AlphaRED demonstrates a success rate of 51%. This new strategy demonstrates the success possible by integrating deep-learning based architectures trained on evolutionary information with physics-based enhanced sampling.

    "abstract": "Combinations of oncogenic mutations drive inter-tumor heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC), which promotes distinct phenotypes and affects therapeutic efficacy. We recently demonstrated that combinations of mutations in mouse small intestinal organoids lead to unique changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. However, it remains unknown how different mutational backgrounds shape miRNA profiles in the human colon. We leveraged human colonic organoid models, termed colonoids, with gene edits targeting genes commonly mutated in CRC to profile genotype-specific changes in miRNA expression. By small RNA-sequencing we characterized genotype-specific miRNA profiles. We identified one group of miRNAs, including mir-34a-5p and mir-10a-5p, that is strongly downregulated in APC/KRAS/TP53 mutant (AKP-mutant) colonoids. Using chromatin run-on sequencing, we showed that most miRNA alterations in AKP-mutant colonoids are concordant with transcriptional changes. Transcription factor (TF) motif enrichment analysis using transcriptional regulatory elements with increased activity in AKP-mutant colonoids revealed an enrichment of binding sites for multiple oncogenic TFs. Several of these harbor predicted binding sites for mir-10a-5p and/or mir-34a-5p, suggesting these miRNAs may play a role in regulating transcriptional programs in AKP-mutant contexts. Ultimately, our study offers a glimpse into regulatory mechanisms that drive inter-tumor heterogeneity, and we highlight candidate therapeutic targets for the advancement of precision medicine.",

Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pannexin 1 (PANX1) channel-forming protein is known to decrease melanoma cell tumorigenic properties in vitro and ex vivo. Here, we crossed Panx1 knockout (Panx1-/-) mice with the inducible melanoma model: BrafCA, PtenloxP, Tyr::CreERT2 (BPC). We found that deleting the Panx1 gene in mice does not reduce BRAF(V600E)/Pten-driven primary tumor formation or improve survival. Notably, BPC-Panx1-/- mice tumors exhibited a significant infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and increased Granzyme B+ cells with no changes in the expression of early T cell activation marker CD69, LAG-3 checkpoint receptor or PD-L1 in tumors when compared to BPC-Panx1+/+ genotype. Our results suggest that although Panx1 deletion does not overturn the aggressive BRAF/Pten-driven melanoma progression, in vivo, it does increase the infiltration of effector immune T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. We propose that PANX1-targeted therapy could be explored as a strategy to increase tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to boost anti-tumor immunity.",

We identify ERBB2 as an upstream regulator of the expression and transcriptional activity of FOXM1. Unexpectedly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) unbiased screen reveals a prominent anti-correlation between FOXM1 and immune response pathways. Indeed, syngeneic mouse models show that FOXM1 inhibits the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment. Consistently, FOXM1 suppresses CD8+ T cell chemotaxis in vitro and antigen-dependent CD8+ T cell killing.

Circadian clocks execute this temporal regulation by modulating temporal expression of genes. Clock regulation of mRNAs was envisioned as the primary driver of daily rhythms.

To assess the contribution from post-transcriptional processes, we quantitatively probed the Chlamydomonas proteome for two circadian cycles. Our study suggests rampant role of posttranscriptional processes in clock regulation of Chlamydomonas metabolism. We quantified >1000 proteins, half of which demonstrate circadian rhythms. Among these rhythmic proteins, >40% originate from non-rhythmic mRNAs and > 90% peak around midday or midnight. Accumulation rhythms of proteins rather than their encoding mRNAs shows extreme coordination. We uncovered new rhythms and accounted for physiological rhythms whose mechanistic details remained undocumented from earlier transcriptomic studies. We envisage our study will refine and enrich the evaluation of temporal metabolic processes in Chlamydomonas.

The widely conserved AvrE/DspE-family effectors play a central role in the pathogenesis of diverse phytopathogenic bacteria6. These conserved effectors are involved in the induction of \"water-soaking\" and host cell death that are conducive to bacterial multiplication in infected tissues. However, the exact biochemical functions of AvrE/DspE-family effectors have been recalcitrant to mechanistic understanding for three decades. Here we show that AvrE/DspE-family effectors fold into a {beta}-barrel structure that resembles bacterial porins. Expression of AvrE and DspE in Xenopus oocytes results in (i) inward and outward currents, (ii) permeability to water and (iii) osmolarity-dependent oocyte swelling and bursting. Liposome reconstitution confirmed that the DspE channel alone is sufficient to allow the passage of small molecules such as fluorescein dye. Targeted screening of chemical blockers based on the predicted pore size (15-20 [A]) of the DspE channel identified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as inhibitors of the DspE/AvrE channels. Remarkably, PAMAMs broadly inhibit AvrE/DspE virulence activities in Xenopus oocytes and during Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae infections. Thus, we have unraveled the enigmatic function of a centrally important family of bacterial effectors with significant conceptual and practical implications in the study of bacterial pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The diversity and phenotypic impacts related to the presence of heritable bacteria in insects have been extensively studied in the last decades. On the contrary, heritable viruses have been overlooked for several reasons, including technical ones. This is regrettable because of the size of this gap knowledge and because case study indicate that viruses may have profound impact on the functionning of individuals and communities. Additionally, the factors that may shape viral communities are poorly known, except in some very specific viral-insect systems. Here we analyze the community structure of heritable viruses in a multi-hosts-multi-parasitoids community. Drosophilidae and their larval and pupal parasitoids were sampled in two locations, two years and two seasons. After two lab generations, putative DNA and RNA viruses were purified and sequenced. Our analysis revealed the presence of 53 viruses (including 37 new viruses), the great majority of which were RNA viruses. The \"species\" factor was by far the most significant one, explaining more than 50% of the variance in viral structure. Additionally, parasitoids had a higher number of heritable viruses compared to their hosts, suggesting that this lifestyle favours the association with viruses. Finally, our community-level survey challenged previous interpretation concerning the host range of some previously described viruses.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with a strong genetic basis. Despite the identification of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the SLC15A4 gene that are significantly associated with SLE across multiple populations, specific causal SNP(s) and molecular mechanisms responsible for disease susceptibility are unknown. To address this gap, we employed bioinformatics, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and 3D chromatin interaction analysis to nominate a likely functional variant, rs35907548, in an active intronic enhancer of SLC15A4. Through luciferase reporter assays followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR, we observed significant allele-specific enhancer effects of rs35907548 in diverse cell lines. The rs35907548 risk allele T is associated with increased regulatory activity and target gene expression, as shown by eQTLs and chromosome conformation capture (3C)-qPCR. The latter revealed long-range chromatin interactions between the rs35907548 enhancer and the promoters of SLC15A4, GLTLD1, and an uncharacterized lncRNA. The enhancer-promoter interactions and expression effects were validated by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out (KO) of the locus in HL60 promyeloblast cells. KO cells also displayed dramatically dysregulated endolysosomal pH regulation. Together, our data show that the rs35907548 risk allele affects multiple aspects of cellular physiology and may directly contribute to SLE.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme needed for dealing with topological entanglements in the DNA arising from replication and transcription. The N-terminal region and core of the protein are utilized in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, which generates a transient double-stranded break in one segment of DNA and passes another segment through the break. The C-terminal domain is a large, intrinsically disordered region that appears to be involved in regulating the function of the enzyme both in terms of substrate selection and the level of activity of the enzyme. In a previous study, we explored eleven targeted mutations to the C-terminal domain. This present study explores six of these mutants to determine whether there are any defects in closure of the N-terminal clamp and whether an experimental compound known as a Cu(II)-thiosemicarbazone affects DNA cleavage with the mutants. Based upon our results, the mutants are able to close the N-terminal clamp, but some of the mutants that displayed the least clamp closing activity also had the lowest catalytic activity. Further, Cu-APY-ETSC did impact the ability of the enzymes to cleave DNA to similar levels as seen with the WT enzyme. These results lay the groundwork for additional analyses of the C-terminal domain and indicate the C-terminal domain regions tested did not influence the action of Cu-APY-ETSC except at the level of coordination between the two active sites.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we uncover a metabolite interaction between barley and the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana (Bs), involving hordedanes, a previously undescribed set of labdane-related diterpenoids with antimicrobial properties. Bs infection of barley roots elicits hordedane synthesis from a 600-kb gene cluster. Heterologous reconstruction of the synthesis pathway in yeast produced several hordedanes, including one of the most advanced products 19-b-hydroxy-hordetrienoic acid (19-OH-HTA). Barley mutants in the diterpene synthase genes of the cluster are unable to produce hordedanes but, unexpectedly, show reduced Bs colonization. Accordingly, 19-OH-HTA enhances both germination and growth of Bs, while it inhibits other fungi, and Bs chemically modifies 19-OH-HTA. Thus, plant and pathogen molecular interactions extend beyond protein-protein recognition and the simple detoxification of plant antimicrobial metabolites.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA fungal pathogen uses barley diterpenoid phytoalexins to facilitate root colonization.",

    "abstract": "The type VII protein secretion system (T7SS) is found in many Gram-positive bacteria and in pathogenic mycobacteria. All T7SS substrate proteins described to date share a common helical domain architecture at the N-terminus that typically interacts with other helical partner proteins, forming a composite signal sequence for targeting to the T7SS. The C-terminal domains are functionally diverse and in Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus often specify toxic anti-bacterial activity. Here we describe the first example of a new class of T7 substrate, TslA, that has an unexpected reverse domain organisation. TslA is widely found across Bacillota including Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Listeria. We show that the S. aureus TslA N-terminal domain is a phospholipase A with anti-staphylococcal activity that is neutralised by the immunity lipoprotein TilA. Two small helical partner proteins, TlaA1 and TlaA2 are essential for T7-dependent secretion of TslA and at least one of these interacts with the TslA C-terminal domain to form a helical stack. Cryo-EM analysis of purified TslA complexes indicate that they share structural similarity with canonical T7 substrates. Our findings suggest that the T7SS has the extraordinary feature of recognising a secretion signal present at either end of a substrate.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a major gastrointestinal pathogen that is transmitted as a dormant spore. As an intestinal pathogen, C. difficile must contend with variable environmental conditions, including fluctuations in pH and nutrient availability. Nutrition and pH both influence growth and spore formation, but how pH and nutrition jointly influence sporulation are not known. In this study, we investigated the dual impact of pH and pH-dependent metabolism on C. difficile sporulation. Specifically, we examined the impacts of pH and the metabolite acetoin on C. difficile growth and sporulation. We found that expression of the predicted acetoin dehydrogenase operon, acoRABCL, was pH-dependent and regulated by acetoin. Regulation of the C. difficile aco locus is distinct from other characterized systems and appears to involve a co-transcribed DeoR-family regulator rather than the sigma54-dependent activator. In addition, an acoA null mutant produced significantly more spores and initiated sporulation earlier than the parent strain. However, unlike other Firmicutes, growth and culture density of C. difficile was not increased by acetoin availability or disruption of the aco pathway. Together, these results indicate that acetoin, pH, and the aco pathway play important roles in nutritional repression of sporulation in C. difficile, but acetoin metabolism does not support cell growth as a stationary phase energy source.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile, or C. diff, is an anaerobic bacterium that lives within the gut of many mammals and causes infectious diarrhea. C. difficile is able to survive outside of the gut and transmit to new hosts by forming dormant spores. It is known that the pH of the intestine and the nutrients available both affect the growth and sporulation of C. diffiicile, but the specific conditions that result in sporulation in the host are not clear. In this study, we investigated how pH and the metabolite acetoin affect the ability of C. difficile to grow, proliferate, and form spores. We found that a mutant lacking the predicted acetoin metabolism pathway form more spores, but their growth is not impacted. These results show that C. difficile uses acetoin differently than many other species and that acetoin has an important role as an environmental metabolite that influences spore formation.",
