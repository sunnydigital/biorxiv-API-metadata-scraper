    "abstract": "Over the course of evolution, enzymes have developed remarkable functional diversity in catalyzing important chemical reactions across various organisms, and understanding how new enzyme functions might have evolved remains an important question in modern enzymology. To systematically annotate functions, based on protein sequences and available biochemical studies, enzymes with similar catalytic mechanisms and/or aspects of catalysis have been clustered together into an enzyme superfamily. Typically, enzymes within a superfamily have similar overall three-dimensional structures, conserved key catalytic residues, but large variations in substrate recognition sites and residues to accommodate the diverse biochemical reactions that are catalyzed within the superfamily. The serine hydrolases are an excellent example of such an enzyme superfamily, that based on known enzymatic activities and protein sequences, is split almost equally into the serine proteases and metabolic serine hydrolases. Within the metabolic serine hydrolases, are two outlying members, ABHD14A and ABHD14B, that have high sequence similarity, but their functions remained cryptic till recently. While ABHD14A still lacks any functional annotation to date, we recently showed that ABHD14B functions as a lysine deacetylase in mammals. Given their high sequence similarity, automated databases wrongly assign ABHD14A and ABHD14B as the same enzyme, and therefore, annotating functions to them in various organisms maybe problematic. In this paper, we present a bioinformatics study coupled to biochemical experiments, that identifies key sequence determinants for both ABHD14A and ABHD14B, and enables better classification for them. Additionally, we map these enzymes on an evolutionary timescale, and provide a resource in studying these interesting enzymes in different organisms.",

    "abstract": "We investigated a relatively underexplored component of the gut-immune axis by profiling the antibody response to gut phages using Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). To enhance this approach, we developed Dolphyn, a novel method that uses machine learning to select peptides from protein sets and compresses the proteome through epitope-stitching. Dolphyn improves the fraction of gut phage library peptides bound by antibodies from 10% to 31% in healthy individuals, while also reducing the number of synthesized peptides by 78%. In our study on gut phages, we discovered that the immune system develops antibodies to bacteria-infecting viruses in the human gut, particularly E.coli-infecting Myoviridae. Cost-effective PhIP-Seq libraries designed with Dolphyn enable the assessment of a wider range of proteins in a single experiment, thus facilitating the study of the gut-immune axis.",

    "abstract": "Circulating monocytes infiltrate and coordinate immune responses in various inflamed tissues, such as those surrounding implanted biomaterials, affecting therapeutic, diagnostic, tissue engineering and regenerative applications. Here, we show that immunometabolic cues in the biomaterial microenvironment govern CCR2- and CX3CR1-dependent trafficking of immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes; ultimately, this affects the composition and activation states of macrophage and dendritic cell populations. Furthermore, immunometabolic cues around implants orchestrate the relative composition of proinflammatory, transitory and anti-inflammatory CCR2+, CX3CR1+ and CCR2+CX3CR1+ immune cell populations. Consequently, modifying immunometabolism by glycolytic inhibition drives a pro-regenerative microenvironment in part by myeloid cells around amorphous polylactide implants. In addition to, Arginase 1-expressing myeloid cells, T helper 2 cells and {gamma}{delta}+ T-cells producing IL-4 significantly contribute to shaping the metabolically reprogramed, pro-regenerative microenvironment around crystalline polylactide biomaterials. Taken together, we find that local metabolic states regulate inflammatory processes in the biomaterial microenvironment, with implications for translational medicine.",

    "abstract": "Single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) experimental designs have become increasingly complex with multiple factors that might affect chromatin accessibility, including cell type, tissue of origin, sample location, batch, etc., whose compound effects are difficult to test by existing methods. In addition, current snATAC-seq data present statistical difficulties due to their sparsity and variations in individual sequence capture. To address these problems, we present a zero-adjusted statistical model, PACS, that can allow complex hypothesis testing of factors that affect accessibility while accounting for sparse and incomplete data. For differential accessibility analysis, PACS controls the false positive rate and achieves on average a 17% to 122% higher power than existing tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PACS through several analysis tasks including supervised cell type annotation, compound hypothesis testing, batch effect correction, and spatiotemporal modeling. We apply PACS to several datasets from a variety of tissues and show its ability to reveal previously undiscovered insights in snATAC-seq data.",

    "abstract": "Retroelements (RE) present in the human genome are silenced via multiple mechanisms, including DNA methylation, to prevent their potentially mutagenic effect. RE activity, demonstrated by their expression and somatic retrotransposition events, is deregulated in multiple tumor types but not in leukemia. We hypothesized that treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA), commonly used in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, could lead to increased RE activity and somatic retrotranspositions, and contribute to disease progression. We induced expression of ORF1p protein encoded by long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) after 72h treatment with HMA in DAMI and HL-60 cell lines. ORF1p was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, as evidenced by fluorescent microscopy of the DAMI cell line. To study whether long-term HMA therapy may induce somatic retrotranspositions, we (i) treated both cell lines for four weeks, (ii) analyzed a cohort of 17 MDS patients before and on treatment with HMA. Using a previously established sensitive NGS-based method, no RE events were identified. To conclude, we show that although HMA induces the expression of L1-encoded proteins in tumor myeloid cell lines, de novo somatic retrotransposition events do not arise during the long-term treatment of MDS patients and myeloid cell lines with these agents.",

    "abstract": "The molecular basis of reduced autofluorescence in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells relative to normal cells has been speculated to be due to lower levels of free flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). This speculation, along with differences in the intrinsic optical properties of extracellular collagen, lie at the foundation of the design of currently-used clinical optical detection devices. Here, we report that free FAD levels may not account for differences in autofluorescence of OSCC cells, but that the differences relate to FAD as a co-factor for flavination. Autofluorescence from a 70 kDa flavoprotein, succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA), was found to be responsible for changes in optical properties within the FAD spectral region with lower levels of flavinated SDHA in OSCC cells. Since flavinated SDHA is required for functional complexation with succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB), decreased SDHB levels were observed in human OSCC tissue relative to normal tissues. Accordingly, the metabolism of OSCC cells was found to be significantly altered relative to normal cells, revealing vulnerabilities for both diagnosis and targeted therapy. Optimizing non-invasive tools based on optical and metabolic signatures of cancers will enable more precise and early diagnosis leading to improved outcomes in patients.",

    "abstract": "Although angiosperm plants have a general capacity to react after the immunity elicitor chitin or chitosan treatment by the cell wall callose deposition, this response in particular cell types and its evolutionary conservation is not understood. Here we show that also the growing root hairs (RHs) of Arabidopsis can respond to a mild (0.001%) chitosan treatment by the callose deposition and by a deceleration of the RH growth. We demonstrate that the glucan synthase-like 5 (GSL5)/PMR4 is vital for chitosan-induced callose deposition but not for RH growth inhibition. Upon the higher chitosan concentration (0.01%) treatment, RHs do not deposit callose, while growth inhibition is prominent. To understand the specificities of the low and high concentration chitosan treatments, we analysed the corresponding PTI signalling components, gene expression, and RH cellular endomembrane and cytoskeleton modifications. Importantly, chitosan-induced callose deposition is also present in the functionally analogous and evolutionarily only distantly related RH-like structures rhizophores (lycophytes) and rhizoids (bryophytes). Our results point to the RH callose deposition as a conserved strategy of soil-anchoring plant cells (rhizoids/rhizophores/RHs) to deal with mild biotic stress. At the same time, high chitosan concentration prominently disturbs intracellular dynamics, tip-localised endomembrane compartments and RH growth, precluding callose deposition.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of poorly differentiated myeloid cells, with a heterogenous mutational landscape. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are found in 20% of the AML cases. Although much effort has been made to identify genes associated with leukemogenesis, the regulatory mechanism of AML state transition is still not fully understood. To alleviate this issue, here we develop a new computational approach that integrates genomic data from diverse sources, including gene expression and ATAC-seq datasets, curated gene regulatory interaction databases, and mathematical modeling to establish models of context-specific core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for a mechanistic understanding of tumorigenesis of AML with IDH mutations. The approach adopts a novel optimization procedure to identify the optimal network according to its accuracy in capturing gene expression states and its flexibility to allow sufficient control of state transitions. From GRN modeling, we identify key regulators associated with the function of IDH mutations, such as DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, and network destabilizers, such as E2F1. The constructed core regulatory network and outcomes of in-silico network perturbations are supported by survival data from AML patients. We expect that the combined bioinformatics and systems-biology modeling approach will be generally applicable to elucidate the gene regulation of disease progression.\n\nSignificanceA combined bioinformatics and systems-biology modeling approach is designed to model a transcriptional regulatory network for AML with IDH mutations.

    "abstract": "Earthworms can stimulate microbial activity and hence, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils. However, the extent of this effect in the presence of plants and soil moisture fluctuations, which are influenced by earthworm burrowing activity, remains uncertain. Here we report the effect of earthworms (without, anecic, endogeic, both) and plants (with, without) on GHG (CO2, N2O) emissions in a 3 month-greenhouse mesocosm experiment simulating a simplified agricultural context. The mesocosms allowed for water drainage at the bottom to account for the earthworm engineering effect on water flow during two drying-wetting cycles. N2O cumulative emissions were 34.6 and 44.8% lower when both earthworm species and only endogeic species were present, respectively, and 19.8% lower in presence of plants. The presence of the endogeic species alone or in combination with the anecic species slightly reduced CO2 emissions by 5.9% and 11.4% respectively, and plants presence increased emissions by 6%. Earthworms, plants and soil water content interactively affected weekly N2O emissions, an effect controlled by increased soil dryness due to drainage via earthworm burrows and mesocosm evapotranspiration. Soil macroporosity (measured by X-ray tomography) was affected by earthworm species-specific burrowing activity. Both GHG emissions decreased with top soil macropore volume, presumably due to reduced moisture and microbial activity. N2O emissions decreased with macropore volume in the deepest layer, likely due to fewer anaerobic microsites. Our results indicate that, under experimental conditions allowing for plant and earthworm engineering effects on soil moisture, earthworms do not increase GHG emissions and that endogeic earthworms may even reduce N2O emissions.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic life depends on the functional elements encoded by both the nuclear genome and organellar genomes, such as those contained within the mitochondria. The content, size, and structure of the mitochondrial genome varies across organisms with potentially large implications for phenotypic variance and resulting evolutionary trajectories. Among yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, extensive differences have been observed in various species relative to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but mitochondrial genome sampling across many groups has been scarce, even as hundreds of nuclear genomes have become available. By extracting mitochondrial assemblies from existing short-read genome sequence datasets, we have greatly expanded both the number of available genomes and the coverage across sparsely sampled clades. Comparison of 353 yeast mitochondrial genomes revealed that, while size and GC content were fairly consistent across species, those in the genera Metschnikowia and Saccharomyces trended larger, while several species in the order Saccharomycetales, which includes S. cerevisiae, exhibited lower GC content. Extreme examples for both size and GC content were scattered throughout the subphylum. All mitochondrial genomes shared a core set of protein-coding genes for Complexes III, IV, and V, but they varied in the presence or absence of mitochondrially-encoded canonical Complex I genes. We traced the loss of Complex I genes to a major event in the ancestor of the orders Saccharomycetales and Saccharomycodales, but we also observed several independent losses in the orders Phaffomycetales, Pichiales, and Dipodascales. In contrast to prior hypotheses based on smaller-scale datasets, comparison of evolutionary rates in protein-coding genes showed no bias towards elevated rates among aerobically fermenting (Crabtree/Warburg-positive) yeasts. Mitochondrial introns were widely distributed, but they were highly enriched in some groups. The majority of mitochondrial introns were poorly conserved within groups, but several were shared within groups, between groups, and even across taxonomic orders, which is consistent with horizontal gene transfer, likely involving homing endonucleases acting as selfish elements. As the number of available fungal nuclear genomes continues to expand, the methods described here to retrieve mitochondrial genome sequences from these datasets will prove invaluable to ensuring that studies of fungal mitochondrial genomes keep pace with their nuclear counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Due to the abundance of single cell RNA-seq data, a number of methods for predicting expression after perturbation have recently been published. Expression prediction methods are enticing because they promise to answer pressing questions in fields ranging from developmental genetics to cell fate engineering and because they are faster, cheaper, and higher-throughput than their experimental counterparts. However, the absolute and relative accuracy of these methods is poorly characterized, limiting their informed use, their improvement, and the interpretation of their predictions. To address these issues, we created a benchmarking platform that combines a panel of large-scale perturbation datasets with an expression forecasting software engine that encompasses or interfaces to current methods. We used our platform to systematically assess methods, parameters, and sources of auxiliary data. We found that uninformed baseline predictions, which were not always included in prior evaluations, yielded the same or better mean absolute error than benchmarked methods in all test cases. These results cast doubt on the ability of current expression forecasting methods to provide mechanistic insights or to rank hypotheses for experimental follow-up. However, given the rapid pace of innovation in the field, new approaches may yield more accurate expression predictions. Our platform will serve as a neutral benchmark to improve methods and to identify contexts in which expression prediction can succeed.",

    "abstract": "In biological network analysis, identifying key molecules plays a decisive role in the development of potential diagnostic and therapeutic candidates. Among various approaches of network analysis, network vulnerability analysis is quite important, as it assesses significant associations between topological properties and the functional essentiality of a network. Further, some node centralities are also used to screen out key molecules. Among these node centralities, escape velocity centrality (EVC), and its extended version (EVC+) outperform others, viz., Degree, Betweenness, and Clustering coefficient. Keeping this in mind, we aimed to develop a first-of-its-kind R package named NetVA, which analyzes networks to identify key molecular players through network vulnerability and EVC+-based approaches. To demonstrate the application and relevance of our package in network analysis, previously published and publicly available protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data of human breast cancer were analyzed. This resulted in identifying some most important proteins. These included essential proteins, non-essential proteins, hubs, and bottlenecks, which play vital roles in breast cancer development. Thus, the NetVA package, available at https://github.com/kr-swapnil/NetVA with a detailed tutorial to download and use, assists in predicting potential candidates for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes by exploring various topological features of a disease-specific PPIs network.",

    "abstract": "We re-analyzed the data from a recent large-scale study that reported strong correlations between microbial organisms and 33 different cancer types, and that created machine learning predictors with near-perfect accuracy at distinguishing among cancers. We found at least two fundamental flaws in the reported data and in the methods: (1) errors in the genome database and the associated computational methods led to millions of false positive findings of bacterial reads across all samples, largely because most of the sequences identified as bacteria were instead human; and (2) errors in transformation of the raw data created an artificial signature, even for microbes with no reads detected, tagging each tumor type with a distinct signal that the machine learning programs then used to create an apparently accurate classifier. Each of these problems invalidates the results, leading to the conclusion that the microbiome-based classifiers for identifying cancer presented in the study are entirely wrong. These flaws have subsequently affected more than a dozen additional published studies that used the same data and whose results are likely invalid as well.",

    "abstract": "When humans navigate through complex environments, they coordinate gaze and steering to efficiently sample the visual information needed to guide movement. Gaze and steering behavior during high-speed self-motion has been extensively studied in the context of automobile driving along a winding road. Theoretical accounts that have emerged from this work capture behavior during movement along explicit, well-defined paths over flat, obstacle-free ground surfaces. However, humans are also capable of visually guiding self-motion over uneven terrain that is cluttered with obstacles and may lack an explicit path. An extreme example of such behavior occurs during first-person view drone racing, in which pilots maneuver at high speeds through a dense forest. In this study, we explored the gaze and steering behavior of skilled drone pilots. Subjects guided a simulated quadcopter along a racecourse embedded within a forest-like virtual environment built in Unity. The environment was viewed through a head-mounted display while gaze behavior was recorded using an eye tracker. In two experiments, subjects performed the task in multiple conditions that varied in terms of the presence of obstacles (trees), waypoints (hoops to fly through), and a path to follow. We found that subjects often looked in the general direction of things that they wanted to steer toward, but gaze fell on nearby objects and surfaces more often than on the actual path or hoops. Nevertheless, subjects were able to perform the task successfully, steering at high speeds while remaining on the path, passing through hoops, and avoiding collisions. Furthermore, in conditions that contained hoops, subjects adapted how they approached the most immediate hoop in anticipation of the position (but not the orientation) of the subsequent hoop. Taken together, these findings challenge existing models of steering that assume that steering is tightly coupled to where actors look.",

G1 nucleosomes are concentrated in globular chromatin domains and metaphase nucleosomes are concentrated in the chromatids.

Class averages that have more than two stacked nucleosomes or that have side-by-side dinucleosomes are not detected, suggesting that groups of more than two nucleosomes are heterogeneous. Large multi-megadalton structures are abundant in G1 nucleoplasm, but not found in G1 chromatin domains and metaphase chromatin.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine largely decreased overtime against the emerging virus strains, necessitating the universal vaccine development. The most abundant structural membrane (M) protein is highly conserved in amino acid sequence, which arouses our research interests in developing a universal immunogen based on it. Serological analysis showed that IgG responses specific to its N-terminal peptides can be strongly detected in many serum samples from both convalescent patients and vaccinees receiving inactivated vaccines, indicating the potential existence of human B-cell epitopes in reactive peptides. Microneutralization assays showed that the N-terminal peptide S2M2-30-specific hyperimmune serum was capable of cross-neutralizing the authentic viruses including wild-type HKU-001a, B.1.617.2/Delta, and Omicron subvariant BQ.1.1, and synergized with RBD-specific serum in reinforcing antiviral activities. Strong S2M2-30-specific immunities elicited in hACE2-transgenic mice could effectively inhibit B.1.1.7/Alpha (UK) infections. Our results suggest the potentiality of conserved M peptides as vaccine targets for conferring cross-protections against sarbecoviruses.",

    "abstract": "As many as 10-30% of the over 760 million survivors of COVID-19 develop persistent symptoms, of which respiratory symptoms are among the most common. To understand the cellular and molecular basis for respiratory PASC, we combined a machine learning based analysis of lung computed tomography (CT) with flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasal curettage samples, and alveolar cytokine profiling in a cohort of thirty-five patients with respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities more than 90 days after infection with COVID-19. CT images from patients with PASC revealed abnormalities involving 73% of the lung, which improved on subsequent imaging. Interstitial abnormalities suggestive of fibrosis on CT were associated with the increased numbers of neutrophils and presence of profibrotic monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages in BAL fluid, reflecting unresolved epithelial injury. Persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 was identified in six patients and secondary bacterial or viral infections in two others. These findings suggest that despite its heterogenous clinical presentations, respiratory PASC with radiographic abnormalities results from a common pathobiology characterized by the ongoing recruitment of neutrophils and profibrotic monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages driving lung fibrosis with implications for diagnosis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Branched chain -ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) is the rate limiting enzyme in branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism, a metabolic pathway with great importance for human health. BCKDC belongs to the mitochondrial -ketoacid dehydrogenase complex family, which also includes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC). Here we revealed that BCKDC can be substantially inhibited by reactive nitrogen species (RNS) via a mechanism similar to what we recently discovered with PDHC and OGDC -- modifying the lipoic arm on its E2 subunit. In addition, we showed that such reaction between RNS and the lipoic arm of the E2 subunit can further promote inhibition of the E3 subunits of -ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. We examined the impacts of this RNS-mediated BCKDC inhibition in muscle cells, an important site of BCAA metabolism, and demonstrated that the nitric oxide production induced by cytokine stimulation leads to a strong inhibition of BCKDC activity and BCAA oxidation in myotubes and myoblasts. More broadly, nitric oxide production reduced the level of functional lipoic arms across the multiple -ketoacid dehydrogenases and led to intracellular accumulation of their substrates (-ketoacids), reduction of their products (acyl-CoAs), and a lower cellular energy charge. This work revealed a new mechanism for BCKDC regulation, demonstrated its biological significance, and elucidated the mechanistic connection between RNS-driven inhibitory modifications on the E2 and E3 subunits of -ketoacid dehydrogenases. Together with previous work, we revealed a general mechanism for RNS to inhibit all -ketoacid dehydrogenases, which has numerous physiological implications across multiple cell types.",

Exploiting SHIP1 as a drug target will require structural knowledge and the design of selective small molecules. We have determined apo, and magnesium and phosphate-bound structures of the phosphatase and C2 domains of SHIP1. The C2 domains of SHIP1 and the related SHIP2 modulate the activity of the phosphatase domain. To understand the mechanism, we performed activity assays, hydrogen-deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics on SHIP1 and SHIP2. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of the C2 domain is more pronounced for SHIP2 than SHIP1. We determined 91 structures of SHIP1 with fragments bound, with some near the interface between the two domains. We performed a mass spectrometry screen and determined four structures with covalent fragments. These structures could act as starting points for the development of potent, selective probes.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive disorder characterized by age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Although significant progress has been made over the years to identify the molecular determinants of sarcopenia, the precise mechanisms underlying the age-related loss of contractile function remains unclear. Advances in  omics technologies, including mass spectrometry-based proteomic and metabolomic analyses, offer great opportunities to better understand sarcopenia. Herein, we performed mass spectrometry-based analyses of the vastus lateralis from young, middle-aged, and older rhesus monkeys to identify molecular signatures of sarcopenia. In our proteomic analysis, we identified numerous proteins that change with age, including those involved in adenosine triphosphate and adenosine monophosphate metabolism as well as fatty acid beta oxidation. In our untargeted metabolomic analysis, we identified multiple metabolites that changed with age largely related to energy metabolism including fatty acid beta oxidation. Pathway analysis of age-responsive proteins and metabolites revealed changes in muscle structure and contraction as well as lipid, carbohydrate, and purine metabolism. Together, this study discovers new metabolic signatures and offer new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying sarcopenia for the evaluation and monitoring of therapeutic treatment of sarcopenia.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551315v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc0addorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d73b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8733forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e65408_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Various studies have linked several diseases, including cancer and Covid-19, to single nucleotide variations (SNV). Although scRNA-seq technology can provide SNV and gene expression data, few studies have integrated and analyzed these multimodal data. To address this issue, this paper introduces Interpretable Single-cell Multimodal Data Integration Based on Variational Autoencoder (ISMI-VAE). ISMI-VAE leverages latent variable models that utilize the characteristics of SNV and gene expression data to overcome high noise levels, and uses deep learning techniques to integrate multimodal information, map them to a low-dimensional space, and classify disease cells. Moreover, ISMI-VAE introduces an attention mechanism to reflect feature importance and analyze genetic features that could potentially cause disease. Experimental results on three cancer data sets and one Covid-19 data set demonstrate that ISMI-VAE surpasses the baseline method in terms of both effectiveness and interpretability, and can effectively identify disease-causing gene features.",

This study aims to explore the biosynthetic potential of kynurenine pathway for the efficient production of actinocin, an antitumor precursor selected as a proof-of-concept target molecule. Kynurenine pathway is first constructed in Escherichia coli by testing various combinations of biosynthetic genes from four different organisms. Metabolic engineering strategies are next performed to improve the production by inhibiting a competing pathway, and enhancing intracellular supply of a cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine, and ultimately to produce actinocin from glucose. Metabolome analysis further suggests additional gene overexpression targets, which finally leads to the actinocin titer of 719 mg/L. E. coli strain engineered to produce actinocin is further successfully utilized to produce 350 mg/L of kynurenic acid, a neuroprotectant, and 1401 mg/L of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, an antioxidant, also from glucose. These competitive production titers demonstrate the biosynthetic potential of kynurenine pathway as a source of multiple medicinal molecules.

    "abstract": "Daptomycin is a last-line antibiotic commonly used to treat vancomycin resistant Enterococci, but resistance evolves rapidly and further restricts already limited treatment options. While genetic determinants associated with clinical daptomycin resistance (DAPR) have been described, information on factors affecting the speed of DAPR acquisition is limited. The multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF), a phosphatidylglycerol modifying enzyme involved in cationic antimicrobial resistance, is linked to DAPR in pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Since Enterococcus faecalis encodes two paralogs of mprF and clinical DAPR mutations do not map to mprF, we hypothesized that functional redundancy between the paralogs prevents mprF-mediated resistance and masks other evolutionary pathways to DAPR. Here we performed in vitro evolution to DAPR in mprF mutant background. We discovered that the absence of mprF results in slowed DAPR evolution and is associated with inactivating mutations in ftsH resulting in the depletion of the chaperone repressor HrcA. We also report that ftsH is essential in the parental, but not in the {Delta}mprF, strain where FtsH depletion results in growth impairment in the parental strain, a phenotype associated with reduced glycolysis and reduced ability for metabolic reduction. This presents FtsH and HrcA as enticing targets for developing anti-resistance strategies.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551240v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ff3adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@127044aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ab082org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14a4afc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote CoCoNuTs (coiled-coil nuclease tandems) for their salient features, the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with 3 distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial tmRNA, YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs may also target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF (CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold) domains.

    "abstract": "In this study, we evaluated the vaginal and uterine microbiota between beef cattle that became pregnant via artificial insemination (AI) and those that did not to identify microbial signature associated with pregnancy. We also characterized the culturable fraction of these microbiota using extensive culturing and screened some vaginal and uterine bacterial isolates for their antimicrobial resistance. For this, vaginal and uterine swabs from two cohorts of Angus-crossbred cattle: mature cows (vaginal and uterine; 27 open and 31 pregnant) and heifers (vaginal; 26 open and 33 pregnant) that were collected before AI were processed for microbiota assessment using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culturing. Twenty-nine vaginal and uterine bacterial isolates were screened for resistance against 41 antibiotics. Sequencing results revealed 11 taxa that were more abundant in the vaginal samples from non-pregnant heifers compared to pregnant heifers. No differentially abundant taxa were detected in the vaginal samples from pregnant versus non-pregnant cows. Pregnant cows had a distinct uterine microbiota community structure (P = 0.008) and interaction network structure compared to non-pregnant cows. Twenty-eight differentially abundant uterine taxa were observed between the two groups. Community structure and diversity were different between the cow vagina and uterus. A total of 733 bacterial isolates were recovered from vaginal (512) and uterine (221) swabs under aerobic (83 different species) and anaerobic (69 species) culturing. Among these isolates were pathogenic species and those mostly susceptible to tested antibiotics. Overall, our results indicate that pregnancy-associated taxonomic signatures are present in the bovine uterine and vaginal microbiota.\n\nImportanceEmerging evidence suggests that microbiome-targeted approaches may provide a novel opportunity to reduce the incidence of reproductive failures in cattle. To develop such microbiome-based strategies, one of the first logical steps is to identify reproductive microbiome features related to fertility, and isolate the pregnancy associated microbial species for developing a future bacterial consortium that could be administered before breeding to enhance pregnancy outcomes. Here, we characterized the vaginal and uterine microbiota in beef cattle that became pregnant or not via AI and identified some microbiota features associated with pregnancy. We compared similarities between vaginal and uterine microbiota, and between heifers and cows. Using extensive culturing, we provided new insights on the culturable fraction of the vaginal and uterine microbiota, and their antimicrobial resistance. Overall, our findings will serve as an important basis for future research aimed at harnessing the vaginal and uterine microbiome for improved cattle fertility.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are important drivers of microbial ecosystems, but their influence and dynamics in terrestrial biomes remain poorly understood compared to aquatic and host-associated systems. To investigate this, we analyzed shotgun metagenomics datasets from ten compost-derived microbial communities propagated over 48 weeks. We found that the communities clustered into two distinct types consisting of hundreds of microbial genera, and in one community type identified Theomophage, a lytic bacteriophage representing a new Schitoviridae subfamily, which accounted for up to 74.3% of the total community metagenome, indicating massive viral outbreaks. We tracked molecular evolution of Theomophage and found that isolated communities were dominated by a single strain that showed little molecular evolution during outbreaks. However, when experimental manipulation allowed phages to migrate between communities, we observed transient coexistence of strains followed by genomic recombination that underpinned replacement of the ancestral strains. Additionally, when Theomophage colonized mesocosms where it was originally absent, new mutations evolved that fixed and spread to other communities. Our study describes the largest bacteriophage outbreak reported to date and reveals the spatial and temporal scales at which terrestrial bacteriophage microdiversity evolves. It also demonstrates that mixing of viral communities, which may be frequent in natural systems, promotes rapid bacteriophage evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementTerrestrial viral ecology and evolution is an active research area, but current knowledge on soil viruses still lags behind that of other biomes, and the terrestrial microbiome harbors untapped viral diversity. This study describes parallel, massive outbreaks of a novel bacteriophage in a 48- week evolution experiment with compost-derived microbial communities. The unprecedented abundance of this bacteriophage highlights the importance of accounting for viral sequences - which may be challenging to identify and annotate - when analyzing community sequence data. Moreover, we show how dispersal accelerates the dynamics of molecular evolution on a timescale of weeks. These results advance understanding of the spatiotemporal scales at which bacteriophage eco-evolutionary dynamics play out in terrestrial biomes.",

    "abstract": "Signalling pathways in malaria parasite remain poorly defined and major reason for this is the lack of understanding of the function of majority of parasite protein kinases and phosphatases in parasite signalling and its biology. In the present study, we have elucidated the function of Protein Kinase 2 (PfPK2), which is known to be indispensable for the survival of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We demonstrate that it is involved in the invasion of host erythrocytes, which is critical for establishing infection. In addition, PfPK2 may also be involved in the maturation of the parasite post-invasion. PfPK2 regulates the release of microneme proteins like Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), which facilitates the formation of Tight Junction between the merozoite and host erythrocyte-a key step in the process of invasion. Comparative phosphoproteomics studies revealed that PfPK2 may be involved in regulation of several key proteins involved in invasion and signalling. Furthermore, PfPK2 regulates the generation of cGMP and the release of calcium in the parasite, which are key second messengers for the process of invasion. These and other studies have shed light on a novel signalling pathway in which PfPK2 acts as an upstream regulator of important cGMP-calcium signalling, which is plays an important role in parasite invasion.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a bacterial wall-less human pathogen and the etiological agent of atypical pneumonia and tracheobronchitis in both adults and children. M. pneumoniae infectivity, gliding motility and adherence to host target respiratory epithelial cells, are mediated by adhesin proteins P1 and P40/P90 forming a trans-membrane complex that binds to sialylated oligosaccharides cell receptors. Here we report the Cryo-EM structure from P1 bound to the Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody (P1/MCA4), which stops gliding and induces detachment of motile M. pneumoniae cells. On the contrary, polyclonal antibodies generated against the N-domain of P1 or against the whole ectodomain of P40/P90 have little or no effects on adhesion or motility. The epitope of P1MCA4, centred on loop Thr1426-Asp1438 in the small C-terminal domain of P1, is inaccessible to antibodies in the \"open\" conformation of the adhesion complex, when ready for attachment to sialylated oligosaccharides. Mutations in the highly conserved Engelman motifs found in the transmembrane helix of P40/P90, also alter adhesion and motility. The C-terminal domain of P1 experiences large conformational rearrangements, during the attachment/detachment cycle of the adhesion complex. These rearrangements are hindered by antibodies against the C-terminal domain interfering with gliding, which explains the specific neutralization mechanism deployed by antibodies against this domain and suggests new ways to confront M. pneumoniae infections.",

Here, we report that ZNF512B binds the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. We discover a conserved amino acid sequence within ZNF512B that resembles the NuRD-interaction motif (NIM) previously identified in FOG-1 and other transcriptional regulators. By solving the crystal structure of this motif bound to the NuRD component RBBP4 and by applying several biochemical assays we demonstrate that this internal NIM is both necessary and sufficient for robust NuRD binding. Transcriptome analyses and reporter assays identify ZNF512B as a repressor of gene expression that can act in both NuRD-dependent and -independent ways. Surprisingly, high levels of ZNF512B expression lead to nuclear protein and chromatin aggregation foci that form independent of the interaction with the NuRD complex but depend on the zinc finger domains of ZNF512B. Our study has implications for diseases in which ZNF512B expression is deregulated, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, and hint at the existence of more proteins as potential NuRD interactors.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePancreatic islets are nutrient sensors that regulate organismal blood glucose homeostasis. Glucagon release from the pancreatic -cell is important under fasted, fed, and hypoglycemic conditions, yet metabolic regulation of -cells remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a previously unexplored role for physiological levels of leucine, which is classically regarded as a {beta}-cell fuel, in the intrinsic regulation of -cell glucagon release.\n\nMethodsGcgCreERT:CAMPER and GcgCreERT:GCaMP6s mice were generated to perform dynamic, high-throughput functional measurements of -cell cAMP and Ca2+ within the intact islet. Islet perifusion assays were used for simultaneous, time-resolved measurements of glucagon and insulin release from mouse and human islets. The effects of leucine were compared with glucose and the mitochondrial fuels 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH, non-metabolized leucine analog that activates glutamate dehydrogenase), -ketoisocaproate (KIC, leucine metabolite), and methyl-succinate (complex II fuel). CYN154806 (Sstr2 antagonist), diazoxide (KATP activator, which prevents Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from , {beta}, and {delta}-cells), and dispersed -cells were used to inhibit islet paracrine signaling and identify -cell intrinsic effects.\n\nResultsMimicking the effect of glucose, leucine strongly suppressed amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion. Mechanistically, leucine dose-dependently reduced -cell cAMP at physiological concentrations, with an IC50 of 57, 440, and 1162 M at 2, 6, and 10 mM glucose, without affecting -cell Ca2+. Leucine also reduced -cell cAMP in islets treated with Sstr2 antagonist or diazoxide, as well as dispersed -cells, indicating an -cell intrinsic effect. The effect of leucine was matched by KIC and the glutamate dehydrogenase activator BCH, but not methyl-succinate, indicating a dependence on mitochondrial anaplerosis. Glucose, which stimulates anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylase, had the same suppressive effect on -cell cAMP but with lower potency. Similarly to mouse islets, leucine suppressed glucagon secretion from human islets under hypoglycemic conditions.\n\nConclusionsThese findings highlight an important role for physiological levels of leucine in the metabolic regulation of -cell cAMP and glucagon secretion. Leucine functions primarily through an -cell intrinsic effect that is dependent on glutamate dehydrogenase, in addition to the well-established -cell regulation by {beta}/{delta}-cell paracrine signaling. Our results suggest that mitochondrial anaplerosis-cataplerosis facilitates the glucagonostatic effect of both leucine and glucose, which cooperatively suppress -cell tone by reducing cAMP.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551113v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1af2865org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8508fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c009org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afb6e9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LILeucine inhibits glucagon secretion from mouse and human islets\nC_LIO_LILeucine suppresses -cell cAMP via both direct and paracrine effects\nC_LIO_LIAnaplerosis via glutamate dehydrogenase is sufficient to suppress -cell cAMP\nC_LIO_LILeucine suppresses -cell cAMP and glucagon secretion more potently than glucose\nC_LI",

Proteinaceous microcompartments, called carboxysomes, play a critical role in CCM function, housing two enzymes to enhance CO2 fixation: carbonic anhydrase (CA) and Rubisco. Despite its importance, our current understanding of the carboxysomal CAs found in [a]-cyanobacteria, CsoSCA, remains limited, particularly regarding the regulation of its activity. Here, we present the first structural and biochemical study of CsoSCA from the cyanobacterium Cyanobium PCC7001. Our results show that the Cyanobium CsoSCA is allosterically activated by the Rubisco substrate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), and forms a hexameric trimer of dimers. Comprehensive phylogenetic and mutational analyses are consistent with this regulation appearing exclusively in cyanobacterial [a]-carboxysome CAs. These findings clarify the biologically relevant oligomeric state of -carboxysomal CAs and advance our understanding of the regulation of photosynthesis in this globally dominant lineage.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase, CsoSCA, is allosterically activated by the Rubisco substrate RuBP, revealing a novel mechanism controlling key enzyme activity in cyanobacterial -carboxysomes.",

    "abstract": "Temperature plays a fundamental role for the fitness of all organisms. In particular, it strongly affects metabolism and reproduction in ectotherms that have limited physiological capabilities to regulate their body temperature. Ectotherms thus have to maintain thermal homeostasis by behavioral adjustments. The influence of temperature variation on the physiology and behavior of ectotherms is well studied but we still know little about the influence of symbiotic interactions on thermal preference (Tp) of the host. The Wolbachia-Drosophila host-symbiont system represents an ideal model for addressing these questions. A growing number of studies demonstrated that different Wolbachia types can influence Tp in different Drosophila species, but these results may be confounded by the use of long-term Drosophila lab-strains that may not be representative for natural fly populations. To account for this, we investigated the effect of Wolbachia on Tp in wild-type D. melanogaster flies recently collected from nature. Consistent with previous data, we found reduced Tp compared to an uninfected control in one of two fly strains infected with the wMelCS Wolbachia type. Additionally, we, for the first time, found that Wolbachia titer variation influences thermal preference of the host fly. These data indicate that the interaction of Wolbachia and Drosophila resulting in behavioral variation is complex and strongly influenced by the genetic background of host and symbiont. Our results further emphasize the necessity for more in-depth studies to better understand the evolutionary significance of Tp variation influenced by Wolbachia in natural Drosophila populations.",

Despite the availability of several high-resolution structures, the dynamic regulation of its unique intramolecular domain stack is nevertheless still not well understood. By in-depth biochemical analysis, assessing the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the Roc G domain, we have confirmed that LRRK2 has similar to other Roco protein family members a KM value of LRRK2 that lays within the range of the physiological GTP concentrations within the cell. Furthermore, the R1441G PD variant located within a mutational hotspot in the Roc domain showed an increased catalytic efficiency. The most common PD variant G2019S, located in the kinase domain showed an increased KM and reduced catalytic efficiency, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism from the kinase domain to the G-domain. Auto-phosphorylation of the G1+2 residue (T1343) in the Roc P-loop motif is critical for this phosphoregulation of both the KM as well as the kcat values of the Roc-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, most likely by changing the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Together our data reveal a novel intramolecular feedback regulation of the LRRK2 Roc G domain by a LRRK2 kinase dependent mechanism. Interestingly, PD mutants differently change the kinetics of the GTPase cycle, which might in part explain the difference in penetrance of these mutations in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Small molecules have become increasingly recognized as invaluable tools to study RNA structure and function and to develop RNA-targeted therapeutics. To rationally design RNA-targeting ligands, a comprehensive understanding and explicit testing of small molecule properties that govern molecular recognition is crucial. To date, most studies have primarily evaluated properties of small molecules that bind RNA in vitro, with little to no assessment of properties that are distinct to selective and bioactive RNA-targeted ligands. Therefore, we curated an RNA-focused library, termed the Duke RNA-Targeted Library (DRTL), that was biased towards the physicochemical and structural properties of biologically active and non-ribosomal RNA-targeted small molecules. The DRTL represents one of the largest academic RNA-focused small molecule libraries curated to date with more than 800 small molecules. These ligands were selected using computational approaches that measure similarity to known bioactive RNA ligands and that diversify the molecules within this space. We evaluated DRTL binding in vitro to a panel of four RNAs using two optimized fluorescent indicator displacement assays, and we successfully identified multiple small molecule hits, including several novel scaffolds for RNA. The DRTL has and will continue to provide insights into biologically relevant RNA chemical space, such as the identification of additional RNA-privileged scaffolds and validation of RNA-privileged molecular features. Future DRTL screening will focus on expanding both the targets and assays used, and we welcome collaboration from the scientific community. We envision that the DRTL will be a valuable resource for the discovery of RNA-targeted chemical probes and therapeutic leads.",

    "abstract": "Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism mediated by break-induced replication (BIR), evident in approximately 15% of human cancers. A characteristic feature of ALT cancers is the presence of C-circles, circular single-stranded telomeric DNAs composed of C-rich sequences. Despite the fact that extrachromosomal C-rich single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), unique to ALT cells, are considered potential precursors of C-circles, their generation process remains undefined. Here, we introduce a highly sensitive method to detect single stranded telomeric DNA, called 4SET (Strand-Specific Southern-blot for Single-stranded Extrachromosomal Telomeres) assay. Utilizing 4SET, we are able to capture C-rich single stranded DNAs are near 500 bp in size. Both C-rich ssDNAs and C-circles are abundant in cytoplasmic fraction which supports the idea that C-rich ssDNAs may indeed precede C-circles. We also found that C-rich ssDNAs originate during Okazaki fragment processing in lagging strands. The generation of C-rich ssDNA requires CST-PP (CTC1/STN1/TEN1-PRIMASE-Polymerase alpha)-complex mediated priming of the C-strand synthesis and subsequent excessive strand displacement of C-rich strand through DNA Polymerase delta and BLM helicase. Our work proposes a new model for the generation of C-rich ssDNAs and C-circles that are indicative of the presence of ALT pathway.",

    "abstract": "Due to their active roles in regulating phosphorylations, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) have emerged as attractive targets in diseases characterized by aberrant phosphorylations such as cancers. The activity of the phosphatase of regenerating liver 3, PRL3, has been linked to several oncogenic and metastatic pathways, particularly in breast, ovarian, colorectal, and blood cancers. Development of small molecules that directly target PRL3, however, has been challenging. This is partly due to the lack of structural information on how PRL3 interacts with its inhibitors. Here, computational methods are used to bridge this gap by evaluating the druggability of PRL3. In particular, web-based pocket prediction tools, DoGSite3 and FTMap, were used to identify binding pockets using structures of PRL3 currently available in the Protein Data Bank. Druggability assessment by molecular dynamics simulations with probes was also performed to validate these results and to predict the strength of binding in the identified pockets. While several druggable pockets were identified, those in the closed conformation show more promise given their volume and depth. These two pockets flank the active site loops and roughly correspond to pockets predicted by molecular docking in previous papers. Notably, druggability simulations predict the possibility of low nanomolar affinity inhibitors in these sites implying the potential to identify highly potent small molecule inhibitors for PRL3. Putative pockets identified here can be leveraged for high-throughput virtual screening to further accelerate the drug discovery against PRL3 and development of PRL3-directed therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Protein O-GlcNAcylation is an evolutionary conserved post-translational modification catalysed by the nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and reversed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA). How site-specific O-GlcNAcylation modulates a diverse range of cellular processes is largely unknown. A limiting factor in studying this is the lack of accessible techniques capable of producing homogeneously O-GlcNAcylated proteins, in high yield, for in vitro studies. Here, we exploit the tolerance of OGT for cysteine instead of serine, combined with a co-expressed OGA to achieve site-specific, highly homogeneous mono-glycosylation. Applying this to DDX3X, TAB1, and CK2, we demonstrate that near-homogeneous mono-S-GlcNAcylation of these proteins promotes DDX3X and CK2 solubility and enables crystallisation of mono-S-GlcNAcylated TAB1. Taken together, this work provides a new approach for functional dissection of protein O-GlcNAcylation.",

    "abstract": "Guinea pigs repeatedly exposed to Ixodes scapularis develop acquired resistance to the ticks (ATR). The molecular mechanisms of ATR have not been fully elucidated, and partially involve immune responses to proteins in tick saliva. In this study, we examined the metabolome of sera of guinea pigs during the development of ATR. Induction of components of the tyrosine metabolic pathway, including hydroxyphenyllactic acid (HPLA), were associated with ATR. We therefore administered HPLA to mice, an animal that does not develop ATR, and exposed the animals to I. scapularis. We also administered nitisinone, a known inhibitor of tyrosine degradation, to another group of mice. The mortality of I. scapularis that fed on mice given HPLA or nitisinone was 26% and 72% respectively, compared with 2% mortality among ticks that fed on control animals. These data indicate that metabolic changes that occur after tick bites contribute to ATR.",

    "abstract": "The reovirus {sigma}NS RNA-binding protein is required for formation of intracellular compartments during viral infection that support viral genome replication and capsid assembly. Despite its functional importance, a mechanistic understanding of {sigma}NS is lacking. We conducted structural and biochemical analyses of an R6A mutant of {sigma}NS that forms dimers instead of the higher-order oligomers formed by wildtype (WT) {sigma}NS. The crystal structure of selenomethionine-substituted {sigma}NS-R6A reveals that the mutant protein forms a stable antiparallel dimer, with each subunit having a well-folded central core and a projecting N-terminal arm. The dimers interact with each other by inserting the N-terminal arms into a hydrophobic pocket of the neighboring dimers on either side to form a helical assembly that resembles filaments of WT {sigma}NS in complex with RNA observed using cryo-EM. The interior of the crystallographic helical assembly is positively charged and of appropriate diameter to bind RNA. The helical assembly is disrupted by bile acids, which bind to the same hydrophobic pocket as the N-terminal arm, as demonstrated in the crystal structure of {sigma}NS-R6A in complex with bile acid. This finding suggests that the N-terminal arm functions in conferring context-dependent oligomeric states of {sigma}NS, which is supported by the structure of {sigma}NS lacking the N-terminal arm. We discovered that {sigma}NS displays RNA helix destabilizing and annealing activities, likely essential for presenting mRNA to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for genome replication. The RNA chaperone activity is reduced by bile acids and abolished by N-terminal arm deletion, suggesting that the activity requires formation of {sigma}NS oligomers. Our studies provide structural and mechanistic insights into the function of {sigma}NS in reovirus replication.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchistosomiasis is the second most destructive parasitic disease globally. It poses a serious threat to human health if not diagnosed and treated promptly. However, the current detection methods have limitations due to their dependence on specialized equipments and personnel, and the long detection time, resulting in less-than-ideal detection outcomes. Therefore, more accurate and sensitive assays are required to aid in the control of schistosomiasis. This study aims to develop a rapid and practical method for detecting Schistosoma japonicum circulating nucleic acid by combining the Cas12a protein in the CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system with recombinase-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe created a CRISPR-Cas12a detection method for Schistosomiasis. SjR2 and SjCHGCS19 genes with repetitive copies in the Schistosoma japonicum genome were targeted for detection. The CRISPR-Cas12a detection method can achieve a detection sensitivity of 1 cp/{micro}L, with no cross-reaction with the other three human-infecting trematode parasites. To vividly simulate clinical patients at different infection stages, we collected rabbits serums at 1 d, 3 d, 1 w, 3 w, 5 w, and 7 w post-infection. Circulating Schistosoma japonicum DNA in the serum can be detected as early as 3 days post-infection. The sample and positive rates of each stage were analyzed and the CRISPR-Cas12a detection method prevailed to Nested-PCR. Additionally, our assay offers flexible results readout options, including lateral test strips.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis CRISPR-Cas12a detection method enables sensitive and specific detection of Schistosomiasis by detecting highly repetitive SjR2 and SjCHGCS19 genes. The method was fully validated with rabbits serums collected at different infection stages, which can be applied to monitoring the early infection of schistosomiasis in resource-limited regions.\n\nAuthor SummaryWith the development of schistosomiasis prevention and control efforts in recent years, the prevalence rate and infection intensity of schistosomiasis have decreased, making early and accurate diagnoses more challenging. Combining CRISPR-Cas12a protein with isothermal amplification technology, a detection method for the multi-copy sequences SjR2 and SjCHGCS19 in the genome of Schistosoma japonicum was developed in this study. The results demonstrated that the detection sensitivity of this method could reach 1 cp/{micro}L, with no cross reactivity with three other fluke-like human parasites. In this study, serum samples from 15 rabbits infected with Schistosoma japonicum were used to validate the method. The results demonstrated that rabbits could be identified as early as the third day after infection. CRISPR-Cas12a detection method has a higher positive rate than traditional Nested-PCR. In addition, lateral test strips enable direct observation of our assay results. The aforementioned research findings indicate that the CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection method can be utilized for the early diagnosis of schistosomiasis. In conjunction with the result reading method of the lateral test strips, it also provides a new method for the on-site diagnosis of schistosomiasis in environments with limited access to resources.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the development of potent and safe immune-activating adjuvant technologies has become the heart of intensive research in the constant fight against highly mutative and immune evasive viruses such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. Herein, we developed a modular saponin-based nanoparticle platform incorporating toll-like receptor agonists (TLRas) such as TLR1/2a, TLR4a, TLR7/8a, or a mixture of TLR4a and TLR7/8a adjuvants and denoted them as TLR1/2a-SNP, TLR4a-SNP, TLR7/8a-SNP, and TLR4a-TLR7/8a-SNP respectively. These TLRa-SNPs greatly improved the potency, durability, breadth, and neutralization of both COVID-19 and HIV vaccine candidates, suggesting the potential broad application of this newly designed adjuvant technology to a range of different antigens. More importantly, in addition to their potency, different formulations of TLRa-SNPs induced unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention. Overall, this work demonstrates a modular TLRa-SNP adjuvant platform which could have a major impact on modern vaccine indications.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of microbial genome sequencing data have revealed unexpectedly wide distributions of enzymes from specialized metabolic pathways, including enzymes from methanogens, providing exciting opportunities for discovery. Here, we identify a family of gene clusters (the type 1 mlp gene clusters (MGCs)) that encodes homologs of the soluble coenzyme M methyltransferases (SCMTs) involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis and is widespread in bacteria and archaea. Type 1 MGCs are expressed and regulated in a number of medically, environmentally, and industrially important organisms, making them likely to be physiologically relevant. Enzyme annotation and analysis of genomic context suggests these gene clusters are likely to play a role in methyl-sulfur and/or methyl-selenide metabolism in numerous anoxic environments, including the human gut microbiome. Notably, we propose that type 1 MGCs could participate in selenium and methionine salvage pathways that could impact sulfur and selenium cycling in diverse, anoxic environments.",

    "abstract": "Intra-organism biodiversity is thought to arise from epigenetic modification of our constituent genes and post-translational modifications after mRNA is translated into proteins. We have found that post-transcriptional modification, also known as RNA editing, is also responsible for a significant amount of our biodiversity, substantively expanding this story. The APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like) family RNA editing enzymes APOBEC3A and APOBEC3G catalyze the deamination of cytosines to uracils (C>U) in specific stem-loop structures.1,2 We used RNAsee (RNA site editing evaluation), a tool developed to predict the locations of APOBEC3A/G RNA editing sites, to determine whether known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA could be replicated in RNA via RNA editing. About 4.5% of non-synonymous SNPs which result in C>U changes in RNA, and about 5.4% of such SNPs labelled as pathogenic, were identified as probable sites for APOBEC3A/G editing. This suggests that the variant proteins created by these DNA mutations may also be created by transient RNA editing, with the potential to affect human health. Those SNPs identified as potential APOBEC3A/G-mediated RNA editing sites were disproportionately associated with cardiovascular diseases, digestive system diseases, and musculoskeletal diseases. Future work should focus on common sites of RNA editing, any variant proteins created by these RNA editing sites, and the effects of these variants on protein diversity and human health. Classically, our biodiversity is thought to come from our constitutive genetics, epigenetic phenomenon, transcriptional differences, and post-translational modification of proteins. Here, we have shown evidence that RNA editing, often stimulated by environmental factors, could account for a significant degree of the protein biodiversity leading to human disease. In an era where worries about our changing environment are ever increasing, from the warming of our climate to the emergence of new diseases to the infiltration of microplastics and pollutants into our bodies, understanding how environmentally sensitive mechanisms like RNA editing affect our own cells is essential.",

    "abstract": "Genomics has become the primary way to explore microbial diversity, because genetic tools are currently difficult to develop in non-model organisms. Here, we demonstrate that -omics can be leveraged to accelerate genetic tool development for the basidiomycete yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous CBS 6938, the sole biotechnologically relevant organism in the Tremellomycete family. First, we sequence the genome. Then, we perform transcriptomics under a variety of conditions, focusing on light and oxidative stress. This data not only reveals novel photobiology and metabolic regulation, it also allows derivation of constitutive and regulated gene expression parts. Our analysis of X. dendrorhous photobiology shows for the first time that a complex system of white-collar and cryptochrome homologs mediate response to ultraviolet light (UV). Our analysis of metabolic regulation shows that UV activates DNA repair, aromatic amino acid and carotenoid biosynthesis and represses central carbon metabolism and the fungal-like apoptotic pathway. Thus, X. dendrorhous shows a dynamic response toward biosynthetic pathways for light-absorbing compounds and survival and away from energy production. We then define a modular cloning system, including antibiotic selections, integration sites, and reporter genes, and use the transcriptomics to derive strong constitutive and regulated promoters. Notably, we discover a novel promoter from a hypothetical gene that has 9-fold activation upon UV exposure. Thus, -omics-to-parts workflows can simultaneously provide useful genomic data and advance genetic tools for non-model microbes, particularly those without a closely related model organism. This approach will be broadly useful in current efforts to engineer diverse microbes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria must adapt to the stresses of specific environmental conditions to survive. This adaptation is often achieved by altering gene expression through two-component regulatory systems (TCSs). In Gram-negative bacteria, the response to environmental changes in osmolarity and pH are primarily mediated by the EnvZ/OmpR TCS. Although the functioning of EnvZ/OmpR has been well characterized in Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and the Yersinia genus, the importance of EnvZ/OmpR TCS in the opportunistic human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae has been limitedly studied.\n\nHere, we investigated the importance of EnvZ/OmpR in K. pneumoniae for fitness, gene regulation, virulence, and infection. Through the generation of a markerless ompR-deletion mutant, we show that overall fitness of K. pneumoniae is not impacted in vitro. Using dual RNA-seq of K. pneumoniae co-incubated with human lung epithelial cells we demonstrate that the K. pneumoniae OmpR regulon includes important virulence factors, but shows otherwise limited overlap with the regulons of other Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, we show that deletion of ompR in K. pneumoniae leads to a stronger antibacterial transcriptional response in human lung epithelial cells. Lastly, we show that OmpR is crucial for K. pneumoniae virulence and infection through a murine lung infection model.\n\nAs the adaptation of commensal bacteria to specific niches is mediated by TCSs, we show that EnvZ/OmpR plays a crucial role in successful lung infection, as well as in virulence. These results suggest that OmpR is an interesting target for anti-virulence drug discovery programs.\n\nImportanceBacteria use two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) to adapt to changes in their environment by changing their gene expression. In this study, we show that the EnvZ/OmpR TCS of Klebsiella pneumoniae plays an important role in successfully establishing lung infection, and virulence. In addition, we discern the transcriptional response that OmpR facilitates within this clinically relevant opportunistic pathogen, and within the host. This work suggests that K. pneumoniae OmpR might be a promising target for innovative anti-infectives.",
