    "abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can reveal the structures of large and often dynamic molecules, but smaller biomolecules remain challenging targets due to their intrinsic low signal to noise ratio. Methods to resolve small proteins have been applied but development of similar approaches for small structured RNA elements have lagged. Here, we present a scaffold-based approach that we used to recover maps of sub-25 kDa RNA domains to 4.5 - 5.0 [A]. While lacking the detail of true high-resolution maps, these are suitable for model building and preliminary structure determination. We demonstrate this method faithfully recovers the structure of several RNA elements of known structure, and it promises to be generalized to other RNAs without disturbing their native fold. This approach may streamline the sample preparation process and reduce the optimization required for data collection. This first-generation scaffold approach provides a system for RNA structure determination by cryo-EM and lays the groundwork for further scaffold optimization to achieve higher resolution.",

    "abstract": "Protein language models have shown remarkable success in learning biological information from protein sequences. However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pre-training objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently. This paper proposes a unified protein language model, xTrimoPGLM, to address these two types of tasks simultaneously through an innovative pre-training framework. Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in diverse protein understanding tasks (13 out of 15 tasks across four categories) and generates novel protein sequences which are structurally similar to natural ones. Furthermore, using the same xTrimoPGLM framework, we train an antibody-specific model (xTrimoPGLM-Ab) using 1 billion parameters. This model set a new record in predicting antibody naturalness and structures, both essential to the field of antibody-based drug design, and demonstrated a significantly faster inference speed than AlphaFold2. These results highlight the substantial capability and versatility of xTrimoPGLM in understanding and generating protein sequences.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian neocortex receives extensive cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain. Although it has been shown that acetylcholine (Ach) participates in learning-associated cortical plasticity, its not clear whether Ach can directly modulate structural changes of cortical synapses. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we show that optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons in mouse basal forebrain leads to an increase in spine formation on apical dendrites of layer (L) 5 pyramidal neurons in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex, and these newly formed spines follow similar spatial rules as the spontaneously formed new spines. Selective blockage of Ach receptors (AchRs) revealed that nicotinic AchRs, but not muscarinic AchRs, are involved in the stimulation-triggered spine formation. Furthermore, {gamma}-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission is required in this process, indicating that acetylcholine acts through GABAergic connections in promoting spine formation. Together, our findings demonstrate that acetylcholine can induce spine formation in both sensory and higher-order cortices, via activating nicotinic AchRs through GABAergic local circuitry. Our work established a direct link between Ach release and cortical spine formation in vivo, and shed light on synaptic mechanisms underlying Ach-associated cortical remapping and learning-induced plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes continue to differentiate from their precursor cells even in adulthood, a process that can be modulated by neuronal activity and experience. Yet, our understanding of the functional role of adult oligodendrogenesis remains limited. Previous work has indicated that conditional ablation of oligodendrogenesis in adult mice can lead to learning and memory deficits in a range of behavioural tasks. Our results, reported here, have replicated a key finding that learning to run on a complex wheel with unevenly spaced rungs is disrupted by ablation of oligodendrogenesis. However, using ex vivo MRI (MTR and DTI), we also found that ablating oligodendrogenesis by itself alters brain microstructure, independent of behavioural experience. Furthermore, in vivo EEG recording in behaviourally naive mice with ablated oligodendrogenesis revealed altered brain activity in the form of increased EEG power density across a broad frequency range. Together, our data indicate that disrupting the formation of new oligodendrocytes directly alters brain microstructure and activity. This suggests a role for adult oligodendrogenesis in the maintenance of brain function and indicates that task-independent changes to brain structure and function might contribute to the learning and memory deficits associated with oligodendrogenesis ablation.",

    "abstract": "Music is an intricate stimulus that engages numerous brain networks at various temporal scales. Past work has successfully correlated brain regions and networks of brain regions with features in musical signals and behavioural ratings. Current dynamic systems frameworks allow for the incorporation of multiple types of high-dimensional stimuli into the same model. In the present study, we used networks of music features and continuous behavioural ratings to examine patterns of brain network connectivity captured via EEG in two music listening conditions. Participants listened to music while continuously rating either perceptual features in the musical signal or emotional states induced by the music. Networks of brain regions and networks of music features were estimated using hidden Markov modelling and were analyzed together with continuous behavioural ratings using partial least squares analysis. We found task-specific differences in between-network brain activity. In the perceptual task, network activity in medial frontoparietal, pericentral, anterior frontal, and bilateral temporal networks was most strongly positively correlated with acoustic features in the musical signal. In the emotional task, transitions between networks were more positively correlated with low-arousal low-valence emotional states in anterior cingulate, frontal, and occipital networks. We conclude that attention to specific aspects of a musical experience employs different network connectivity patterns in music listening and discuss the implications of these methods for future work on feature-rich naturalistic behaviours.",

    "abstract": "AimArctic plants survived the Pleistocene glaciations in unglaciated refugia, but the number of these refugia is often unclear. We use high-resolution genomic data from present-day and Little-Ice-Age populations of Arctic White Heather (Cassiope tetragona) to re-evaluate the biogeography of this species and determine whether it had multiple independent refugia or a single refugium in Beringia.\n\nLocationCircumpolar Arctic and Coastal British Columbia (BC) alpine\n\nTaxonCassiope tetragona L., subspecies saximontana and tetragona, outgroup C. mertensiana (Ericaceae)\n\nMethodsWe built genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) libraries using Cassiope tetragona tissue from 36 Arctic locations, including two [~]250-500-year-old populations collected under glacial ice on Ellesmere Island, Canada. We assembled a de novo GBS reference and called variants in dDocent. Population structure, genetic diversity, and demography were inferred from PCA, ADMIXTURE, fastsimcoal2, SplitsTree, and several population genomics statistics.\n\nResultsPopulation structure analyses identified 4-5 clusters that align with geographic locations. Nucleotide diversity was highest in Beringia and decreased eastwards across Canada. Demographic coalescent analysis of the site-frequency-spectrum dated the following splits from Alaska: BC subspecies saximontana (6 mya), Russia (1.5 mya), Europe (>300-600 kya), Greenland (100 kya). Northern Canada populations appear to be from the current interglacial (7-9 kya). Genetic variants from Alaska appeared more frequently in present-day than historic plants on Ellesmere Island.\n\nConclusionsDemographic analyses show BC, Alaska, Russia, Europe, and Greenland all had separate refugia during the last major glaciations. Northern Canadian populations appear to be founded during the current interglacial with genetic contributions from Alaska, Europe, and Greenland. On Ellesmere Island, there is evidence for continued, recent gene flow with foreign variants introduced in the last 250-500 years. These results suggest that a re-analysis of other Arctic species with shallow population structure using higher resolution genomic markers and demographic analyses may help reveal deeper structure and other circumpolar glacial refugia.",
