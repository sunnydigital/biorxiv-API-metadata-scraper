    "abstract": "In vitro culture systems that structurally model human myogenesis and promote PAX7+ myogenic progenitor maturation have not been established. Here we report that human skeletal muscle organoids can be differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cell lines to contain paraxial mesoderm and neuromesodermal progenitors and develop into organized structures reassembling neural plate border and dermomyotome. Culture conditions instigate neural lineage arrest and promote fetal hypaxial myogenesis towards limb axial anatomical identity, with generation of sustainable uncommitted PAX7 myogenic progenitors and fibroadipogenic (PDGFRa+) progenitor populations equivalent to those from the second trimester of human gestation. Single cell comparison to human fetal and adult myogenic progenitors reveals distinct molecular signatures for non-dividing myogenic progenitors in activated (CD44High/CD98+/MYOD1+) and dormant (PAX7High/FBN1High/SPRY1High) states. Our approach provides a robust 3D in vitro developmental system for investigating muscle tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "A universal coordinate system that can ensemble the huge number of cells and capture their heterogeneities is of vital importance for constructing large-scale cell atlases as references for future molecular and cellular studies. Studies have shown that cells in complex organs exhibit multifaceted heterogeneities in their transcriptomic features at multiple resolutions. This nature of complexity makes it hard to design a fixed coordinate system through a combination of known features. It is desirable to build a learnable universal coordinate model that can capture major heterogeneities and serve as a controlled generative model for data argumentation. We developed UniCoord, a specially tuned joint-VAE model to represent single-cell transcriptomic data in a lower-dimensional latent space with high interpretability. Each latent dimension can represent either discrete or continuous feature, and either supervised by prior knowledge or unsupervised. The original transcriptomic profiles can be regenerated from the latent dimensions. The latent dimensions can be easily reconfigured to generate transcriptomic profiles of pseudo cells with desired properties. UniCoord can also be used as a pre-trained model to analyze new data with unseen cell types and thus can serve as a feasible framework for cell annotation and comparison. UniCoord provides a prototype for a learnable universal coordinate framework to enable better analysis and generation of cells with highly orchestrated functions and heterogeneities.",

    "abstract": "Clinical diagnoses rely on a wide variety of laboratory tests and imaging studies, interpreted alongside physical examination findings and the patients history and symptoms. Currently, the tools of diagnosis make limited use of the immune systems internal record of specific disease exposures encoded by the antigen-specific receptors of memory B cells and T cells, and there has been little integration of the combined information from B cell and T cell receptor sequences. Here, we analyze extensive receptor sequence datasets with three different machine learning representations of immune receptor repertoires to develop an interpretive framework, MAchine Learning for Immunological Diagnosis (Mal-ID), that screens for multiple illnesses simultaneously. This approach is effective in identifying a variety of disease states, including acute and chronic infections and autoimmune disorders. It is able to do so even when there are other differences present in the immune repertoires, such as between pediatric or adult patient groups. Importantly, many features of the model of immune receptor sequences are human-interpretable. They independently recapitulate known biology of the responses to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, provide evidence of receptor antigen specificity, and reveal common features of autoreactive immune receptor repertoires, indicating that machine learning on immune repertoires can yield new immunological knowledge. This framework could be useful in identifying immune responses to new infectious diseases as they emerge.",

DNA origami offers precise nanoscale spacing of ligands, a potentially useful feature for therapeutic nanoparticles. Here we introduce a \"square block\" DNA origami platform to explore the importance of spacing of CpG oligonucleotides, which engage Toll-like receptors and thereby act as danger signals for dendritic cells. Through in vitro cell-culture studies and in vivo tumor-treatment models, we demonstrate that square blocks induce Th1 immune polarization when CpG is spaced at 3.5 nm. We observe that this DNA origami vaccine enhances DC activation, antigen cross-presentation, CD8 T cell activation, Th1-polarized CD4 activation and NK cell activation. The vaccine also synergizes effectively with anti-PD-L1 for improved cancer immunotherapy in melanoma and lymphoma models and induces long-term T cell memory. Our results suggest that DNA origami may serve as an advanced vaccine platform for controlling adjuvant spacing and co-delivering antigens.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThis study developed a DNA origami-based cancer vaccine (DoriVac) that co-delivers antigen and CpG immune adjuvant with an optimal nanospacing for Th1 immune polarization.",

In this work, we explore the applicability of protein language models to this task.\n\nResultsWe introduce pLM-BLAST, a tool inspired by BLAST, that detects distant homology by comparing single-sequence representations (embeddings) derived from a protein language model, ProtT5. Our benchmarks reveal that pLM-BLAST maintains a level of accuracy on par with HHsearch for both highly similar sequences (with over 50% identity) and markedly divergent sequences (with less than 30% identity), while being significantly faster. Additionally, pLM-BLAST stands out among other embedding-based tools due to its ability to compute local alignments. We show that these local alignments, produced by pLM-BLAST, often connect highly divergent proteins, thereby highlighting its potential to uncover previously undiscovered homologous relationships and improve protein annotation.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationpLM-BLAST is accessible via the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit as a web server for searching precomputed databases (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/plmblast). It is also available as a standalone tool for building custom databases and performing batch searches (https://github.com/labstructbioinf/pLM-BLAST).",

    "abstract": "Most of the transcribed eukaryotic genomes are composed of non-coding transcripts. Among these transcripts, some are newly transcribed when compared to outgroups and are referred to as de novo transcripts. De novo transcripts have been shown to play a major role in de novo gene emergence. However, little is known about the rates at which de novo transcripts are gained and lost in individuals of the same species. Here, we address this gap and estimate for the first time the de novo transcript turnover rate. We use DNA long reads and RNA short reads from seven samples of inbred individuals of Drosophila melanogaster to detect de novo transcripts that are (transiently) gained on a short evolutionary time scale. Overall, each sampled individual contains between 2,320 and 2,809 unspliced de novo transcripts with most of them being sample specific. We estimate that around 0.15 transcripts are gained per year, and that each gained transcript is lost at a rate around 5x10-5 per year. This high turnover of transcripts suggests frequent exploration of new genomic sequences within species. These rates provide first empirical estimates to better predict and comprehend the process of de novo gene birth.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the central extended amygdala is critical for regulation of the stress response. This regulation is extremely complex, involving multiple subpopulations of GABAergic neurons and complex networks of internal and external connections. Two neuron subpopulations expressing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), located in the central amygdala and the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTL), play key roles in the long-term components of fear learning and in sustained fear responses akin to anxiety. Very little is known on the regulation of stress by the amygdala in non-mammals, hindering efforts for trying to improve animal welfare. In birds, one of the major problems relates to the high evolutionary divergence of the telencephalon, where the amygdala is located. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the presence of CRF neurons of the central extended amygdala in chicken and the local connections within this region. We found two major subpopulations of CRF cells in BSTL and the medial capsular central amygdala of chicken. Based on multiple labeling of CRF mRNA with different developmental transcription factors, all CRF neurons seem to originate within the telencephalon since they express Foxg1, and there are two subtypes with different embryonic origins that express Islet1 or Pax6. In addition, we demonstrated direct projections from Pax6 cells of the capsular central amygdala to BSTL and the oval central amygdala. We also found projections from Islet1 cells of the oval central amygdala to BSTL, which may constitute an indirect pathway for regulation of BSTL output cells. Part of these projections may be mediated by CRF cells, in agreement with expression of CRF receptors in both Ceov and BSTL. Our results show a complex organization of the central extended amygdala in chicken, and open new venues for studying how different cells and circuits regulate stress in these animals.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, must adapt to a diversity of environmental conditions that it faces during its life cycle. The adaptation to these changes is mediated by signaling pathways that coordinate the cellular responses to the new environmental settings. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and Calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathways regulate critical cellular processes in this parasite, such as differentiation, osmoregulation, host cell invasion and cell bioenergetics. Although the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology prompted reverse genetics approaches for functional analysis in T. cruzi, it is still necessary to expand the toolbox for genome editing in this parasite, as for example to perform multigene analysis. Here we used an efficient T7RNAP/Cas9 strategy to tag and delete three genes predicted to be involved in cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways: a putative Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK), Flagellar Member 6 (FLAM6) and Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain/C2 domain-containing protein (CC2CP). We endogenously tagged these three genes and determined the subcellular localization of the tagged proteins. Furthermore, the strategy used to knockout these genes allow us to presume that TcCC2CP is an essential gene in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Our results will open new venues for future research on the role of these proteins in T. cruzi.",

    "abstract": "Heliconius butterflies are well-known for their colourful wing patterns, which advertise distastefulness to potential predators and are used during mate choice. However, the relative importance of different aspects of these signals will depend on the visual abilities of Heliconius and their predators. Previous studies have investigated colour sensitivity and neural anatomy, but visual acuity (the ability to perceive detail) has not been studied in these butterflies. Here, we provide the first estimate of visual acuity in Heliconius: from a behavioural optomotor assay, we found that mean visual acuity = 0.49 cycles-per-degree (cpd), with higher acuity in males than females. We also estimated visual acuity from eye morphology and reported slightly lower values (mean visual acuity = 0.38 cpd), but acuity was still higher in males. Finally, we estimated how visual acuity affects Heliconius visual perception compared to a potential avian predator. Whereas the bird predator maintained high resolving power, Heliconius lost the ability to resolve detail at greater distances, though colours may remain salient. These results will inform future studies of Heliconius wing pattern evolution, as well as other aspects in these highly visual butterflies, which have emerged as an important system in studies of adaptation and speciation.",

By contrast, some mutations do not increase the basal activity of SHP2 and likely exert their pathogenicity through alternative mechanisms. We lack a molecular understanding of how these mutations impact SHP2 structure, activity, and signaling. Here, we characterize five such mutations that occur within the ligand binding pockets of the regulatory phosphotyrosine-recognition domains of SHP2, using high-throughput biochemical screens, biophysical and biochemical measurements, molecular dynamics simulations, and cellular assays. While many of these mutations impact binding affinity, the T42A mutation is unique in that it also alters ligand binding specificity. As a result, the T42A mutant has biased sensitivity toward a subset of activating phosphoproteins. Our study highlights an example of a nuanced mechanism of action for a disease-associated mutation, characterized by a change in protein-protein interaction specificity that alters enzyme activation.",

All the dimension reduction methods supported that the enterotype clusters were overlapped in the dimension reduction plots, and that the distribution of microbial data points appeared to be continuous rather than discrete. Comparison of the composite variables calculated from the different dimension reduction methods showed that the characteristics of the composite variables differed between the dimension reduction methods. The second composite variable calculated from PCoA was significantly associated with the intake of several nutrients, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the risk of AR. The composite variable was also correlated with the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, and thus, Bifidobacterium was related to the risk of AR and intake of several nutrients through dimension reduction.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis faces numerous challenges, including high sparsity, a high-dimensional feature space, technical biases, and biological noise. These challenges hinder downstream analysis, necessitating the use of feature selection methods to address technical biases, identify informative genes, and reduce data dimensionality. However, existing methods for selecting highly variable genes (HVGs) exhibit limited overlap and inconsistent clustering performance across benchmark datasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle to accurately select HVGs from fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and rare cell types, raising concerns about the reliability of their results. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel feature selection framework for unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) scRNA-seq data called Mcadet. Mcadet integrates Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), graph-based community detection, and a novel statistical testing approach. To assess the effectiveness of Mcadet, we conducted extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world data, employing unbiased metrics for comparison. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of Mcadet in the selection of HVGs in scenarios involving fine-resolution scRNA-seq datasets and datasets containing rare cell populations. By addressing the challenges of feature selection in scRNA-seq analysis, Mcadet provides a valuable tool for improving the reliability and accuracy of downstream analyses in single-cell transcriptomics.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis requires building stable macromolecular structures from highly dynamic proteins. Muscles are anchored by long-lasting integrin adhesions to resist contractile force. However, the mechanisms governing integrin diffusion, immobilization, and activation within developing tissue remain elusive. Here, we show that actin polymerisation-driven membrane protrusions form nanotopographies resulting in strong adhesions in the Drosophila muscle attachment site. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that integrins assemble adhesive belts around Arp2/3-dependent actin protrusions, forming an invadosomes-like structure with membrane nanotopographies. Single protein tracking showed that, during MAS development, integrins exhibit enhanced molecular immobilization and confinement in diffusion traps formed by these membrane nanotopographies. Actin filaments also display restricted motion and confinement, indicating strong mechanical connection with integrins. Using isolated muscle cells, we show that substrate nanotopography, instead of rigidity, drives adhesion maturation by regulating actin protrusion, integrin diffusion and immobilization. These results point to the existence of a molecular clutch in developing tissue required for the formation of stable adhesions and highlight the importance of geometrical information in cellular and tissue morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Salinity is an environmental factor that strongly characterizes the habitat use patterns of aquatic organisms. However, knowledge is biased toward the effect of differences in osmotic pressure among salinity habitats; how ambient specific gravity (SG) differences determine species distribution is scarcely understood. Diadromous fish, which migrate between marine and freshwater habitats, may encounter this SG problem when they are unexpectedly landlocked in or colonize freshwater areas with low environmental SG. This is particularly serious for planktonic larval fish, which must maintain neutral buoyancy for foraging and passive locomotion, although their swimbladders are generally underdeveloped. Then, we hypothesized that the SG problem limits the establishment of freshwater resident populations in marine-originated diadromous fishes. To test this hypothesis, the SG modulation ability of newly hatched larvae was compared among three closely related diadromous goby species in Gymnogobius, one of which has freshwater resident populations. The aquarium experimental results did not support that only the species deriving freshwater residents can maintain neutral buoyancy even in freshwater conditions; that is, all three species could modulate their body SG almost equally to those of both fresh and sea waters. This suggests that the ability to maintain neutral buoyancy in freshwater had been pre-adaptively acquired prior to larval freshwater colonization. On the other hand, it is highly noteworthy that the early larvae of the target group maintained neutral buoyancy in various SG environments using swimbladders, which is the first such evidence in teleosts.",

    "abstract": "The ruff sandpiper Calidris pugnax is a Palearctic lekking shorebird with three genetic morphs determined by an autosomal inversion. Male morphs differ strikingly in body size, ornaments, endocrinology and mating behavior. Aggressive Independents represent the ancestral haplotype, semi-cooperative Satellites and female-mimicking Faeders the inverted haplotypes. Since one inversion breakpoint is homozygous lethal, the inverted haplotypes (Satellite and Faeder) cannot recombine and are expected to accumulate mutations. The inversion regions also harbor genes involved in spermatogenesis. However, it is unknown whether the genetic difference between the morphs also translate into differences in sperm traits. Here, we use a captive-bred population of ruffs to compare sperm velocity and morphology among the morphs. Faeder sperm moved the slowest, which is in line with expectations from mutation accumulation and the idea that Faeders might fare worse than Satellites, as Satellite haplotype arose through a rare recombination event that may have re-instated the function of sperm-related genes or helped to purge deleterious mutations. Against the expectation from mutation accumulation, sperm of Independents did not seem to be of highest quality, i.e., they were not the fastest nor the least variable, and they had the shortest tail and midpiece. Although the midpiece contains the energy-producing mitochondria, sperm midpiece length was not associated with sperm swimming speed. Instead, two of three velocity metrics were weakly positively associated with head length (absolute and relative). These results may relate to our observation that although ruff sperm morphologically resemble those of passerines, they generally appear to move differently, vibrating from side to side while slowly moving forward, rather than rotating while moving forwards. To conclude, the three genetically determined morphs showed only minor differences in sperm traits, and these differences were not clearly associated with variation in sperm velocity, indicating a low potential for the evolution of morph-specific sperm adaptations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundProtein-protein interactions play essential roles in almost all biological processes. The binding interfaces between interacting proteins impose evolutionary constraints, leading to co-evolutionary signals that have successfully been employed to predict protein interactions from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). During the construction of MSAs for this purpose, critical choices have to be made: how to ensure the reliable identification of orthologs, how to deal with paralogs, and how to optimally balance the need for large alignments versus sufficient alignment quality.\n\nResultsHere, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy for MSA generation: instead of building a single, large alignment for each protein, multiple distinct alignments are constructed, each covering only a single clade in the tree of life. Co-evolutionary signals are searched separately within these clades, and are only subsequently integrated into a final interaction prediction using machine learning. We find that this strategy markedly improves overall prediction performance, concomitant with better alignment quality. Using the popular DCA algorithm to systematically search pairs of such alignments, a genome-wide all-against-all interaction scan in a bacterial genome is demonstrated.\n\nConclusionsGiven the recent successes of AlphaFold in predicting protein-protein interactions at atomic detail, a discover-and-refine approach is proposed: our method could provide a fast and accurate strategy for pre-screening the entire genome, submitting to AlphaFold only promising interaction candidates - thus reducing false positives as well as computation time.",

    "abstract": "The study of larval competition in laboratory populations of Drosophila, implemented via the crowding of larval cultures, has contributed greatly to the understanding of the ecology of competition, the evolution of larval competitive ability, and formed the basis of rigorous testing of the theory of density-dependent selection. Earlier studies led to the view that the outcomes of larval competition, and resulting evolutionary consequences of crowding-adaptation, could largely be understood by varying the starting density of individuals in a crowded culture. However, recent studies have shown that the results of adaptation to larval crowding may not be well predicted by the total larval density (i.e., total starting individuals/total volume of food). Cultures raised at the same total density but at different egg number and food volume combinations were shown to have different underlying density-specific fitness functions, and crowding-adaptation in each of these cultures was attained through different evolutionary trajectories as well. A recent study showed that cultures with not just the same density, but the same egg and food volume combination, achieved through food columns of differing diameter and height, could also differ greatly in fitness-related trait outcomes. In that study, the density of larvae in the feeding band (volume of food close to the surface in contact with air, to which larval feeding is largely restricted) was a very important factor in predicting the outcomes of larval competition. Given these recent findings, it is important to understand the overall role of feeding band density, and how it influences density-specific fitness functions in different kinds of crowded cultures. As the older models of larval competition are now insufficient to capture current empirical data, we constructed an individual-based simulation framework informed in part by these more recent findings, in order to better understand the evolutionary ecology and mechanistic underpinnings of larval competition, and predict robust experiments for expanding our understanding of the process of larval competition in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Parthenogenetic lineages, common in many animals, have sparked debate about their evolutionary persistence. Even after the loss of male individuals, males can survive on the genomes; in fact, rarely occurring males were described in many asexual lineages. Theoretical predictions suggest that genes related to male sexual traits in parthenogenetic lineages will decay over long evolutionary times free from the pressure of stabilizing selection. However, in many cases, such rare males are potentially functional. In this study, we investigated the functionality of rare males in the Japanese parthenogenetic stick insect, Ramulus mikado. Rarely occurring males in the species exhibited the external and anatomical morphology typical in stick insect males, and vigorously and successfully performed mating behaviors with conspecific females; nevertheless, no paternal genotypes were detected in the offspring; all embryos were genetically identical to their mothers. Our histological observation demonstrated that females received a spermatophore without sperms in their copulatory pouch, and revealed that in a male, spermatogenesis was completely deformed. These results suggest the irreversible clonal reproduction of R. mikado due to compromised male function. Our present study provides the first case of evident dysfunction in rare males of stick insects, illuminating the degenerative evolution of sexual traits in asexual lineages.",

    "abstract": "Most population genomic tools rely on accurate SNP calling and filtering to meet their underlying assumptions. However, genomic complexity, due to structural variants, paralogous sequences and repetitive elements, presents significant challenges in assembling contiguous reference genomes. Consequently, short-read resequencing studies can encounter mismapping issues, leading to SNPs that deviate from Mendelian expected patterns of heterozygosity and allelic ratio. In this study, we employed the ngsParalog software to identify such deviant SNPs in whole-genome sequencing data from four species: Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar), and the American Eel (Anguilla rostrata), with low (2X) to intermediate (6X) coverage. The analyses revealed that deviant SNPs accounted for up to 62% of all SNPs in salmonid datasets and approximately 10% in the American Eel dataset. These deviant SNPs were particularly concentrated within repetitive elements and genomic regions that had recently undergone rediploidization in salmonids. Additionally, narrow peaks of elevated coverage were ubiquitous along all four reference genomes, encompassed most deviant SNPs and could be partially attributed to transposons and tandem repeats. Including these deviant SNPs in genomic analyses led to highly distorted site frequency spectra, apparent homogenization of populations and underestimating pairwise FST values. Considering the widespread occurrence of deviant SNPs arising from a variety of source, their important impact in estimating population parameters, and the availability of effective tools to identify them, we propose that excluding deviant-SNPs from WGS datasets is required to improve genomic inferences for a wide range of taxa and sequencing depths.\n\nSignificance: Genomes can be very repetitive and hard to assemble into a reference, which can lead to biases when genotyping genetic markers in complex genomic regions. Here, we draw attention to this issue in various whole-genome datasets and validate a method to identify problematic SNPs at low coverage. We also explore processes creating such SNPs and their consequences on common population genomics analyses.",

    "abstract": "The role of hydrophobicity of phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG-Nups) in determining transport of receptor-bound cargo across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is investigated using Langevin dynamics simulations. A coarse-grained, minimal model of the NPC, comprising a cylindrical pore and hydrophobic-hydrophilic random copolymers for FG-Nups was employed. Karyopherin-bound receptor-cargo complexes (Kaps) were modeled as rigid, coarse-grained spheres without (inert) and with (patchy) FG-binding hydrophobic domains. With a sequence-agnostic description of FG-Nups and the absence of any anisotropies associated with either NPC or cargo, the model described tracer transport only as a function of FG-Nup hydrophobicity, f. The simulations showed the emergence of two important features of cargo transport, namely, NPC selectivity and specificity. NPC selectivity to patchy tracers emerged due to hydrophobic Kap-FG interactions and despite the sequence-agnostic description of FG-Nups. Further, NPC selectivity was observed only in a specific range of FG-hydrophobic fraction, 0.05 [&le;] f [&le;] 0.20, resulting in specificity of NPC transport with respect to f. Significantly, this range corresponded to the number fraction of FG-repeats observed in both S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens NPCs. This established the centrality of FG-hydrophobic fraction in determining NPC transport, and provided a biophysical basis for conservation of FG-Nup hydrophobic fraction across evolutionarily distant NPCs. Specificity in NPC transport emerged from the formation of a hydrogel-like network inside the pore with a characteristic mesh size dependent on f. This network rejected cargo for f > 0.2 based on size exclusion which resulted in an enhanced translocation probability for 0.05 [&le;] f [&le;] 0.20. Thus, the NPC model provides a template for designing synthetic, biomimetic nanopores for macromolecular separations with high degrees of selectivity and specificity.",

Currently, biologists analyzing SNP information have to discard mixed infection samples, because existing downstream analyses require monogenomic inputs. Such a protocol impedes our understanding of the underlying genetic diversity, co-infection patterns, and genomic relatedness of pathogens. A reliable tool to learn and resolve the SNP haplotypes from polygenomic data is an urgent need in molecular epidemiology. In this work, we develop a slice sampling Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, named SNP-Slice, to learn not only the SNP haplotypes of all strains in the populations but also which strains infect which hosts. Our method reconstructs SNP haplotypes and individual heterozygosities accurately without reference panels and outperforms the state of art methods at estimating the multiplicity of infections and allele frequencies. Thus, SNP-Slice introduces a novel approach to address polygenomic data and opens a new avenue for resolving complex infection patterns in molecular surveillance. We illustrate the performance of SNP-Slice on empirical malaria and HIV datasets and provide recommendations for the practical use of the method.",

We demonstrate how napari-threedee can be used for human-in-the-loop 3D image analysis in diverse image data including fluorescence microscopy and cryoelectron tomography.",

    "abstract": "Imaging mass spectrometry is a label-free imaging modality that allows for the spatial mapping of many compounds directly in tissues. In an imaging mass spectrometry experiment, a raster of the tissue surface produces a mass spectrum at each sampled x, y position, resulting in thousands of individual mass spectra, each comprising a pixel in the resulting ion images. However, efficient analysis of imaging mass spectrometry datasets can be challenging due to the hyperspectral characteristics of the data. Each spectrum contains several thousand unique compounds at discrete m/z values that result in unique ion images, which demands robust and efficient algorithms for searching, statistical analysis, and visualization. Some traditional post-processing techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped to dissect these types of data. For example, while principal component analysis (PCA) has long served as a useful tool for mining imaging mass spectrometry datasets to identify correlated analytes and biological regions of interest, the interpretation of the PCA scores and loadings can be non-trivial. The loadings often containing negative peaks in the PCA-derived pseudo-spectra, which are difficult to ascribe to underlying tissue biology. Herein, we have utilized extended similarity indices to streamline the interpretation of imaging mass spectrometry data. This novel workflow uses PCA as a pixel-selection method to parse out the most and least correlated pixels, which are then compared using the extended similarity indices. The extended similarity indices complement PCA by removing all non-physical artifacts and streamlining the interpretation of large volumes of IMS spectra simultaneously. The linear complexity, O(N), of these indices suggests that large imaging mass spectrometry datasets can be analyzed in a 1:1 scale of time and space with respect to the size of the input data. The extended similarity indices algorithmic workflow is exemplified here by identifying discrete biological regions of mouse brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCulture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) are gaining popularity as tools for detecting pathogens in food. Shotgun sequencing holds substantial promise for food testing as it provides abundant information on microbial communities, but the challenge is in analyzing large and complex sequencing datasets with a high degree of both sensitivity and specificity. Falsely classifying sequencing reads as originating from pathogens can lead to unnecessary food recalls or production shutdowns, while low sensitivity resulting in false negatives could lead to preventable illness.\n\nResultsWe have developed a bioinformatic pipeline for identifying Salmonella as a model pathogen in metagenomic datasets with very high sensitivity and specificity. We tested this pipeline on mock communities of closely related bacteria and with simulated Salmonella reads added to published metagenomic datasets. Salmonella-derived reads could be found at very low abundances (high sensitivity) without false positives (high specificity). Carefully considering software parameters and database choices is essential to avoiding false positive sample calls. With well-chosen parameters plus additional steps to confirm the taxonomic origin of reads, it is possible to detect pathogens with very high specificity and sensitivity.",

We enable deconvolution of reads with Xenome, quantification of spatial gene expression from host and graft species with Space Ranger, extraction of B-allele frequencies, and splicing quantification with Velocyto. In the H&E image processing sub-workflow, we generate morphometric and deep learning-derived feature quantifications complementary to the Visium spots, enabling multi-modal H&E/expression comparisons. We have wrapped the pipeline into Nextflow DSL2 in a scalable, portable, and easy-to-use framework.\n\nSummaryWe designed a Nextflow DSL2-based pipeline, Spatial Transcriptomics Quantification (STQ), for simultaneous processing of 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics data and a matched hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide image (WSI), optimized for Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) cancer specimens. Our pipeline enables the classification of sequenced transcripts for deconvolving the mouse and human species and mapping the transcripts to reference transcriptomes. We align the H&E WSI with the spatial layout of the Visium slide and generate imaging and quantitative morphology features for each Visium spot. The pipeline design enables multiple analysis workflows, including single or dual reference genomes input and stand-alone image analysis. We showed the utility of our pipeline on a dataset from Visium profiling of four melanoma PDX samples. The clustering of Visium spots and clustering of imaging features of H&E data reveal similar patterns arising from the two data modalities.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of exposure to the pervasive environmental toxicant, inorganic arsenic (iAs), on human and fish health are well characterized and several lines of evidence suggest that some impacts can manifest years after exposure cessation. Using a developmental exposure protocol whereby zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.5 and 1.5 mM iAs from 4-120 hours post fertilization (hpf) and then was removed, we investigated the sustained effects of iAs on gene expression in the liver, survival, reproductive success, and susceptibility to iAs toxicity in the subsequent generation. Developmental exposure to iAs has massive effects on the hepatic transcriptome, with 23% of genes differentially expressed at the end of exposure at 120 hpf, and some of these genes remain deregulated in the liver 9 months after iAs was removed. Developmental exposure to 1.5 mM iAs, but not 0.5 mM, increased mortality through 3 months by over 50%. Adults that were developmentally exposed to 0.5 mM iAs had reduced mating success, but their offspring had no differences in observable aspects of development or their susceptibility to iAs toxicity. This demonstrates that developmental exposure of zebrafish to iAs reduces long-term survival, reproductive success and causes sustained changes to gene expression in the liver.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThis work investigates the long-term effects of developmental exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) using zebrafish. Months after iAs-exposure was terminated, we found increased mortality, changes in gene expression in the liver and decreased mating success.",

    "abstract": "Endoreduplication, during which cells increase their DNA content through successive rounds of full genome replication without cell division, is the major source of endopolyploidy in higher plants. Endoreduplication plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development and is associated with the activation of specific transcriptional programs that are characteristic to each cell type, thereby defining their identity. In plants, endoreduplication is found in numerous organs and cell types and especially in agronomically valuable ones, such as the fleshy fruit (pericarp) of tomato presenting high ploidy levels. We used the tomato pericarp tissue as a model system to explore the transcriptomes associated with endoreduplication progression during fruit growth. We confirmed that expression globally scales with ploidy level and identified sets of genes differentially expressed when comparing ploidy levels at a specific developmental stage. We found that non-endoreduplicated cells are defined by cell division state and cuticle synthesis while endoreduplicated cells are mainly defined by their metabolic activity changing rapidly over time. By combining this dataset with publicly available spatiotemporal pericarp expression data, we proposed a map describing the distribution of ploidy levels within the pericarp. These transcriptome-based predictions were validated by quantifying ploidy levels within the pericarp tissue. This in situ ploidy quantification revealed the dynamic progression of endoreduplication and its cell layer specificity during early fruit development. In summary, the study sheds light on the complex relationship between endoreduplication, cell differentiation, and gene expression patterns in the tomato pericarp.\n\nSignificance statementThe progression of endoreduplication is very dynamic during early fruit development and displays cell layer specific patterns. The integration of ploidy distribution maps with ploidy-specific transcriptome data revealed that gene expression in the pericarp is controlled in a ploidy-specific manner during the early stages of tomato fruit development, resulting in the spatialization of transcriptional programs.",

    "abstract": "AimEnvironmental conditions strongly affect the distribution and abundance of species via complex forces. Shifts in environmental conditions and differences in the speed and scale of these effects complicate our efforts to infer how species will respond to future environmental change. We test how 18 functional traits affect plant species responses to gradients in environmental conditions and 50-year shifts in climate.\n\nLocationWe analyzed 50-year shifts in the distribution and abundance of 153 plant species distributed across 284 sites in Wisconsin, USA.\n\nTime period1950s to 2000s.\n\nMajor taxa studiedVascular plants (much of the flora of NE North America).\n\nMethodsWe used random forest and integrated hierarchical mixed models to test how plant abundances (and 50-year changes in abundance) track gradients in overstory, soil, and climatic conditions.\n\nResultsWithin study periods, plant abundances reflect gradients in environmental conditions. Leaf traits affected local abundance (both directly and via trait-environment interactions) in the 1950s and 2000s. Strong soil and temperature effects in the 1950s have weakened while precipitation effects have strengthened. Although we expected these models to also predict how plants would respond to shifts in climate, they did not.\n\nMain conclusionsLags in species responses, increases in the stochastic forces affecting community assembly, and other forces limit the ability of models fitted to static data (e.g., space-for-time substitutions) to predict how plant species will respond to long-term shifts in environmental conditions. We must therefore be cautious about applying trait-based species distribution models to predict how climate change will affect species distributions and community structure.",

Herein we extend ATN modeling of the intertidal ecosystem off the central coast of Chile to include empirical data on pelagic chlorophyll-a concentration. This intertidal community requires subsidy of primary productivity to support its rich ecosystem. Previous work models this subsidy using a constant rate of phytoplankton input to the system. However, data shows pelagic subsidies exhibit short-term, highly variable, pulse-like behavior. Incorporating this variable input into ATN modeling is the primary contribution of this work and provides several new insights into this ecosystems response to pulses of offshore phytoplankton, including: (1) closely related sea snails show differential responses to pulses of phytoplankton that are explained by underlying network structure; (2) increasing the rate of pelagic-intertidal mixing increases fluctuations in species biomasses that may increase the risk of local extirpation; (3) predators are the most sensitive species to phytoplankton biomass fluctuations, putting these species at greater risk of extirpation than others. Finally, our work provides a straightforward way to incorporate empirical, time-series data into the ATN framework that will expand this powerful methodology to new applications.",

In particular, microbial communities play a central role in the ecosystem, but we do not understand how changing factors like temperature are going to affect community composition or function. One of the challenges is that we do not understand the mechanistic impacts of temperature on different metabolic strategies, nor how this metabolic plasticity could impact microbial interactions. Dissecting the contribution of environmental factors on microbial interactions in natural ecosystems is hindered by our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to disentangle interactions from sequencing data. Studying the self-assembly of multiple communities in synthetic environments, here we are able to predict changes in microbial community composition based on metabolic responses of each functional group along a temperature gradient.

    "abstract": "Although fossil evidence has been suggested the existence of the early muscular system in the ancient cnidarian jellyfish from the early Cambrian Kuanchuanpu biota (ca. 535 Ma), south China, the mechanism of feeding and respiration of the early jellyfish is conjecture. Recently, the polyp inside the periderm of olivooids was proven to be the calyx-like, most likely bearing short tentacles and bundles of coronal muscles at the edge of the calyx, thus presumably contributing to feeding and respiration. We simulate here the contraction and expansion of the microscopic periderm-bearing olivooid Quadrapyrgites via the dynamic, fluid-solid interactions (FSI) method to investigate their feeding and respiratory activities. The hydrostatic simulations show that the rate of water inhalation by the polyp subumbrella is positively correlated with the rate of contraction and expansion of the coronal muscles, consisting with the previous feeding and respiration hypothesis. The dynamic simulations also show that the frequent inhalation/exhalation of water through the periderm polyp expansion/contraction conducted by the muscular system of Quadrapyrgites, most likely represents the ancestral feeding and respiration patterns of Cambrian sedentary medusozoans that predated the rhythmic jet-propelled swimming of the modern jellyfish. It will be a remarkable step to apply the dynamic fluid simulation to other early Cambrian cnidarians and metazoans to enlighten their behaviours during the Cambrian explosion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle, autosomal-dominant missense mutations in MYH7, which encodes a sarcomeric protein (MHC-{beta}) in cardiac and skeletal myocytes, are a leading cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and are clinically-actionable. However, [~]75% of MYH7 variants are of unknown significance (VUS), causing diagnostic challenges for clinicians and emotional distress for patients. Deep mutational scans (DMS) can determine variant effect at scale, but have only been utilized in easily-editable cell lines. While human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be differentiated to numerous cell types that enable the interrogation of variant effect in a disease-relevant context, DMS have not been executed using diploid hiPSC derivates. However, CRaTER enrichment has recently enabled the pooled generation of a saturated five position MYH7 variant hiPSC library suitable for DMS for the first time.\n\nResultsAs a proof-of-concept, we differentiated this MYH7 variant hiPSC library to cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for multiplexed assessment of MHC-{beta} variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) and hiPSC-CM survival. We confirm MHC-{beta} protein loss occurs in a failing human heart with a pathogenic MYH7 mutation. We find the multiplexed assessment of MHC-{beta} abundance and hiPSC-CM survival both accurately segregate all pathogenic variants from synonymous controls. Overall, functional scores of 68 amino acid substitutions across these independent assays are [~]50% consistent.\n\nConclusionsThis study leverages hiPSC differentiation into disease-relevant cardiomyocytes to enable multiplexed assessments of MYH7 missense variants at scale for the first time. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to DMS previously restricted, clinically-actionable genes to reduce the burden of VUS on patients and clinicians.",

In this work, we present a novel framework named ASCETIC (Agony-baSed Cancer EvoluTion InferenCe) that extracts such signatures from NGS experiments generated by different technologies such as bulk and single-cell sequencing data. In our study, we applied ASCETIC to (i) single-cell sequencing data from 146 patients with distinct myeloid malignancies and bulk whole-exome sequencing data from 366 acute myeloid leukemia patients, (ii) multi-region sequencing data from 100 early-stage lung cancer patients from the TRACERx project, (iii) whole-exome/genome sequencing data from more than 10,000 Pan-Cancer Atlas samples, and (iv) targeted bulk sequencing data from more than 25,000 MSK-MET metastatic patients (both datasets including multiple cancer types).

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) is a common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The inheritance is autosomal dominant, but a high proportion of cases are sporadic. One possible explanation is de novo expansions of unstable intermediate-length alleles (IAs). Using haplotype sharing trees (HST) with the novel haplotype analysis tool kit (HAPTK), we derived majority-based ancestral haplotypes of HRE carriers and discovered that IAs containing [&ge;]18-20 repeats share large haplotypes in common with the HRE. Using HSTs of HRE and IA carriers, we demonstrate that the longer IA haplotypes are largely indistinguishable from HRE haplotypes. These analysis tools allow physical understanding of the haplotype blocks shared with the ancestral haplotype. Our results demonstrate that the haplotypes with longer IAs belong to the same pool of haplotypes as the HRE and suggest that longer IAs represent potential premutation alleles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatographic peakpicking continues to represent a significant bottleneck in automated LC-MS workflows. Uncontrolled false discovery rates and the lack of manually-calibrated quality metrics require researchers to visually evaluate individual peaks, requiring large amounts of time and breaking replicability. This problem is exacerbated in noisy environmental datasets and for novel separation methods such as hydrophilic interaction columns in metabolomics, creating a demand for a simple, intuitive, and robust metric of peak quality.\n\nResultsHere, we manually labeled four HILIC oceanographic particulate metabolite datasets to assess the performance of individual peak quality metrics. We used these datasets to construct a predictive model calibrated to the likelihood that visual inspection by an MS expert would include a given mass feature in the downstream analysis. We implemented two novel peak quality metrics, a custom signal-to-noise metric and a test of similarity to a bell curve, both calculated from the raw data in the extracted ion chromatogram and found that these outperformed existing measurements of peak quality. A simple logistic regression model built on two metrics reduced the fraction of false positives in the analysis from 70-80% down to 1-5% and showed minimal overfitting when applied to novel datasets. We then explored the implications of this quality thresholding on the conclusions obtained by the downstream analysis and found that while only 10% of the variance in the dataset could be explained by depth in the default output from the peakpicker, approximately 40% of the variance was explained when restricted to high-quality peaks alone.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that the poor performance of peakpicking algorithms significantly reduces the power of both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to detect environmental differences. We demonstrate that simple models built on intuitive metrics and derived from the raw data are more robust and can outperform more complex models when applied to new data. Finally, we show that in properly curated datasets, depth is a major driver of variability in the marine microbial metabolome and identify several interesting metabolite trends for future investigation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the circuits that control cell differentiation is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating this problem. However, the reconstruction of developmental trajectories is based on the assumption that cell states traverse a tree-like structure, which may bias our understanding of critical developmental mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose a topological approach that enables identifying signatures of functional biological circuits as persistent homology groups in transcriptome space. In this work, we applied our approach to more than ten single-cell developmental atlases and found that topological transcriptome spaces are predominantly path-connected and only sometimes simply connected. We developed a framework, TopGen, that identifies transiently expressed genes along topological motifs using homology generators. We show that TopGen can identify genetic drivers of topological structures in simulated datasets. Finally, we applied TopGen to analyze topological loops representing stem-like, transdifferentiation, and convergent cell circuits, found in C. elegans, H. vulgaris, and N. vectensis, respectively. Our results show that some essential differentiation mechanisms use non-trivial topological motifs, and that these motifs can be conserved in a cell-type-specific manner. Thus, our approach to studying the topological properties of developmental datasets opens new possibilities for understanding cell development and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid mutations that lower a proteins thermodynamic stability are implicated in numerous diseases, and engineered proteins with enhanced stability are important in research and medicine. Computational methods for predicting how mutations perturb protein stability are therefore of great interest. Despite recent advancements in protein design using deep learning, in silico prediction of stability changes has remained challenging, in part due to a lack of large, high-quality training datasets for model development. Here we introduce ThermoMPNN, a deep neural network trained to predict stability changes for protein point mutations given an initial structure. In doing so, we demonstrate the utility of a newly released mega-scale stability dataset for training a robust stability model. We also employ transfer learning to leverage a second, larger dataset by using learned features extracted from a deep neural network trained to predict a proteins amino acid sequence given its three-dimensional structure. We show that our method achieves competitive performance on established benchmark datasets using a lightweight model architecture that allows for rapid, scalable predictions. Finally, we make ThermoMPNN readily available as a tool for stability prediction and design.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) is a promising target for treating various psychiatric disorders. While upregulation of D1R activity has shown potential in alleviating motor and cognitive symptoms, orthosteric agonists have limitations, restricting their clinical applications. However, the discovery of several allosteric compounds specifically targeting the D1R, such as LY3154207, has opened new therapeutic avenues. Based on the cryo-EM structures of the D1R, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding and allosteric mechanisms of LY3154207. Our simulations revealed that LY3154207 preferred the horizontal orientation above intracellular loop 2 (IL2) and stabilized the helical conformation of IL2. Moreover, LY3154207 binding induced subtle yet significant changes in key structural motifs and their neighboring residues. Notably, a cluster of residues centered around the Na+ binding site became more compact, while interactions involving the PIF motif and its neighboring residues were loosened upon LY3154207 binding, consistent with their role in opening the intracellular crevice for receptor activation. Additionally, we identified an allosteric pathway likely responsible for the positive allosteric effect of LY3154207 in enhancing Gs protein coupling. This mechanistic understanding of LY3154207s allosteric action at the D1R pave the way for the rational design of more potent and effective allosteric modulators.",

    "abstract": "Cilia and flagella were one of the characteristic traits of the last eukaryotic common ancestor and as such, are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Their proteomic makeup is consequently remarkably similar throughout all eukaryotic lineages. Recently, one subgroup of ciliary transport proteins in mammalian cells, the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins, was shown to have the ability to traverse the nuclear envelope, and to engage in protein-protein-interactions that modulate gene expression, signalling cascades, and cell homeostasis. Insects have been critically understudied in cilia biology because of their highly specialised cilia being localised on only a small subset of cell types. In this study, we present evidence that the BBSome, a hetero-octameric ciliary transport complex of BBS proteins, is largely conserved in multiple insect lineages. Using the honeybee Apis mellifera as a study system to explore BBS-associated gene expression, our analyses suggest that not all BBSome-associated genes are expressed equally, indicating possible non-ciliary functions. We also demonstrate that the expression of individual BBS proteins varies significantly between the tissues of queens and males in A. mellifera, especially in neuronal tissue. This result raises the question of what role BBS proteins play in these tissues and whether they are involved in gene regulation in insects. The potential gene regulatory function of BBS proteins should be explored in other eukaryotes due to their high degree of conservation.",

However, disentangling biological signals from the many sources of bias and artifacts remains difficult. Using diverse types of medical imaging (i.e. MRIs, ECGs and DXAs), we develop registered and cross-modal generative models. In all cases, we show how registration, both spatial and temporal, guided by domain knowledge or learned de novo, uncovers rich biological information. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate that even extremely lossy transformations, such as registering images onto a single 1D curve (e.g. a circle), can yield robust signals. Conversely, we demonstrate that increasing data dimensionality by integrating multiple modalities can also result in richer representations. Through genome- and phenome-wide association studies (GWAS and PheWAS) of learned embeddings, we uncover significantly more associations with registered and fused modalities than with equivalently trained and sized representations learned from native coordinate spaces. Our findings systematically reveal the crucial role registration plays in enhancing the characterization of physiological states across a broad range of medical imaging data types.",

Here we describe prime-SGE (\"prime saturation genome editing\"), a new framework based on prime editing, in which libraries of specific mutations can be installed into genes throughout the genome and functionally assessed in a single, multiplex experiment. Prime-SGE is based on quantifying the abundance of prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) in the context of a functional selection, rather than quantifying the mutations themselves. We apply prime-SGE to assay thousands of single nucleotide changes in eight oncogenes for their ability to confer drug resistance to three EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although currently restricted to positive selection screens by the limited efficiency of prime editing, our strategy opens the door to the possibility of functionally assaying vast numbers of precise mutations at locations throughout the genome.",

We suggest that protein conformations from multiple AF2 models and those from MD trajectories exhibit a coherent trend: the conformations of an IDP are deviated from each other and the conformations of a well-folded protein are consistent with each other. We use a residue-residue interaction network (RIN) derived from the contact map which show that the residue-residue interactions in Nvjp-1 are mainly transient; however, those in a well-folded protein are mainly persistent. Despite the variation in 3D shapes, we show that the AF2 models of both disordered and ordered proteins exhibit highly consistent profiles of the pLDDT (predicted local distance difference test) scores.

A common approach is to decompose networks into largely independent functional modules, but inferring these modules and their organization from network activity is difficult, given the uncertainties and in-completeness of measurements. Typically, some parts of the overall functional organization, such as intermediate processing steps, are latent. We show that the hidden structure can be uniquely determined from the statistical moments of observable network components alone, as long as the mean of each latent variable maps onto a scaled expectation of a binary variable and the functional relevance of the network components lies in their mean values. Whether the function of biological networks permits a hierarchical modularization can be falsified by a correlation-based statistical test that we derive.

Nothing is known of how sea turtles core body temperatures vary from season to season at nesting sites. Over seven consecutive seasons we measured the surface temperatures of freshly laid eggs as proxies of core temperatures of sea turtles using non-contact infrared thermometers. We measured egg temperatures of two species that have contrasting lifestyles - leatherbacks, the largest, which are adapted to migrate between tropical breeding sites to cold temperate waters, and the smaller hawksbills that are confined to the tropics and sub-tropics. We found considerable year-to-year variations in temperatures in both species (year means 30.4 {degrees}C to 31.5 {degrees}C in leatherbacks), hawksbills the more so (28.1 {degrees}C to 30.3 {degrees}C). These differences will likely be modified by both natural seasonal variations and anthropogenic changes in global ocean temperatures and resulting changes in currents and water temperatures local to nesting beaches. These previously unrecognised diversities in body temperatures of nesting turtles are pertinent to predicting environmental tolerances, reproductive success, and nest site selection by sea turtles, and could contribute to predicting which rookeries may remain viable or not during future ocean warming.",

Then, we evaluated their in vivo activities by disrupting the tyrosinase enzyme (tyr), which induces albino-like phenotypes. LbCpf1 (Cpf1 derived from Lachnospiraceae bacterium)-Ultra outperformed the other enzymes, producing more than 80% of embryos with severely defective phenotypes even in low-temperature conditions. In addition, duplicated copies of two paralogous lysine demethylases (kdm5b and kdm5c) were successfully disrupted, which recapitulated the previously reported phenotypes observed upon morpholino-mediated knockdown.\n\nConclusionsNewly engineered Cas12a is valuable for gene function studies in Xenopus and other model organisms with low growth temperatures.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTrafficking of GLUcose Transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) from the adipocyte vesicular pool to the cell surface is tightly regulated by insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis in response to changing demands in energy consumption. Previously, endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6, gene name SLC9A6) was identified in adipocyte plasma membranes and shown to associate with GLUT4-positive vesicles. However, the functional contribution of NHE6 to GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake remained uncharacterized.\n\nMethodsNHE6 was knocked down in 3T3L1 cells either before or after differentiation into adipocytes using lentiviral delivery of shRNA. Uptake of [3H] 2-deoxyglucose into adipocytes was quantified in response to insulin. We used epitope tagged constructs to distinguish between localization of vesicular and surface levels of NHE6 and GLUT4 proteins. Protein and transcript levels of components of the glucose signaling pathway were monitored by qPCR and Western analysis, respectively, in response to NHE6 knockdown and/or treatment with chemical modulators of endosomal pH.\n\nResultsWe show that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes is severely impaired upon NHE6 depletion. Correspondingly, insulin-stimulated surface expression of GLUT4 at the adipocyte plasma membrane was diminished in NHE6 knockdown cells due to a post-transcriptional decrease in basal GLUT4. Metformin response of GLUT4 was also muted in the absence of NHE6. Further, we demonstrate diminished activation of the GLUT4 translocation pathway in the absence of NHE6 via reduced expression of the insulin receptor and reduced phosphorylation of the downstream effector kinase Akt. Components of GLUT4 storage vesicles, including GLUT4, LRP1 and sortilin were downregulated in NHE6-knockdown adipocytes under basal conditions. Proteostatic control of key components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin receptor, GLUT4) could be restored by chemical bypass of NHE6 using the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin or the Na+/H+ exchanger mimetic monensin.\n\nConclusionsThus, NHE6 is critical for proper expression and trafficking of GLUT4. Basal expression of both insulin receptor and GLUT4 in NHE6 knockdown cells could be restored by bafilomycin-inhibition of the H+-ATPase or the H+ ionophore monensin pointing to pH dysregulation as the underlying defect. We suggest that NHE6 is a component of GLUT4 storage vesicles where it regulates proteostasis. These findings establish NHE6 as a novel contributor to glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism with implications for Christianson syndrome patients who carry loss of function mutations in the SLC9A6 gene.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551163v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6fc88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d7faforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89d577org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11da50a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Impaired wound healing in burn injuries can lead to complications such as skin graft loss, infection, and increased risk of scarring, which impacts long-term patient outcomes and quality of life. While wound repair in severe burns has received substantial research attention, poor wound outcomes in cases of non- severe burns (classified as <20% of the total body surface area (TBSA)) remain relatively understudied despite also having considerable physiological impact and constituting the majority of hospital admissions for burns. Predicting outcomes in the early stages of healing would decrease financial and patient burden, and aid in preventing long-term complications from poor wound healing. Lipids have been implicated in inflammation and tissue repair processes and may play essential roles in burn wound healing. Longitudinal plasma samples were collected from patients (n=20) with non-severe (<15% TBSA) flame or scald burns over a 6-week period including timepoints pre- and post-surgical intervention. Samples were analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect 850 lipid species and 112 lipoproteins. Statistical analyses, including orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis was performed to identify changes associated with either re-epithelialisation or delayed wound re-epithelisation.\n\nThe results demonstrated that the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles at admission could predict wound re-epithelisation outcomes at two weeks post-surgery, and that these discriminatory profiles were maintained over a 6-week period. Triacylglycerides, diacylglycerides (DAG) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions were associated with delayed wound closure, with DAG(18:2_18:3) and LDL/High density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio having the most influence (p-value < 0.02, Cliffs delta > 0.7), while HDL subfractions, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylcholines (PC), and phosphatidylserines were associated with re-epithelisation at two weeks post-surgery, with PC(16:0_18:1) and HDL-2 apolipoprotein-A1 showing the greatest influence on the model (p-value < 0.01, Cliffs delta < -0.7). We demonstrate clinical prediction of wound re-epithelisation in non-severe burn patients using lipid and lipoprotein profiling. Further validation of the models will potentially lead to personalised intervention strategies to enhance injury outcomes, reducing the risk of chronic complications post-burn injury.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDemonstration of wound healing prediction from time of hospital admission for non-severe burns.\nC_LIO_LIPlasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles within 48 hours of admission to hospital with non-severe burn injury are distinctly different between patients whose wounds re-epithelialized within two weeks and those with delayed re-epithelisation.\nC_LIO_LIPatients with delayed wound re-epithelisation have a persistent lipid and lipoprotein signature from burns admission up to six weeks post-injury.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Many marine microbes require vitamin B12 (cobalamin) but are unable to synthesize it, necessitating reliance on other B12-producing microbes. Thus, phytoplankton and bacterioplankton community dynamics can partially depend on the production and release of a limiting resource by members of the same community. We tested the impact of temperature and B12 availability on the growth of two bacterial taxa commonly associated with phytoplankton: Ruegeria pomeroyi, which produces B12 and fulfills the B12 requirements of some phytoplankton, and Alteromonas macleodii, which does not produce B12 but also does not strictly require it for growth. For B12-producing R. pomeroyi, we further tested how temperature influences B12 production and release. Access to B12 significantly increased growth rates of both species at the highest temperatures tested (38{o}C for R. pomeroyi, 40{o}C for A. macleodii) and A. macleodii biomass was significantly reduced when grown at high temperatures without B12, indicating that B12 is protective at high temperatures. Moreover, R. pomeroyi produced more B12 at warmer temperatures but did not release detectable amounts of B12 at any temperature tested. Results imply that increasing temperatures and more frequent marine heatwaves with climate change will influence microbial B12 dynamics and could interrupt symbiotic resource sharing.",

The immunological performance of the BE-inactivated (BEI) virus was analysed in mice and the neutralising titre of the immune sera measured against the wild-type EMCV-3.

    "abstract": "Meta-omics has become commonplace in the study of microbial eukaryotes. The explosion of available data has inspired large-scale analyses, including species or taxonomic group distribution mapping, gene catalog construction, and inference on the functional roles and activities of microbial eukaryotes in situ. However, genome and transcriptome databases are prone to misannotation biases, and meta-omic inventories may have no recoverable taxonomic annotation for more than half of assembled contigs or predicted proteins. Direct mapping solely to organisms of interest might introduce a problematic misattribution bias, while full databases can annotate any cataloged organism but may be imbalanced between taxa. Here, we explore the potential pitfalls of common approaches to taxonomic annotation of protistan meta-omic datasets. We argue that ongoing curation of genetic resources is critical in accurately annotating protists in situ in meta-omic datasets. Moreover, we propose that precise taxonomic annotation of meta-omic data is a clustering problem rather than a feasible alignment problem. We show that taxonomic membership of sequence clusters demonstrates more accurate estimated community composition than returning exact sequence labels, and overlap between clusters can address database shortcomings. Clustering approaches can be applied to diverse environments while continuing to exploit the wealth of annotation data collated in databases, and database selection and evaluation is a critical part of correctly annotating protistan taxonomy in environmental datasets. We re-analyze three environmental datasets at three levels of taxonomic hierarchy in order to illustrate the critical importance of both database completeness and curation in enabling accurate environmental interpretation.",

    "abstract": "UHRF1 is an essential chromatin protein required for DNA methylation maintenance, mammalian development and gene regulation. We investigated the Tandem-Tudor domain (TTD) of human UHRF1 that is known to bind H3K9me2/3 histones and is a major driver of UHRF1 localization in cells. We verified binding to H3K9me2/3 but unexpectedly discovered stronger binding to H3 peptides and mononucleosomes containing K9me2/3 with additional K4me1. We investigated the combined binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 vs. H3K9me2/3, engineered mutants with specific and differential changes of binding, and discovered a novel read-out mechanism for H3K4me1 in an H3K9me2/3 context that is based on the interaction of R207 with the H3K4me1 methyl group and on counting the H-bond capacity of H3K4. Individual TTD mutants showed up to 10,000-fold preference for the double modified peptides, suggesting that after a conformational change, WT TTD could exhibit similar effects. The frequent appearance of H3K4me1-K9me2 regions demonstrated in our TTD pulldown and ChIP-western blot data suggests that it has specific biological roles. Chromatin pull-down of TTD from HepG2 cells and ChIP-seq data of full-length murine UHRF1 correlate with H3K4me1 profiles indicating that the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 interaction of TTD influences chromatin binding of full-length UHRF1. We demonstrated the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 specific binding of UHRF1-TTD to enhancers and promoters of cell-type specific genes, at the flanks of cell-type specific transcription factor binding sites, and provided evidence supporting an H3K4me1-K9me2/3 dependent and TTD mediated down-regulation of these genes by UHRF1, illustrating the physiological function of UHRF1-TTD binding to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double marks in a cellular context.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs play an essential role in gene regulation during virus infections and have major consequences on viral pathogenesis. During RNA virus infections, the host miRNAs can target both host mRNAs and the virus genomic RNA. Using the CVB3 virus as a model, we have investigated how a host miRNA can target viral genomic RNA and act as an antiviral factor limiting the growth of the virus. CVB3 is an RNA virus whose infection causes myocarditis and, eventually, dilated cardiomyopathy. We shortlisted miRNAs with a potential binding site in the CVB3 genomic RNA. Among these, miR-22 was picked for further studies as its binding site was putatively located in a region in the CVB3 5 UTR, important for recruiting ITAFs and ribosomes for IRES-mediated translation. Using mutational analysis and pull-down assays, we first confirmed the binding of miR-22 on the 5UTR. This binding negatively regulated the translation of CVB3 RNA. However, miR-22 binding-defective mutant of CVB3 RNA had no effect of miR-22 overexpression and could translate normally. Moreover, cells from which miR-22 was knocked out, showed a higher level of CVB3 infection as compared to the wild type. We have further demonstrated that the binding of miR-22 interferes with the recruitment of several ITAFs (La, PSF, and PTB) on viral mRNA. This abrogates the spatial structure necessary for ribosome recruitment on the CVB3 RNA, ultimately inhibiting its translation. Also, the level of miR-22 increases 4 hours post-infection, presumably after the synthesis of viral 2A protease, to regulate infection in the host cell more effectively. Along with the direct effect on viral RNA, the altered level of miR-22 affects the level of its cellular targets which might contribute to CVB3 infection. To identify the possible players, we obtained a list of miR-22 targets and performed pathway analysis. Several targets were shortlisted among the top hits and their levels upon CVB3 infection were checked. Protocadherin-1 (PCDH-1), a single-pass transmembrane protein, followed an expected trend, and its levels were significantly downregulated upon CVB3 infection in miR-22 dependent manner. miR-22 mediated suppression of PCDH1 levels during CVB3 infection points towards the possible role of miR-22 in either modulating antiviral signaling or in virus entry, in addition to regulating the viral translation.",

    "abstract": "Fragmentation of watercourses poses a significant threat to biodiversity, particularly for migratory fish species. Mitigation measures, such as fishways have been increasingly implemented to restore river connectivity and support fish migration. The effects of such restoration efforts are typically tested using telemetry and fisheries methods, which do not fully capture the broader population movements that may have important consequences for population viability. We performed a before-and-after control-impact study using genetic tools (SNPs) to investigate the effect of a newly implemented fishway, aiming to enhance upstream spawning migration of brown trout (Salmo trutta, Linnaeus) in a reservoir with two headwater tributaries fragmented by man-made weirs. Another reservoir with two barrier-free tributaries was also analysed as a control. Our results showed that the isolated brown trout population was self-sustaining in the reservoir before the installation of the fishway, and we found genetic structuring and differentiation between fragmented headwater tributaries before the fishway construction, but not in the control reservoir. Unexpectedly, after the fishway construction we observed increased genetic differentiation between populations of newly recruited juvenile fish in the reservoir tributary and fish in the reservoir. We propose this was caused by philopatric behaviour of brown trout to their natal spawning tributary. In contrast, we did not find any genetic changes in the tributary without a fishway or in the barrier-free reservoir system. Given the scarcity of similar studies, we advocate for an increased use of genetic analyses to monitor and evaluate the effect of efforts to restore river connectivity and inform future management strategies.",

Here, we investigate how symbiosis interacts with nutrient limitation to influence gene expression and stress response programming in the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (Aiptasia). Transcriptomic responses to starvation were similar between symbiotic and aposymbiotic Aiptasia; however, aposymbiotic anemone responses were stronger. Starved Aiptasia of both symbiotic states exhibited increased protein levels of immune-related transcription factor NF-{kappa}B, its associated gene pathways, and putative target genes. However, this starvation-induced increase in NF-{kappa}B only correlated with increased immunity in symbiotic anemones. Furthermore, starvation had opposite effects on Aiptasia susceptibility to pathogen and oxidative stress challenges, suggesting distinct energetic priorities under nutrient scarce conditions. Finally, when we compared starvation responses in Aiptasia to those of a facultative coral and nonsymbiotic anemone, \"defense\" responses were similarly regulated in Aiptasia and the facultative coral, but not in the nonsymbiotic anemone. This pattern suggests that capacity for symbiosis influences immune responses in cnidarians. In summary, expression of certain immune pathways - including NF-{kappa}B - does not necessarily predict susceptibility to pathogens, highlighting the complexities of cnidarian immunity and the influence of symbiosis under varying energetic demands.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent light-up aptamer (FLAP) systems are promising biosensing platforms that can be genetically encoded. Most biologically relevant inorganic molecules lack fluorogenicity or affinity for an aptamer that binds a particular organic molecule ligand. Not surprisingly, a FLAP system that can detect an inorganic molecule has yet to be developed. Here we describe a small-molecule based approach that allows for a single aptamer system with a consensus sequence known to bind a specific organic ligand to fluorogenically detect multiple, structurally unique, and non-fluorogenic inorganic targets. Guided by molecular docking and chemical functional group reactivity, we developed novel benzylidene imidazolinone architectures as pre-ligands that exhibit weak or inhibited fluorogenic binding toward Baby Spinach. These pre-ligands can be transformed into native ligands by either hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Adaptation of this method to live cells through plasmid transfection opened a new opportunity for cell-based biosensing: Escherichia coli competent cells (BL21-DE3) transformed with a plasmid encoding Baby Spinach and incubated with the pre-ligand successfully generated fluorescence signal in response to externally introduced H2S or H2O2. The reported method eliminates the need of in vitro selection of a new aptamer sequence for these inorganic targets, expanding the current capabilities of FLAPs. Leveraging the functional group reactivity of small molecules can lead to cell-based sensors for inorganic molecular targets, exploiting a new synergism between synthetic organic chemistry and synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of the disordered neuronal protein, -Synuclein (S), is the primary pathological feature of Parkinsons disease. Current hypotheses favor cell-to-cell spread of S species as underlying disease progression, driving interest in identifying the molecular and cellular species involved in cellular internalization of S. Prior work from our lab identified the chemically specific interaction between S and the pre-synaptic adhesion protein neurexin 1{beta} (N1{beta}) to be capable of driving cellular internalization of both monomer and aggregated forms of S. Here we explore the physical basis of N1{beta}-driven internalization of S. Specifically, we show that spontaneous internalization of S by SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells expressing N1{beta} requires essentially all of the membrane-binding domain of S; S constructs truncated beyond residue 90 bind to N1{beta} in the plasma membrane of HEK cells, but are not internalized. Interestingly, prior to internalization, S and N1{beta} co-diffuse rapidly in the plasma membrane. S constructs that are not internalized show very slow mobility themselves, as well as slow N1{beta} diffusion. Finally, we find that truncated S is capable of blocking internalization of full-length S. Our results draw attention to the potential therapeutic value of blocking S-N1{beta} interactions.",

    "abstract": "Tissue remodeling and shape changes often rely on force-induced cell rearrangements occurring via cell-cell contact dynamics. Epithelial cell-cell contact shape changes are particularly dependent upon E-cadherin adhesion dynamics which are directly influenced by cell-generated and external forces. While both the mobility of E-cadherin adhesions and their adhesion strength have been reported before, it is not clear how these two aspects of E-cadherin adhesion dynamics are related. Here, using magnetic pulling cytometry, we applied an accelerated force ramp on the E-cadherin adhesion between an E-cadherin-coated magnetic microbead and an epithelial cell to ascertain this relationship. Our approach enables the determination of the adhesion strength and force-dependent mobility of individual adhesions, which revealed a direct correlation between these key characteristics. Since -catenin has previously been reported to play a role in both E-cadherin mobility and adhesion strength when studied independently, we also probed epithelial cells in which -catenin has been knocked out. We found that, in the absence of -catenin, E-cadherin adhesions not only had lower adhesion strength, as expected, but were also more mobile. We observed that -catenin was required for the recovery of strained cell-cell contacts and propose that the adhesion strength and force-dependent mobility of E-cadherin adhesions act in tandem to regulate cell-cell contact homeostasis. Our approach introduces a method which relates the force-dependent adhesion mobility to adhesion strength and highlights the morphological role played by -catenin in E-cadherin adhesion dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The anion exchanger SLC26A9, consisting of the transmembrane (TM) domain and the cytoplasmic STAS domain, plays an essential role in regulating chloride transport across cell membranes. Recent studies have indicated that C-terminal helices block the entrance of the putative ion transport pathway. However, the precise functions of the STAS domain and C-terminal helix, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms governing the transport process, remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of three distinct models of human SLC26A9: full-length (FL), STAS domain removal ({Delta}STAS), and C-terminus removal ({Delta}C), to investigate their conformational dynamics and ion binding properties. Stable binding of ions to the binding sites was exclusively observed in the {Delta}C model in these simulations. Comparing the FL and {Delta}C simulations, the {Delta}C model displayed enhanced motion of the STAS domain. Furthermore, comparing the {Delta}STAS and {Delta}C simulations, the {Delta}STAS simulation failed to exhibit stable ion bindings to the sites despite the absence of the C-terminus blocking the ion transmission pathway in both systems. These results suggest that the removal of the C-terminus not only unblocks the access of ions to the permeation pathway but also triggers STAS domain motion, gating the TM domain to promote ions entry into their binding site. Further analysis revealed that the asymmetric motion of STAS domain leads to the expansion of the ion permeation pathway within the TM domain, resulting in the stiffening of the flexible TM12 helix near the ion binding site. This structural change in the TM12 helix stabilizes chloride ion binding, which is essential for SLC26A9 elevator motion. Overall, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of SLC26A9 transport and may pave the way for the development of novel treatments for diseases associated with dysregulated ion transport.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe explored the mechanism by which the human protein SLC26A9 transports chloride in the cell. SLC26A9 is a potential therapeutic target for patients with cystic fibrosis, as by targeting drugs to it, it may be possible to restore chloride ion transport in epithelial cells. To design therapeutic drugs, it is essential to understand how the protein works. Our findings support an elevator-type mechanism, in which chloride ions bind to SLC26A9 inside the cell and are then released by the protein to the extracellular environment. We find that the STAS domain of SLC26A9 has critical roles in binding chloride and induces conformational changes in the transmembrane domain that facilitate chloride transport.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle, essential for various cellular processes, is known to be precisely regulated by the underlying gene network. Accumulating evidence has revealed that the chromosome, which serves as the scaffold for the gene expressions, undergoes significant structural reorganizations during mitosis. Understanding the mechanism of the cell cycle from the molecular chromosome structural perspective remains a grand challenge. In this study, we applied an integrated approach using a data-driven model combined with a nonequilibrium landscape-switching model to investigate large-scale chromosome structural dynamics during the mitosis-to-G1 phase transition. We generated 3D chromosome structural ensembles for the five critical stages in the process. We observed that the chromosome structural expansion and adaptation of the structural asphericity do not occur synchronously. We attributed this asynchronous adaptation behavior in the chromosome structural geometry to the unique unloading sequence of the two types of condensins. Furthermore, we observed that the coherent motions between the chromosomal loci are primarily enhanced within the topologically associating domains (TADs) as cells progress to the G1 phase, suggesting that TADs can be considered as both structural and dynamical units for organizing the 3D chromosome. Our analysis also reveals that the quantified pathways of chromosome structural reorganizations during the mitosis-to-G1 phase transition exhibit high stochasticity at the single-cell level and show non-linear behaviors in changing TADs and contacts formed at the long-range regions. These features underscore the complex nature of the cell-cycle processes. Our findings, which are consistent with the experiments in many aspects, offer valuable insights into the large-scale chromosome structural dynamics after mitosis and contribute to the molecular-level understanding of the cell-cycle process.",

The majority (70%) of NUT carcinoma is associated with chromosome translocation events that lead to the formation of a BRD4-NUTM1 fusion gene. However, because the BRD4-NUTM1 gene is unequivocally cytotoxic when ectopically expressed in cell lines, there is no experimental evidence of the oncogenic potential of this fusion gene to initiate NC. We report here the first genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) for NUT carcinoma. By inducing a chromosome translocation event mirroring the human event in mouse epithelial progenitors, we demonstrated that the Brd4-Nutm1 fusion gene could induce aggressive head and neck, and skin carcinomas in mice. The tumors present similar histopathological and molecular features to human NC. As the sole immunocompetent GEMM for NC, the model will have a far-reaching impact on understanding NC oncogenesis and developing NC treatment, including targeted therapies and immune therapies in a preclinical setting, which will benefit NC patients through translational research.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the thermogenic response by brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important component of energy homeostasis with implications for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Motivated to understand how BAT function is regulated epigenetically, we reanalyzed publicly available RNA-seq data and uncovered many nodes representing epigenetic modifiers that are altered in BAT in response to chronic thermogenic activation. Thus, we hypothesized that chronic thermogenic activation broadly alters epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones in BAT. To test our hypothesis, wildtype male C57BL/6J mice were housed under chronic conditions of thermoneutral temperature (TN, 28.8{degrees}C), mild cold/room temperature (RT, 22{degrees}C), or severe cold (SC, 8{degrees}C). BAT and reference tissue liver were subsequently dissected from each mouse. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) reveals decreased methylation of promoters and intragenic regions in BAT genomic DNA in response to varying degrees of chronic cold exposure. Integration of our RRBS and the RNA-Seq dataset suggests a role for epigenetic modification of DNA in gene regulation in response to cold. To analyze histone modifications in BAT, we develop a robust method for the isolation of histones and report the first quantitation of histone H3.2 and H4 proteoforms. We initially observe that BAT and liver exhibit different histone proteoforms. Next, we report housing temperature-dependent changes in histone proteoforms in BAT. We observe differences in bivalent proteoforms such as H3{K9me2,K23ac,K36me1}, H3{K9me3,K23ac,K36me1} and H4<K8ACK16ACK20ME3>. Taken together, our results provide novel findings supporting global epigenetic modification in murine BAT in response to varying degrees of chronic cold stimuli and establish a methodology to quantitatively study histones in BAT, allowing for direct comparisons to decipher mechanistic changes during the thermogenic response.",

    "abstract": "Dengue is an arboviral disease causing severe illness in over 500,000 people each year. Currently, there is no way to constrain dengue in the clinic. Host kinase regulators of dengue virus (DENV) infection have the potential to be disrupted by existing therapeutics to prevent infection and/or disease progression. To evaluate kinase regulation of DENV infection, we performed kinase regression (KiR), a machine learning approach that predicts kinase regulators of infection using existing drug-target information and a small drug screen. We infected hepatocytes with DENV in vitro in the presence of a panel of 38 kinase inhibitors then quantified the effect of each inhibitor on infection rate. We employed elastic net regularization on these data to obtain predictions of which of 300 kinases are regulating DENV infection. Thirty-six kinases were predicted to have a functional role. Intriguingly, seven of the predicted kinases - EPH receptor A4 (EPHA4), EPH receptor B3 (EPHB3), EPH receptor B4 (EPHB4), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and ret proto-oncogene (RET) - belong to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, which are already therapeutic targets in the clinic. We demonstrate that predicted RTKs are expressed at higher levels in DENV infected cells. Knockdown of ERBB2, FGFR2 and IGF1R reduces DENV infection in hepatocytes. Finally, we observe differential temporal induction of ERBB2 and IGF1R following DENV infection, highlighting their unique roles in regulating DENV. Collectively, our findings underscore the significance of multiple RTKs in DENV infection and advocate further exploration of RTK-oriented interventions against dengue.",

    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging (fMRI) signals are famously sluggish, unfolding over several seconds after even brief sensory (and neural) events. Relative timing differences between different evoking conditions, however, can distinguish between changes in the duration or intensity of neural activity (Henson et al., 2002). Specifically, increases in stimulus duration cause a delayed response peak with a greater amplitude, whereas increases in stimulus intensity affect the peak magnitude alone. These relationships have been empirically demonstrated using stimulus durations of several seconds (Friston, 2005), but many processes relevant to cognitive psychology occur on sub-second timescales. Here we tested whether the predicted relationship between stimulus properties and the hemodynamic response held for sub-second stimuli and sub-second changes in stimulus duration. In Experiment 1 (n=15), we presented visual and auditory stimuli at three durations (100, 300, and 900 ms) and three intensities in a slow event-related design with a rapid TR (625 ms). In Experiment 2 (n=14), the stimulus durations were extended (1000, 1200, and 1800 ms) to increase the evoked signal. By fitting the observed fMRI signals to parameterised hemodynamic response functions, we found that changes in stimulus duration caused differences in peak latency and magnitude, whereas changes in stimulus intensity affected only peak magnitude. Significant effects were found for duration differences as small as 200 ms, with clearer results when a sufficiently large base signal was evoked and when a bootstrap resampling technique was used. Our results support the validity of existing models of the hemodynamic response. They also support the use of time-resolved fMRI for mental chronometry in cognitive neuroscience, thereby allowing researchers to draw additional inferences about brief mental events.",

Several pathogen including viruses activate stimulators of interferon genes (STING), and a small amount of STING agonist functions as adjuvants for sensitization to house dust mite (HDM); however, the associated mechanism is unclear. We investigated the role of STING during sensitization to HDM in airway epithelial cells.\n\nMethodsAirway epithelial cell STING expression was analyzed using the GEO database. We delivered cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a STING agonist to mice intranasally, and sorted epithelial cells and performed RNA-seq. Human airway epithelial cells (HBEpCs) were stimulated using cGAMP in vitro. Next, we sensitized mice with cGAMP and HDM, Der p1 on Day 1, and challenged with HDM on Day 7, and on Day 8, analyzed cytokine/chemokine levels, bronchoalveolar lavage cell fraction, histology, and the number of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of RANTES/CCL5 alone on sensitizing to HDM.\n\nResultsRelative to other pattern recognition receptors, TMEM173, encoding STING, was highly expressed in HBEpCs, and RANTES expression was remarkably upregulated in cGAMP-treated mice. RANTES, not IL-33 or TSLP, was also activated by cGAMP in HBEpCs, especially in the presence of H2O2. Type 2 cytokine/chemokine, eosinophil, and goblet cell metaplasia increased with ILC2 and cDC2 accumulation in cGAMP-adjuvanted HDM-sensitized mice. RANTES alone functioned as an adjuvant for induction of type 2 inflammation in mice.\n\nConclusionSTING was highly expressed in airway epithelial cells.

Pleural involvement is the most common SLE-related lung disease. Natural antibodies are rapidly secreted by innate-like B cells following perturbation of homeostasis and are important in the early stages of immune activation. The serous cavities are home to large numbers of innate-like B cells present both within serous fluid and resident within fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs). FALCs are important hubs for B-cell activation and local antibody secretion within the body cavities. Patients with SLE can develop anti-phospholipid antibodies and in rare situations develop alveolar haemorrhage. Utilising delivery of the hydrocarbon oil pristane in C57BL/6 mice as a model of SLE we identify a rapid expansion of pleural cavity B cells as early as day 3 after intra-peritoneal pristane delivery. Following pristane delivery, pericardial B1 B cells are proliferative, express the plasma-cell surface marker CD138 and secrete both innate and class switched antibodies highlighting that this cavity niche may play an unrecognised role in the initiation of lupus pleuritis.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=163 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/549766v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ea5bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23d9deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b48b3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@20a133_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "During epithelial morphogenesis, the apical junctions connecting cells must remodel as cells change shape and make new connections with their neighbors. In the C. elegans embryo, new apical junctions form when epidermal cells migrate and seal with one another to encase the embryo in skin ( ventral enclosure), and junctions remodel when epidermal cells change shape to squeeze the embryo into a worm shape ( elongation). The junctional cadherin-catenin complex (CCC), which links epithelial cells to each other and to cortical actomyosin, is essential for C. elegans epidermal morphogenesis. RNAi genetic enhancement screens have identified several proteins that interact with the CCC to promote epidermal morphogenesis, including the scaffolding protein Afadin (AFD-1), whose depletion alone results in only minor morphogenesis defects. Here, by creating a null mutation in afd-1, we show that afd-1 provides a significant contribution to ventral enclosure and elongation on its own. Unexpectedly, we find that afd-1 mutant phenotypes are strongly modified by diet, revealing a previously unappreciated maternal nutritional input to morphogenesis. We identify functional interactions between AFD-1 and the CCC by demonstrating that E-cadherin is required for the polarized distribution of AFD-1 to cell contact sites in early embryos. Finally, we show that afd-1 promotes the enrichment of polarity regulator and CCC-interacting protein PAC-1/ARHGAP21 to cell contact sites, and identify genetic interactions suggesting that afd-1 and pac-1 regulate epidermal morphogenesis at least in part through parallel mechanisms. Our findings reveal that C. elegans AFD-1 makes a significant contribution to epidermal morphogenesis and functionally interfaces with core and associated CCC proteins.",

    "abstract": "Economic and ecological consequences of invasive species make biological invasions an influential driver of global change. Monitoring the spread and impacts of non-native species is essential, but often difficult, especially during the initial stages of invasion. The Joro spider, Trichonephila clavata (L. Koch, 1878, Araneae: Araneidae), is a large-bodied orb weaver native to Asia, likely introduced to northern Georgia, U.S. around 2010. We investigated the nascent invasion of T. clavata by constructing species distribution models (SDMs) from crowdsourced data to compare the climate T. clavata experiences in its native range to its introduced range. We found evidence that the climate of T. clavatas native range differs significantly from its introduced range and that the most similar climate in North America to its native range is to the north of its current introduced range. We then compared the SDM predictions to current observations of spread. Consistent with predictions, T. clavata appears to be spreading faster to the north than to the south. Lastly, we conducted surveys to investigate potential ecological impacts of T. clavata on the diversity of native orb weaving spiders. Importantly, Trichonephila clavata was the most common and abundant species observed in the survey, and was numerically dominant at half of the sites it was present in. Our models also suggest that there is lower native orb weaver species richness and diversity closer to where T. clavata was initially found and where it has been established the longest, though human population density complicates this finding. This early study is the first to forecast how widely this spider may spread in its introduced range and explore potential ecological impacts of T. clavata, and we call for continued investigation of this invasions effects.",

    "abstract": "Although avian haemosporidian parasites are widely used as model organisms to study fundamental questions in evolutionary and behavorial ecology of host-parasite interactions, some of their basic characteristics, such as seasonal variations in within-host density, are still mostlyunknown. In addition, their interplay with host reproductive success in the wild seems to depend on the interaction of many factors, starting with host and parasite species and the temporal scale under study. Here, we monitored the intensities of infection by two haemosporidian parasites - Plasmodium relictum and P. homonucleophilum - in two wild populations of great tits (Parus major) in Switzerland over three years, to characterize their dynamics. We also collected data on birds reproductive output - laying date, clutch size, fledging success - to determine whether they were associated with infection intensity before (winter), during (spring) and after (autumn) breeding season. Both parasite species dramatically increased their within-host density in spring, in a way that was correlated to their parasitaemia in winter. Infection intensity before and during breeding season did not explain reproductive success. However, the birds which fledged the more chicks had higher parasite burdens in autumn, which were not associated with their parasite burden in previous spring. Our results tend to indicate that high haemosporidian parasite loads do not impair reproduction in great tits, but high resource allocation into reproduction can leave birds less able to maintain low parasitaemia over the following months.",

However, in a conventional ALI system, cells are cultured on a porous plastic membrane that is much stiffer than human airway tissues. Here, we develop a gel-ALI culture system by simply coating the plastic membrane with a thin layer of hydrogel with tunable stiffness matching that of healthy and fibrotic airway tissues. We determine the optimum gel thickness that does not impair the transport of nutrients and biomolecules essential to cell growth.

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular organelles regulating energy and lipid metabolism. Generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by phase separation of neutral lipids (e.g., triglycerides), nascent LDs resemble lens-shaped blisters, grow into spherical droplets, and eventually emerge from the ER membrane, generally towards the cytosol - a process known as budding. Images of both nascent and mature LDs are available, but the mechanism of biogenesis has never been observed experimentally.\n\nHere we identify the mechanism of the initial steps in LD biogenesis using computer simulations at the molecular level, emulating LD growth in ER-mimicking membranes. We find that LDs bud towards the cytosol only when sufficient asymmetry is generated between the two membrane leaflets: the budding transition is independent of membrane morphology, lipid composition, and LD size. Seipin, a protein essential for correct LD biogenesis, is per se not sufficient to promote budding, but it stabilizes LD-ER contact sites. Localization of triglyceride synthesis in the proximity of seipin is necessary to avoid nucleation of multiple LDs - a possible cause of aberrant phenotypes. In contrast, localization of phospholipid synthesis has no effect on the mechanism of budding. Our new methodology paves the way to simulations of organelle and cell biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling, carried out by multi-subunit remodeler complexes, alleviates topological constraints posed by nucleosomes to regulate genome access. Although mutations in the SWI/SNF subfamily of remodelers are implicated in >20% of human cancers, how misregulation of their intranuclear dynamics could underpin cancer remains poorly understood. Combining single-molecule tracking and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we probed the live-cell dynamics of three key subunits common to all major human SWI/SNF remodeler complexes (BAF57, BAF155 and BRG1), revealing temporally distinct modes characteristic of free and chromatin-associated diffusion and chromatin-binding. Quantifying residence times of the fully assembled remodeler complex further resolved one transient and two stable binding fractions. Moreover, super-resolved density mapping of single-molecule binding using a newly devised strategy, termed STAR, revealed heterogeneous, nanoscale remodeler binding \"hotspots\" across the nucleoplasm where multiple binding events preferentially cluster, with particular enrichment of consecutive longer-lived stable binding. Importantly, we showed that the bromodomain plays a key role in modulating the enhancement of remodeler binding dynamics in a DNA-accessibility-dependent manner, but does not facilitate targeting to hyperacetylated chromatin. Finally, we compared the chromatin-binding dynamics of seven common BRG1 mutants implicated in various cancers across tumor types, and uncovered systematic alterations in residence time, binding frequency, fraction of time bound, targeting efficiency and number of binding \"hotspots\" unique to each point/truncation mutant. Collectively, our findings shed critical insight into the multi-modal landscape regulating the spatio-temporal organizational dynamics of SWI/SNF remodelers to selectively modulate genome accessibility, and could potentially serve as quantitative, mutant-specific signatures for cancers associated with remodeling misregulation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUsing two complementary approaches, we performed, to our knowledge, the first single-molecule quantification of live-cell dynamics of the fully assembled human SWI/SNF remodeler complex by correlating three key common subunits, and uncovered distinct roles of the bromodomain in modulating chromatin binding/targeting in a DNA-accessibility-dependent manner. Our super-resolved mapping of chromatin-binding also revealed intranuclear \"hotspots\" where remodelers bind repeatedly in nanometer-scale clusters, as a potential strategy to promote remodeling at these loci. By leveraging previously under-explored parameters, our findings revealed a broader and multi-modal landscape that regulates SWI/SNF-mediated remodeling dynamics in space and time, and established the biophysical basis for aberrant remodeler-chromatin interactions associated with seven mutants implicated in various cancers, which could potentially serve as their unique identifying yardsticks.",

Here, we investigate the interaction between bedaquiline (Bq), a potent anti-tuberculosis drug, and the mycobacterial ATP synthase, to unravel the role of a specific hydrogen bond to a conserved acidic residue in the target affinity and specificity. Our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this bond belongs to the SSHB category and accounts for a substantial fraction of the target binding energy. We also demonstrate that the presence of an extra acidic residue (D32), found exclusively in mycobacteria, cooperatively enhances the HB strength ensuring the specificity for the mycobacterial target. Consistently, we show that the removal of D32 markedly weakens the affinity, leading to Bq resistance associated with mutations of D32 to non-acidic residues. By designing simple Bq analogs, we then explore the possibility to overcome the resistance and potentially broaden the Bq antimicrobial spectrum by making the SSHB independent on the presence of the extra acidic residue.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), once thought to be active exclusively at the plasma membrane, have been shown to signal from multiple intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes and the Golgi. However, the potential occurrence and functional relevance of intracellular signaling for the emerging family of metabolite-sensing GPCRs is largely unknown. Here, we used live-cell imaging, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) measurements, and functional readouts to investigate signal compartmentalization of the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4), a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR that is activated by medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs). Unexpectedly, we show that FFA4 largely resides on intracellular membranes that are intimately associated with lipid droplets in adipocytes. Upon lipolysis induction, the released FFAs rapidly bind to and activate this intracellular pool of FFA4, leading to local Gi/o coupling and inhibition of cAMP production in the vicinity of lipid droplets. This provides a spatiotemporally confined negative feedback mechanism allowing individual lipid droplets to rapidly adjust their lipolysis rate. Our results reveal a novel  intracrine signaling modality by a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR and identify a new lipid-droplet-associated signaling hub implicated in the rapid regulation of lipid metabolism, with important implications for adipocyte physiology and pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is known as \"The Silent Killer\" due to its toxic effect at high concentrations, leading to an impairment in oxygen storage, delivery, and use. The cytotoxicity of CO is due to its high affinity for transition metals, such as iron, where CO outcompetes oxygen for the heme binding sites on hemoproteins in the body. CO is made in vivo in most organisms as a byproduct of heme degradation via heme oxygenase enzymes. Certain species of deep-diving marine mammals with high quantities of hemoproteins in blood and skeletal muscle have naturally elevated concentrations of CO in these tissues. To date, there exist few data on extravascular tissue CO content in wild animals. This study aims to characterize CO concentrations in nine different tissues from stranded Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We found three tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and spleen) have higher CO concentrations than other tissues. In a subset of samples from animals that tested positive for dolphin morbillivirus, the CO content in their kidney and liver was lower when compared to animals that tested negative. The mean CO concentration found in every tissue from dolphins was higher than those previously reported in healthy rodents. However, the skeletal muscle CO concentrations in dolphins from this study were much lower than those of deep-diving elephant seals. These results highlight the diversity and pattern of CO found in different tissues from bottlenose dolphins and continues to show that the heme oxygenase/carbon monoxide pathway appears to be critical for air-breathing divers.",

Here we quantified firing of cortical neurons using Hawkes process modeling that can model sequential random events exhibiting temporal clusters. \"Intensity\" is a parameter of Hawkes process that defines the probability of an event occurring. We defined the appearance of repetitive firing as the firing intensity corresponding to \"intensity\" in Hawkes process. Firing patterns were quantified by the magnitude of firing intensity, the time constant of firing intensity, and the background firing intensity. The higher the magnitude of firing intensity, the higher the likelihood that the spike will continue. The larger the time constant of firing intensity, the longer the repetitive firing lasts. The higher the background firing intensity, the more likely neurons fire randomly. The magnitude of firing intensity was inversely proportional to the time constant of firing intensity, and non-REM sleep increased the magnitude of firing intensity and decreased the time constant of firing intensity. The background firing intensity was not affected by the sleep/wake state. Our findings suggest that the cortex is organized such that neurons with a higher probability of repetitive firing have shorter repetitive firing periods. In addition, our results suggest that repetitive firing is ordered to become high frequency and short term during non-REM sleep, while unregulated components of firing are independent of the sleep/wake state in the cortex. Hawkes process modeling of firing will reveal novel properties of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Photomodulable fluorescent probes are drawing an increasing attention due to their applications in advanced bioimaging. Whereas photoconvertible probes can be advantageously used in tracking, photoswitchable probes constitute key tools for single molecule localization microscopy to perform super resolution imaging. Herein we shed light on a red and far-red BODIPY, namely BDP-576 and BDP-650 possessing both properties of conversion and switching. Our study demonstrates that theses pyrrolyl-BODIPYs respectively convert towards typical green- and red-emitting BODIPYs that are perfectly adapted to microscopy. We also showed that these pyrrolyl-BODIPYs undergo Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion, a photoconversion mechanism that we recently introduced and where the pyrrole moiety plays a central role. These unique features were used to develop targeted photoconvertible probes towards different organelles or subcellular units (plasma membrane, mitochondria, nucleus, actin, Golgi apparatus, etc.) using chemical targeting moieties and Halo tag. We notably showed that BDP-650 could be used to track intracellular vesicles over more than 20 minutes in two color imaging with laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrating its robustness. The switching properties of these photoconverters were studied at the single molecule level and were then successfully used in live Single Molecule Localization Microscopy in epithelial cells and neurons. Both membrane and mitochondria targeted probes could be used to decipher membrane 3D architecture and mitochondria dynamics at the nanoscale. This study builds a bridge between the photoconversion and photoswitching properties of probes undergoing directed photooxidation and shows the versatility and efficacy of this mechanism in live advanced imaging.",

Transcriptomic analyses of HSCs isolated from mice defined the murine ortholog of TILAM. We then generated Tilam-deficient GFP reporter mice and quantified fibrotic responses to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and choline-deficient L-amino acid defined high fat diet (CDA-HFD). Co-precipitation studies, mass spectrometry, and gene expression analyses identified protein partners of TILAM.\n\nResultsTILAM is conserved between human and mouse HSCs and regulates expression of ECM proteins, including collagen. Tilam is selectively induced in HSCs during the development of fibrosis in vivo. In both male and female mice, loss of Tilam results in reduced fibrosis in the setting of CCl4 and CDA-HFD injury models. TILAM interacts with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) to stabilize PML protein levels and promote the fibrotic activity of HSCs.\n\nConclusionTILAM is activated in HSCs and interacts with PML to drive the development of liver fibrosis. Depletion of TILAM may serve as a therapeutic approach to combat the development of end stage liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Many macromolecules in biological systems exist in the form of helical polymers. However, the inherent polymorphism and heterogeneity of samples complicate the reconstruction of helical polymers from cryo-EM images. Currently available 2D classification methods are effective at separating particles of interest from contaminants, but they do not effectively differentiate between polymorphs, resulting in heterogeneity in the 2D classes. As such, it is crucial to develop a method that can computationally divide a dataset of polymorphic helical structures into homogenous subsets. In this work, we utilized deep-learning language models to embed the filaments as vectors in hyperspace and group them into clusters. Tests with both simulated and experimental datasets have demonstrated that our method - HLM (Helical classification with Language Model) can effectively distinguish different types of filaments, in the presence of many contaminants and low signal-to-noise ratios. We also demonstrate that HLM can isolate homogeneous subsets of particles from a publicly available dataset, resulting in the discovery of a previously unknown non-proteinaceous density around tau filaments.",

    "abstract": "Addiction to the WRN helicase is a unique vulnerability of human cancers with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H). However, while prolonged loss of WRN ultimately leads to cell death, little is known about how MSI-H cancers initially respond to acute loss of WRN, knowledge that would be helpful for informing clinical development of WRN-targeting therapy, predicting possible resistance mechanisms, and identifying useful biomarkers of successful WRN inhibition. Here, we report the construction of an inducible ligand-mediated degradation system wherein the stability of endogenous WRN protein can be rapidly and specifically tuned, enabling us to track the complete sequence of cellular events elicited by acute loss of WRN function. We find that WRN degradation leads to immediate accrual of DNA damage in a replication-dependent manner that curiously did not robustly engage checkpoint mechanisms to halt DNA synthesis. As a result, WRN-degraded MSI-H cancer cells accumulate DNA damage across multiple replicative cycles and undergo successive rounds of increasingly aberrant mitoses, ultimately triggering cell death. Of potential therapeutic importance, we find no evidence of any generalized mechanism by which MSI-H cancers could adapt to near-complete loss of WRN. However, under conditions of partial WRN degradation, addition of low dose ATR inhibitor significantly increased their combined efficacy to levels approaching full inactivation of WRN. Overall, our results provided the first comprehensive view of molecular events linking upstream inhibition of WRN to subsequent cell death and suggested a potential therapeutical rationale for dual targeting of WRN and ATR.",

However, TMB is not significantly associated with favorable prognosis from Preclinical and clinical studies. It implys that except for TMB, other mechanisms should be needed to contribute to successful cancer immunotherapy. We found that the hyperactivation of PANoptotic effective molecules in dMMR tumor cells caused cell membrane damage, and induced ESCRT mediated membrane repair, and protectd tumor cells from the damage caused by Triton X100, while DNA mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) tumor cells were sensitive to Triton X100 mediating cell membrane damage due to the lack of ESCRT mediated membrane repair. There were hyperactivation of GSDMD, GSDME and p-MLKL in dMMR tumor cells. Co-treatment of IFN-{gamma} and TNF- induced rapid death of dMMR tumor cells by inducing PANoptosis including pyroptosis, apoptosis not necrosis. pMMR tumor cells had defects in PANoptosis pathway and were resistant to co-treatment of IFN-{gamma} and TNF-.

    "abstract": "Plant roots sense many physical and chemical cues in soil, such as gravity, humidity, light and chemical gradients, and respond by redirecting their growth towards or away from the source of the stimulus. This process is generally called tropism. While gravitropism is the tendency to align growth with the gravitational field, electrotropism is the alignment with external electric fields and the induced ionic currents. Although root tropisms are at the core of their ability to explore large volumes of soil in search of water and nutrients, the molecular and physical mechanisms underlying most of them remain poorly understood. We have previously provided a quantitative characterisation of root electrotropism in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) primary roots exposed for 5 hours to weak electric fields, showing that auxin asymmetric distribution is not necessary but that cytokinin biosynthesis is. Here, we extend that study showing that long-term electrotropism is characterised by a complex behaviour. We describe overshoot and habituation as key traits of long-term root electrotropism in Arabidopsis and provide quantitative data about the role of past exposures in the response to electric fields (hysteresis). On the molecular side, we show that cytokinin, although necessary for root electrotropism, is not asymmetrically distributed during the bending.\n\nOverall, the data presented here represent a significant step forward towards the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating electrotropism in plants, and provide a quantitative platform for future studies on the genetics of this and other tropisms.",

    "abstract": "The inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, is made up of endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin protein forms a bond with VE-cadherin from neighbouring cells (homophilic bond) to determine the size of gaps between the cells and thereby regulate the size of particles that can cross the endothelium. Chemical cues such as Thrombin, along with mechanical properties of the cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) are known to affect the permeability of endothelial cells. Abnormal permeability is found in patients suffering from diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and COVID-19. Even though some of the regulatory mechanisms affecting endothelial permeability are well studied, details of how several mechanical and chemical stimuli acting simultaneously affect endothelial permeability are not yet understood.\n\nIn this article, we present a continuum-level mechanical modelling framework to study the highly dynamic nature of the VE-cadherin bonds. Taking inspiration from the catch-slip behaviour that VE-cadherin complexes are known to exhibit, we model VE-cadherin homophilic bond as cohesive contact with damage following a traction-separation law. We explicitly model the actin-cytoskeleton, and substrate to study their role in permeability. Our studies show that mechano-chemical coupling is necessary to simulate the influence of the mechanical properties of the substrate on permeability. Simulations show that shear between cells is responsible for the variation in permeability between bi-cellular and tri-cellular junctions, explaining the phenotypic differences observed in experiments. An increase in the magnitude of traction force that endothelial cells experience results in increased permeability, and it is found that the effect is higher on stiffer ECM. Finally, we show that the cylindrical monolayer exhibits higher permeability than the planar monolayer under unconstrained cases. Thus, we present a contact mechanics-based mechano-chemical model to investigate the variation in permeability of endothelial monolayer due to multiple loads acting simultaneously.",

To enhance knowledge our about the mechanism underlying this effect, we analysed the oils toxicological potential in vitro. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, pro-oxidant, and antioxidant activities were evaluated in a V79-4 cell line. The oil was obtained using the Soxhlet method, and the proportions of the fatty acid profile was previously identified 43.74 % saturated and 34.65 % unsaturated fatty acids. Protocol 487 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was employed for cell line selection and concentrations. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTT assay and clonogenic survival. Pro-oxidant and antioxidant activities were analysed using flow cytometry. Genotoxicity was evaluated using comet and micronucleus assays. The oil did not demonstrate cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 500 {micro}g/mL. At concentrations of 250 and 500 {micro}g/mL, the oil exerted a protective effect against oxidative stress and showed genotoxic effects only at the highest concentration (2000 {micro}g/mL). Like other oils of interest for human health, the oil extracted from the visceral fat of C. yacare demonstrated low toxicological potential in vitro.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe oil from Caiman yacare visceral fat presents low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, highlighting its potential for therapeutic applications without adverse effects.",

Telomere overhang formation relies on the coordinated interplay between DNA synthesis and exonuclease activity. DCLRE1B/hSNM1B/Apollo generates an initial resection at the newly synthesized, blunt-ended leading strand telomere. This resection is thought to be required for further nucleolytic processing at the leading strand telomere. Here, we investigated the functional relevance of Apollo in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by generating Apollo deficient cells. Leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated locally haploid hPSCs (loHAPs) that lack one allele of Apollo. Subsequently, we mutated the remaining Apollo allele and monitored the resultant allele spectrum over 3 weeks. Surprisingly, cells survived regardless of Apollo status. These results suggest that, in hPSCs, Apollo is not acutely essential for cellular survival.",

    "abstract": "Secretory granules (SGs) are crucial for normal animal physiology due to their role in regulated exocytosis of biologically active molecules. SG membranes are enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and cholesterol, and previous studies suggest lipid composition is important for SG biogenesis and function. Nonetheless, the molecular details of how lipids are regulated during SG biogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Oxysterol binding protein (Osbp) as a novel regulator of SG biogenesis in a Drosophila model. We show Osbp expression level positively correlates with SG size and that Osbp requires type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KII) to increase SG size. Moreover, Osbp is needed for proper PI4KII and PI4P distribution, autophagic resolution and formation of cholesterol-rich endosomal tubules that are positive for PI4KII. Feeding larvae food supplemented with sterol leads to partial suppression of SG size and PI4P distribution defects in Osbp mutants. Our results indicate that reciprocal regulation of Osbp and PI4KII drives formation of membrane tubules that mediate SG maturation through elevating PI4P levels on SG membranes.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/551178v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (67K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19566fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19beeadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@52e048org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1029b3c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIOsbp is needed for formation of PI4KII-positive endosomal tubules that enrich secretory granule membranes with PI4P and facilitate granule maturation.\nC_LIO_LIReciprocally, PI4KII is needed for Osbp-mediated secretory granule growth in salivary gland cells.\nC_LIO_LIChanges in Osbp expression levels alter autophagy initiation and autophagosome resolution in salivary gland cells.\nC_LIO_LIPI4KII-positive endosomal tubules are enriched in sterols, and sterol feeding suppresses defects caused by loss of Osbp.\nC_LI",
