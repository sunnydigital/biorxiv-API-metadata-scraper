    "abstract": "Marine-phase salmonid aquaculture is a major component of the coastal economies of Northern Europe, North America and Chile and is under threat from numerous challenges to gill health, many of which originate from the phyto- and zooplankton. Associated losses are growing as a proportion of production year on year. A first step towards mitigating losses is to characterize the biological drivers of poor gill health. Numerous planktonic species have been implicated, including toxic and siliceous microalgae, hydrozoans and scyphozoans; however, rigorous longitudinal surveys of planktonic diversity and gill health have been lacking. In the current study, we present and assess an  exhaustive identification approach combining both morphological and molecular methods (environmental DNA metabarcoding) approaches in combination with robust statistical models to identify the planktonic drivers of complex gill disease (CGD) and fish mortality. We undertook longitudinal molecular and microscopic evaluation at two marine aquaculture facilities on the west coast of Scotland using daily data collected during the 2021 growing season (March-October). Examining these two different sites, one sheltered and one exposed to the open sea, we identified new, important, and unexpected planktonic drivers (e.g. doliolids and appendicularians) of CGD and mortality and confirmed the significance of some established threats (e.g. hydrozoans and diatoms). We also explored delayed or  lagged effects of planktonic abundances on gill health and undertook a comparison of environmental DNA metabarcoding and microscopy in their ability to identify and quantify planktonic species. Our data highlight the diversity of planktonic threats to salmonid aquaculture as well as the importance of using both molecular and morphological approaches to detect those. Despite our study relying on two farm sites only, our results evidence the role of the different planktonic players on salmon gill disease; there is now an urgent need to expand systematic longitudinal molecular and morphological approach across multiple sites and over multiple years. The resultant catalogue of main biological drivers will enable early warning systems, new treatments and, ultimately, a sustainable platform for future salmonid aquaculture in the marine environment.",

    "abstract": "Cell therapies such as Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) therapy have shown promise in the treatment of patients with refractory solid tumors, with improvement in response rates and durability of responses nevertheless sought. To identify targets capable of enhancing the anti-tumor activity of T cell therapies, large-scale in vitro and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens were performed, with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) gene identified as a top T cell-enhancing target. In murine CD8 T cell therapy models, SOCS1 served as a critical checkpoint in restraining the accumulation of T central memory cells in lymphoid organs as well as intermediate (Texint) and effector (Texeff) exhausted T cell subsets derived from progenitor exhausted T cell (Texprog) cells in tumors. A comprehensive CRISPR tiling screen of the SOCS1 coding region identified sgRNAs targeting the SH2 domain of SOCS1 as the most potent, with a sgRNA with minimal off-target cut sites used to manufacture KSQ-001, an engineered TIL therapy with SOCS1 inactivated by CRISPR/Cas9. KSQ-001 possessed increased responsiveness to cytokine signals and enhanced in vivo anti-tumor function in mouse models. These data demonstrate the use of CRISPR/Cas9 screens in the rational design of T cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "The vaginal bacterial community plays a crucial role in preventing infections. The composition of this community can be classified into five main groups, termed community state types (CSTs). Four of these CSTs, which are primarily consisted of Lactobacillus species, are considered healthy, while the fifth, which is composed of non-Lactobacillus populations, is considered less protective. This latter CST is often considered to represent a state termed Bacterial vaginosis (BV) - a common disease condition associated with unpleasant symptoms and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted diseases. However, the exact mechanisms underlying BV development are not yet fully understood, including specifically, the dynamics of the vaginal microbiome in BV, and the possible routes it may take from a healthy to a BV state. This study aims to identify the progression from healthy Lactobacillus-dominant populations to symptomatic BV by analyzing 8,026 vaginal samples and using a manifold-detection framework. This approach is inspired by single-cell analysis and aims to identify low-dimensional trajectories in the high-dimensional composition space. This framework further order samples along these trajectories and assign a score (pseudo-time) to each sample based on its proximity to the BV state. Our results reveal distinct routes of progression between healthy and BV state for each CST, with pseudo-time scores correlating with community diversity and quantifying the health state of each sample. BV indicators, including Nugent score, positive Amsels test, and several Amsels criteria, can also be successfully predicted based on pseudo-time scores. Additionally, Gardnerella vaginalis can be identified as a key taxon in BV development using this approach, with increased abundance in samples with high pseudo-time, indicating an unhealthier state across all BV-development routes on the manifold. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how manifold detection can be used to successfully characterizes the progression from healthy Lactobacillus-dominant populations to BV and to accurately quantify the health condition of new samples along the route of BV development.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella species that cause respiratory infections in mammals include B. pertussis, which causes human whooping cough, and B. bronchiseptica, which infects nearly all mammals. Both bacterial species produce filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB) and adenylyl cyclase toxin (ACT), prominent surface-associated and secreted virulence factors that contribute to persistence in the lower respiratory tract by inhibiting clearance by phagocytic cells. FhaB and ACT proteins interact with themselves, each other, and host cells. Using immunoblot analyses, we showed that ACT binds to FhaB preferentially on the bacterial surface before being released into the extracellular environment. We showed that SphB1, a surface protease identified based on its ability to cleave FhaB, also cleaves ACT, and we showed that the presence of ACT blocks SphB1-dependent and independent cleavage of FhaB, but the presence of FhaB does not block SphB1-dependent cleavage of ACT. SphB1-dependent cleavage of ACT occurs proximally to ACTs active site, and hence is predicted to inactivate ACT. We also showed that FhaB-bound ACT can intoxicate host cells producing CR3, the receptor for ACT. In addition to increasing our understanding of FhaB, ACT, and ACT interactions on the Bordetella surface, our data support a model in which FhaB functions as a novel toxin delivery system by binding to ACT and allowing its release upon binding of ACT to its receptor, CR3, on phagocytic cells.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYBacteria need to control the variety, abundance, and conformation of proteins on the cellular surface to survive. Members of the Gram-negative bacterial genus Bordetella include B. pertussis, which causes whooping cough in humans, and B. bronchiseptica, which causes respiratory infections in a broad range of mammals. These extremely closely related species produce two prominent virulence factors, the two-partner secretion (TPS) effector FhaB and Adenylyl cyclase toxin (ACT), that interact with themselves, each other, and host cells. In this work, we showed that ACT binds preferentially to FhaB on the bacterial surface before being released into the extracellular environment. We showed that the exoprotease SphB1, which cleaves FhaB, also cleaves ACT. We showed that ACT that is bound to FhaB can be delivered to CR3+ host cells. Our data support a model in which FhaB functions to deliver ACT specifically to phagocytic cells, and not epithelial cells. This is the first report of a TPS system facilitating delivery of a separate polypeptide toxin to target cells and expands our understanding of how these systems contribute to bacterial pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology relies on the screening and quantification of genetic components to assemble sophisticated gene circuits with specific functions. Microscopy is powerful tool for characterizing complex cellular phenotypes with increasing spatial and temporal resolution to library screening of genetic elements. Microscopy-based assays are powerful tools for characterizing cellular phenotypes with spatial and temporal resolution, and can be applied to large-scale samples for library screening of genetic elements. However, strategies for high-throughput microscopy experiments remain limited. Here, we present a high-throughput, microscopy-based platform that can simultaneously complete the preparation of an 8x12-well agarose pads plate, allowing for the screening of 96 independent strains or experimental conditions in a single experiment. Using this platform, we screened a library of natural intrinsic promoters from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and identified a small subset of robust promoters that drives stable levels of gene expression under varying growth conditions. Additionally, the platform allowed for single-cell measurement of genetic elements over time, enabling the identification of complex and dynamic phenotypes to map genotype in high-throughput. We expected that the platform could be employed to accelerate the identification and characterization of genetic elements in various biological systems, as well as to understand the relationship between cellular phenotypes and internal states, including genotypes and gene expression programs.\n\nImpact statementThe high-throughput microscopy-based platform, presented in this study, enables efficient screening of 96 independent strains or experimental conditions in a single experiment, facilitating the rapid identification of genetic elements with desirable features, thereby advancing synthetic biology. The robust promoters identified through this platform, which provide predictable and consistent control over gene expression under varying growth conditions, can be utilized as reliable tools to regulate gene expression in various biological applications, including synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and gene therapy, where consistent system performance is required.",

Unlike lean animals, dietary-induced NAFLD mice showed hepatic co-declined LysTTT-5tRF and miR-194-5p levels, restored following hepatic steatosis-suppressing miR-132 antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Moreover, exposing human-derived Hep G2 cells to oleic acid for 7 days co-suppressed miR-194-5p and LysTTT-5tRF levels while increasing lipid accumulation. Importantly, transfecting fattened cells with a synthetic LysTTT-5tRF mimic elevated the metabolic regulator {beta}-Klotho mRNA levels while declining triglyceride amounts by 30% within 24 hours. In contradistinction, antisense suppression of miR-194-5p induced accumulation of its novel target, the NAFLD-implicated lipid droplet-coating PLIN2 protein. Further, two out of 15 steatosis-alleviating screened drug repurposing compounds, Danazol and Latanoprost elevated miR-194-5p or LysTTT-5tRF levels.

    "abstract": "While the elements encoding enhancers and promoters have been relatively well studied, the full spectrum of insulator elements which bind the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), is relatively poorly characterised. This is partly due to the genomic context of CTCF sites greatly influencing their roles and activity. Here we have developed an experimental system to determine the ability of consistently sized, individual CTCF elements to interpose between enhancers and promoters and thereby reduce gene expression during differentiation. Importantly, each element is tested in the identical location thereby minimising the effect of genomic context. We found no correlation between the ability of CTCF elements to block enhancer-promoter activity with the amount of CTCF or cohesin bound at the natural genomic sites of these elements; the degree of evolutionary conservation; or their resemblance to the consensus core sequences. Nevertheless, we have shown that the strongest enhancer-promoter blockers include a previously described bound element lying upstream of the CTCF core motif. In addition, we found other uncharacterised DNaseI footprints located close to the core motif that may affect function. We have developed an assay of CTCF sequences which will enable researchers to sub-classify CTCF elements in a uniform and unbiased way.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn advanced atherosclerotic lesions, apoptotic cell death of plaque macrophages results in necrotic core formation and plaque vulnerability. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a mitochondria-specific cyclophilin involved in the process of cell death after organ ischemia-reperfusion. However, the role of CypD in atherosclerosis, especially in necrotic core formation, is unknown.\n\nMethodsTo clarify the specific role of CypD, apolipoprotein-E/CypD-double knockout (ApoE-/-CypD-/-) mice were generated. These mice were fed a high-fat diet containing 0.15% cholesterol for 24 weeks to accelerate atherosclerotic lesion development.\n\nResultsThe deletion of CypD decreased the necrotic core size, accompanied by a reduction of macrophage apoptosis compared to control ApoE-/- mice. In RAW264.7 cells treated with endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer thapsigargin, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol was attenuated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CypD. Ly-6Chigh inflammatory monocytes in the peripheral blood leukocytes and mRNA expression of Il1b in the aorta were decreased by the deletion of CypD. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CypD did not significantly decrease Il1b nor Ccl2 mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS and IFN-{gamma}, suggesting that inhibition of inflammation in vivo is likely due to decreased cell death in the atherosclerotic lesions rather than a direct action of CypD deletion on the macrophage.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first report showing that CypD induces macrophage death and promotes necrotic core formation in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. CypD could be a novel therapeutic target for treating atherosclerotic vascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Persistent tuberculosis (TB) in cattle populations in England has been associated with an exchange of infection with badgers (Meles meles). A badger control policy (BCP) commenced in 2013. Its aim was to decrease TB in cattle by reducing the badger population available to provide a wildlife reservoir for bovine TB. Monitoring data from 52 BCP intervention areas 200-1600 km2 in size, starting over several years, were used to estimate the change in TB incidence rate in cattle herds, which was associated with time since the start of the BCP in each area. A Difference in Differences analysis addressed the non-random selection and starting sequence of the areas. Herd incidence rate of TB reduced by 56% (95% Confidence Interval 43-67%) up to the fourth year of BCP interventions, with the largest reductions in the second and third years. There was insufficient evidence to judge whether incidence rate reduced further beyond four years. These estimates are the most precise for the timing of decline in cattle TB associated with interventions primarily targeting badgers. They are within the range of previous estimates from England and Ireland. This analysis indicates the importance of reducing transmission from badgers to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle, noting that vaccination of badgers, fertility control and on farm biosecurity may also achieve this effect.",

    "abstract": "The ligand-regulated PAS domains are one of the most diverse signal-integrating domains found in proteins from prokaryotes to humans. By biochemically connecting cellular processes with their environment, PAS domains facilitate an appropriate cellular response. PAS domain-containing Kinase (PASK) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase that plays important signaling roles in mammalian stem cells to establish stem cell fate. We have recently shown that the nuclear translocation of PASK is stimulated by differentiation signaling cues in muscle stem cells. However, the mechanistic basis of the regulation of PASK nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation remains unknown. Here, we show that the PAS-A domain of PASK contains a putative monopartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif. This NLS is inhibited in cells via intramolecular association with a short linear motif, termed the PAS Interacting Motif (PIM), found upstream of the kinase domain. The interaction between the PAS-A domain and PIM is evolutionarily conserved and serves to retain PASK in the cytosol in the absence of signaling cues. Consistent with that, we show that metabolic inputs induce PASK nuclear import, likely by disrupting the PAS-A: PIM association. We suggest that a route for such linkage may occur through the PAS-A ligand binding cavity in that we have previously described and show here that PIM recruitment and artificial ligand binding to the PAS-A domain occur at neighboring locations that could facilitate metabolic control of the PAS-PIM interaction. Thus, the PAS-A domain of PASK integrates metabolic signaling cues for nuclear translocation and could be targeted to control the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in stem cells.",

    "abstract": "The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is a complex regulator of synaptic plasticity in glutamatergic neurons. Understanding its molecular function is key to elucidate the neurobiology of memory and learning, stress regulation, and multiple neurological and psychiatric diseases. The recent development of anti-Arc nanobodies has promoted the characterization of the molecular structure and function of Arc. This study aimed to validate two anti-Arc nanobodies, E5 and H11, as selective modulators of the human Arc N-lobe (Arc-NL), a domain that mediates several molecular functions of Arc through its peptide ligand binding site. The structural characteristics of recombinant Arc-NL-nanobody complexes were solved at atomic resolution using X-ray crystallography. The structures revealed that both anti-Arc nanobodies specifically bind to the multi-peptide binding site of Arc-NL. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the Arc-NL-nanobody interactions occur at nanomolar affinity, and that the nanobodies can displace a TARP{gamma}2-derived peptide from the Arc-NL binding site. Thus, both anti-Arc-NL nanobodies can be used in vitro as competitive inhibitors of endogenous Arc ligands. Differences in the CDR3 loops between the two nanobodies indicate that the spectrum of short linear motifs recognized by the Arc-NL should be expanded. We provide a robust biochemical background to support the use of anti-Arc nanobodies in attempts to target Arc-dependent synaptic plasticity. Function-blocking anti-Arc nanobodies could eventually help unravel the complex neurobiology of synaptic plasticity and help diagnose and treat Arc-associated synaptic disorders.",

    "abstract": "The complex of methyltransferase-like proteins 3 and 14 (METTL3-14) is the major enzyme that deposits N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on mRNA in humans. METTL3-14 plays key roles in various biological processes through its methyltransferase (MTase) activity. However, little is known about its substrate recognition and methyl transfer mechanism from its cofactor and methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Here, we study the MTase mechanism of METTL3-14 by a combined experimental and multiscale simulation approach using bisubstrate analogues (BAs), conjugates of a SAM-like moiety connected to the N6-atom of adenosine. Molecular dynamics simulations based on crystal structures of METTL3-14 with BAs suggest that the Y406 side chain of METTL3 is involved in the recruitment of adenosine and release of m6A. A crystal structure representing the transition state of methyl transfer shows a direct involvement of the METTL3 side chains E481 and K513 in adenosine binding which is supported by mutational analysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energy calculations indicate that methyl transfer occurs without prior deprotonation of adenosine-N6. Furthermore, the QM/MM calculations provide further support for the role of electrostatic contributions of E481 and K513 to catalysis. The multidisciplinary approach used here sheds light on the (co)substrate binding mechanism, catalytic step, and (co)product release catalysed by METTL3, and suggests that the latter step is rate-limiting. The atomistic information on the substrate binding and methyl transfer reaction of METTL3 can be useful for understanding the mechanisms of other RNA MTases and for the design of transition state analogues as their inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) chromosomal ten PBPs and one class-A {beta}-lactamase (blaC) were implicated in multi-drug resistance against penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenem drugs. The E. coli Class-A PBP1A and PBP1B proteins referred as PonA1 and PonA2 in Mt with 34% homologies whereas Class-B PBP2 referred as PbpA and PbpB sub-class proteins with 27% homologies. The class-C PBPs were, PBP4, MecA_N, DacB1, DacB2 and AmpH1- AmpH4. During database search, we found that many Mt Pbp4 had no homology to E. coli PBP4 and such enzyme were found to be AmpH class with AmpC, ACC, DHA and GES {beta}- lactamases similarities although one of such enzymes suggested as AmpH but the other referred as DacB or PBP5 in the literature. We investigated the Mt whole genomes (accession nos. AL123456, CP001642, CP054013, CP001641, CP025597) to get authentic PBP4 in Mt strain FDAARGOS_757 genome (protein id. AUP69687, 34% homology to E. coli PBP4) which was designated as conserved protein in chromosomes of Mt strains H37Rv, H37Rv-1, GG-36-11 and CCDC5180 making confusion in data analysis. Similarly, we BLASTP homology searched with plasmid-mediated 24 {beta}-lactamases suggested that four blaAmpH genes, (AmpH1, AmpH2, AmpH3 and AmpH4) predominantly control the degradation of cephalosporins in M. tuberculosis but such genes were found as pseudogenes in M. leprae. The Mt AmpH1/2/3/4 enzymes had better homologies with V. parahaemolyticus and Yersinia pekkanenii AmpH enzyme as well as with E. coli AmpH enzyme. The DacB1 (PBP6) and DacB2 (PBP7) enzymes had blaTEM similarity but no AmpH similarity indicating blaC and DacB1/B2 controlled the Penicillin hydrolysis in Mt. The blaC enzyme had 30% homology to S. aureus blaZ {beta}-lactamase but such enzyme was also missing in M. leprae. Homology search suggested that carbapenem hydrolysis by blaOXA-23/51-like PBPA/B enzymes and blaOXA-58 related MecA_N domain {beta}-lactamase which has 21% similarity to S. aureus mecA enzyme. The PonA1/A2 had no homology to 24 classes of {beta}-lactamases but still were popular enzymes implicated for better penicillin hydrolysis. We designed primers for Mt PBPs to check transcription of individual genes by RT-PCR as well as to check chromosomal locus by BLASTN search after WGS. The E. coli genome had no similarities to blaAmpH1/2/3/4 genes but a 17nt (5- CCTTGGTGCCGTCGACC-3) sequence found in pKEC-a3c plasmid of C. fruendii with homology to blaAmpH4 gene (nt. 1236-1252) and shared a homology with IS1182-like ISKpn6 transposase of plasmids. The oligonucleotides selected many Mt chromosomes and located conserved blaAmpH4 protein in all cases. However, D435E and F495V mutations in the Mt strain 5521 blaAmpH4 were evident and frameshift deletions located in Mt stain FDAARGOS_756 blaAmpH4 gene with no protein was made. Thus, mutations, deletions and rearrangements mediated by IS-elements were the driving force to make new AmpH genes in M. tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates into amyloid fibrils in Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. In these tauopathies, tau is hyperphosphorylated, suggesting that this posttranslational modification may induce pathological tau aggregation. Tau is also phosphorylated in normal developing brains. To investigate how tau phosphorylation induces amyloid fibrils, here we report the atomic structures of two phospho-mimetic full-length tau fibrils assembled without anionic cofactors. One set of phospho-mimetic mutations is targeted by the antibody AT8, while the other set is targeted by the antibody PHF1. Solid-state NMR and cryo-electron microscopy data reveal that AT8 tau forms a unique triangular fibril core that encompasses the entire C-terminal third of the protein, whereas PHF1 tau forms a triple-stranded core. These results demonstrate that specific post-translational modifications induce structurally specific tau aggregates. We propose that these aggregates may evolve into pathological filaments under suitable cellular conditions or remain as transient species in normal brains.",

In this study, a combination of LC-HRMS and GC-MS analytical approaches was used to analyse the whole metabolic changes of a marine sourced Penicillium restrictum strain isolated from a marine shellfish area. The P. restrictum MMS417 strain was grown on seven different media including an ecological one with two different water sources (synthetic sea water and distilled water) conditions following the OSMAC approach. Extracts of all media were analysed by LC-HRMS (lipids and specialised metabolites profiling) and GC-MS (fatty acids profiling). Aquired data were analysed using a multiblock strategy to highlight metabolic modification in regards to water conditions and to environmentally relevant conditions (mussel-based culture medium). This revealed that fatty acid composition of lipids was the most altered part of the explored metabolisms either looking to water effect and to environmentally relevant conditions. In particular, data showed that P. restrictum MMS417 is able to produce lipids that include fatty acids usually produced by the mussel itself. This study also provides insight into the P. restrictum adaptation to marine salinity through fatty acids alteration. and shows that lipid metabolisms if far more altered in an OSMAC approach than the specialized metabolism. This study finally highlights the need for using environnement-mimicking culture conditions to reveal the metabolic potentialities of marine microbes.",

    "abstract": "Prochlorococcus are the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic organisms on Earth, contributing up to 50% of the chlorophyll in the oligotrophic oceans. Despite being important in regulating the carbon cycle in todays ocean, the ecological significance of Prochlorococcus in Earths history remains elusive. Our new robustly calibrated molecular clock reveals that Prochlorococcus emerged in the deep photic zone of the Tonian oceans. The classical antenna for light harvesting in Cyanobacteria, the phycobilisome, was replaced in Prochlorococcus by the chlorophyllLbased lightLharvesting complex enabling more efficient use of blue light that penetrated to deeper water. Importantly, Prochlorococcus colonization of deep water enhanced access to phosphate, which was rich in upwelled seawater, but likely scarce in the Tonian surface ocean, promoting expansion of Prochlorococcus and associated photosynthetic oxygen production. Colonization of deeper waters would also have improved access to ammonium, leading to the neutral loss of nitrate utilization genes. Our research thus documents the conspicuous emergence of new photosynthetic bacterial lineages in the run-up to the Neoproterozoic oxygenation event, implying an additional layer of eco-evolutionary complexity during this pivotal interval in Earths history.\n\nSignificanceDespite being important in todays oceans, the ecological significance of Prochlorococcus in the past remains elusive. By  borrowing fossils from photosynthetic eukaryotes and leveraging the sequential Bayesian dating approach, we have developed a new pipeline for dating the evolution of Prochlorococcus, which systematically quantifies the uncertainties in using different fossil calibrations, molecular datasets, species tree topologies and molecular clock models. Our analyses pin-pointed the origin of Prochlorococcus to the phosphorous-limited Tonian oceans. The changes in the photosynthetic apparatus in early Prochlorococcus enabled them to colonize the phosphorus-rich deep photic niches, which would have led to increased primary productivity and oxygen release, likely contributing to the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event.",

    "abstract": "Screening programs for colorectal cancer (CRC) have had a profound impact on the morbidity and mortality of this disease by detecting and removing early cancers and precancerous adenomas with colonoscopy. However, CRC continues to be the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and woman, partly because of limitations in colonoscopy-based screening. Thus, novel strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of screening colonoscopy are urgently needed. Here, we propose to address this need using an optical biopsy technique based on spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT). The depth resolved images obtained with OCT are analyzed as a function of wavelength to measure optical tissue properties. The optical properties can be used as input to machine learning algorithms as a means to classify adenomatous tissue in the colon. In this study, biopsied tissue samples from the colonic epithelium are analyzed ex vivo using spectroscopic OCT and tissue classifications are generated using a novel deep learning architecture, informed by machine learning methods including LSTM and KNN. The overall classification accuracy obtained was 88.9%, 76.0% and 97.9% in discriminating tissue type for these methods. Further, we apply an approach using false coloring of en face OCT images based on SOCT parameters and deep learning predictions to enable visual identification of tissue type. This study advances the spectroscopic OCT towards clinical utility for analyzing colonic epithelium for signs of adenoma.",

    "abstract": "Retentostat cultivations have enabled investigations into substrate-limited near-zero growth for a number of microbes. Quantitative physiology at these near-zero growth conditions has been widely discussed, yet characterisation of the fluxome is relatively under-reported. We investigated the rewiring of metabolism in the transition of a recombinant protein producing strain of Komagataella phaffii to glucose-limited near-zero growth rates. We used cultivation data from a 200-fold range of growth rates and comprehensive biomass composition data to integrate growth rate dependent biomass equations, generated using a number of different approaches, into a K. phaffii genome scale metabolic model. Here we show that a non-growth associated maintenance value of 0.65 mmolATP gCDW-1 h-1 and a growth-associated maintenance value of [Formula] lead to accurate growth-rate predictions. In-line with its role as energy source, metabolism is rewired to increase the yield of ATP per glucose. This includes a reduction of flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, and a greater utilisation of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Interestingly, we observed activity of an external, non-proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase in addition to the malate-aspartate shuttle. Regardless of the method used for the generation of biomass equations, a similar, yet different, growth rate dependent rewiring was predicted. As expected, these differences between the different methods were clearer at higher growth rates, where the biomass equation provides a much greater constraint than at slower growth rates. When placed on an increasingly limited glucose diet, the metabolism of K. phaffii adapts, enabling it to continue to drive critical processes sustaining its high viability at near-zero growth rates.",

We wanted to understand whether this transition shapes the mouse neutrophil protein landscape, how the mouse neutrophil proteome is impacted by systemic infection and perform a comparative analysis of human and mouse neutrophils. Using quantitative mass spectrometry we reveal tissue-specific, infection-induced and species-specific neutrophil protein signatures. We show a high degree of proteomic conservation between mouse bone marrow, blood and peritoneal neutrophils, but also identify key differences in the molecules that these cells express for sensing and responding to their environment. Systemic infection triggers a change in the bone marrow neutrophil population with considerable impact on the core machinery for protein synthesis and DNA replication along with environmental sensors. We also reveal profound differences in mouse and human blood neutrophils, particularly their granule contents.

    "abstract": "Alaskas boreal birds face a rapidly changing environment, but we know little about shifts in migratory timing, particularly in autumn. We used quantile regression to quantify long-term changes in autumn capture date in 21 boreal passerines using 22+year datasets from two banding stations in central Alaska. We also quantified differences between sites and explored whether select climate indices during three periods of the annual cycle (breeding, post-fledge, and migration) could predict long-term changes in median capture. Long-term changes in autumn migration were detected in 86% of taxa, 76% of which exhibited advances in capture date ([~]2-3 days/decade), particularly long-distance migrants at one field site. However, site-specific differences unexpectedly highlight the need for caution before extrapolating long-term timing patterns over broad spatial extents. Warmer conditions during the breeding period (using the AO climate index) were associated with advances in autumn capture date in the greatest number of species (9). Collectively, we hypothesize that Alaskas immense size and spatially-variable climate regions impact reproductive timing, often resulting in long-term advances (with warming) and occasionally delays (with cooling). Carry-over effects of reproductive timing may therefore influence the autumn passage of different breeding populations, causing site-specific patterns, such as a species showing long-term advances at one location, but delays at another. Finally, as part of the broader effort to anticipate and reduce declines in boreal migratory birds, our study underscores the conservation value of banding station data in quantifying avian responses to and investigating drivers associated with varied climate indices.",

    "abstract": "Substantial progress has been made to map biodiversity and its drivers across the planet at multiple scales, yet studies that quantify the evolutionary processes that underpin this biodiversity, and test their drivers at multiple scales, are comparatively rare. Studying most fish species, we quantify rates of body size evolution to test the role of fundamental salinity habitats in shaping rates of evolution at multiple scales. We also determine how four additional factors shape evolutionary rates.\n\nIn up to 1710 comparisons studying over 27,000 ray-finned fish species, we compare rates of body size evolution between five salinity habits using 12 metrics. The comparisons span a molecular tree, supertrees, and ten scales of observation to test for robust patterns and reveal how patterns change with scale. Then, three approaches assess the role of three non-salinity factors on rates, and an alternative habitat scheme tests if lakes influence evolutionary rates.\n\nRates of size evolution rarely differ consistently between salinity habitats; rate patterns are highly clade- and scale-dependent. One exception is freshwater-brackish fishes, which possess among the highest size rates of any salinity, and show higher rates than euryhaline fishes in most groupings studied at most scales, and verses marine, freshwater, and marine-brackish habitats at specific scales. Additionally, species richness had the greatest potential to predict phenotypic rates, followed by branch duration and absolute values of body size. Lacustrine environments were consistently associated with high rates of size evolution.\n\nWe reveal the rate patterns that underpin global body size diversity for fishes, identifying factors that play a limited role in shaping rates of size evolution, such as salinity, and those such as species richness, age, and lake environments that consistently shape evolutionary rates across half of vertebrate diversity.",

This protease selectively triggered apoptosis in human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (PA-1, SKOV3) and mouse ovarian carcinoma cells (ID8), in addition to exhibiting no significant effect on normal human epithelial ovarian cell (IOSE) and mouse peritoneal macrophage (PEM[FE]) cell viabilities. Protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1); a GPCR which is reported to be overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells was identified as a novel target of Peptidase M84. We observed that Peptidase M84 induced PAR-1 overexpression along with activating its downstream signalling effectors NF{kappa}B and MAPK to promote excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in ovarian cancer cells. This disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, allowed cytosolic release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, increased the Bax (pro-apoptotic) to Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) ratio and promoted DNA damage to evoke apoptotic death of the ovarian cancer cells. Peptidase M84 also reduced nuclear ki-67 expression in these malignant cells to render an anti-proliferative role. In in vivo set-up, weekly intraperitoneal administration of Peptidase M84 (12 {micro}g/kg body-weight) in the ID8 mice model significantly diminished ascitic fluid accumulation through induction of oxidative stress, increasing murine survival rates by 60%. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggested that Peptidase M84 triggered PAR-1 mediated oxidative stress to act as an apoptosis inducer in ovarian cancer cells. This established Peptidase M84 as a promising drug candidate for receptor mediated targeted-therapy of ovarian cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556500v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b0a19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1640510org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1888b49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1708114_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) are deadly diseases that rank as the second and fourth leading causes of cancer-related deaths, respectively. We have previously shown that miR-6883 targets CDK4/6 and that palbociclib-mediated CDK4/6 inhibition destabilizes HIF1. We hypothesize that miR-6883 downregulates HIF1 in CRC and BC cells. miR-6883 was transfected under normoxia or hypoxia and western blot analysis revealed that miR-6883 downregulates CDK4/6 and HIF1 in CRC and BC cells, pointing to miR-6883 as a promising therapeutic to target hypoxic cancers or HIF1-deregulated tumor cells. Future studies will further investigate miR-6883 as a cancer biomarker, effects on HIF-related proteins and therapeutic uses in vivo.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556385v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0acadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68b428org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc4dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aa13ad_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO miR-6883 downregulates CDK4/6 and HIF1 in colorectal and breast cancer cells\n\nA) Colorectal cancer cells were treated with doses of palbociclib ranging from 0-20 {micro}M.

    "abstract": "Cortical-striatal synaptic dysfunction, including enhanced toxic signaling by extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (eNMDARs), precedes neurodegeneration in Huntington disease (HD). A previous study showed Activin A, whose transcription is upregulated by calcium influx via synaptic NMDARs, suppresses eNMDAR signaling. Therefore, we examined the role of Activin A in the YAC128 HD mouse model, comparing it to wild-type controls. We found decreased Activin A secretion in YAC128 cortical-striatal co-cultures, while Activin A overexpression in this model rescued altered eNMDAR expression. Striatal overexpression of Activin A in vivo improved motor learning on the rotarod task, and normalized striatal neuronal eNMDAR-mediated currents, membrane capacitance and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequency in the YAC128 mice. These results support the therapeutic potential of Activin A signaling and targeting eNMDARs to restore striatal neuronal health and ameliorate behavioral deficits in HD.",
