    "abstract": "Nearly all transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 are CCR5 (R5)-tropic. While previous evidence suggested that CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV-1 are transmissible, detection was not at the earliest stages of acute infection. Here, we identified an X4-tropic T/F HIV-1 in a participant in acute infection cohort. Coreceptor assays demonstrated that this T/F virus is strictly CXCR4 tropic. The participant experienced significantly faster CD4 depletion compared with R5 virus infected participants in the same cohort. Naive and central memory CD4 subsets declined faster than effector and transitional memory subsets. All CD4 subsets, including naive, were productively infected. Increased CD4+ T cell activation was observed over time. This X4-tropic T/F virus is resistant to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting V1/V2 and V3 regions. These findings demonstrate that X4-tropic HIV-1 is transmissible through the mucosal route in people with the wild-type CCR5 genotype and have implications for understanding the transmissibility and immunopathogenesis of X4-tropic HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) maintain cardiac homeostasis and EC dysfunction causes heart failure progression. Moreover, pathological changes occur via interactions between multiple cells, including ECs. Here, we conducted single-cell RNA-seq analysis of non-cardiomyocytes in mouse hearts during heart failure progression to elucidate the pathological changes in ECs and fibroblasts (FBs) mediated by cell-cell interactions. We show that capillary and arterial ECs exhibit mesenchymal gene expression changes with heart failure progression, indicating that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a major pathological alteration in ECs. We also found that the interaction between ECs and FBs was enriched during heart failure, particularly when involving Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 1 (Scarb1) in ECs. FBs induce mesenchymal gene alterations in ECs in the EC-FB co-culture system, which is inhibited by blocking SCARB1. RNA-seq analysis showed that administration of a SCARB1 inhibitor blocked mesenchymal gene expression, and inflammatory changes, suggesting that the EC-FB interaction via Scarb1 is important for EndMT induction in ECs. Systemic administration of a SCARB1 inhibitor attenuated heart failure progression and cardiac fibrosis. EC-specific Scarb1 knockout mouse showed improved cardiac function, suggesting a crucial role of Scarb1 in heart failure progression. Our results suggest that Scarb1 is a promising candidate for novel heart failure treatments that target ECs.",

    "abstract": "In the protozoan parasite Leishmania, most of the genes encoding for ribosomal proteins (RPs) are present as two or more copies in the genome, their untranslated regions (UTRs) are predominantly divergent, and might be associated with a distinct regulation of the paralogous genes expression. Here, we investigated the expression profiles of two RPs (S16 and L13a) encoded by duplicated genes in Leishmania major. The genes encoding for S16 protein have identical CDSs and divergent UTRs while the L13a CDSs diverge in two amino acids with divergent UTRs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing system, we generated knockout ({Delta}) and tagged transfectants for each paralog of L13a and S16. Combining tagged and {Delta} cell lines we show that the expression of both RPS16 and RPL13a isoforms differ throughout the parasite development with one of the isoforms being always more abundant than its respective copy. Additionally, compensatory expression was observed for each paralog when one of the isoforms was deleted, evidencing functional conservation of these proteins. Such phenomenon is related to post-translational processes, since the compensation happened at the protein levels, with no alterations observed at the transcript levels. Ribosomal profiles for RPL13a point out a standard behavior for these paralogues as already reported for other RPs in trypanosomatids, showing its interaction with heavy RNA-protein complexes. The identification of sets of proteins binding specifically to the 3UTRs of either the high or less abundant transcripts suggests a possible role of these proteins to differently control the levels of expression of these RP genes. In addition, conserved cis-elements were identified in the 3UTRs of RPS16 or RPL13a; among these, exclusive cis-elements for the more or for the less expressed transcripts were identified.",

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous dirofilariasis, caused by the parasitic nematode Dirofilaria repens, is a growing concern in Europe, affecting both dogs and humans. This study focused on D. repens Dr20/22, a protein encoded by an alt (abundant larval transcript) gene family. While well-documented in L3 larvae of other filariae species, this gene family had not been explored in dirofilariasis. The research involved cloning Dr20/22 cDNA, molecular characterization, and evaluating its potential application in the diagnosis of dirofilariasis. Although Real-Time analysis revealed mRNA expression in both adult worms and microfilariae, the native protein remained undetected in lysates from both developmental stages. This suggests the proteins specificity for L3 larvae and may be related to a process called SLTS (spliced leader trans-splicing), contributing to stage-specific gene expression. The antigens apparent specificity for invasive larvae makes it a strong candidate for an early dirofilariasis marker. ELISA tests using sera from infected and healthy dogs detected specific IgG antibody responses in both groups, indicating that specific IgG in healthy dog sera may contribute to dirofilariasis immunity. Although further research is necessary, the molecular and immunological characterization of Dr20/22 can enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and provide insights into the mechanisms that facilitate immune system evasion.",

    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT), a human neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cognitive and motor impairments, is caused by dysfunction of the conserved transcriptional regulator Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Genetic analyses in mouse Mecp2 mutants, which exhibit key features of human RTT, have been essential for deciphering the mechanisms of MeCP2 function; nonetheless, our understanding of these complex mechanisms is incomplete. Zebrafish mecp2 mutants exhibit mild behavioral deficits but have not been analyzed in depth. Here we combine transcriptomic and behavioral assays to assess baseline and stimulus-evoked motor responses and sensory filtering in zebrafish mecp2 mutants from 5-7 days post-fertilization (dpf). We show that zebrafish mecp2 function is dispensable for gross movement, acoustic startle response, and sensory filtering (habituation and sensorimotor gating), and reveal a previously unknown role for mecp2 in behavioral responses to visual stimuli. RNA-seq analysis identified a large gene set that requires mecp2 function for correct transcription at 4 dpf, and pathway analysis revealed several pathways that require MeCP2 function in both zebrafish and mammals. These findings show that MeCP2s function as a transcriptional regulator is conserved across vertebrates and supports using zebrafish to complement mouse modeling in elucidating these conserved mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of inner ear disorders remains challenging due to the intrinsic anatomical barriers. The majority treatments and delivery approaches for accessing inner hair cells are still engaged with surgical intervention, which is highly invasive and inconsistent in terms of efficacy and safety. In order to address this challenge for crossing anatomical barriers, we report an extracellular vesicle (EVs) -based delivery approach to inner hair cells, which enables carrying CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-sgRNA complex in high-throughput and high efficiency. The novel Microfluidic Droplet-based Electroporation System ({micro}DES) is developed to efficiently load cargos into EVs via millisecond pulsed, low-voltage electroporation within flow-through droplets as enormous bioreactors in a continuous-flow and scalable manner. The observed loading efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 RNA complex into EVs (RNP-EVs) is 10-fold higher than current bulk cuvette electroporation with hundred-fold increase of processing throughput. The low-voltage electroporation minimized the Joule heating influence on nanosized EVs, which retained the native surface membrane properties of cargo-loaded EVs. Both ex vivo and in vivo testing in Shaker-1 mice model demonstrated the high biocompatibility and biodistribution of produced RNP-EVs in the mouse cochlea penetrating inner hair cells. In contrast, the CRISPR/Cas9 RNP lipid-like nanoparticles (RNP-LNPs) control group was unable to penetrate anatomical barriers to access inner hair cells. In the Shaker-1 mouse model, DES produced RNP-EVs demonstrated much higher editing efficiency at Myo7ash1 mRNA level and showed significant hearing recovery in the Myo7aWT/Sh1 mice via Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) testing. The report work will present a new solution to advance gene therapy in treating sensorineural hearing loss .",

    "abstract": "In contemporary medical research, patient heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in comprehending intricate diseases such as Alzheimers disease and various forms of cancer. Specifically, in the genomic analysis of Alzheimers disease, individual patients may exhibit unique causal mutations that significantly influence their therapeutic trajectory. Conventional models that share numerous parameters across all individuals struggle to discern this heterogeneity and identify the influential factors for individuals. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach called Heteroscedastic Personalized Regression (Het-PR) to estimate the heterogeneity across samples and obtain personalized models for each sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Het-PR through both simulation and real data experiments. In the simulation experiment, we show that Het-PR outperforms other state-of-the-art models in capturing inter-sample heterogeneity. In the real data experiment, we apply Het-PR to Alzheimers data and show that it can identify persuasive selected genetic factors for each individual patient. Interestingly, our results suggest that there might be different associative SNPs for AD patients stratified by different cognitive levels.\n\nAuthor summaryIn medical research, it has been observed that causes of a disease vary significantly among individuals, especially when looking at complex diseases like Alzheimers disease and cancer. For Alzheimers disease, obesity, age, gender, and depression may play different roles across different patients. When studying the genes of Alzheimers patients, we find that each person might have their own unique genetic changes that can affect their treatment. For example, Alzheimers patients with different genetic mutations may respond differently to the same treatment. Traditional research methods often miss these individual differences and cant always pinpoint important personalized factors for each patient, because they usually use one model for all patients. To better understand these differences, weve introduced a new method, Heteroscedastic Personalized Regression (Het-PR), which generates a personalized model for each individual. Our experiments show that Het-PR is more effective than other leading methods in identifying these patient differences and recognizing Alzheimers genetic basis for each patient through both simulation and real data experiments. When we used Het-PR on real Alzheimers data, it helped us spot key genetic factors for each patient. Additionally, in our study, we excitedly find that different genetic markers in Alzheimers patients are possibly based on their cognitive abilities.

    "abstract": "Taxonomical identification of archaeological fruit and seed is of prime importance for any archaeobotanical studies. We compared the relative performance of deep learning and geometric morphometrics at identifying pairs of plant taxa. We used their seeds and fruit stones that are the most abundant recovered organs in archaeobotanical assemblages, and whose morphological identification, chiefly between wild and domesticated types, allow to document their domestication and biogeographical history. We used existing modern datasets of four plant taxa (date palm, barley, olive and grapevine) corresponding to photographs of two orthogonal views of their seeds that were analysed separately to offer a larger spectrum of shape diversity. On these eight datasets, we compared the performance of a deep learning approach, here convolutional neural networks (CNN), to that of a geometric morphometric approach, here outline analyses using elliptical Fourier transforms (EFT). Sample sizes were at minimum eight hundred seeds in each class, which is quite small when training deep learning models but of typical magnitude for archaeobotanical studies. Our objectives were twofold: i) to test whether deep learning can beat geometric morphometrics in taxonomic identification and if so, ii) to test which minimal sample size is required. We ran simulations on the full datasets and also on subsets, starting from 50 images in each binary class. For CNN networks, we deliberately used a candid approach relying on pre-parameterised VGG16 network. For EFT, we used a state-of-the art morphometrical pipeline. The main difference rests in the data used by each model: CNN used bare photographs where EFT used (x, y) outline coordinates. This \"pre-distilled\" geometrical description of seed outlines is often the most time-consuming part of morphometric studies. Results show that CNN beats EFT in most cases, even for very small datasets. We finally discuss the potential of CNN for archaeobotany, why outline analyses and morphometrics have not yet said their last word by providing quantitative descriptions, and how bioarchaeological studies could embrace both approaches, used in a complementary way, to better assess and understand the past history of species.",

It was found that a change in curvature of a nanoparticle, strength of ligand-receptor interactions, or receptor concentration could each drastically change the valency of the system. While the focus of this study was primarily on spherical nanoparticles, it is postulated that other structures with non-uniform curvaitures might also exhibit similar behaviors. Previous literature may not necessarily be rendered invalid by the findings here, especially when parameters like lower receptor concentrations, smaller nanoparticles, adjusted ligand-receptor interaction strengths, or weaker bonding potentials were employed. However, to ensure methodological robustness and repeatability in nanoparticle studies, this work recommends eliminating the use of pairwise functions to model ligand-receptor due to demonstrated inconsistencies.",

    "abstract": "Human feline leukaemia virus subgroup C receptor-related proteins 1 and 2 (FLVCR1 and 2) are major facilitator superfamily transporters from the solute carrier family 49. Dysregulation of these ubiquitous transporters has been linked to various haematological and neurological disorders. While both FLVCRs were initially proposed to hold a physiological function in heme transport, subsequent studies questioned this notion. Here, we used structural, computational and biochemical methods and conclude that these two FLVCRs function as human choline transporters. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of FLVCRs in different inward- and outward-facing conformations, captured in the apo state or in complex with choline in their translocation pathways. Our findings provide insights into the molecular framework of choline coordination and transport, largely mediated by conserved cation-{pi} interactions, and further illuminate the conformational dynamics of the transport cycle. Moreover, we identified a heme binding site on the protein surface of the FLVCR2 N-domain, and observed that heme actively drives the conformational transitions of the protein. This auxiliary binding site might indicate a potential regulatory role of heme in the FLVCR2 transport mechanisms. Our work resolves the contested substrate specificity of the FLVCRs, and sheds light on the process of maintaining cellular choline homeostasis at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "Intricate self-organization is essential in many biological processes, underpinning vital functions and interactions. In an effort to mimic such processes, synthetic biology aims to engineer dynamic structures with controllable functions using nanotechnological tools. A key requirement of engineered building blocks is the ability to assemble and disassemble hierarchically with precision. Using the DNA origami technique, we here present the moDON, a modular DNA origami nanostructure, which is capable of assembling into almost 20 000 diverse monomers, forming complex and controlled superstructures in three dimensions. While shape and addressability of DNA origami are nearly arbitrary, its overall size is limited by the scaffold size. Previous methods of extending the size of DNA origami (e.g. hierarchical assembly, modified scaffolds, etc.), either led to loss over control of shape and addressability beyond monomers or to proportionally increased cost and design effort. With the moDON we were able to overcome both issues. The modular design combines xy- and z-plane assembly methods, enabling the construction of finite and periodic structures beyond 1 GDa. We demonstrate xy-z orthogonality, by enabling controlled selective or parallel assembly and disassembly via distinct orthogonal triggers. The kinetic profile of assembly and disassembly aligns with biological time scales, paving the way for applications in dynamic nanomachinery and advanced biomaterials. Finally, we showcase the conjugation of gold nanoparticles to specific positions within superstructures, underscoring the efficacy of this approach for creating intricate and orthogonal nanoscale architectures with preserved site-specific addressability. The moDON thus offers an efficient, cost-effective solution for constructing large, precisely organized, and fully addressable structures with vast potential in synthetic cellular systems design.",

    "abstract": "The identification and characterization of the main conformations from a protein population is a challenging, inherently high-dimensional problem. We introduce the Secondary sTructural Ensembles with machine LeArning (StELa) double clustering method, which clusters protein structures based on the underlying Ramachandran plot. Our approach takes advantage of the relationship between the phi and psi dihedral angles in a protein backbone and the secondary structure of the protein. The classification of states as vectors composed of the clusters indices arising naturally from the Ramachandran plot, followed by the hierarchical clustering of the vectors, enables the identification of the minima from the corresponding free energy landscape (FEL) by lifting the high structure degeneracy found with existing approaches such as the RMSD-based clustering GROMOS. We compare the performance of StELa with not only GROMOS but also with CATS, the combinatorial averaged transient structure clustering method based on distributions of the phi and psi dihedral angle coordinates. Using ensembles of conformations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of either intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) of various lengths (tau protein fragments) or from local structures from a globular protein, we show that StELa is the only clustering method that identifies nearly all the minima from the corresponding FELs. In contrast, GROMOS yields a large number of clusters that cover the entire FEL and CATS, even with an additional clustering step, is unable to sample well the FEL for long IDPs and for fragments from globular proteins as it misses important minima.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/557631v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@634f90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fca966org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d59bd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eadb94_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We show that these developmentally primed states are characterized by differential methylation patterns at typically silenced heterochromatin, and that these epigenetic signatures are detectable as early as 10 days of age. The differentially methylated loci are enriched for genes with known oncogenic potential.

Long-read sequencing (PacBio) of one donor and secretome proteomics and short-read sequencing of five donors were performed.

We observe widespread loss of intron retention as a common result of all pathogen stimulations. We highlight novel transcripts of NFKB1 and CASP1 that may indicate novel immunological mechanisms. In general, RNA expression differences did not result in differences in the amounts of secreted proteins.\n\nInterindividual differences in the proteome were larger than the differences between stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs.

    "abstract": "The development of novel antimicrobials provides additional treatment options for infectious diseases, including antimicrobial resistant infections. There are many hurdles to antimicrobial development and identifying an antimicrobials mechanism of action is a crucial step in progressing candidate molecules through the drug discovery pipeline. We used the genome wide screening method TraDIS-Xpress to identify genes in two model Gram-negative bacteria that affected sensitivity to three analogues of a novel antimicrobial compound (OPT-2U1). TraDIS-Xpress identified that all three analogues targeted the lipid IVA biosynthetic pathway in E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. Specifically, we determined that the antimicrobial target was likely to be LpxD, and validated this by finding a 5 log2-fold increase in the MIC of the OPT-2U1 analogues in E. coli when lpxD was overexpressed. Synergies were identified between OPT-2U1 analogues combined with rifampicin or colistin, to varying strengths, in both E. coli and S. Typhimurium. LPS composition was a likely reason for differences between E. coli and S.Typhimurium, as perturbation of LPS synthesis affected synergy between antibiotics and OPT-2U1 analogues. Finally, genes involved in ATP synthesis and membrane signalling functions were also found to affect the synergy between colistin and OPT-2U1 analogues. TraDIS-Xpress has proven a powerful tool to rapidly assay all genes (and notably, essential genes) within a bacterium for roles in dictating antimicrobial sensitivity. This study has confirmed the predicted target pathway of OPT-2U1 and identified synergies which could be investigated for development of novel antimicrobial formulations.\n\nData SummaryNucleotide sequence data supporting the analysis in this study has been deposited in ArrayExpress under the accession number E-MTAB-13250.

    "abstract": "How does the cerebellum learn how to control motion? The cerebellar motor learning critically depends on the long-term depression of the synapses between granule cells and Purkinje cells, which encode motor commands and inhibitory modifications to motor outputs, respectively, for simultaneous granule cell inputs and climbing fibre inputs, the latter of which encode the error signals1-3. However, recent studies have revealed that inhibitory inputs to Purkinje cells may disrupt long-term depression4-8, and it is not clear how long-term depression can occur without disruption. In search of a clue, we investigated the synaptic connectivity among the neurons reconstructed from serial electron microscopy images of the cerebellar molecular layer9,10. We discovered synapses between climbing fibres and a subset of inhibitory interneurons, which synapse onto the remaining interneurons, which in turn synapse onto Purkinje cells. Such connectivity redefines the interneuron types, which have been defined morphologically or molecularly11-13. Together with climbing fibres to Purkinje cell connections, those cell types form a feedforward disinhibitory circuit14. We argued that this circuit secures long-term depression by suppressing inhibition whenever climbing fibre input is provided and long-term depression needs to occur15, and we validated the hypothesis through a computational model. This finding implies a general principle of circuit mechanism in which disinhibition supports synaptic plasticity16,17.",

In addition to Myo1D, the zebrafish genome encodes the closely related Myo1G. While Myo1G also controls LR asymmetry, we show that it does so through an entirely different mechanism. Myo1G promotes the Nodal-mediated transfer of laterality information from the LRO to target tissues. At the cellular level, Myo1G is associated with endosomes positive for the TGF{beta} signaling adapter SARA. myo1g mutants have fewer SARA-positive Activin receptor endosomes and a reduced responsiveness to Nodal ligands that results in a delay of left-sided Nodal propagation and tissue-specific laterality defects in organs that are most distant from the LRO. Beyond LR asymmetry, Myo1G promotes signaling by different Nodal ligands in other biological contexts. Our findings therefore identify Myo1G as a novel positive regulator of the Nodal signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Dingoes come from an ancient canid lineage that originated in East Asia around 8000-11,000 years BP. As Australias largest terrestrial predator, dingoes play an important ecological role. A small population exists on a world heritage listed offshore island, Kgari (formerly Fraser Island). While dingoes on Kgari are protected, dingoes on the mainland are only protected in certain regions, and, because of its controversial status in Australia, lethal control is commonly used for management. Concern regarding the persistence of dingoes on Kgari has risen due to their low genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding levels. However, whole-genome sequencing data is lacking from this population. Here, we include five new whole-genome sequences of Kgari dingoes. We analyze a total of 18 whole genome sequences of dingoes sampled from mainland Australia and Kgari to assess the genomic consequences of their demographic histories. Long (>1 Mb) runs of homozygosity (ROH) -- indicators of inbreeding -- are elevated in all sampled dingoes. However, Kgari dingoes showed significantly higher levels of very long ROH (>5 Mb), providing genomic evidence for small population size, isolation, inbreeding, and a strong founder effect. Our results suggest that, despite current levels of inbreeding, the Kgari population is purging strongly deleterious mutations, which, in the absence of further reductions in population size, may facilitate the persistence of small populations despite low genetic diversity and isolation. However, there is little to no purging of mildly deleterious alleles, which may have important long-term consequences, and should be considered by conservation and management programs.",

Here, we integrate behavioral data from a mate choice experiment involving benthic and limnetic fish with gene expression data from the brains of females making these mate choice decisions. We find substantial gene expression variation between limnetic and benthic species, regardless of behavioral context, suggesting general divergence in gene expression patterns in female brains, in accordance with their genetic differentiation. Intriguingly, female gene co-expression modules covary with male display traits but in opposing directions for sympatric populations of the two species, suggesting male displays elicit a genomic response that reflects known differences in female preferences which serve to isolate the species. Furthermore, our analysis confirms the role of numerous candidate genes previously implicated in female mate choice decision-making in other teleost species, suggesting that these cognitive molecular processes are, in part, evolutionarily conserved. Taken together, our study adds important new insights to our understanding of the molecular processes underlying female decision-making that maintain isolation between diverging species.",

    "abstract": "The human brain comprises an intricate web of connections that generate complex neural networks capable of storing and processing information. This information depends on multiple factors, including underlying network structure, connectivity, and interactions; and thus, methods to characterize neural networks typically aim to unravel and interpret a combination of these factors. Here, we present four-dimensional (4D) Shannons entropy, a novel quantitative metric of network activity based on the Triple Correlation Uniqueness (TCU) theorem. Triple correlation, which provides a complete and unique characterization of the network, relates three nodes separated by up to four spatiotemporal lags. Here, we evaluate the 4D entropy from the spatiotemporal lag probability distribution function (PDF) of the network activitys triple correlation. Given a spike raster, we compute triple correlation by iterating over time and space. Summing the contributions to the triple correlation over each of the spatial and temporal lag combinations generates a unique 4D spatiotemporal lag distribution, from which we estimate a PDF and compute Shannons entropy. To outline our approach, we first compute 4D Shannons entropy from feedforward motif-class patterns in a simulated spike raster. We then apply this methodology to spiking activity recorded from rat cortical cultures to compare our results to previously published results of pairwise (2D) correlated spectral entropy over time. We find that while first- and second-order metrics of activity (spike rate and cross-correlation) show agreement with previously published results, our 4D entropy computation (which also includes third-order interactions) reveals a greater depth of underlying network organization compared to published pairwise entropy. Ultimately, because our approach is based on the TCU, we propose that 4D Shannons entropy is a more complete tool for neural network characterization.\n\nAuthor SummaryHere, we present a novel entropy metric for neural network characterization, 4D Shannons entropy, based on triple correlation, which measures interactions among up to three neurons in time and space. Per the Triple Correlation Uniqueness (TCU) theorem, our 4D entropy approach is based on a complete and unique characterization of network activity. We first outline the method to obtain 4D Shannons entropy using a simulated spike raster of feedforward three-neuron configurations. We then apply this metric to an open-source, experimental dataset of rat cortical cultures over time to show that while first- and second-order interactions (spike rate and cross-correlation) show similar trends to published results, the TCU-based 4D Shannons entropy metric provides greater insights into later-stage network activity compared to the published pairwise entropy. As this metric is computed from a 4D distribution unique to the network, we propose that utilization of 4D entropy offers a clear advantage compared to currently utilized pairwise entropy metrics for neural network analyses. For this reason, neuroscientific and clinical applications abound - these may include analysis of distinct dynamical states, characterizing responses to medication, and identification of pathological brain networks, such as seizures.",

    "abstract": "Active avoidance is a fundamental defensive behavior, defined as performing a voluntary action to escape a noxious stimulus. Active avoidance serves as an adaptive response to threat, ensuring safety. In individuals with anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, avoidance behavior can become maladaptive when even safe situations are avoided, at great psychosocial cost. Corticostriatal and amygdalostriatal pathways have been implicated in active avoidance, though their role in learning and expression of this behavior is not fully understood. Projections from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to the ventromedial striatum (VMS) have been shown to regulate a variety of defensive behaviors; however, their role in active avoidance has not previously been examined. Additionally, basolateral amygdala (BLA) projections to the VMS have been shown to promote active avoidance in studies utilizing pharmacological inactivation and optogenetic inhibition, though in vivo real time neural activity in this pathway has not been recorded during active avoidance learning. Here we utilized fiber photometry for in vivo recordings of neural activity in vmPFC-VMS and BLA-VMS projections during active avoidance learning and expression. We implemented a two-way signaled active avoidance paradigm in which a light cue served as the conditioned stimulus (CS) signaling an impending foot shock. We examined changes in neural activity in these two projections during CS presentation, onset of active avoidance, and conditioned freezing. We found that vmPFC-VMS projections develop learning-related increases in activity at CS onset across training, while BLA-VMS projections do not show learning-related encoding of the CS. Additionally, we found that both vmPFC-VMS and BLA-VMS projections develop an increase in activity at avoidance onset. No changes in neural activity were observed during cued freezing in either vmPFC-VMS or BLA-VMS projections. Together these results indicate that vmPFC-VMS projections encode both CS and avoidance, while BLA-VMS projections may simply encode avoidance. Finally, we utilized optogenetic inhibition of vmPFC-VMS projections during the CS to investigate the necessity of this pathway for expression of active avoidance behavior. We found that inhibition of vmPFC-VMS projections attenuates learned active avoidance behavior, indicating that activity in this pathway is required for proper active avoidance. In summary, our results demonstrate task-relevant encoding of active avoidance behavior in vmPFC-VMS and BLA-VMS projections.",

    "abstract": "Animals produce different acoustic types of vocalizations in different behavioral contexts. The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) is obligatory for vocal production (Jurgens, 1994, 2002, 2009), but how midbrain circuits are organized to control the production of different vocalization types remains unknown. To test whether a single population of midbrain neurons regulates the production of different vocalization types, we applied intersectional methods to selectively ablate a population of midbrain neurons required for the production of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in mice. We find that although ablation of these PAG-USV neurons blocks USV production in both males and females, these neurons are not required for the production of squeaks. Our findings provide strong evidence that distinct populations of midbrain neurons control the production of different acoustic categories of vocalizations.",

    "abstract": "The production of recombinant proteins in a host using synthetic constructs such as plasmids comes at the cost of detrimental effects such as reduced growth, energetic inefficiencies, and other stress responses, collectively known as metabolic stress. Increasing the number of copies of the foreign gene increases the metabolic load but increases the expression of the foreign protein. Thus, there is a trade-off between biomass and product yield in response to changes in heterologous gene copy number. This work proposes a computational method, rETFL (recombinant Expression and Thermodynamic Flux), for analyzing and predicting the responses of recombinant organisms to the introduction of synthetic constructs. rETFL is an extension to the ETFL formulations designed to reconstruct models of metabolism and expression (ME-models). We have illustrated the capabilities of the method in four studies to (i) capture the growth reduction in plasmid-containing E. coli and recombinant protein production; (ii) explore the trade-off between biomass and product yield as plasmid copy number is varied; (iii) predict the emergence of overflow metabolism in recombinant E. coli in agreement with experimental data; and (iv) investigate the individual pathways and enzymes affected by the presence of the plasmid. We anticipate that rETFL will serve as a comprehensive platform for integrating available omics data for recombinant organisms and making context-specific predictions that can help optimize recombinant expression systems for biopharmaceutical production and gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the World Health Organization published a catalog of microorganisms in 2017 for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. Within this list, the carbapenem-resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, belonging to the ESKAPE group, has been granted the \"critical\" status. Over the years, such isolates have been detected within healthcare units, posing a global threat to upcoming pandemics. One way to facilitate a systemic view of bacterial metabolism and allow the development of new therapeutics based on environmental and genetic alterations is to apply constraint-based modeling on metabolic networks. We developed a versatile workflow to build high-quality and simulation-ready genome-scale metabolic models. We applied our workflow to create a novel metabolic model for A. baumannii and validated its predictive capabilities using experimental nutrient utilization and gene essentiality data. Our analysis showed that our model i ACB23LX could recapitulate cellular metabolic phenotypes observed during in vitro experiments with an accuracy of over 80%, while positive biomass production rates were observed in growth media relevant to A. baumannii. Additionally, we identified putative essential genes with no human counterparts, which could serve as novel antibiotic candidates for the development of future antimicrobial strategies. Finally, we have assembled the first curated collection of available reconstructions for distinct A. baumannii strains and analyzed their growth characteristics. The presented models herein are in a standardized and well-curated format, facilitating their usability, while they can be used to guide the reconstruction of multi-strain networks. Ultimately, they serve as a knowledge base for reliable predictions under various perturbations and the development of effective drugs.",
