    "abstract": "Background and aimsCapsid assembly (CA) is a critical step in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) life cycle, mediated by the viral core protein. CA is the target for various new anti-viral candidate therapeutics known as capsid assembly modulators (CAMs) of which the CAM-aberrant (CAM-A) class induces aberrant shaped core protein structures and lead to hepatocyte cell death. The aim of the studies was to identify the mechanism of action of the CAM-A modulators leading to HBV infected hepatocyte elimination.\n\nMethodsThe CAM-A mediated mechanism of HBsAg reduction was evaluated in vitro in a stable HBV replicating cell line and in vivo in AAV-HBV transduced C57BL/6, C57BL/6 SCID and HBV-infected chimeric mice with humanized livers.\n\nResultsIn vivo treatment with CAM-A modulators induced pronounced reductions in HBe- and HBsAg which were associated with a transient increase in ALT. Both HBs- and HBeAg reduction and ALT increase were delayed in C57BL/6 SCID and chimeric mice, suggesting that adaptive immune responses may indirectly contribute to this phenotype. However, depletion of CD8+ T-cells in transduced wild-type mice did not have a negative impact on antigen reduction, indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses are not essential.\n\nCoinciding with the transient ALT elevation in AAV-HBV transduced mice, we observed a transient increase in markers related to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis as well as cytokines related to apoptosis pathways, followed by the detection of a proliferation marker. Pathway enrichment analysis of microarray data revealed that antigen presentation pathway (MHC-I) was upregulated, overlapping with observed apoptosis. Combination treatment with HBV-specific siRNA demonstrated that CAM-A mediated HBsAg reduction is dependent on de novo core protein translation and that the effect is dependent on high levels of core protein expression, which will likely focus the CHB sub-population that could respond.\n\nConclusionCAM-A treatment eradicates HBV infected hepatocytes with high core protein levels through the induction of apoptosis a promising approach as part of a regimen to achieve functional cure.\n\nLay summaryTreatment with hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid assembly modulators that induce the formation of aberrant HBV core protein structures (CAM-A) leads to programmed cell death, apoptosis, of HBV-infected hepatocytes and subsequent reduction of HBV antigens, which differentiates CAM-A from other CAMs. The effect is dependent on the de novo synthesis and high levels of core protein.",

However, individuals with partial loss-of-function variants in DNA replicative helicase components often present with immunodeficiency due to specific loss of natural killer (NK) cells. Such lineage-specific disease phenotypes raise questions on how the proliferation is regulated in cell type-specific manner. We aimed to understand NK cell-specific proliferative dynamics and vulnerability to impaired helicase function using iPSCs from individuals with NK cell deficiency (NKD) due to hereditary compound heterozygous GINS4 variants. We observed and characterized heterogeneous cell populations that arise during the iPSC differentiation along with NK cells. While overall cell proliferation decreased with differentiation, early NK cell precursors showed a short burst of cell proliferation. GINS4 deficiency induced replication stress in these early NK cell precursors, which are poised for apoptosis, and ultimately recapitulate the NKD phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial membrane vesicles (BMVs) are produced by most bacteria and participate in various cellular processes, such as intercellular communication, nutrient exchange, and pathogenesis. Notably, these vesicles can contain virulence factors, including toxic proteins, DNA, and RNA. Such factors can contribute to the harmful effects of bacterial pathogens on host cells and tissues. Although the general effects of BMVs on host cellular physiology are well known, the underlying molecular mechanisms are less understood. In this study, we introduce a vesicle quantification method, leveraging the membrane dye FM4-64. We utilize a linear regression model to analyze the fluorescence emitted by stained vesicle membranes to ensure consistent and reproducible vesicle-host interaction studies using cultured cells. This method is particularly valuable for identifying host cellular processes impacted by vesicles and their specific cargo. Moreover, it outcompetes clearly unreliable protein concentration-based methods. We (1) show a linear correlation between the quantity of vesicles and the fluorescence signal emitted from the FM4-64 dye, (2) introduce the \"vesicle load\" as a new semi-quantitative unit, facilitating more reproducible vesicle-cell culture interaction experiments (3) show that a stable vesicle load yields consistent host responses when studying vesicles from Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants (4) demonstrate that typical vesicle isolation contaminants, such as flagella, do not significantly skew the metabolic response of lung epithelial cells to P. aeruginosa vesicles, and (5) identify inositol-1-monophosphatase (SuhB) as a pivotal regulator in the vesicle-mediated pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism is regulated by a series of enzyme complexes, whose function depends on effective interactions between proteins and RNA encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. These epistatic interactions are in turn highly sensitive to the environment. Many studies have found that mitochondrial haplotype frequencies of various taxa associate with latitude or altitude, leading to the hypothesis that mitochondrial genomes may respond to thermal selection and contribute to local adaptation. We used a Drosophila melanogaster panel comprising native (coadapted) populations from the extremes of the Australian east-coast cline, and generated mitonuclear cybrid populations. Our results indicate a strong phenotypic impact of mitonuclear interactions in cybrid lines, involving an apparent trade-off between aerobic capacity and key fitness aspects such as reproduction, growth, and survival. Overall, our study shows that naturally-occurring mitonuclear disruptions can have a meaningful impact on phenotypes, potentially influencing future ecological adaptation and population persistence.",

    "abstract": "In meiotic prophase I, hundreds of double-strand breaks (DSB) are induced to initiate homologous recombination, resulting in the formation of non-crossovers (NCO) and crossovers (CO). Of the 250-300 DSBs that form in mice, only [~]10% are resolved as COs, with all remaining DSB events resolving as NCO. Thus, both the frequency and distribution of COs must be tightly regulated to ensure their appropriate localization across the genome. Errors in crossover designation and maturation can result in nondisjunction, leading to aneuploidy, germ cell death, birth defects, or infertility. That these errors are more evident in female meiosis compared to males suggests that the events of meiotic prophase I are sexually dimorphic with respect to DSB processing, resolution, and/or surveillance. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how COs are designated and regulated during prophase I in the female germline. Previous studies in our lab showed that Cyclin N-Terminal Domain Containing 1 (CNTD1) protein plays a critical role in CO designation during male meiosis, co-localizing with other essential CO proteins such as MutL{gamma} (MLH1/MLH3) and crossover site-associated cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) during pachynema. In the current study, we investigated whether analogous roles for CNTD1 existed in female meiosis. Similar to Cntd1-/- males, Cntd1-/- females are sterile, with no gross morphological ovarian defects in adults albeit with a depletion in ovarian follicle numbers. During prophase I, early DSB induction and repair occur normally, but oocytes from Cntd1-/- females fail to accumulate MutL{gamma} in pachynema. Phenotypically, meiotic prophase I disruption in Cntd1-/- females is similar to that seen in Cntd1-/- males. Importantly, whereas the Caernohabditis elegans ortholog of CNTD1, COSA-1, appears to interact with CDK-2 during pachynema in oocytes, CNTD1 in mouse oocytes lacks the CDK-interacting motif, suggesting that its function in oocytes does not involve a cyclin-like induction of CDK2 phosphorylation activity. In contradiction to the timing of prophase I disruption in Cntd1-/- females at pachynema, we observe a dramatic depletion of primordial follicles, beginning shortly after birth and increasing dramatically through to adult ages. Those primordial follicles that persist, however, are able to develop through dictyate arrest into primary and larger follicular structures in pre-pubertal females, and only by adulthood were significant declines observed in all follicles. The early loss of oocytes in Cntd1-/- females shortly after birth, considerably earlier than that observed for mice lacking MLH1 or MLH3, suggests a novel early role for CNTD1 in CO designation and/or in ensuring progression of oocytes into dictyate arrest at late pachynema.",

    "abstract": "Activins are one of the three distinct subclasses within the greater Transforming Growth Factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) superfamily. First discovered for their critical roles in reproductive biology, activins have since been shown to alter cellular differentiation and proliferation. At present, members of the activin subclass include activin A (ActA), ActB, ActC, ActE, and the more distant members myostatin and GDF11. While the biological roles and signaling mechanisms of most activins class members have been well-studied, the signaling potential of ActE has remained largely unknown. Here, we characterized the signaling capacity of homodimeric ActE. Molecular modeling of the ligand:receptor complexes showed that ActC and ActE shared high similarity in both the type I and type II receptor binding epitopes. ActE signaled specifically through ALK7, utilized the canonical activin type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB, and was resistant to the extracellular antagonists follistatin and WFIKKN. In mature murine adipocytes, ActE invoked a SMAD2/3 response via ALK7, similar to ActC. Collectively, our results establish ActE as an ALK7 ligand, thereby providing a link between genetic and in vivo studies of ActE as a regulator of adipose tissue.\n\nSignificanceActivin E is a homodimeric member of the TGF{beta} family belonging to the activin subclass. Currently, the signaling capacity of ActE is unknown due to a lack of reliable reagents to study the protein. Here, we demonstrate that ActE acts as a canonical TGF{beta} ligand that signals through SMAD2/3 in an ALK7-dependent manner, similar to ActC. ActE also utilizes the activin type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB, to signal and is unable to be antagonized by FS288 and WFIKKN2. This study shows that ActE is a signaling ligand and provides a connection between genetic and in vivo studies that links ActE to adiposity.",

Despite the recent development of several EVs-based cancer immunotherapies, their clinical efficacy remained limited. Here, using fusion with tetraspanin as one of the EV engineering techniques, we created antigen-presenting extracellular vesicles (AP-EVs) to reproduce the functional characteristics of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). AP-EVs were also equipped with surface-bound IL-2, a feature not inherent to APCs, which facilitated selective delivery of IL-2 to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. AP-EVs were engineered to express a peptide-major histocompatibility class I (pMHCI) complex, a costimulatory CD80 molecule, and IL-2, allowing the simultaneous presentation of multiple immune modulators to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. This promoted the clonal expansion and differentiation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, leading to potent anticancer immune responses. Combination therapy with AP-EVs and anti-PD-1 demonstrated enhanced anticancer immunity against established tumors compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Our engineered EVs represent a novel effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

Lately, our understanding of these processes has greatly expanded through the inference of cellular communication, utilizing RNA extracted from bulk tissue or individual cells. Considering the challenge of obtaining tissue biopsies for these approaches, we considered the potential of studying cell-free RNA obtained from blood. To test the feasibility of this approach, we used the BulkSignalR algorithm across 295 cell-free RNA samples and compared the LRI profiles across multiple cancer types and healthy donors. Interestingly, we detected specific and reproducible LRIs particularly in the blood of liver cancer patients compared to healthy donors. We found an increase in the magnitude of hepatocyte interactions, notably hepatocyte autocrine interactions in liver cancer patients. Additionally, a robust panel of 30 liver cancer-specific LRIs presents a bridge linking liver cancer pathogenesis to discernible blood markers. In summary, our approach shows the plausibility of detecting liver LRIs in blood and builds upon the biological understanding of cell-free transcriptomes.",

Here, we studied the impact of ASPM pathogenic mutations on human corticogenesis in organoid models. We found that at earliest stages of neurogenesis, ASPM mutant cortical progenitors, located at the apical surface of the neuroepithelium, display transient mitotic spindle randomization. The mutant progenitors then delaminate basally to adopt precociously the characteristics of outer radial glia cells (oRGC), a population of progenitors selectively amplified in human corticogenesis. Subsequently, cortical progenitors are depleted through decreased amplification and increased apoptosis. Thus, ASPM regulates the timely generation of oRGC by controlling mitotic spindle orientation, shedding light on how species-specific features of neurogenesis may confer vulnerability to neurodevelopmental diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive performance largely depends on how much effort is invested during task-execution. This also means that we rarely perform as good as we could. Cognitive effort is adjusted to the expected outcome of performance, meaning that it is driven by motivation. The results from recent studies investigating the effects manipulations of motivation clearly suggest that it is the expenditure of cognitive control that is particularly prone to being affected by modulations of cognitive effort. Although recent EEG studies investigated the neural underpinnings of the interaction of effort and control, reports on how cognitive effort is reflected by oscillatory activity of the EEG are quite sparse. It is the goal of the present study to bridge this gap by performing an exploratory analysis of high-density EEG data from a switching-task using manipulations of monetary incentives. A beamformer approach is used to localize the sensor-level effects in source-space. The results indicate that the manipulation of cognitive effort was successful. The participants reported significantly higher motivation and cognitive effort in high versus low reward trials. Performance was also significantly increased. The analysis of the EEG data revealed that the increase of cognitive effort was reflected by an increased mid-frontal theta activity during the cue-target interval, suggesting an increased use of proactive control. Alpha-desynchronization throughout the trial was also more pronounced in high reward trials, signaling a bias of attention towards the processing of external stimuli. Source reconstruction suggests that these effects are located in areas related to cognitive control, and visual processing.",

Results show that dopamine enhances bimodal responses, specifically in direct pathway MSNs, through the acceleration of the visual responses. We provide anatomical and computational evidence suggesting that this relies on the disinhibition of direct MSNs by a cell-type-specific corticostriatal pathway.

To potentially shed light on these processes, millions of transposon insertion mutants throughout the genome of C. glabrata were profiled en masse for fitness defects in the presence of FK506, a specific inhibitor of calcineurin. 87 specific gene deficiencies depended on calcineurin signaling for full viability in vitro both in wild type and pdr1{Delta} null strains lacking pleiotropic drug resistance. Three genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis (FKS1, DCW1, FLC1) possess co-essential paralogs whose expression depended on calcineurin and Crz1 in response to micafungin, a clinical antifungal that interferes with cell wall biogenesis. Interestingly, 80% of the FK506-sensitive mutants were deficient in different aspects of vesicular trafficking, such as endocytosis, exocytosis, sorting, and biogenesis of secretory proteins in the ER. In response to the experimental antifungal manogepix that blocks GPI-anchor biosynthesis in the ER, calcineurin signaling increased and strongly prevented cell death independent of Crz1, one of its major targets. Comparisons between manogepix, micafungin, and the ER-stressing tunicamycin reveal a correlation between the degree of calcineurin signaling and the degree of cell survival. These findings suggest that calcineurin plays major roles in mitigating stresses of vesicular trafficking. Such stresses may arise during host infection and in response antifungal therapies.",

Here we considered the Salicornia europaea rhizosphere community, and the ability of the phytoremediation plant Salix viminalis to recruit its beneficial microbiome to mediate the pollution stress at the Stebnyk mine tailings storage. The tailings contain large amounts of brine salts and heavy metals that contaminate the ground water and surrounding areas, changing soil biogeochemistry and causing increased erosion. The species richness of the endophytic bacterial community of S. viminalis roots was assessed based on observed OTUs, Shannon-InvSimpson, and evenness index. Our results show that biodiversity was decreased across the contamination zones and that S. europaea supplementation significantly increased the species richness. Our results also indicate that the number of dominating OTUs was not changed across zones in both S. europaea-treated and untreated bacterial populations, and that the decrease in richness was mainly caused by the low abundance of OTUs.\n\nThe importance of engineering microbial communities that support the genetic diversity of degraded environments and the challenges with high throughput metabarcoding databases are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Protein acetylation is a crucial post-translational modification that controls gene expression and a variety of biological processes. Sirtuins, a prominent class of NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylases, serve as key regulators of protein acetylation and gene expression in eukaryotes. In this study, six single knockout strains of fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus were constructed, in addition to a strain lacking all predicted sirtuins (SIRTKO). Phenotypic assays suggest that sirtuins are involved in cell wall integrity, secondary metabolite production, thermotolerance, and virulence. AfsirE deletion resulted in attenuation of virulence, as demonstrated in murine and Galleria infection models. The absence of AfSirE leads to altered acetylation status of proteins, including histones and non-histones, resulting in significant changes in the expression of genes associated with secondary metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and virulence factors. These findings encourage testing sirtuin inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategies to combat A. fumigatus infections or in combination therapy with available antifungals.",

Here, we identified the transcription factor ARID3A as a novel regulator of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation at the TA compartment. We show that ARID3A forms an expression gradient from villus tip to the early progenitors at the crypts mediated by TGF-{beta} and WNT signalling. Intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of Arid3a reduces proliferation of TA cells. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis shows increased enterocyte differentiation and reduced secretory cells in the Arid3a cKO intestine. Interestingly, upper-villus gene signatures of both enterocytes and secretory cells are enriched in the mutant intestine. We find that the enhanced enterocyte differentiation in the Arid3a cKO intestine is caused by increased binding of HNF1 and HNF4. Finally, we show that loss of Arid3a impairs irradiation-induced regenerative process by altering the dynamics of proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings imply that ARID3A may play a gatekeeping role in the TA compartment to maintain the \"just-right\" proliferation-to-differentiation ratio for tissue homeostasis and plasticity.",

It is therefore appealing for conservation and environmental governance to combine that information into single measure of ecosystem or population health.\nC_LIO_LIThe Jacobian matrix is a common characteristic used to identify the sensitivity of simulated/mathematical systems to perturbation (a.k.a. its resilience) and predict its near future dynamics. Jacobians have therefore been suggested as a theoretically grounded measure of ecosystem resilience. Whilst historically it has been challenging to estimate the Jacobian from empirical data, recent work has proposed a suite of metrics capable of reconstructing it for real-world community using multi-species time series data.\nC_LIO_LIHere we assess the robustness of five resilience metrics influenced by varying time series lengths and data qualities based on that seen in real-world wildlife time series. We generate data using multispecies Lotka-Volterra equations and simulate stressed and unstressed communities of varying species number. These data were then corrupted through the introduction of sampling error (to mimic varying search efforts) and truncating time series (to match the typical time series lengths reported in global biodiversity datasets such as the Living Planet Index and BIOTIME).\nC_LIO_LIThe robustness of all resilience metrics improved with time series length, whilst the amount of sampling error had little effect on their performance. However, community size (number of species) dramatically altered metric capability, with larger communities decreasing the reliability of resilience metric trends.\nC_LIO_LIOverall, resilience metrics behave predictably across realistic data corruptions. Generic resilience estimation is therefore possible from abundance time series alone, and we suggest that, given the increasing availability of multivariate community data, focussing on Jacobian estimates for resilience is a promising avenue of research.

Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods to test the Dispersal hypothesis for the evolution of sex differences in contributions to cooperative care across the cooperatively breeding birds and mammals. The Dispersal hypothesis predicts that, where non-breeding individuals of both sexes help to rear offspring within their natal group, the more dispersive sex will contribute less (either because leaving the natal group earlier reduces the downstream direct benefit from cooperation or because dispersal activities trade-off against cooperation). Our analyses reveal (i) support for the Dispersal hypothesis (sex biases in dispersal predict sex biases in natal cooperation across taxa), and (ii) that this pattern cannot be readily attributed to alternative hypothesized drivers of sex differences in cooperation (kin selection, heterogamety, paternity uncertainty, patterns of parental care or differences between birds and mammals). Our findings help to clarify the evolutionary drivers of sex differences in cooperation and highlight the need for single-species studies to now tease apart whether sex differences in dispersal predict sex differences in natal cooperation because dispersal impacts the direct benefits of natal cooperation (as is often proposed) or because activities that promote dispersal trade-off against natal cooperation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella Infantis has disseminated worldwide, mainly linked to the consumption of poultry products. Evidence shows dissemination of this pathogen in Chile; however, studies are primarily limited to phenotypic data or involve few isolates. As human cases of Salmonella Infantis infections have substantially increased in recent years, a better understanding of its molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial-resistance profiles are required to inform effective surveillance and control measures.\n\nMethodsWe sequenced 396 Salmonella Infantis genomes and analyzed them with all publicly available genomes of this pathogen from Chile (440 genomes in total), representing isolates from environmental, food, animal, and human sources obtained from 2009 to 2022. Based on bioinformatic and phenotypic methods, we assessed the population structure, dissemination among different niches, and AMR profiles of Salmonella Infantis in the country.\n\nFindingsThe genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that Salmonella Infantis from Chile comprised several clusters of highly related isolates dominated by sequence type 32. The HC20_343 cluster grouped an important proportion of all isolates. The latter was the only cluster associated with pESI-like megaplasmids, and up to 12 acquired AMR genes/mutations predicted to result in an MDR phenotype. Accordingly, antimicrobial-susceptibility testing revealed a strong concordance between the AMR genetic determinants and their matching phenotypic expression, indicating that a significant proportion of HC20_343 isolates produce extended- spectrum {beta}-lactamases and have intermediate fluoroquinolone resistance. HC20_343 Salmonella Infantis were spread among environmental, animal, food, and human niches, showing a close relationship between isolates from different years and sources, and a low intra-source genomic diversity.\n\nInterpretationOur findings show a widespread dissemination of MDR Salmonella Infantis from the HC20_343 cluster in Chile. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to first-line antibiotics and the evidence of active transmission between the environment, animals, food, and humans highlight the urgency of improved surveillance and control measures in the country. As HC20_343 isolates predominate in the Americas, our results suggest a high prevalence of ESBL- producing Salmonella Infantis with intermediate fluoroquinolone resistance in the continent.\n\nFundingAgencia de Investigacion y Desarrollo de Chile (ANID) through FONDECYT de Postdoctorado Folio 3230796 and Folio 3210317, FONDECYT Regular Folio 1231082, and ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - ICN2021_044.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSIn the last decade, emergent multidrug-resistant Salmonella Infantis has spread worldwide, primarily linked to poultry product consumption. However, in most countries from the Americas Region, such as Chile, the extent of the dissemination of emergent Salmonella Infantis and its molecular epidemiology remains unknown. In May and September 2023, an online search was conducted using the Google engine and the PMC database with the terms \"Salmonella,\" \"Infantis,\" and \"Chile,\" with no language restrictions. We assessed the results to select those presenting antimicrobial resistance, epidemiologic, or genomic data directly associated with isolates from Chile (13 studies). The selected studies showed that the prevalence of Salmonella Infantis in poultry-meat production systems, its resistance to different antibiotics, and the number of human cases of infection caused by this serovar have increased since 2014-2016. However, these reports were limited to phenotypic data or involved the genomic analysis of a few isolates (<50) obtained from the same source. No study has assessed the genomic epidemiology of the Salmonella Infantis population at the country level.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere, we present the first large-scale genomic epidemiology analysis of Salmonella Infantis in Chile, including isolates from environmental, food, animal, and human sources obtained from 2009 to 2022. We found that Salmonella Infantis in Chile is divided into several clusters of highly related isolates and that only a single cluster, the HC20_343, was associated with multiple antimicrobial-resistance determinants and pESI-like megaplasmids. We also report that isolates from this cluster are widespread among most sources, including irrigation water, poultry, food, and human cases. Detection of AMR determinants coupled with antimicrobial- susceptibility testing indicated that most HC20_343 isolates are ESBL-producers and have intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin. Population structure analysis of this foodborne pathogen evidenced an active transmission of MDR Salmonella Infantis between different niches. This study reveals the widespread dissemination of MDR Salmonella Infantis in Chile.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe evidence indicates that emerging Salmonella Infantis from the HC20_343 cluster is spreading among various niches, including irrigation water, poultry, and food, causing human infections in Chile. Its resistance to first-line antibiotics used for treating salmonellosis in individuals with a higher risk of severe or invasive infections is concerning. Currently, most surveillance and control efforts to reduce salmonellosis in Chile are focused on the poultry industry, and the study of outbreaks does not include whole-genome sequence analyses. Our findings highlight the urgent necessity to improve the surveillance and control measures to include agricultural waters to prevent contamination of produce and the further dissemination of resistance genes in the environment. As the HC20_343 cluster is highly prevalent in the Americas, further research involving large-scale genomic population analyses would shed light on the extent of the dissemination and transmission routes of emergent Salmonella Infantis in the continent and may contribute to informing surveillance and control policies.",

The NS1 protein of influenza B virus (NS1B) suppresses the host innate immune response to infection. Here, integrative structural biology studies revealed previously unrecognized blunt-end dsRNA binding by the NS1B C-terminal domain (NS1B-CTD), in which conserved basic groups interact with 5-triphosphorylated double-stranded RNA (5ppp-dsRNA), analogous to complexes formed by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). NS1B-CTD preferentially binds 5ppp-dsRNA, the primary pathogen-associated feature that activates RIG-I. NS1B-CTD competition with RIG-I for 5ppp-dsRNA suppresses activation of RIG-Is ATPase activity that otherwise initiates interferon synthesis. The NS1B N-terminal RNA-binding domain lacks such 5ppp-dsRNA end preferences. In cells infected with influenza B virus RIG-I activation is inhibited. However, RIG-I activation and the resulting phosphorylation of transcription factor IRF-3 are not inhibited in cells infected with a mutant virus encoding NS1B with a CTD R208A substitution that eliminates 5ppp-dsRNA binding. We conclude that NS1B binds 5ppp-dsRNA to inhibit the RIG-I innate immune response during influenza B virus infection.",

    "abstract": "The human intestines are colonized by trillions of microbes, comprising the gut microbiota, which produce diverse small molecule metabolites and modify host metabolites, such as bile acids, that regulate host physiology. Biosynthesized in the liver, bile acids are conjugated with glycine or taurine and secreted into the intestines, where gut microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) deconjugate the amino acid to produce unconjugated bile acids that serve as precursors for secondary bile acid metabolites. Among these include a recently discovered class of microbially-conjugated bile acids (MCBAs), wherein alternative amino acids are conjugated onto bile acids. To elucidate the metabolic potential of MCBAs, we performed detailed kinetic studies to investigate the preference of BSHs for host- and microbially-conjugated bile acids. We identified a BSH that exhibits positive cooperativity uniquely for MCBAs containing an aromatic sidechain. Further molecular modeling and phylogenetic analyses indicated that BSH preference for aromatic MCBAs is due to a substrate-specific cation-{rho}{varepsilon} interaction and is predicted to be widespread among human gut microbial BSHs.\n\nTOC graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/559308v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d6764org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16efed0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b13a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7682e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Although machine learning approaches have proven effective, their performance on prospective screening data has room for improvement. Prediction accuracy can vary greatly from one variant to the next. So far, it is unclear what characterizes variants that are associated with large model error. We designed and generated a dataset that can be stratified based on four structural characteristics (buriedness, number of contact residues, proximity to the active site and presence of secondary structure), to answer this question. We found that variants with multiple mutations that are buried, closely connected with other residues or close to the active site, which we call challenging mutations, are harder to model than their counterparts (i.e. exposed, loosely connected, far from the active site). This effect emerges only for variants with multiple challenging mutations, since single mutations at these sites were not harder to model. Our findings indicate that variants with challenging mutations are appropriate benchmarking targets for assessing model quality and that stratified dataset design can be leveraged to highlight areas of improvement for machine learning guided protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "The deliberate release of captive-bred individuals, the accidental escape of domesticated strains, or the invasion of closely related conspecifics into wild populations can all lead to introgressive hybridisation, which poses a challenge for conservation and wildlife management. Rates of introgression and the magnitude of associated demographic impacts vary widely across ecological contexts. However, the reasons for this variation remain poorly understood. One rarely considered phenomenon in this context is soft selection, wherein relative trait values determine success in intraspecific competition for a limiting resource. Here we develop an eco-genetic model explicitly focussed on understanding the influence soft selection has on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild populations experiencing intrusion from foreign/domesticated individuals. While based on a generalised salmonine lifecycle, the model is applicable to any taxon that experiences incursion from locally maladapted genotypes, in addition to phenotype-dependent competition for a limiting resource (e.g., breeding sites, feeding territories). The effects of both acute and chronic intrusion depended strongly on the relative competitiveness of intruders versus locals. When intruders were competitively inferior, soft selection limited their reproductive success (ability to compete for limited spawning sites), which prevented strong introgression or population declines from occurring. In contrast, when intruders were competitively superior, this amplified introgression and led to increased maladaptation of the admixed population. This had negative consequences for population size and population viability. The results were sensitive to the intrusion level, the magnitude of reproductive excess, trait heritability, and the extent to which intruders were maladapted relative to locals. Our findings draw attention to under- appreciated interactions between soft selection and maladaptive hybridisation, which may be critical to determining the impact captive breeding programmes and domesticated escapees can have on otherwise self-sustaining wild populations.",

    "abstract": "Cystatins not only encode a high functional variability because of their ability to inhibit different classes of proteases but also because of their propensity to form oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Phytocystatins, essential regulators of protease activity in plants, specifically inhibit papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) and legumains through two distinct cystatin domains. Mammalian cystatins can form amyloid fibrils, however, the potential for amyloid fibril formation of phytocystatins remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana phytocystatin 6 (AtCYT6) exists as a mixture of monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms in solution. Non-covalent oligomerization was facilitated by the N-terminal cystatin domain, while covalent dimerization occurred through disulfide bond formation in the interdomain linker. The non-covalent dimeric form of AtCYT6 retained activity against its target proteases, papain, and legumain, albeit with reduced inhibitory potency. Additionally, we observed the formation of amyloid fibrils by AtCYT6 under acidic pH conditions and upon heating. The amyloidogenic potential could be attributed to AtCYT6s N-terminal domain (AtCYT6-NTD). Importantly, AtCYT6 amyloid fibrils harbored inhibitory activities against both papain and legumain. These findings shed light on the oligomerization and amyloidogenic behavior of AtCYT6, expanding our understanding of phytocystatin biology and its potential functional implications in plant protease regulation.",

    "abstract": "Imatinib and other selective inhibitors of BCR-ABL are the mainstay of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, but resistance to these drugs limits their efficacy. Known resistance mechanisms include ABL mutations, activation of compensatory signaling pathways, and the induction of quiescence that protects CML cells from apoptosis. CDK8/19 Mediator kinases that regulate transcriptional reprogramming have been implicated in the development of resistance to different drugs. We have investigated the effects of CDK8/19 inhibition on CML response to BCR-ABL inhibitors. Selective CDK8/19 inhibitors Senexin B and SNX631 strongly increased the induction of apoptosis in K562 cells treated with imatinib or other BCR-ABL inhibitors. Imatinib induced G1 arrest along with upregulation of p27Kip1, but these effects were suppressed by CDK8/19 inhibition. Senexin B also prevented the induction of G1 arrest and protection from imatinib-induced apoptosis of K562 cells by inducible p27Kip1 expression, suggesting that CDK8/19 activity potentiates both the transcription and function of p27Kip1. In contrast, CDK8/18 inhibition did not have the same effect in KU812 CML cells that do not undergo G1 arrest and are hypersensitive to imatinib. Our results suggest that inhibition of CDK8/19 may be used as a new strategy to prevent quiescence-mediated resistance to BCR-ABL inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Nature has scarcely evolved a biochemistry around fluorine. However, modern science proved fluorinated organic molecules to be suitable building blocks for biopolymers, from peptides and proteins up to entire organisms. Here, we conducted adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments to introduce fluorine into living microorganisms. By cultivating Escherichia coli with fluorinated indole analogues, we successfully evolved microbial cells capable of utilizing either 6-fluoroindole or 7-fluoroindole for growth. Our improved ALE protocols enabled us to overcome previous challenges and achieve consistent and complete adaptation of microbial populations to these unnatural molecules. In the ALE experiments, we supplied fluoroindoles to auxotrophic E. coli bacteria, exerting strong selective pressure that led to microbial adaptation and growth on monofluorinated indoles. Within the cells, these indoles were converted into corresponding amino acids (6- and 7-fluorotryptophan) and incorporated into the proteome at tryptophan sites. This study is a first step and establishes a strong foundation for further exploration of the mechanisms underlying fluorine-based life and how a formerly stressor (fluorinated indole) becomes a vital nutrient.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=64 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/559291v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1428dd7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e20f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@355cd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16125e1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation - an automatic stimulus-response mapping - that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions in animal development. However, this approach has been successfully applied in only a small number of Drosophila tissues. The Drosophila motor nervous system is an excellent model system for studying the biology of neuromuscular junction (NMJ). To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to the Drosophila motor system, here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of this toolkit by knocking out known genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. Using these tools, we discovered an essential role for SNARE pathways in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating the retrograde Gbb signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to lease extracellular vesicles at the NMJ.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn this study, we developed a tissue-specific Cas9 toolkit that enables gene knockout specifically in motor neurons, glial cells, and muscle cells, the three cell types of the Drosophila peripheral motor system. Complementary to existing RNAi methods, this versatile tissue-specific knockout system offers unique advantages for dissecting gene functions at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Using these tools, we discovered that SNARE-mediated secretory pathways are required to maintain the integrity of the NMJ and that ESCRT components play critical yet differential roles in the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles, bouton growth, and membrane turnover at the NMJ. This CRISPR toolkit can be applied to study many biological questions in the neuromuscular system.",

Here we used a mouse specific epigenetic clock to measure epigenetic age of hippocampi from Ts65Dn and euploid mice at 20 weeks. Ts65Dn mice showed an increased hippocampal epigenetic age respect to controls, and the observed changes in DNA methylation partially recapitulated those observed in hippocampi from people with DS.

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly hydrated, three-dimensional network composed of various macromolecules and signaling factors. It serves as a structural scaffold for cells and plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Despite its importance in metazoans, structural knowledge is rudimentary on how the components of the matrisome are secreted, remodeled, and interact with each other and with surrounding cells. Specifically, the exact molecular assembly of important ECM fibers, such as fibronectin fibrils, fibrillin microfibrils, or Collagen-VI filaments has remained enigmatic. This is largely due to methodological limitations in specimen preparation for conventional room-temperature electron microscopy (EM).\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we have developed a cell culture-based 3D-ECM platform compatible with sample thinning by cryo-lift out focused ion beam (FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our workflow involves the implementation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) grown on EM grids, resulting in a highly adaptable and versatile tool to closely mimic ECM environments. This allows us to visualize native ECM and its components for the first time in their fully hydrated, cellular context. Our data reveals an intricate network of ECM fibers and their positioning with respect to matrix-secreting cells. In addition to D-spaced collagen fibers, we visualize previously unresolved fibrous structures, and an amorphous matrix co-assembling in proximity to ECM fibers and delineating the boundary between ECM and empty extra-cellular space. Intra- and extracellular granules presumably represent assembly intermediates of the ECM. Our results add to the structural atlas of the ECM and provide novel insights into ECM secretion, assembly and maintenance.",

Here, by integrating predictive computational modeling validated with experiments, we uncover that Bmp9 upregulates Lunatic Fringe (LFng) in endothelial cells (ECs), and thereby also regulates Notch activity in an inter-dependent, multiplicative fashion. Specifically, the Bmp9-upregulated LFng enhances Notch receptor activity creating a much stronger effect when Dll4 ligands are also present. During sprouting, this LFng regulation alters vessel branching by modulating the timing of EC phenotype selection and rearrangement. Our results further indicate that LFng can play a role in Bmp9-related diseases and in pericyte-driven vessel stabilization, since we find LFng contributes to Jag1 upregulation in Bmp9-stimulated ECs; thus, Bmp9-upregulated LFng results in not only enhanced EC Dll4-Notch1 activation, but also Jag1-Notch3 activation in pericytes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAutomatic cell type annotation methods assign cell type labels to new datasets by extracting relationships from a reference RNA-seq dataset. However, due to the limited resolution of gene expression features, there is always uncertainty present in the label assignment. To enhance the reliability and robustness of annotation, most machine learning methods address this uncertainty by providing a full reject option, i.e. when the predicted confidence score of a cell type label falls below a user-defined threshold, no label is assigned and no prediction is made. As a better alternative, some methods deploy hierarchical models and consider a so-called partial rejection by returning internal nodes of the hierarchy as label assignment. However, because a detailed experimental analysis of various rejection approaches is missing in the literature, there is no consensus on best practices, superiority of certain methods, and potential drawbacks associated with rejection. We evaluate three annotation approaches (1) full rejection (2) partial rejection and (3) no rejection for both flat and hierarchical probabilistic classifiers. Our findings indicate that hierarchical classifiers are superior when rejection is applied, with partial rejection being the preferred rejection approach, as it preserves a significant amount of label information. For optimal rejection implementation, the rejection threshold should be determined through careful examination of a methods rejection behavior. Without rejection, flat and hierarchical annotation perform equally well, as long as the cell type hierarchy accurately captures transcriptomic relationships.",

Beside the role of traditional signals related to goal-directed and stimulus-driven control, a debate exists regarding the mechanisms governing the effect of statistical regularities on attentional selection, and how these are integrated with other control signals. Using a visuo-spatial search task under fMRI, we tested the joint effects of statistical regularities and stimulus-driven salience. We found that both types of signals modulated occipital activity in a spatially-specific manner. Salience acted primarily by reducing the attention bias towards the target location when associated with irrelevant distractors, while statistical regularities reduced this attention bias when the target was presented at a low probability location, particularly at the lower levels of the visual hierarchy. In addition, we found that both statistical regularities and salience activated the dorsal frontoparietal network. Additional exploratory analyses of functional connectivity revealed that only statistical regularities modulated the inter-regional coupling between the posterior parietal cortex and the occipital cortex. These results show that statistical regularities and salience signals are both spatially represented at the occipital level, but that their integration into attentional processing priorities relies on dissociable brain mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences human health remain largely unknown. Pseudomonadota is the third most abundant phylum in normal gut microbiomes. Several pathogens in this phylum can inject so-called virulence effector proteins into host cells. We report the identification of intact type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) in 5 - 20% of commensal Pseudomonadota in normal human gut microbiomes. To understand their functions, we experimentally generated a high-quality protein-protein meta-interactome map consisting of 1,263 interactions between 289 bacterial effectors and 430 human proteins. Effector targets are enriched for metabolic and immune functions and for genetic variation of microbiome-influenced traits including autoimmune diseases. We demonstrate that effectors modulate NF-{kappa}B signaling, cytokine secretion, and adhesion molecule expression. Finally, effectors are enriched in metagenomes of Crohns disease, but not ulcerative colitis patients pointing toward complex contributions to the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. Our results suggest that effector-host protein interactions are an important regulatory layer by which the microbiome impacts human health.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a major global issue in healthcare and understanding the drivers of resistance is key in developing effective strategies to counter it. Many non-antibiotic drugs, such as cancer chemotherapy drugs, can have antimicrobial properties but their effects on bacteria in the context of infection and drug resistance have only recently begun to be explored. Here we investigate the antimicrobial properties of the cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the common human commensal and pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. 5-FU can be metabolized by S. aureus and ultimately results in the inhibition of ThyA, involved in the folate synthesis and thymine synthesis pathways. Bacterial growth was inhibited by 5-FU, and the drug had additive or synergistic interactions with the antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The addition of thymidine overcame the inhibitory effects of 5-FU. Strains of S. aureus evolved in the presence of 5-FU developed mutations in the thymidine kinase gene tdk, likely inhibiting the thymine salvage pathway. In mixtures of clinical trimethoprim-resistant S. aureus strains and sensitive strains, the presence of 5-FU conferred a large fitness advantage to the resistant strains and selected for them over the sensitive strains. Together these data show that 5-FU has antimicrobial effects against S. aureus with these effects targeting the same pathway as existing antibiotics, and that the use of 5-FU in patients may be selecting for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

In this study we describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands as tools for visualization of dopamine D2-like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR-MN212 (20) as a high-affinity ligand for D2-like receptors (pKi (D2longR) = 8.24, pKi (D3R) = 8.58, pKi (D4R) = 7.78) with decent selectivity towards D1-like receptors. Compound 20 is a neutral antagonist in a Go1 activation assay at the D2longR, D3R and D4R, which is an important feature for studies using whole cells. The neutral antagonist 20, equipped with a 5-TAMRA dye, displayed rapid association to the D2longR in binding studies using confocal microscopy demonstrating its suitability for fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, in molecular brightness studies, the ligands binding affinity could be determined in a single-digit nanomolar range that was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. Therefore, the fluorescent compound can be used for quantitative characterization of native D2-like receptors in a broad variety of experimental setups.",

Potential SARS-CoV-2 spillback into rodents is understudied despite their host role for numerous zoonoses and human proximity. We assessed exposure and infection among white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in Connecticut, USA. We observed 1% (6/540) wild-type neutralizing antibody seroprevalence among 2020-2022 residential mice with no cross-neutralization of variants. We detected no SARS-CoV-2 infections via RT-qPCR, but identified non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus infections via pan-coronavirus PCR among 1% (5/468) of residential mice. Sequencing revealed two divergent betacoronaviruses, preliminarily named Peromyscus coronavirus-1 and -2. Both belong to the Betacoronavirus 1 species and are [~]90% identical to the closest known relative, Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence suggests white-footed mice may not be sufficiently susceptible or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to present a long-term human health risk. However, the discovery of divergent, non-SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses expands the diversity of known rodent coronaviruses and further investigation is required to understand their transmission extent.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of pathogen spillover is largely based on viral systems associated with bats. Bacterial infections of zoonotic origin also pose a significant public health burden, many of which are associated with small mammals like rodents that live abundantly among humans. When ecologically different species of small mammals are brought in contact with each other due to various factors, including habitat modification, there is potential for bacterial spillover within the host community and subsequently to humans. Small mammals and their ectoparasite communities present a unique system to investigate the eco-epidemiology of multi-host pathogens, which can inform specific bacterial spillover determinants and their interplay. In a rainforest-human-use mosaic, we applied ecological and evolutionary analysis to investigate Bartonella spp. across small mammal and ectoparasite communities.\n\nWe observed substantial overlap among small mammal communities in different habitat types, predominantly driven by habitat generalists. Most ectoparasites were generalists, infecting multiple hosts, and several host species displayed polyparasitism, i.e., they were infected by multiple ectoparasites. We observed high Bartonella prevalence at both study sites - a forest-plantation mosaic (47.4%) and a protected area (28.8%). Seven of the ten ectoparasite morphotypes sampled were also positive for Bartonella, following the prevalence trend in their hosts. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) revealed an independent association between aggregated ectoparasite load in species and Bartonella prevalence, implicating ectoparasites in transmission. Bartonella lineages from small mammals were host-specific, while ectoparasites showed no host-specific associations. They carried Bartonella associated with other hosts, indicating the potential for cross-species transmission. Phylogenetic ancestral trait reconstruction of Bartonella haplotypes suggests historic spillover events in the small mammal community, validating the potential for contemporary spillover. These results highlight infection risk from such underdiagnosed agents in the landscape, and the necessity to disentangle complex multi-host multi-vector systems to understand their epidemiological consequences.",

    "abstract": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of RNA processing and cellular function. Technologies to discover RNA targets of RBPs such as TRIBE (targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing) and STAMP (surveying targets by APOBEC1 mediated profiling) utilize fusions of RNA base-editors (rBEs) to RBPs to circumvent the limitations of immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-based methods that require enzymatic digestion and large amounts of input material. To broaden the repertoire of rBEs suitable for editing-based RBP-RNA interaction studies, we have devised experimental and computational assays in a framework called PRINTER (protein-RNA interaction-based triaging of enzymes that edit RNA) to assess over thirty A-to-I and C-to-U rBEs, allowing us to identify rBEs that expand the characterization of binding patterns for both sequence-specific and broad-binding RBPs. We also propose specific rBEs suitable for dual-RBP applications. We show that the choice between single or multiple rBEs to fuse with a given RBP or pair of RBPs hinges on the editing biases of the rBEs and the binding preferences of the RBPs themselves. We believe our study streamlines and enhances the selection of rBEs for the next generation of RBP-RNA target discovery.",

    "abstract": "Take away- Quantification of stress-induced promoter transcription dynamics using a live assays reporter system displays no dependence of signal intensity with gene length.\n- Mathematical modeling predicts that the formation of gene loops leading to the recycling of polymerases can explain the observed behavior.\n- More prevalent polymerase recycling on short genes results in a higher transcriptional output.\n\n\nTranscription enables the production of RNA from a DNA template. Due to the highly dynamic nature of transcription, live-cell imaging methods play a crucial role in measuring the kinetics of this process. For instance, transcriptional bursts have been visualized using fluorescent phage-coat proteins that associate tightly with mRNA stem loops formed on nascent transcripts. To convert the signal emanating from a transcription site into meaningful estimates of transcription dynamics, the influence of various parameters on the measured signal must be evaluated. Here, the effect of gene length on the intensity of the transcription site focus was analyzed. Intuitively, a longer gene can support a larger number of transcribing polymerases, thus leading to an increase in the measured signal. However, measurements of transcription induced by hyper-osmotic stress responsive promoters display independence from gene length. A mathematical model of the stress-induced transcription process suggests that the formation of gene loops that favor the recycling of polymerase from the terminator to the promoter can explain the observed behavior. One experimentally validated prediction from this model is that the amount of mRNA produced from a short gene should be higher than for a long one as the density of active polymerase on the short gene will be increased by polymerase recycling. Our data suggest that this recycling contributes significantly to the expression output from a gene and that polymerase recycling is modulated by the promoter identity or the cellular state.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe response of double-stranded DNA to external mechanical stress plays a central role in its interactions with the protein machinery in the cell. Modern atomistic force fields have been shown to provide highly-accurate predictions for the fine structural features of the duplex. In contrast, and despite their pivotal function, less attention has been devoted to the accuracy in the prediction of the elastic parameters. Several reports have addressed the flexibility of double-stranded DNA via all-atom molecular dynamics, yet the collected information is insufficient to have a clear understanding of the relative performance of the various force fields. In this work, we fill this gap by performing a systematic study in which several systems, characterized by different sequence contexts, are simulated with the most up-to-date force fields, bcs1 and OL15, in the presence of external forces with increasing magnitude. Analysis of our results, together with their comparison with previous work focused on bsc0, allows us to unveil the differences in the predicted rigidity between the newest force fields, and suggests a road map to test their performance against experiments.",

Here, we report a non-human primate model of metabolic PASC using SARS-CoV-2 infected African green monkeys (AGMs). Using this model, we have identified a dysregulated chemokine signature and hypersensitive T cell population during acute COVID-19 that correlates with elevated and persistent hyperglycemia four months post-infection. This persistent hyperglycemia correlates with elevated hepatic glycogen, but there was no evidence of long-term SARS-CoV-2 replication in the liver and pancreas. Finally, we report a favorable glycemic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, administered on day 4 post-infection.

In 2009, the H1N1 pandemic (pdmH1N1) virus spilled back into swine, but did not become endemic. However, the pdmH1N1 did contribute the matrix gene segment (pdmM) to the swFLUAVs circulating in the pig population; which replaced the classical swine matrix gene (swM) found in the TRIG cassette, suggesting that the pdmM has a fitness benefit. Others have shown that swFLUAV containing the pdmM have greater neuraminidase activity and transmission efficiency compared to viruses containing the swM gene segment. We hypothesized that the matrix gene could also affect disease and utilized two infection models, resistant BALB/c and susceptible DBA/2 mice, to assess swFLUAV pathogenicity. We infected BALB/c and DBA/2 mice with a panel of H1 and H3 swFLUAVs containing the swM or pdmM gene and measured lung virus titers, morbidity, mortality, and lung histopathology. H1 influenza strains containing the pdmM gene caused greater morbidity and mortality in both resistant and susceptible murine strains, while H3 swFLUAVs caused no clinical disease. However, both H1 and H3 swFLUAVs containing the pdmM replicated to higher viral titers in the lungs and pdmM containing H1 viruses induced greater histological changes compared to swM H1 viruses. While the surface glycoproteins contribute to swFLUAV pathogenicity, and other genes also influence disease, these data suggest that the origin of the matrix gene also contributes to pathogenicity of swFLUAV viruses in mice.",

As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, variants resistant to nirmatrelvir and other currently available treatments are likely to arise. This study aimed to identify and characterize mutations that confer resistance to nirmatrelvir. To safely generate Mpro resistance mutations, we passaged a previously developed, chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-Mpro) with increasing, yet suboptimal concentrations of nirmatrelvir. Using Wuhan-1 and Omicron Mpro variants, we selected a large set of mutants. Some mutations are frequently present in GISAID, suggesting their relevance in SARS-CoV-2. The resistance phenotype of a subset of mutations was characterized against clinically available PIs (nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir) with cell-based and biochemical assays. Moreover, we showed the putative molecular mechanism of resistance based on in silico molecular modelling. These findings have implications on the development of future generation Mpro inhibitors, will help to understand SARS-CoV-2 protease-inhibitor-resistance mechanisms and show the relevance of specific mutations in the clinic, thereby informing treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic has officially ended1, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve. Recent infections have been dominated by XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 subvariants2. A new subvariant designated BA.2.86 has just emerged, spreading to 21 countries in 5 continents3. This virus contains 34 spike mutations compared to its BA.2 predecessor, thereby raising concerns about its propensity to evade existing antibodies. We examined its antigenicity using human sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Reassuringly, BA.2.86 was not more resistant to human sera than XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1, indicating that the new subvariant would not have a growth advantage in this regard. Importantly, sera from patients who had XBB breakthrough infection exhibited robust neutralizing activity against all viruses tested, suggesting that upcoming XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines could confer added protection. The finding that the longer genetic distance of BA.2.86 did not yield a larger antigenic distance was partially explained by the mAb data. While BA.2.86 showed greater resistance to mAbs to subdomain 1 (SD1) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) class 2 and 3 epitopes, it was more sensitive to mAbs to class 1 and 4/1 epitopes in the \"inner face\" of RBD that is exposed only when this domain is in the \"up\" position. We also identified six new spike mutations that mediate antibody resistance, including E554K that threatens SD1 mAbs in clinical development. The BA.2.86 spike also had a remarkably high receptor affinity. The ultimate trajectory of this new SARS-CoV-2 variant will soon be revealed by continuing surveillance, but its worldwide spread is worrisome.",

    "abstract": "The best whole genome assemblies are currently built from a combination of highly accurate short-read sequencing data and long-read sequencing data that can bridge repetitive and problematic regions. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) produce long-read sequencing platforms and they are continually improving their technology to obtain higher-quality read data that is approaching the quality obtained from short-read platforms such as Illumina. As these innovations continue, we were interested in evaluating how much ONT read coverage produced by the Rapid Barcoding Kit v14 (SQK-RBK114) is necessary to generate high-quality hybrid and long-read-only genome assemblies for a panel of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales bacterial isolates. We found that 30X long-read coverage is sufficient if Illumina data is available, and that 100X long-read coverage is recommended for long-read-only assemblies. We found that Illumina polishing is still improving SNVs and INDELs in long-read-only assemblies. We also examined if antimicrobial resistance genes could be accurately identified in long-read-only data, and found that Flye assemblies regardless of ONT coverage detected > 94 % of resistance genes at 100% identity and length. Overall, the Rapid Barcoding Kit v14 and long-read-only assemblies can be an optimal sequencing strategy depending on the specific use case and resources available.",

    "abstract": "Overlapping or convergent stress-activated molecular pathways exist to coordinate cell fate in response to stimuli such as hypoxia, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and unfolded proteins. Cells can remodel the splicing and translation machineries to mount a specialized gene expression response to certain stresses. Here, we show that hypoxic human cells in 2D and 3D culture models increase the relative abundance by 1.7- to 2.6-fold and 4.7- to 11.5-fold, respectively, of a longer mRNA variant of ribosomal protein S24 (RPS24L) compared to a shorter mRNA variant (RPS24S) by favoring the inclusion of a 22 bp cassette exon. Mechanistically, RPS24L and RPS24S are induced and repressed, respectively, by distinct parallel pathways in hypoxia: RPS24L is induced in an autophagy-dependent manner, while RPS24S is reduced by mTORC1 repression and in a HIF-dependent manner. RPS24L is a more stable mRNA in hypoxia and produces a more stable protein isoform compared to RPS24S. Cells overexpressing RPS24L display improved survival and growth in hypoxia relative to control cells and cells overexpressing RPS24S, which display impaired survival. Previous work from our group showed a correlation between RPS24L levels and tumor hypoxia in prostate cancer. These data highlight RPS24L as a stress-induced alternative splicing event that favors hypoxic cell survival, which could be exploited by cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment.",

We herein describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands, structurally derived from D1R antagonist SCH-23390 and labeled with two different fluorescent dyes, as tool compounds for the visualization of D1-like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR-NR435 (25) as a high-affinity ligand for D1-like receptors (pKi (D1R) = 8.34, pKi (D5R) = 7.62) with excellent selectivity towards D2-like receptors. Compound 25 proved to be a neutral antagonist at the D1R and D5R in a Gs heterotrimer dissociation assay, an important feature to avoid receptor internalization and degradation when working with whole cells. The neutral antagonist 25 displayed rapid association and complete dissociation to the D1R in kinetic binding studies using confocal microscopy verifying its applicability for fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, molecular brightness studies determined a single-digit nanomolar binding affinity of the ligand, which was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. For this reason, this fluorescent ligand is a useful tool for a sophisticated characterization of native D1 receptors in a variety of experimental setups.",

    "abstract": "Generation of mature cells from progenitors requires tight coupling of differentiation and metabolism. During erythropoiesis, erythroblasts are required to massively upregulate globin synthesis then clear extraneous material and enucleate to produce erythrocytes1-3. Nprl3 has remained in synteny with the -globin genes for >500 million years4, and harbours the majority of the -globin enhancers5. Nprl3 is a highly conserved inhibitor of mTORC1, which controls cellular metabolism. However, whether Nprl3 itself serves an erythroid role is unknown. Here, we show that Nprl3 is a key regulator of erythroid metabolism. Using Nprl3-deficient fetal liver and adult competitive bone marrow - fetal liver chimeras, we show that NprI3 is required for sufficient erythropoiesis. Loss of Nprl3 elevates mTORC1 signalling, suppresses autophagy and disrupts erythroblast glycolysis and redox control. Human CD34+ progenitors lacking NPRL3 produce fewer enucleated cells and demonstrate dysregulated mTORC1 signalling in response to nutrient availability and erythropoietin. Finally, we show that the -globin enhancers upregulate NprI3 expression, and that this activity is necessary for optimal erythropoiesis. Therefore, the anciently conserved linkage of NprI3, -globin and their associated enhancers has enabled coupling of metabolic and developmental control in erythroid cells. This may enable erythropoiesis to adapt to fluctuating nutritional and environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Members of the genus Vibrio are ecologically significant bacteria native to aquatic ecosystems globally, and a few can cause diseases in humans. Vibrio-related illnesses have increased in recent years, primarily attributed to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, understanding the role of environmental factors in the occurrence and growth of pathogenic strains is crucial for public health. Water, oyster, and sediment samples were collected between 2009 and 2012 from Chester River and Tangier Sound sites in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA, to investigate the relationship between water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll with the incidence and distribution of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) and Vibrio vulnificus (VV). Odds ratio analysis was used to determine association between the likelihood of VP and VV presence and these environmental variables. Results suggested that water temperature threshold of 20{degrees}C or higher was associated with an increased risk, favoring the incidence of Vibrio spp. A significant difference in salinity was observed between the two sampling sites, with distinct ranges showing high odds ratio for Vibrio incidence, especially in water and sediment, emphasizing the impact of salinity on VP and VV incidence and distribution. Notably, salinity between 9-20 PPT consistently favored the Vibrio incidence across all samples. Relationship between chlorophyll concentrations and VP and VV incidence varied depending on sample type. However, chlorophyll range of 0-10 {micro}g/L was identified as critical in oyster samples for both vibrios. Analysis of odds ratios for water samples demonstrated consistent outcomes across all environmental parameters, indicating water samples offer a more reliable indicator of Vibrio spp. incidence.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the role of environmental parameters in the occurrence of Vibrio species posing significant public health risks and economic burdens such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are of paramount importance. These aquatic bacteria are responsible for various human diseases, including gastroenteritis and wound infections, which can be severe and sometimes fatal. Recent observations suggest that certain environmental conditions may favor the growth of Vibrio, leading to more severe disease outcomes. By investigating the environmental factors that influence the occurrence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus, the need to gain insights into the favorable ranges of environmental variables is apparent. The significance of this research is in identifying the favorable ranges of environmental and ecological factors, which holds the potential to provide an aid in the intervention and mitigation strategies through the development of predictive models, ultimately enhancing our ability to manage and control diseases caused by these pathogens.",

    "abstract": "All humans carry a small fraction of archaic ancestry across the genome, the legacy of gene flow from Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other hominids into the ancestors of modern humans. While the effects of Neanderthal ancestry on human fitness and health have been explored more thoroughly, there are fewer examples of adaptive introgression of Denisovan variants. Here, we study the gene MUC19, for which some modern humans carry a Denisovan-like haplotype. MUC19 is a mucin, a glycoprotein that forms gels with various biological functions, from lubrication to immunity. We find the diagnostic variants for the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype at high frequencies in admixed Latin American individuals among global population, and at highest frequency in 23 ancient Indigenous American individuals, all predating population admixture with Europeans and Africans. We find that some Neanderthals--Vindija and Chagyrskaya--carry the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype, and that it was likely introgressed into human populations through Neanderthal introgression rather than Denisovan introgression. Finally, we find that the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype carries a higher copy number of a 30 base-pair variable number tandem repeat relative to the Human-like haplotype, and that copy numbers of this repeat are exceedingly high in American populations. Our results suggest that the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype served as the raw genetic material for positive selection as American populations adapted to novel environments during their movement from Beringia into North and then South America.",

Yet, the uncontrolled and potentially selfish proliferation of LTR-RTs can lead to deleterious mutations and genome instability, with large fitness costs for their host. While population genomics data suggest that an ongoing LTR-RT mobility is common in many species, the understanding of their dual roles in evolution is limited. Here, we harness the genetic diversity of 320 sequenced natural accessions of the Mediterranean grass Brachypodium distachyon to characterize how genetic and environmental factors influence plant LTR-RT dynamics in the wild. When combining a coverage-based approach to estimate global LTR-RT copy number variations with mobilome-sequencing of nine accessions exposed to eight different stresses, we find little evidence for a major role of environmental factors in LTR-RT accumulations in B. distachyon natural accessions. Instead, we show that loss of RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), which mediates RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants, results in high transcriptional and transposition activities of RLC_BdisC024 (HOPPLA) LTR-RT family elements, and that these effects are not stress-specific. This work supports findings indicating an ongoing mobility in B. distachyon and reveals that host RNA-directed DNA methylation rather than environmental factors controls their mobility in this wild grass model.",

    "abstract": "Immune signaling needs to be well-regulated to promote clearance of pathogens, while preventing aberrant inflammation. Interferons (IFNs) and antiviral genes are activated by the detection of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Signal transduction downstream of RLRs proceeds through a multi-protein complex organized around the central adaptor protein MAVS. Recent work has shown that protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules providing allosteric regulation or acting as molecular guides or scaffolds. Thus, we hypothesized that RNA plays a role in organizing MAVS signaling platforms. Here, we show that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacts with the 3' untranslated regions of cellular mRNAs. Importantly, elimination of RNA by RNase treatment disrupts the MAVS signalosome, including newly identified regulators of RLR signaling, and inhibits phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3. This supports the hypothesis that RNA molecules scaffold proteins in the MAVS signalosome to induce IFNs. Together, this work uncovers a function for cellular RNA in promoting signaling through MAVS and highlights a generalizable principle of RNA regulatory control of cytoplasmic immune signaling complexes.",

    "abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) are cholesterol-derived molecules in the human gut that aid in digestion and nutrient absorption, regulate host metabolic processes, and influence gut microbiome composition. Both the host and its microbiome contribute to enzymatic modifications that shape the chemical diversity of BAs in the gut. Several bacterial species have been reported to conjugate standard amino acids to BAs, but it was not known if bacteria conjugate other classes of amines to BAs. We show that Bacteroides fragilis strain P207, isolated from a bacterial bloom in the J-pouch of a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) pouchitis, conjugates standard amino acids and the neuroactive amines {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and tyramine to deoxycholic acid. We extended our analysis to other human gut isolates and identified bacterial species that conjugate GABA and tyramine to primary and secondary BAs, and further identified diverse BA-GABA and -tyramine amides in human stool. A time-series metabolomic analysis of UC J-pouch contents revealed a lack of secondary bile acids and a shifting BA conjugate profile before, during and after onset of pouchitis, including temporal changes in several BA-GABA amides. Treatment of pouchitis with ciprofloxacin was associated with a marked reduction of nearly all BA amides in the J-pouch. Our study expands the known repertoire of conjugated bile acids produced by bacteria to include BA conjugates to the neuroactive amines GABA and tyramine, and demonstrates that these molecules are present in the human gut.\n\nImportanceBile acids (BAs) are modified in multiple ways by host enzymes and the microbiota to produce a chemically diverse set of molecules that assist in the digestive process and impact many physiological functions. This study reports the discovery of bacterial species that conjugate the neuroactive molecules, GABA and tyramine, to primary and secondary BAs. We further present evidence that BA-GABA and BA-tyramine conjugates are present in the human gut, and document a shifting BA-GABA profile in a human pouchitis patient before, during and after inflammation and antibiotic treatment. GABA and tyramine are potent neuroactive molecules and common metabolic products of the gut microbiota. GABA- and tyramine-conjugated BAs may influence receptor-mediated regulatory mechanisms within the gastrointestinal tract and absorption of these molecules and their entry into the enterohepatic circulation may impact host physiology at distal tissue sites.

    "abstract": "As coral reefs continue to decline due to climate change, the role of coral epigenetics (specifically, gene body methylation, GBM) in coral acclimatization warrants investigation. The evidence is currently conflicting. In diverse animal phyla the baseline GBM level is associated with gene function: continuously expressed \"housekeeping\" genes are typically highly methylated, while inducible context-dependent genes have low or no methylation at all. Some authors report association between GBM and the environment, and interpret this observation as evidence of GBMs role in acclimatization. Yet, others argue that correlation between GBM change and gene expression change is typically absent or negligible. Here, we used the reef- building coral, Acropora millepora, to test whether environmentally driven changes in GBM are associated with a genes ability to respond to environmental changes (plasticity) rather than expression level. We analyzed two cases of modified gene expression plasticity observed in a three-week-long heat acclimatization experiment. The first one was a group of heat-induced genes that failed to revert their expression after the coral was translocated back to the control tank. The second case involved genes that changed the magnitude of their response to the daily temperature fluctuations over the course of the experiment. In both cases we found negligible or no association with GBM change. We conclude that although both gene expression plasticity and GBM can change during acclimatization, there is no direct association between the two. This adds to the increasing volume of evidence that the function of GBM in invertebrates is unrelated to acclimatization on physiological timescales.",

    "abstract": "Unstable transcripts have emerged as markers of active enhancers in vertebrates and shown to be involved in many cellular processes and medical disorders. However, their prevalence and role in plants is largely unexplored. Here, we comprehensively captured all actively initiating (\"nascent\") transcripts across diverse crops and other plants using capped small (cs)RNA-seq. We discovered that unstable transcripts are rare, unlike in vertebrates, and often originate from promoters. Additionally, many \"distal\" elements in plants initiate tissue-specific stable transcripts and are likely bone fide promoters of yet-unannotated genes or non-coding RNAs, cautioning against using genome annotations to infer \"enhancers\" or transcript stability. To investigate enhancer function, we integrated STARR-seq data. We found that annotated promoters, and other regions that initiate stable transcripts rather than unstable transcripts, function as stronger enhancers in plants. Our findings underscore the blurred line between promoters and enhancers and suggest that cis-regulatory elements encompass diverse structures and mechanisms in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) plays critical roles in repairing lesions that arise during DNA replication and is thus essential for viability. RAD51 plays important roles during replication and HR, however, how RAD51 is regulated downstream of nucleofilament formation and how the varied RAD51 functions are regulated is not clear. We have investigated the poorly characterized protein c1orf112/RADIF that previously scored in genome-wide screens for mediators of DNA inter-strand crosslink (ICL) repair. Upon ICL agent exposure, RADIF loss leads to marked cell death, elevated chromosomal instability, increased micronuclei formation, altered cell cycle progression and increased DNA damage signaling. RADIF is recruited to damage foci and forms a complex with FIGNL1. Both proteins have epistatic roles in ICL repair, forming a co-stable complex. Mechanistically, RADIF loss leads to increased RAD51 amounts and foci on chromatin both with or without exogenous DNA damage, defective replication fork progression and reduced HR competency. We posit that RADIF is essential for limiting RAD51 levels on chromatin in the absence of damage and for RAD51 dissociation from nucleofilaments to properly complete HR. Failure to do so leads to replication slowing and inability to complete repair.",

    "abstract": "N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) is a major contributor to the N-terminal acetylome and is implicated in several key cellular processes including apoptosis and proteostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms linking NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation to apoptosis and its relationship with protein homeostasis remain elusive. In this study, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with an inactivated catalytic subunit of NatB (Naa20-/-) to investigate the impact of NatB deficiency on apoptosis regulation. Through quantitative N-terminomics, label-free quantification, and targeted proteomics, we demonstrated that NatB does not influence the proteostasis of all its substrates. Instead, our focus on putative NatB-dependent apoptotic factors revealed that NatB-mediated acetylation serves as a protective shield against UBR4 and UBR1 Arg/N-recognin-mediated degradation. Notably, Naa20-/- MEFs exhibited reduced responsiveness to extrinsic pro-apoptotic stimuli, a phenotype that was partially reversible upon UBR4 Arg/N-recognin silencing and consequent inhibition of procaspase-8 degradation. Collectively, our results shed light on how the interplay between NatB-mediated acetylation and the Arg/N-degron pathway impacts apoptosis regulation, providing new perspectives in the field including in therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial decidualization, a prerequisite for successful pregnancies, relies on transcriptional reprogramming driven by progesterone receptor (PR) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD1/SMAD5 signaling pathways. Despite their critical roles in early pregnancy, how these pathways intersect in reprogramming the endometrium into a receptive state remains unclear. To define how SMAD1 and/or SMAD5 integrate BMP signaling in the uterus during early pregnancy, we generated two novel transgenic mouse lines with affinity tags inserted into the endogenous SMAD1 and SMAD5 loci (Smad1HA/HAand Smad5PA/PA). By profiling the genome-wide distribution of SMAD1, SMAD5, and PR in the mouse uterus, we demonstrated the unique and shared roles of SMAD1 and SMAD5 during the window of implantation. We also showed the presence of a conserved SMAD1, SMAD5, and PR genomic binding signature in the uterus during early pregnancy. To functionally characterize the translational aspects of our findings, we demonstrated that SMAD1/5 knockdown in human endometrial stromal cells suppressed expressions of canonical decidual markers (IGFBP1, PRL, FOXO1) and PR-responsive genes (RORB, KLF15). Here, our studies provide novel tools to study BMP signaling pathways and highlight the fundamental roles of SMAD1/5 in mediating both BMP signaling pathways and the transcriptional response to progesterone (P4) during early pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis) is a highly promising organism for the production of diverse recombinant chemicals, including biofuels. However, conventional genetic engineering in Synechocystis is challenging due to its highly polyploid genome which not only leads to low product yields but also makes the recombinant organism less reliable for use in biomanufacturing. Due to its precision, effectiveness and reliability in a vast array of chassis, CRISPR/Cas9 has the potential of overcoming the drawbacks effected by a polyploid genome. Here we identified and developed an effective sgRNA for the knock-in of nucleotide sequences of varying lengths in the neutral site slr0168 of polyploid Synechocystis using CRISPR/Cas9. The gene encoding digeranylgeranylglycerophospholipid reductase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and the methyl ketone operon from Solanum habrochaites were chosen as the exemplar nucleotide sequences for incorporation into the chromosome of Synechocystis. It is demonstrated here that our sgRNA design was effective for both knock-ins and that CRISPR/Cas9 achieves complete mutant segregation after a single step of selection and induction.",
