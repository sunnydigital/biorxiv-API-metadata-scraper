    "abstract": "DNA lesions are a threat for genome stability. In order to cope with these lesions, cells have evolved lesion tolerance mechanisms: Translesion Synthesis (TLS) that allows the cell to insert a nucleotide directly opposite to the lesion, with the risk if introducing a mutation. Or error-free Damage Avoidance (DA) that uses homologous recombination to retrieve the genetic information from the sister chromatid. In this article, we investigate the timing of lesion bypass. We show that TLS can occur at the fork, rapidly after the encounter with the blocking lesion. But TLS can also occur behind the fork, at postreplicative gaps that are generated downstream of the lesion after repriming has occurred. We show that in this latter situation, TLS is reduced because it is in competition with the Damage Avoidance pathway. We also showed that EXO1 seems to modulate the size of the post-replicative gaps, that in turn modulate the balance between TLS and damage avoidance.",

    "abstract": "The mRNA 5'-cap structure removal by the decapping enzyme DCP2 is a critical step in gene regulation. While DCP2 is the catalytic subunit in the decapping complex, its activity is strongly enhanced by multiple factors, particularly DCP1, which is the major activator in yeast. However, the precise role of DCP1 in metazoans remains to be elucidated. In humans moreover, the specific biological functions of the two DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of human DCP1, we generated cell-lines that were deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b or both to evaluate the importance of DCP1 in the decapping machinery. Our results highlight the importance of human DCP1 in decapping and show that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 enhances the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses outline the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells, regulating specific endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes. Overall, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping and shed light on the distinct functions of its paralogs.",

    "abstract": "Following the encounter with an unrepaired DNA lesion, replication is halted and can restart downstream of the lesion leading to the formation of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap. To complete replication, this ssDNA gap is filled in by one of the two known lesion tolerance pathways: the error-prone Translesion Synthesis (TLS) or the error-free Homology Directed Gap Repair (HDGR). In the present work, we show a role for the RecBC complex that is distinct from its canonical function in homologous recombination at double strand breaks: RecBC (independently of the RecD subunit) is required to protect the 3-end of the nascent DNA at the lesion site, in order to promote efficient lesion bypass. In the absence of RecBC, the nuclease ExoI can access and degrade the nascent DNA, thus strongly inhibiting the action of the TLS DNA polymerases and also affecting the HDGR mechanism. RecBC is recruited only when post-replicatively ssDNA gaps are formed and are covered by the single-stranded binding protein (SSB). This protective role of RecBC is reminiscent of the role of BRCA2 in human cells, once again highlighting the evolutionary conservation of DNA replication mechanisms across all living organisms.",

    "abstract": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a region of the human genome that is key to immune system function but sometimes refractory to genomic analyses due to extreme polymorphism and structural variation. We performed targeted long-read sequencing and de novo assembly of MHC to create 246 highly accurate, fully contiguous, and phased full-length sequences, mostly from data provided by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC). We identified alleles at high resolution across 39 loci including the class I and II HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genes, discovering 1,246 putative novel allele sequences. We identified copy number variation in the C4A and C4B genes and found significant linkage disequilibrium between C4A~C4B haplotypes and 14 MHC loci. We build our sequences into a novel \"pan-MHC\" reference graph, and we demonstrate that this improves the accuracy of short-read variant calling. Our haplotypes and graph contain significantly more population diversity than preexisting MHC sequences, thus improving the prospects for global health equity in this clinically important genomic region.",

    "abstract": "The MICOS complex subunit MIC13 is essential for mitochondrial cristae organization. Mutations in MIC13 cause severe mitochondrial hepato-encephalopathy displaying defective cristae morphology and loss of the MIC10-subcomplex. Here we identified SLP2 as a novel interacting partner of MIC13 and decipher a critical role of SLP2 for MICOS assembly at distinct steps. SLP2 provides a large interaction hub for MICOS subunits and loss of SLP2 imparted YME1L-mediated proteolysis of MIC26 and drastic alterations in cristae morphology. We further identified a MIC13-specific role in stabilizing the MIC10-subcomplex via a MIC13-YME1L axis. SLP2 together with the stabilized MIC10-subcomplex promotes efficient assembly of the MIC60-subcomplex forming the MICOS-MIB complex. Consistently, super-resolution nanoscopy showed a dispersed distribution of the MIC60 in cells lacking SLP2 and MIC13. Our study reveals converging and interdependent assembly pathways for the MIC10- and MIC60-subcomplexes which are controlled in two ways, the MIC13-YME1L and the SLP2-YME1L axes, revealing mechanistic insights of these factors in cristae morphogenesis. These results will be helpful in understanding the human pathophysiology linked to mutations in MIC13 or its interaction partners.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied with regards to its contribution to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. APP is an ubiquitously expressed type I transmembrane protein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and translocated to the plasma membrane where it undergoes proteolytic cleavages by several identified proteases. Conversely to other known proteases, we previously elucidated human rhomboid protease RHBDL4 as a novel APP processing enzyme where several cleavages likely occur already in the ER. Interestingly, the pattern of RHBDL4-derived large APP C-terminal fragments resemble those generated by the {eta}-secretase or MT5-MMP, which was described to generate so called A{eta} fragments. The similarity in large APP C-terminal fragments between both proteases raised the question whether RHBDL4 may contribute to {eta}-secretase activity and A{eta}-like fragments. Here, we identified two cleavage sites of RHBDL4 in APP by mass spectrometry, which, intriguingly, lie in close proximity to the cleavage sites of MT5-MMP. Indeed, we observed that RHBDL4 generates A{eta}-like fragments in vitro without contributions of -, {beta}-, or {gamma}-secretases. Such A{eta}-like fragments are likely generated in the ER since RHBDL4-derived APP-C-terminal fragments do not reach the cell surface. Inherited, familial APP mutations appear to not affect this processing pathway. In RHBDL4 knockout mice, we observed increased cerebral full length APP levels in comparison to WT brains in support of RHBDL4 being a physiologically relevant protease for APP. Furthermore, we found secreted A{eta} fragments in dissociated mixed cortical cultures from wild type mice, however significantly less A{eta} fragments in cultures from RHBDL4 knockout mice. Our data underscores that RHBDL4 contributes to {eta}-secretease-like processing of APP and that RHBDL4 is a physiologically relevant protease for APP.",
