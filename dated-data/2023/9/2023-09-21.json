    "abstract": "Endoreduplication is a modified cell cycle in which cells duplicate their DNA without subsequent mitosis. This process is common in plants and can also be found in other organisms like algae and animals. Biotrophic plant pathogens have been shown to induce endoreduplication in their host to gain space and/or nutrients. Phytomyxea (divided into the Plasmodiophorida, the Phagomyxida, and the Marinomyxa clade) are obligate biotrophic parasites of plants, diatoms, brown algae, and oomycetes. Here, we tested if phytomyxids induce local endoreduplication in two distant hosts (plants and brown algae). By combining fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) coupled with nuclear area measurements and flow cytometry, we confirmed that endoreduplication is induced by Plasmodiophora brassicae (Plasmodiophorida) in infected plants and demonstrate this process in combination with Maullinia ectocarpii and Maullinia braseltonii (Phagomyxida) in brown algae. We identified molecular signatures of endoreduplication in RNA-seq datasets of P. brassicae-infected Brassica oleraceae and M. ectocarpii-infected Ectocarpus siliculosus. Cell cycle switch proteins (CCS52A1 and B in plants and CCS52 in algae) as well as the protein kinase WEE1 (in plants) were identified as genes potentially important for the phytomyxean-induced switch from the mitotic cell cycle to the endocycle. Their expression pattern changed in infected plants and brown algae accordingly. In this study we expand the knowledge on Phytomyxea-host interactions by showing that induced endoreduplication in the host is a conserved feature in phytomyxid infections. The induction of this cellular mechanism by phytomyxid parasites in phylogenetically distant hosts further points at a fundamental importance of endoreduplication in these biotrophic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is one of them most common causes of fungal disease in humans and is a commensal member of the human microbiome. The ability of C. albicans to cause disease is tightly correlated with its ability to undergo a morphological transition from budding yeast to a filamentous form (hyphae and pseudohyphae). This morphological transition is accompanied by the induction of a set of well characterized hyphae-associated genes and transcriptional regulators. To date, the vast majority of data regarding this process has been based on in vitro studies of filamentation using a range of inducing conditions. Recently, we developed an in vivo imaging approach that allows the direct characterization of morphological transition during mammalian infection. Here, we couple this imaging assay with in vivo expression profiling to characterize the time course of in vivo filamentation and the accompanying changes in gene expression. We also compare in vivo observations to in vitro filamentation using a medium (RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium with 10% bovine calf serum) widely used to mimic host conditions. From these data, we make the following conclusions regarding in vivo and in vitro filamentation. First, the transcriptional programs regulating filamentation are rapidly induced in vitro and in vivo. Second, the tempo of filamentation in vivo is prolonged relative to in vitro filamentation and the period of high expression of genes associated with that process is also prolonged. Third, hyphae are adapting to changing infection environments after filamentation has reached steady-state.\n\nImportanceCandida albicans filamentation is correlated with virulence and is an intensively studied aspect of C. albicans biology. The vast majority of studies on C. albicans filamentation are based on in vitro induction of hyphae and pseudohyphae. Here we used an in vivo filamentation assay and in vivo expression profiling to compare the tempo of morphogenesis and gene expression between in vitro and in vivo filamentation. Although the hyphal gene expression profile is induced rapidly in both conditions, it remains stably expressed over the 24hr time course in vivo while the expression of other environmentally responsive genes is dynamic. As such, it is important to regard the filamentation process as a separate growth phase of C. albicans that is as adaptable to changing growth conditions as the more familiar yeast phase.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of gene expression, but how RBPs convey regulatory instructions to the core effectors of RNA processing is unclear. We address this problem by dissecting the effector interface responsible for regulation by a developmentally essential RBP. We show that the sequence-specific RBP Unkempt, in addition to its RNA-binding domain, contains an extensive intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a dimerization domain, all of which distinctly contribute to Unkempts function. Within IDR, we identify an array of linear motifs that support direct contact with two central effectors, the CCR4-NOT complex and PABPC. The spatial arrangement, dual-purpose motifs, and obligate homodimerization allow for high-avidity effector interactions that are mandatory for the accuracy of RNA targeting, translational repression, and control of cell morphology by Unkempt. Our study establishes the molecular assembly and functional principles of an RBP- effector interface, with general implications for the evolution and function of RBP-operated regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the factors that determine mammalian cell viability when oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) function is impaired poses challenges due to the diverse cellular responses and limited clinical material availability. Moreover, animal models often fail to replicate human phenotypes. To address these challenges, this study conducted comprehensive analyses involving multiple defects and species by comparing the RNA-Seq expression profiles of human and murine cell lines with distinct nuclear backgrounds, representing both normal and OXPHOS-deficient models. To minimize species-specific variation, the study employed clustering techniques to group murine genes affected by OXPHOS dysfunction and identified crucial regulators like ATF4, UCP1, and SYVN1. ATF4 consistently displayed activation in response to OXPHOS defects, not only in murine but also in human cells, confirming its pivotal role in the cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction. By integrating human and murine data, the study unveiled a conserved regulatory network encompassing genes related to the mTOR pathway and folate metabolism. Remarkably, the study uncovered an unexpected finding: the depletion of ATF4 in both mouse and human cells impairs OXPHOS assembly and supercomplex organization. This impairment primarily stems from a severe disruption in complex I assembly in the absence of ATF4, even under non-stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing and spliceosome assembly is limited by technical challenges to examining spliceosomes in vivo. Here we report the isolation of RNP complexes derived from precatalytic A or B-like spliceosomes solubilized from the chromatin pellet of lysed nuclei. We found that these complexes contain U2 snRNP proteins and a portion of the U2 snRNA, bound with intronic branch sites prior to the first catalytic step of splicing. Sequencing these pre-mRNA fragments allowed the transcriptome-wide mapping of branch sites with high sensitivity. In addition to known U2 snRNP proteins, these complexes contained the proteins RBM5 and RBM10. RBM5 and RBM10 are alternative splicing regulators that control exons affecting apoptosis and cell proliferation in cancer, but were not previously shown to associate with the U2 snRNP or to play roles in branch site selection. We delineate a common segment of RBM5 and RBM10, separate from their known functional domains, that is required for their interaction with the U2 snRNP. We identify a large set of splicing events regulated by RBM5 and RBM10 and find that they predominantly act as splicing silencers. Disruption of their U2 interaction renders the proteins inactive for repression of many alternative exons. We further find that these proteins assemble on branch sites of nearly all exons across the transcriptome, including those whose splicing is not altered by them. We propose a model where RBM5 and RBM10 act as components of the U2 snRNP complex. From within this complex, they sense structural features of branchpoint recognition to either allow progression to functional spliceosome or rejection of the complex to inhibit splicing.",

    "abstract": "Diverse phytoplankton modulate the coupling between the ocean carbon and nutrient cycles through life-history traits such as cell size, elemental quotas, and ratios. Biodiversity is mostly considered at broad functional levels, but major phytoplankton lineages are themselves highly diverse. As an example, Synechococcus is found in nearly all ocean regions and contain extensive intraspecific variation. Here, we grew four closely related Synechococcus isolates in semi-continuous cultures across a range of temperatures (16-25{degrees}C) to quantify for the relative role of intraspecific trait variation vs. environmental change. We report differences in cell size (p<0.01) as a function of strain and clade (p<0.01). The carbon (QC), nitrogen (QN), and phosphorus (QP) cell quotas all increased with cell size. Furthermore, cell size has an inverse relationship to growth rate. Within our experimental design, temperature alone had a weak physiological effect on cell quota and elemental ratios. Instead, we find systemic intraspecific variance of C:N:P, with cell size and N:P having an inverse relationship. Our results suggest a key role for intraspecific life history traits in determining elemental quotas and stoichiometry. Thus, the extensive biodiversity harbored within many lineages may modulate the impact of environmental change on ocean biogeochemical cycles.",

    "abstract": "The laboratory mouse has served as the premier animal model system for both basic and preclinical investigations for a century. However, laboratory mice capture a narrow subset of the genetic variation found in wild mouse populations. This consideration inherently restricts the scope of potential discovery in laboratory models and narrows the pool of potentially identified phenotype-associated variants and pathways. Wild mouse populations are reservoirs of predicted functional and disease-associated alleles, but the sparsity of commercially available, well-characterized wild mouse strains limits their broader adoption in biomedical research. To overcome this barrier, we have recently imported, sequenced, and phenotyped a set of 11 wild-derived inbred strains developed from wild-caught Mus musculus domesticus. Each of these \"Nachman strains\" immortalizes a unique wild haplotype sampled from five environmentally diverse locations across North and South America: Saratoga Springs, New York, USA; Gainesville, Florida, USA; Manaus, Brazil; Tucson, Arizona, USA; and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Whole genome sequence analysis reveals that each strain carries between 4.73-6.54 million single nucleotide differences relative to the mouse reference assembly, with 42.5% of variants in the Nachman strain genomes absent from classical inbred mouse strains. We phenotyped the Nachman strains on a customized pipeline to assess the scope of disease-relevant neurobehavioral, biochemical, physiological, metabolic, and morphological trait variation. The Nachman strains exhibit significant inter-strain variation in >90% of 1119 surveyed traits and expand the range of phenotypic diversity captured in classical inbred strain panels alone. Taken together, our work introduces a novel wild-derived inbred mouse strain resource that will enable new discoveries in basic and preclinical research. These strains are currently available through The Jackson Laboratory Repository under laboratory code NachJ.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational oxidation of methionine residues can destabilize proteins or modify their functions. Although levels of methionine oxidation can provide important information regarding the structural integrity and regulation of proteins, their quantitation is often challenging as analytical procedures in and of themselves can artifactually oxidize methionines. Here, we develop a mass spectrometry-based method called Methionine Oxidation by Blocking with Alkylation (MObBa) that quantifies methionine oxidation by selectively alkylating and blocking unoxidized methionines. Thus, alkylated methionines can be used as a stable proxy for unoxidized methionines. Using proof of concept experiments, we demonstrate that MObBa can be used to measure methionine oxidation levels within individual synthetic peptides and on proteome-wide scales. MObBa may provide a straightforward experimental strategy for mass spectrometric quantitation of methionine oxidation.\n\nSignificance StatementOver time, cellular proteins can become oxidatively damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS). A residue that is particularly prone to oxidative damage is methionine. Here, we develop and validate a methodology for detecting and quantifying levels of methionine oxidation by mass spectrometry. This approach has a number of practical advantages over methods currently available for analysis of methionine oxidation. The ability to accurately quantify methionine oxidation will provide important insights into factors that influence protein homeostasis within a cell.",

    "abstract": "Charging of analytes is a prerequisite for performing mass spectrometry analysis. In proteomics, electrospray ionization stands as the dominant technique for this process. Although the observation of differences in the peptide charge state distribution (CSD) is well-known among experimentalists, its analytical value remains underexplored. To investigate the utility of this dimension, we analyzed several public datasets, comprising over 250,000 peptide CSD profiles from the human proteome. We found that the CSD dimension demonstrates high reproducibility across multiple laboratories and extensive time intervals. The general observation was that the CSD dimension enabled effective partitioning of the peptide property space, resulting in enhanced discrimination between sequence or constitutional peptide isomers. Next, by evaluating the CSD values of phosphorylated peptides, we were able to differentiate between phosphopeptides that we presume adopt salt-bridge structures in the gas phase and those that do not. The reproducibility of the CSD values, in general (mean cosine similarity above 0.97 for most of the experiments), qualified CSD data suitable to train a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting CSD values (negative cosine similarity below - 0.98). When we applied the CSD dimension to MS1- and MS2-based proteomics experiments, we consistently observed an increase in protein identification rate. Although the CSD dimension is not as effective a discriminator as the widely-used retention time dimension, it still holds potential for application in direct infusion proteomics.\n\nElectrospray ionization (ESI) is by far the most dominant ionization technique used for biomolecule ionization in mass spectrometry,1 including the extensive field of proteomics. ESI is frequently coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and offers efficient ionization of a broad range of biomolecules.\n\nUnder ESI conditions, peptides can adopt several protonation states. Some of these states are more likely and thus more abundant, leading to the formation of a peptide charge-state distribution (CSD). Currently, proteomics almost exclusively uses positive ion mode, i.e. ionization resulting in positively charged ions. Peptide cations are preferentially produced by protonation of the most basic sites in peptides. The gas-phase basicity (GB) of these sites is determined by various factors, including the intrinsic gas-phase basicity(GBint) of aminoacids, although it is not the sole decisive parameter. Other factors also play significant roles. For instance, the presence of chemical functional groups capable of sharing protons, known as charge solvation groups, can increase the energy required to remove a proton from a charged site, effectively enhancing the GB of that site. Additionally, the Coulomb repulsion between neighboring protons already present reduces the proton affinity of a potential protonation site. This reduction in GB can make a residue that is inherently less basic but more distant from existing protons more favorable for protonation. Combined, these factors influence the pattern of protonation which has been measured experimentally2,3 and has been a subject of investigation since the beginning of tandem mass spectrometry4,5. The peptide CSD is also influenced by the peptide conformational space, which encompasses the array of possible configurations arising from different combinations of bond rotations, dihedral angles, and side chain orientations. In that way, different peptide structures can affect the accessibility of specific amino acid residues for protonation or deprotonation, thereby impacting the observed charge states. Finally, some polypeptides can form salt bridges in the gas phase, which are electrostatic interactions between amino acid residues of opposing charge and have been widely studied due to their structural and functional importance in proteins6-9. In the context of CSD, the formation of a salt bridge affects this parameter by neutralizing one positive charge in the bond. For phosphorylated peptides, the phosphate motif is particularly prone to forming salt bridge structures. This is because its molecular orbital system disperses its negative charge over two or more oxygen atoms. In contrast, other typical electron donors like Asp and Glu have resonance structures where the electron pair is delocalized over a smaller {pi}-molecular orbital system10. Earlier important work has noted measurable compaction of phosphopeptides in ion mobility mass spectrometry11-13. In this relation, Clemmer and co-workers14 determined lower intrinsic size parameters for the phosphorylation motif compared to any other amino acid. The intrinsic size parameter is a measure of the average value of each amino acid residue or modification that contributes to a peptides cross-section. It was suggested that the presence of the phosphoryl group can play a role in internal interactions that cause an overall compacting effect on the peptide structure compared to sequences without this modification.\n\nPeptide CSDs and their relation to peptide sequence have been the focus of two recent studies by Guan et al.15 and Xu et al.16. The study of Guan et al. demonstrated the possibility of accurate prediction of the CSD using a deep learning LSTM model. The study of Xu et al. aims to uncover sequence features responsible for peptide charging by employing a more explainable logistic regression model based on peptide amino acid composition (i.e. not accounting for amino acid interactions). Both studies have indicated the potential utility of their models and findings to advance peptide identification, though definitive outcomes have yet to be presented. Additionally, neither study has considered phosphorylated peptides - a prevalent and extensively researched category of post-translationally modified peptides.\n\nBuilding on these foundational studies, we pursue here to explore the broader analytical importance of CSD in proteomics and investigate in particular the CSD landscape of phosphorylated peptides. In doing so, we examined multiple public datasets, encompassing over 250,000 peptide/phosphopeptide CSD profiles from the human proteome. We emphasize its consistency, its likely capacity to distinguish phosphorylated peptides with salt-bridge structures, and its potential to enhance protein identification rates in both MS1 and MS2 proteomics experiments.",

    "abstract": "Glycans are key to host-pathogen interactions, whereby recognition by the host and immunomodulation by the pathogen can be mediated by carbohydrate binding proteins, such as lectins of the innate immune system, and their glycoconjugate ligands. Previous studies have shown that excretory-secretory products of the porcine nematode parasite Trichuris suis exert immunomodulatory effects in a glycan-dependent manner. To better understand the mechanisms of these interactions, we prepared N-glycans from T. suis and both analyzed their structures and used them to generate a natural glycan microarray. With this array we explored the interactions of glycans with C-type lectins, C-reactive protein and sera from T. suis infected pigs. Glycans containing LacdiNAc and phosphorylcholine-modified glycans were associated with the highest binding by most of these proteins. In-depth analysis revealed not only fucosylated LacdiNAc motifs with and without phosphorylcholine moieties, but phosphorylcholine-modified mannose and N-acetylhexosamine-substituted fucose residues, in the context of maximally tetraantennary N-glycan scaffolds. Furthermore, O-glycans also contained fucosylated motifs. In summary, the glycans of T. suis are recognized by both the innate and adaptive immune systems, and also exhibit species-specific features distinguishing its glycome from those of other nematodes.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection can severely affect three major organs - the heart, lung, and brain. We analysed SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a interacting host proteins in these three major organs. Further we identified common and unique interacting host proteins, their targeting miRNAs (lung and brain), and delineated associated biological processes reanalysing RNA-seq data from the brain (COVID-19 infected/uninfected Choroid Plexus Organoids study), lung tissue from COVID-19 patients/healthy subjects, and cardiomyocyte cells based transcriptomics analyses.

Though common pathways influenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection were more, unique 21 brain and 7 heart pathways were found. One unique pathway for heart was negative regulation of calcium ion transport. Reported observations of COVID-19 patients with the history of hypertension taking calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or dihydorpyridine CCBs had elevated rate of intubation or increased rate of intubation/death respectively. Also likelihood of hospitalization of chronic CCB users with COVID-19 was more in comparison to long term Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers users.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease that is characterized by immune-mediated demyelination within the central nervous system. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been previously reported as a possible pathophysiological contributor to microglial activation and oligodendroglial loss in MS, particularly in progressive forms of the disease.\n\nMethodsUsing both in vivo and in vitro approaches, this report investigated the use of a previously described ligand of the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), etifoxine, as an immunomodulator that inhibits inflammasome activation in primary human and murine macrophages and microglia. To further elucidate pathologic relevance in the MS context, investigations were also performed ex vivo using peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified CD14+ monocytes derived from secondary progressive MS patients.\n\nResultsHerein, it is demonstrated that etifoxine attenuated clinical symptoms in a mouse model of MS and significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human and murine myeloid-derived cells in vitro by decreasing inflammasome-associated genes and inflammatory cytokine production. These anti-inflammatory effects of etifoxine were mediated independently of its previously described mechanisms related to engagement with TSPO and the GABAA receptor. Furthermore, we observed a similar anti-inflammatory effect of etifoxine on MS patient-derived monocytes, which provides clinical relevance for the investigation of etifoxine as a potential therapeutic in progressive MS. Lastly, through the use of a gene array, we identified multiple signalling pathways in order to elucidate a novel mechanism whereby etifoxine may be inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of etifoxine were mediated independently of its previously described mechanisms related to engagement with TSPO and the GABAA receptor. Furthermore, we observed an anti-inflammatory effect in murine- and human-derived myeloid cells, as well as in MS patient-derived monocytes, which provides clinically relevant evidence to support the exploration of etifoxine as a possible form of therapy for secondary progressive MS.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsSYNGAP1 disorder is a prevalent genetic form of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability (ASD/ID) and is caused by de novo or inherited mutations in one copy of the SYNGAP1 gene. In addition to ASD/ID, SYNGAP1 disorder is associated with comorbid symptoms including treatment-resistant-epilepsy, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal distress. Mechanistic links between these diverse symptoms and SYNGAP1 variants remain obscure, therefore, our goal was to generate a zebrafish model in which this range of symptoms can be studied.\n\nMethodsWe used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce frameshift mutations in the syngap1a and syngap1b zebrafish duplicates (syngap1ab) and validated these stable models for Syngap1 loss-of-function. Because SYNGAP1 is extensively spliced, we mapped splice variants to the two zebrafish syngap1a and b genes and identified mammalian-like isoforms. We then quantified locomotory behaviors in zebrafish syngap1ab larvae under three conditions that normally evoke different arousal states in wild type larvae: aversive, high-arousal acoustic, medium-arousal dark, and low-arousal light stimuli.\n\nResultsWe show that CRISPR/Cas9 indels in zebrafish syngap1a and syngap1b produced loss-of-function alleles at RNA and protein levels. Our analyses of zebrafish Syngap1 isoforms showed that, as in mammals, zebrafish Syngap1 N- and C-termini are extensively spliced. We identified a zebrafish syngap1 1-like variant that maps exclusively to the syngap1b gene. Quantifying locomotor behaviors showed that syngap1ab larvae are hyperactive compared to wild type but to differing degrees depending on the stimulus. Hyperactivity was most pronounced in low arousal settings, with overall movement increasing with the number of mutant syngap1 alleles.\n\nConclusionsOur data support mutations in zebrafish syngap1ab as causal for hyperactivity associated with elevated arousal that is especially pronounced in low-arousal environments.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a medically important flavivirus causing an estimated 50-100 million dengue cases annually, some of whom progress to severe disease. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected cells and has been implicated as a major driver of dengue pathogenesis by inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, less is known about how DENV NS1 interacts with immune cells and what role these interactions play. Here we report that DENV NS1 can trigger activation of inflammasomes, a family of cytosolic innate immune sensors that respond to infectious and noxious stimuli, in mouse and human macrophages. DENV NS1 induces the release of IL-1{beta} in a caspase-1 dependent manner. Additionally, we find that DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation is independent of the NLRP3, Pyrin, and AIM2 inflammasome pathways, but requires CD14. Intriguingly, DENV NS1-induced inflammasome activation does not induce pyroptosis and rapid cell death; instead, macrophages maintain cellular viability while releasing IL-1{beta}. Lastly, we show that caspase-1/11-deficient, but not NLRP3-deficient, mice are more susceptible to lethal DENV infection. Together, these results indicate that the inflammasome pathway acts as a sensor of DENV NS1 and plays a protective role during infection.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to the formation of mucosal memory CD4 T cells that can protect the host. An in-depth understanding of the signals that shape memory cell development is required for more effective vaccine design. We have examined the formation of memory CD4 T cells in the lung following IAV infection of mice, characterising changes to the lung architecture and immune cell composition. IAV-specific CD4 T cells were found throughout the lung at both primary and memory time points. These cells were found near lung airways and in close contact with a range of immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Interactions between lung IAV-specific CD4 T cells and MHCII+ cells during the primary immune response were important in shaping the subsequent memory pool. Treatment with an anti-MHCII blocking antibody increased the proportion of memory CD4 T cells found at lung airways but reduced interferon-{gamma} expression by IAV-specific immunodominant memory CD4 T cells. The immunodominant CD4 T cells expressed higher levels of PD1 than other IAV-specific CD4 T cells and PD1+ memory CD4 T cells were located further away from MHCII+ cells than their PD1-negative counterparts. This distinction in location was lost in mice treated with anti-MHCII antibody. These data suggest that sustained antigen presentation in the lung impacts on the formation of memory CD4 T cells by regulating their cytokine production and location.",

    "abstract": "The growth of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has highlighted an urgent need to identify bacterial pathogenic functions that may be targets for clinical intervention. Although severe bacterial infections profoundly alter host metabolism, prior studies have largely ignored alterations in microbial metabolism in this context. Performing metabolomics on patient and mouse plasma samples, we identify elevated levels of bacterially-derived N- acetylputrescine during gram-negative bloodstream infections (BSI), with higher levels associated with worse clinical outcomes. We discover that SpeG is the bacterial enzyme responsible for acetylating putrescine and show that blocking its activity reduces bacterial proliferation and slows pathogenesis. Reduction of SpeG activity enhances bacterial membrane permeability and results in increased intracellular accumulation of antibiotics, allowing us to overcome AMR of clinical isolates both in culture and in vivo. This study highlights how studying pathogen metabolism in the natural context of infection can reveal new therapeutic strategies for addressing challenging infections.",

    "abstract": "A novel electrochemical bandage (e-bandage) delivering low-level hypochlorous acid (HOCl) was evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa murine wound biofilms. 5 mm skin wounds were created on the dorsum of Swiss-Webster mice and infected with 106 colony forming units (CFU) of P. aeruginosa. Biofilms were formed over two days, after which e-bandages were placed on the wound beds and covered with Tegaderm. Mice were administered Tegaderm-only (control), non-polarized e-bandage (no HOCl production), or polarized e-bandage (using an HOCl-producing potentiostat), with or without concurrently administered systemic amikacin. Purulence and wound areas were measured before and after treatment. After 48 hours, animals were sacrificed, and wounds were harvested for bacterial quantification. Forty-eight hours of polarized e-bandage treatment resulted in mean biofilm reductions of 1.4 log10 CFUs/g (9.0 vs 7.6 log10; p = 0.0107) vs non-polarized controls, and 2.2 log10 CFU/g (9.8 vs 7.6 log10; p = 0.004) vs Tegaderm only controls. Systemic amikacin improved CFU reduction in Tegaderm-only (p = 0.0045) and non-polarized control groups (p = 0.0312), but not in the polarized group (p = 0.3876). Compared to the Tegaderm only group, there was more purulence reduction in the polarized group (p = 0.009), but not in the non-polarized group (p = 0.064). Wound closure was not impeded or improved by either polarized or non-polarized e-bandage treatment. Concurrent amikacin did not impact wound closure or purulence. In conclusion, an HOCl-producing e-bandage reduced P. aeruginosa in wound biofilms with no impairment in wound healing, representing a promising antibiotic-free approach for addressing wound infections.",

Surface-layer Protein A (SlpA), the most expressed protein on bacterial surface, plays a crucial role in the early stages of infection although its role in C. difficile physiology is yet to be fully understood. Anti-S-layer antibodies have been identified in the sera of convalescent patients and correlate with improved outcome of C. difficile infection (CDI). However, the precise mechanisms of how anti-S-layer antibodies can confer protection to the host remain unknown. In this study, we report the first monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting S-layer of the reference strain 630. Characterization of these mAbs unravels important roles for S-layer protein in growth, toxin secretion, and biofilm formation with, surprisingly, opposite effects of different anti-SlpA mAbs on these functions. One anti-SlpA mAb impaired C. difficile growth and restored sensitivity to lysozyme-induced lysis.

However, only limited examples have been reported to date. Here, we show that pateamine A (PatA) represses translation in an mRNA-selective manner by clamping eIF4A, a DEAD-box RNA-binding protein, on GNG motifs. Through a systematic comparison of multiple eIF4A inhibitors by ribosome profiling, we found that PatA has unique mRNA selectivity in translation repression. Unbiased Bind-n-Seq revealed that PatA-targeted eIF4A exhibits a sequence preference for GNG motifs in an ATP-independent manner. This unusual RNA binding sterically hinders scanning by 40S ribosomes. In silico simulation, combination of classical molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemical calculation, and the subsequent development of an inactive PatA derivative revealed that the positive charge of the tertiary amine on the trienyl arm induces G selectivity. Moreover, we identified DDX3, another DEAD-box protein, as an alternative target of PatA, showing the same effect as on eIF4A. Our results provide an example of the sequence-selective anchoring of RNA-binding proteins and mRNA-selective inhibition of protein synthesis by small-molecule compounds.",

    "abstract": "Despite being principally prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes, biguanides, especially metformin and phenformin, have been shown to extend lifespan and healthspan in preclinical models, and to reduce the impact of aging-associated diseases such as cancer. While there have been conflicting results in studies involving rodents and humans, consistent evidence from laboratories worldwide, including our own, indicates metformin and phenformins ability to significantly extend lifespan in C. elegans. However, the pro-longevity effect of metformin can vary depending on environmental conditions. Specifically, the choice of agar from different manufacturers or batches influences metformins ability to extend lifespan in C. elegans. We traced ability of certain agar batches to interfere with metformin-prompted lifespan extension to the presence of a factor that acts directly in the worm, independently of the bacterial food source, that prevents longevity promoting effects downstream of longevity effectors skn-1 and AMPK. In contrast, phenformin prompts robust lifespan extension in the face of environmental changes and exhibits broad positive effects in aging across genetically diverse Caenorhabditis species where the impact of metformin is highly variable. Thus metformin effects in aging are impacted by heretofore unappreciated environmental factors. Phenformin may represent a more robust agent with which to understand the longevity promoting mechanisms downstream of biguanides.",

The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. Its gustatory sensory neurons sensitive to sucrose are distributed in the taste sensilla of larval maxillary galeas and adult antennae, tarsi and proboscis. In this study, using the ectopic expression system, we discovered that Gr10 highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while Gr6 highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we revealed that Gr10 was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while Gr6 was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in the differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt towards the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical work suggests that reinforcement can cause the strengthening of prezygotic isolation in sympatry by mitigating the costs of maladaptive hybridization. However, only a handful of studies have tested all predictions of this theory in natural populations. We investigated reinforcement in a mosaic hybrid zone of the damselflies Ischnura elegans and I. graellsii. Firstly, we tested if the conditions of reinforcement were fulfilled by quantifying whether hybridization was costly, and prezygotic isolation was strengthening in sympatry compared with in allopatry. Secondly, we investigated three specific predictions of reinforcement: rarer female effect, presence of concordant prezygotic and postzygotic isolation asymmetries in sympatry, and greater premating asymmetries associated with weaker postzygotic isolation in sympatry. We found that reinforcement has strengthened mechanical isolation in one cross direction between species in sympatry. Our study details a case of reinforcement and heterospecific gene flow causing opposite effects between reciprocal heterospecific crosses and describes a natural model in which reproductive isolation is built by the simultaneous effects of reinforcement, the lock-and-key model, Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities and Haldanes rule.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAncient divergences within Opisthokonta--a major lineage that includes organisms in the kingdoms Animalia, Fungi, and their unicellular relatives-- remain contentious, hindering investigations of the evolutionary processes that gave rise to two kingdoms and the repeated emergence of iconic phenotypes like multicellularity. Here, we use genome-scale amounts of data to reconstruct the most taxon-rich Opisthokonta tree of life to date (348 species) and place divergences in geologic time, suggesting a Mesoproterozoic origin ([~] 1.11 billion years ago). By dissecting multiple dimensions of phylogenomic error, such as the influence of taxon sampling and model complexity, we found that deep divergences within Holozoa remain unresolved and suggest Pluriformea is either sister to Ichthyosporea and Filozoa (Pluriformea-sister hypothesis) or is monophyletic to Ichthyosporea, forming the Teretosporea lineage (Teretosporea-sister hypothesis). A combination of information theory and sensitivity analyses revealed that the inferred unicellular Holozoa relationships are largely robust to common sources of analytical error, such as insufficient model complexity, and suggest that previous reports likely suffered from insufficient taxon sampling. Our study presents a robust Opisthokonta phylogenomic framework, highlights the challenges in resolving the relationships of unicellular Holozoa, and paves the way for illuminating ancient evolutionary episodes concerning the origin of two kingdoms.",

    "abstract": "Survival in hyperarid deserts is a major challenge for plant life, requiring the development of evolutionary strategies. The Atacama Desert presents harsh conditions such as limited rainfall, crusted soils, high soil salinity, high altitude, and intense solar radiation. These conditions, together with paleoclimatic variability since the past millions of years, have influenced the genetic structure and connectivity of plant populations, resulting in a diverse flora with high endemism. However, the diversification of most lineages appears to be relatively recent, in contrast to proposed age of the Atacama Desert and the onset, evolution and expansion of hyperarid conditions since the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene. A prominent exception is the Atacama paleoendemic Huidobria chilensis (Loasaceae), which is thought to be adapted to such conditions since the Eocene. Still, the environmental limits and thresholds for life in the Atacama remain poorly understood. To investigate the genetic structure in relation to the history of the Atacama Desert, we studied 186 individuals from 11 populations using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed for population structure and genetic diversity. We identified three genetic clusters corresponding to geographic regions: the coastal region south of Tocopilla, the Coastal Cordillera around Chanaral, and the Copiapo watershed in the south. These clusters as well as genetic diversity were analyzed alongside rainfall, altitude, and landscape data. Although the genetic data generally supports isolation by distance as a major factor for genetic variation between populations, the study also reveals the influence of the topography on the distribution of H. chilensis and highlights the role of hydrologically connected watersheds and rivers in plant migration and colonization. This shapes the species evolutionary trajectory and genetic diversity. Understanding these patterns provides insights into the adaptation and survival strategies of plants in extreme desert environments such as the Atacama.",

However, the intrinsic pixelation effect of the detector sensor will deteriorate PSFs under different sampling rates. The influence of the pixelation effect to the achieved 3D localization accuracy for different PSF shapes under different signal to background ratio (SBR) and pixel dependent readout noise has not been investigated in detail so far. In this work, we proposed a framework to characterize the 3D localization accuracy of pixelated PSF at different sampling rates. Four different PSFs (astigmatic PSF, double helix (DH) PSF, Tetrapod PSF and 4Pi PSF) were evaluated and the pixel size with optimal 3D localization performance were derived.

Recently, there is a growing interest in encoding-decoding natural stimuli in a single-trial setting, as opposed to traditional BCI literature where multi-trial presentations of synthetic stimuli are commonplace. While EEG responses to natural speech have been extensively studied, such stimulus-following EEG responses to natural video footage remain underexplored.\n\nApproachWe collect a new EEG dataset with subjects passively viewing a film clip and extract a few video features that have been found to be temporally correlated with EEG signals. However, our analysis reveals that these correlations are mainly driven by shot cuts in the video. To avoid the confounds related to shot cuts, we construct another EEG dataset with natural single-shot videos as stimuli and propose a new set of object-based features.\n\nMain ResultsWe demonstrate that previous video features lack robustness in capturing the coupling with EEG signals in the absence of shot cuts, and that the proposed object-based features exhibit significantly higher correlations. Furthermore, we show that the correlations obtained with these proposed features are not dominantly driven by eye movements. Additionally, we quantitatively verify the superiority of the proposed features in a match-mismatch (MM) task. Finally, we evaluate to what extent these proposed features explain the variance in coherent stimulus responses across subjects.\n\nSignificanceThis work provides valuable insights into feature design for video-EEG analysis and paves the way for applications such as visual attention decoding.",

The complex nature of the gut microbiome, data sparsity, compositionality and population-specificity however remain challenging, which highlights the critical need for standardized methodologies to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Microbiome data transformations can alleviate some of the aforementioned challenges, but their usage in machine learning tasks has largely been unexplored. Our aim was to assess the impact of various data transformations on the accuracy, generalizability and feature selection by analysis using more than 8,500 samples from 24 shotgun metagenomic datasets. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing between healthy and diseased individuals using microbiome data with minimal dependence on the algorithm and transformation selection. Remarkably, presence-absence transformation performed comparably well to abundance-based transformations, and only a small subset of predictors is crucial for accurate classification. However, while different transformations resulted in comparable classification performance, the most important features varied significantly, which highlight the need to reevaluate machine-learning based biomarker detection.

Here, we apply hybrid machine learning (ML) models and leverage cancer cell line multi-omics data and other biological knowledge data as features, to uncover potential candidates involved in mGSH metabolism and membrane transport in cancers. These models predict the known mGSH transporter SLC25A39 but not SLC25A40 as being highly probably related to GSH metabolism in cancers. Additionally, SLC25A24 and SLC25A37 along with the poorly characterized members of the SLC25 family, SLC25A43 and SLC25A50, are predicted to be associated. Similarities in potential substrate binding regions are found between SLC25A39 and the candidates SLC25A24 and A43.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI-based protein structure modeling have yielded remarkable progress in predicting protein structures. Since structures are constrained by their biological function, their geometry tends to evolve more slowly than the underlying amino acids sequences. This feature of structures could in principle be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees over longer evolutionary timescales than sequence-based approaches, but until now a reliable structure-based tree building method has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the use of structure-based phylogenies can outperform sequence-based ones not only for distantly related proteins but also, remarkably, for more closely related ones. This is achieved by inferring trees from protein structures using a local structural alphabet, an approach robust to conformational changes that confound traditional structural distance measures. As an illustration, we used structures to decipher the evolutionary diversification of a particularly challenging family: the fast-evolving RRNPPA quorum sensing receptors enabling gram-positive bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages to communicate and coordinate key behaviors such as sporulation, virulence, antibiotic resistance, conjugation or phage lysis/lysogeny decision. The advent of high-accuracy structural phylogenetics enables myriad of applications across biology, such as uncovering deeper evolutionary relationships, elucidating unknown protein functions, or refining the design of bioengineered molecules.",

    "abstract": "Cancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell-cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the systems description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.\n\nHighlightsO_LICancer growth and progression can be driven by intra-tumour interactions.\nC_LIO_LIProstate cancer cells compete among each other for resources like testosterone and oxygen.\nC_LIO_LIWe model these interactions using a modified logistic model with resource dynamics.\nC_LIO_LIEquilibrium behaviour can be understood through resource supply and use efficiency.\nC_LIO_LIExplicitly ecological models could enable better strategies for cancer control.\nC_LI",

We describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs that recognize specific target sequences through interactions with bases in the major groove, and employ this method in conjunction with experimental screening to generate binders for 5 distinct DNA targets. These binders exhibit specificity closely matching the computational models for the target DNA sequences at as many as 6 base positions and affinities as low as 30-100 nM. The crystal structure of a designed DBP-target site complex is in close agreement with the design model, highlighting the accuracy of the design method.

We found that the higher the frequency of visual events defined by spatial location, the longer the perception duration. At the same visual event frequency, perceptual duration was shorter when motion perception was evoked. We propose that the non-temporal perceptual states dynamically determine which core brain region (read-out system) and which group of activated neurons (timing units) assemble into a time estimation system. Timing units have activation delays in integrating input signals, which results in shorter perceptual time since perceptual duration depends only on the outputs of timing units. The read-out system consumes operating time to accumulate each timing unit, this results in a longer perception time the more timing units are accumulated in the same physical duration. Subsequently, experiments further validated two predictions of our perceptual assembly model.",

We found that the onset of LS kisspeptin expression was linked to pubertal development and estrogen receptor signaling. Cell numbers were higher in females vs. males, continued to increase in adulthood and exogenous estrogen administered to adult mice was able to switch on the Kiss1 gene promoter in new sets of septal neurons. Using RNA-Seq studies of laser-microdissected neurons from ovariectomized mice treated with 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) vs. vehicle, we found that KPLS neurons largely differ from hypothalamic KP neurons in their transcriptome profile which included 571 estrogen-dependent transcripts from which 80% were upregulated by a 4-day E2-treatment of ovariectomized mice. Notably, Kiss1 expression in the LS was considerably lower than in hypothalamic KP neurons, being undetectable in ovariectomized mice and inducible by E2 supplementation. Finally, immunohistochemical detection of septal kisspeptin neurons and their fibers in the human brain suggested that the functions of this neuronal system are evolutionarily conserved. Ontogeny, sexual dimorphism and robust estrogenic regulation raise the intriguing possibility that the KPLS system is a new central player in the estrogen-dependent control of reproductive and/or non-reproductive functions in mice, with a possible human relevance supported by the immunohistochemical observations on post mortem tissues.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans control force is useful to understand human movement behaviors and sensorimotor control. However, it is not well understood how the human nervous system handles different control criteria such as accuracy and energetic cost. We conducted force tracking experiments where participants applied force isometrically while receiving visual force feedback, tracking step changes in target forces. The experiments were designed to disambiguate different plausible objective function components. We found that force tracking error was largely explained by a trade-off between error-reducing tendency and force biases, but we did not need to include an effort-saving tendency. Central tendency bias, which is a shift towards the center of the task distribution, and recency bias, which is a shift towards recent action, were necessary to explain many of our observations. Surprisingly, we did not observe such biases when we removed force requirements for pointing to the target, suggesting that such biases may be task-specific. This study provides insights into the broader field of motor control and human perceptions where behavioral or perceptual biases are involved.",

    "abstract": "Working memory and attention are jointly needed in most everyday life tasks and activities. They have however mostly been studied separately. Here we investigate how auditory working memory and selective attention interact using a recently introduced paradigm (MEMAT) that combines a classic working memory paradigm, the delayed-matching-to-sample task, and selective attention, with distractors presented during the encoding phase. All stimuli are four-tone melodies. Twenty-two participants performed the MEMAT task during MEG recordings. We manipulate the difficulty of the memory task and of attentional filtering. When memory task difficulty increases, the amplitude of the CNV in anticipation of the melody to encode increases and the decrease in alpha power during encoding and maintenance in a left fronto-temporal network is reduced. When attentional filtering difficulty increases, the amplitude of the sustained evoked response during encoding increases, whereas the differential processing of relevant and irrelevant sounds in auditory areas is less pronounced, and frontal theta power during encoding and maintenance is higher. In the left auditory cortex, we could directly observe the result of the interaction between auditory memory and attention: the facilitation of relevant sound processing in the easy filtering condition was reduced when the memory task difficulty increased. This pattern mirrors the observed behavioral effects. Overall brain dynamics highlight reciprocal influences of working memory and selective attention processes, in keeping with shared cognitive resources between them.",

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that time estimation relies on bodily rhythms and interoceptive signals, such as heartbeats. Extending previous research demonstrating this connection, we provided further electrophysiological evidence that the brain registers heartbeats while tracking time intervals. We evaluated the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) and the contingent negative variation (CNV) during an auditory duration-reproduction task with intervals lasting 4, 8, and 12 seconds and a control reaction-time task employing the exact durations. The (interoceptive) Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ) and the heartbeat-counting task (HCT) were administered. The SAQ, but not the HCT scores, correlated with the mean reproduced durations for 4s, 8s, and 12s intervals: the higher the SAQ score (a stronger awareness of bodily signals), the longer the duration reproductions and the more accurate the timing behavior. The HEP amplitude within 130-270 ms (HEP1) and 470-520 ms (HEP2) after the R peak was smaller for the 4s interval than for the 8s and 12s intervals. This is a timing-specific effect, as the HEP amplitude did not differ for intervals in the reaction-time task. A ramp-like increase in HEP2 amplitudes was significant for the duration-encoding phase of the timing task, but not for the control reaction-time task. The HEP2 increase within the reproduction phase of the timing task correlated significantly with the reproduced durations for the 8s and the 12s intervals. The larger the registered increase in the HEP2, the greater the under-reproduction of the estimated duration. The initial and late CNV components were significantly more negative during the encoding phase than during the reaction-time task. Given the link between these components with attention modulation and temporal memory, we interpret the CNV findings as indicating greater executive resources oriented towards time. We conclude that interoceptive awareness (SAQ) and state-like cortical responses to the heartbeat (HEP) predict duration reproductions, emphasizing the notion of the embodiment of time.",

    "abstract": "Bistable perception involves the spontaneous alternation between two exclusive interpretations of a single stimulus. Previous research has suggested that this perceptual phenomenon results from winnerless dynamics in the cortex. Indeed, winnerless dynamics can explain many key behavioral characteristics of bistable perception. However, it fails to explain an increase in alternation rate that is typically observed in response to increased stimulus drive and instead predicts a decline in alternation rate. To reconcile this discrepancy, several lines of work have augmented winnerless dynamics with additional processes such as global gain control, input suppression, and release mechanisms. These offer potential explanations at an algorithmic level. But it remains unclear which, if any, of these mechanisms are implemented in the cortex and what their biological substrates might be. We show that the answers to these questions lie within the architecture of the cortical microcircuit. Utilizing a dynamic mean field approach, we implement a laminar columnar circuit with empirically derived interlaminar connectivity. By coupling two such circuits such that they exhibit competition, we are able to produce winnerless dynamics reflective of bistable perception. Within our model, we identify two mechanisms through which the layered structure of the cortex gives rise to increased alternation rate in response to increased stimulus drive. First, deep layers act to inhibit the upper layers, thereby reducing the attractor depth and increasing the alternation rate. Second, recurrent connections between superficial and granular layers implement an input suppression mechanism which again reduces the attractor depth of the winnerless competition. These findings demonstrate the functional significance of the layered cortical architecture as they showcase perceptual implications of neuroatomical properties such as interlaminar connectivity and layer-specific activation.\n\nAuthor summaryIn our study, we explore the mechanistic underpinnings of bistable perception, a phenomenon where a single visual stimulus can be perceived in two distinct ways, and where our percept alternates spontaneously between interpretations. Although winnerless competition mechanisms have been widely recognized to govern this, they fall short in explaining why we observe more perceptual alternations with a stronger stimulus. To uncover the cortexs role in this discrepancy, we constructed a detailed model that mirrors the layered structure and interlaminar connections of the cortex. Remarkably, the architecture of these layers emerged as instrumental players. We discovered that the deeper layers of the cortex seem to inhibit the upper layers, facilitating a quicker alternation between perceptions when stimulated. Additionally, the interlaminar recurrent connections between the upper  output layer and middle  input layer appeared to destabilize the prevailing interpretation of the stimulus, leading to faster alternations. Our research illuminates how the complex architecture of the cortex, particularly the interconnections between its layers, plays a pivotal role in influencing our perception. The layered structure of the cortex goes beyond mere anatomy; it influences our perceptual experiences.",

We found that sex-biased oligodendrocyte and microglial responses are driven by interaction of sex chromosomes and gonads prior to myelin loss. Post demyelination, sex chromosomes mainly guide microglial responses, while gonadal composition influences oligodendrocyte signaling. Significantly, ablation of the X-linked gene Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7), which exhibited sex-biased expression during demyelination, abolished the sex-biased responses and protected against demyelination.\n\nOne-sentence summaryCell type-specific processes underlying aged demyelination are sex-biased and mediated by Tlr7.",

    "abstract": "The impact of chronic hepatic infection on antigen non-specific immune cells in circulation is not well understood and may influence long term health. We reported lasting global hyperfunction of circulating CD8 T cells in HCV-infected individuals with cirrhosis. Whether gene expression patterns in bulk CD8 T cells are associated with the severity of liver fibrosis in HCV infection is not known. RNA sequencing of blood CD8 T cells from treatment-naive, HCV-infected individuals with minimal (Metavir F0-1 [&le;] 7.0 kPa) or advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (F4 [&ge;] 12.5 kPa), before and after direct-acting antiviral therapy, was performed. Principal component analyses determined robust differences in over 350 genes expressed by CD8 T cells from HCV-infected individuals with minimal or advanced fibrosis and data suggests this remains relatively stable after viral clearance. Gene ontology analyses identified disaggregated gene expression related to cellular metabolism, including upregulated phospholipase, phosphatidyl-choline/inositol activity and second-messenger-mediated signaling, while genes in pathways associated with nuclear processes, RNA transport and cytoskeletal dynamics were reduced. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified decreased expression of genes regulated by the cMyc and E2f transcription factors in cirrhotics, compared to the minimal fibrosis group, as well as reduced expression of genes linked to oxidative phosphorylation, mTOR signaling, and more. Upregulated gene sets in cirrhotics included IFN-, -{gamma}, TGF-{beta} response genes, apoptosis and apical surface pathways, among others. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway was the top featured gene set upregulated in cirrhotics. Inhibition of Hh signaling with cyclopamine ablated CD8 T cell IFN-{gamma} production, suggesting its involvement in hyperfunction. This is the first analysis of bulk CD8 T cell gene expression profiles in HCV infection in the context of liver fibrosis severity, and suggests cirrhosis significantly reprograms the CD8 T cell pool. The novel finding of increased Hh signaling in cirrhosis may contribute to generalized CD8 T cell hyperfunction observed in chronic HCV infection. Understanding the lasting nature of immune cell dysfunction may help mitigate remaining clinical challenges after HCV clearance and more generally, improve long term outcomes for individuals with severe liver disease.",

A portion of the MukB proteins localize at a specific chromosome region, binding to DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. However, it is unclear how MukB localizes at a particular site without sequence specificity. Like other structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins, MukB topologically loads onto DNA, and It has an intrinsic property of preferential topological loading onto the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). We consider it crucial for the localization of a specific region. To investigate the property of MukB, we attempted to identify positively charged amino acid residues responsible for ssDNA binding. We created a series of mutated MukB proteins in which a single positively charged amino acid was replaced with a negatively charged one. The results showed that some substitutions located on the inner surface of the MukB head domain impacted ssDNA-binding activity, leading to deficiencies in cell growth and nucleoid segregation. The efficiency of topological loading onto ssDNA was also decreased when the positive charges were replaced with negative ones. These amino acid residues align with and bind to ssDNA when the MukB dimer secures ssDNA within its ring, thereby likely strengthening the ssDNA-binding ability of MukB.",

We used baited feeding tubes to collect shrew feces. Cox1 PCR primers were designed to preferentially amplify this mini-DNA barcode for shrews in samples that may contain feces from rodents as well. The primers were designed to amplify a small amplicon to increase the likelihood of successful amplification from degraded DNA.

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavioural responses often depend on qualities of the interacting partner of an individual. For example, when competing for resources, an individual might be better off escalating fights with individuals of lower quality, while restraining from fighting individuals of higher quality. Communication systems involving signals of quality allow individuals to reduce uncertainty regarding the fighting ability of their partners and make more adaptive behavioral decisions. However, dishonest individuals can destabilize such communications systems. An open question is whether cognitive mechanisms, such as learning, can maintain the honesty of signals, thus favoring their evolutionary stability. We present evolutionary simulations where individuals can produce a signal proportional to their quality and learn along their lifetime the best response to the signals emitted by their peers. Our simulations replicate previous results where the handicap principle mediates the evolution of signals. In our simulations learning on the receiver side can mediate the evolution of signals of quality on the sender side. When the cost of the signal is proportional to the quality of the sender, all individuals in populations are honest signalers. In contrast to traditional models which predict the absence of signals when the cost is not proportional to the quality of the signaler, our model revealed that learning facilitates the evolution of a polymorphism in which populations comprise both honest and dishonest signalers. We argue that learning may have a role in the evolution and dynamics of a wide range of communication systems and more generally in behavioral responses.",

    "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of great impact on public health since it is considered a notifiable disease occurring mainly in tropical regions with poor sanitation and vulnerable socioeconomic conditions. It is caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira and phylum Spirochaetes and contamination occurs through direct or indirect contact with the contaminating agent. In addition to taxonomic classification, which is performed through sequencing and the analysis of some marker genes, such as 16S rRNA and secY, they are usually classified based on their antigenic characteristics into serogroups and serovars. This kind of classification is largely applied in epidemiological studies and vaccine development. Despite its importance, few studies have been conducted to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the emergence or change of serology in this genus. In view of this, we applied phylogenetic methods in order to understand the evolutionary processes involving the serology of the genus. To this end, sequences of genes comprising the rfb locus from samples of serogroups Sejroe, Mini, and Hebdomadis (34 samples) were extracted and submitted to the phylogenetic pipeline, resulting in the inference of 75 maximum likelihood trees. Topology tests showed that most of the gene trees are significantly different from the species tree. We could depict the occurrence of lateral gene transfer between L. borgpetersenii and L. kirschneri; and L. interrogans and L. weilli. In this analysis, no evidence was found for the lateral gene transfer between samples of the Hardjo serovar of L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii. Thus, it is also suggested that the occurrence of horizontal transfer of genes from the rfb locus between distinct species is less frequent than expected.",

Analyses of the longest running field experiment (1990-2021) designed to quantify yield gains (37 hybrids sold from 1930 to 1990) demonstrate that rates of genetic gain were always positive and have increased over time (from 70 to 150 kg ha-1 y-1 in 1990 and 2021, respectively).

At the same time, farmers modified their farming practices, helping modern hybrids to out-perform their older counterparts by a larger degree. In contrast to the conclusions reached by other observational studies, genetic gain estimates demonstrate that maize breeding and the production system are adapting to modern scenarios.

    "abstract": "Assembled genomes and their associated annotations have transformed our study of gene function. However, each new assembly generates new gene models. Inconsistencies between annotations likely arise from biological and technical causes, including pseudogene misclassification, transposon activity, and intron retention from sequencing of unspliced transcripts. To evaluate gene model predictions, we developed reelGene, a pipeline of machine learning models focused on (1) transcription boundaries, (2) mRNA integrity, and (3) protein structure. The first two models leverage sequence characteristics and evolutionary conservation across related taxa to learn the grammar of conserved transcription boundaries and mRNA sequences, while the third uses conserved evolutionary grammar of protein sequences to predict whether a gene can produce a protein. Evaluating 1.8 million gene models in maize, reelGene found that 28% were incorrectly annotated or nonfunctional. By leveraging a large cohort of related species and through learning the conserved grammar of proteins, reelGene provides a tool for both evaluating gene model accuracy and genome biology.",

    "abstract": "Average heterozygosity is frequently used as a proxy for genetic health, and to compare genetic diversity between species and populations. However, this measurement could be misleading if the distribution of heterozygosity across the genome is highly skewed. We investigated this pitfall in methodology using whole-genome sequencing of the adder (Vipera berus), a species experiencing dramatic declines in the UK. We find that mean heterozygosity in adders is notably high, exceeding that of other vertebrates typically regarded as genetically diverse. Their genome-wide distribution of heterozygosity, however, approximates a negative exponential distribution, with most genome regions showing extremely low heterozygosity. Modelling approaches show that this pattern is likely to have resulted from a recent, severe bottleneck and fragmentation most likely caused by anthropogenic activity in a previously large, interconnected adder population. Our results highlight that high standing diversity may mask severe genetic erosion when declines are recent and rapid. In such situations, whole-genome sequencing may provide the best option for genetic risk assessment and targeted conservation actions.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) nuclear organization of chromatin in eukaryotes plays a crucial role in gene regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair. While genome-wide ensemble methods have enhanced our understanding of chromatin organization, they lack the ability to capture single-cell heterogeneity and preserve spatial information. To overcome these limitations, a new family of imaging-based methods has emerged, giving rise to the field of spatial genomics. In this study, we present pyHiM, an open-source and modular software toolbox specifically designed for the robust, automatic analysis of sequential spatial genomics data. pyHiM enables the reconstruction of chromatin traces in individual cells from raw, multicolor images, offering novel, robust and validated algorithms, extensive documentation, and tutorials. Its user-friendly graphical interface and command-line interface allow for easy installation and execution on various hardware platforms. The software employs a modular architecture, allowing independent execution of analysis steps and customization according to sample specificity and computing resources. pyHiM supports preprocessing, spot detection, mask detection, and trace generation, generating human-readable reports and intermediate results for data validation and further analysis. Moreover, it offers additional features for data formatting, result display, and post-processing. pyHiMs scalability and parallelization capabilities enable the analysis of large, complex datasets in a reasonable time frame. Overall, pyHiM aims to facilitate the democratization and standardization of spatial genomics analysis, foster collaborative developments, and promote the growth of a user community to drive discoveries in the field of chromatin organization.",

    "abstract": "Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanosine triphosphate (GTP) synthesis and is controlled by feedback inhibition and allosteric regulation. IMPDH assembles into micron-scale filaments in cells, which desensitizes the enzyme to feedback inhibition by GTP and boosts nucleotide production. The vertebrate retina expresses two tissue-specific splice variants IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595). IMPDH1(546) filaments adopt high and low activity conformations, while IMPDH1(595) filaments maintain high activity. In bovine retinas, residue S477 is preferentially phosphorylated in the dark, but the effects on IMPDH1 activity and regulation are unclear. Here, we generated phosphomimetic mutants to investigate structural and functional consequences of phosphorylation in IMPDH1 variants. The S477D mutation re-sensitized both variants to GTP inhibition, but only blocked assembly of IMPDH1(595) filaments and not IMPDH1(546) filaments. Cryo-EM structures of both variants showed that S477D specifically blocks assembly of the high activity assembly interface, still allowing assembly of low activity IMPDH1(546) filaments. Finally, we discovered that S477D exerts a dominant-negative effect in cells, preventing endogenous IMPDH filament assembly. By modulating the structure and higher-order assembly of IMPDH, phosphorylation at S477 acts as a mechanism for downregulating retinal GTP synthesis in the dark, when nucleotide turnover is decreased. Like IMPDH1, many other metabolic enzymes dynamically assemble filamentous polymers that allosterically regulate activity. Our work suggests that posttranslational modifications may be yet another layer of regulatory control to finely tune activity by modulating filament assembly in response to changing metabolic demands.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOver 20 different metabolic enzymes form micron-scale filaments in cells, suggesting that filament assembly is a conserved mechanism for regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Filament assembly regulates catalytic activity of many of these enzymes, including inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GTP biosynthesis. The vertebrate retina expresses two IMPDH1 splice variants that are critical for maintaining nucleotide levels required for phototransduction. Here, we show that filament assembly by these variants is itself controlled by phosphorylation at a single residue, adding further complexity to the tight regulation of nucleotide metabolism in the retina. Phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications are likely to be a general regulatory mechanism controlling filament assembly by enzymes in many different metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are redox-enzymes that bind to and oxidize insoluble carbohydrate substrates, such as chitin or cellulose. This class of enzymes has attracted considerable attention due to their ability to convert biomaterials of high abundance into oligosaccharides that can be useful for producing biofuels and bioplastics. However, processes at the interface between solution and insoluble substrates represent a major challenge to biochemical and structural characterization. This study used the four-domain LPMO from Vibrio cholerae, N-acetyl glucosamine binding protein A (GbpA), to elucidate how it docks onto its insoluble substrate with its two terminal domains. First, we developed a protocol that allowed GbpA and chitin to form a stable complex in suspension, overcoming incompatibilities of the two binding partners with respect to pH. After determining the neutron scattering contrast match point for chitin, we characterized the structure of GbpA in complex with chitin by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS). We found that GbpA binds rapidly to chitin, where it spreads out on the chitin fibers unevenly. These findings are supported by electron microscopy. Placing our findings into a biological context, we discussed the potential advantages of GbpA secretion and how chitin binding may prepare the ground for microcolony formation of the bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryInvertebrates use the endoribonuclease Dicer to cleave viral dsRNA during antiviral defense, while vertebrates use RIG-I-like Receptors (RLRs), which bind viral dsRNA to trigger an interferon response. While some invertebrate Dicers act alone during antiviral defense, C. elegans Dicer acts in a complex with a dsRNA binding protein called RDE-4, and an RLR ortholog called DRH-1. We used biochemical and structural techniques to provide mechanistic insight into how these proteins function together. We found RDE-4 is important for ATP- independent and ATP-dependent cleavage reactions, while helicase domains of both DCR-1 and DRH-1 contribute to ATP-dependent cleavage. DRH-1 plays the dominant role in ATP hydrolysis, and like mammalian RLRs, has an N-terminal domain that functions in autoinhibition. A cryo-EM structure indicates DRH-1 interacts with DCR-1s helicase domain, suggesting this interaction relieves autoinhibition. Our study unravels the mechanistic basis of the collaboration between two helicases from typically distinct innate immune defense pathways.",

    "abstract": "We show that human protein Znf706 interacts specifically with stable, non-canonical nucleic acid structures known as G-quadruplexes. Znf706, though only 76 residues long, is comprised of two distinct domains, one dis-ordered and one ordered. The disordered domain is homologous to the SERF family of proteins and acts to accelerate amyloid formation. The ordered domain contains a C2H2 type zinc-finger. We show that Znf706 not only accelerates amyloid formation but also accelerates amorphous protein aggregation. We find that Znf706 binds preferentially to parallel G-quadruplexes with low micromolar affinity, primarily using its N-terminus, whose dynamics are constrained upon interaction. G-quadruplexes are potent anti-aggregation agents, and their binding to Znf706 suppresses Znf706s ability to accelerate protein aggregation and fibril formation. Znf706 in conjunction with G-quadruplexes thus may play a role in regulating protein folding. Depletion of Znf706 specifically impacts mRNA abundance of genes that contain high G-quadruplex density, implying that Znf706 may also serve as a G-quadruplex specific regulator. Our studies give insights into how proteins and G-quadruplexes interact, how these interactions affect both partners, lead to liquid-liquid phase transitions, and lead to the modulation of protein aggregation and cellular mRNA levels.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio computational reconstructions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks will provide invaluable insights on cellular systems, enabling the discovery of novel molecular interactions and elucidating biological mechanisms within and between organisms. Leveraging latest generation protein language models and recurrent neural networks, we present SENSE-PPI, a sequence-based deep learning model that efficiently reconstructs ab initio PPIs, distinguishing partners among tens of thousands of proteins and identifying specific interactions within functionally similar proteins. SENSE-PPI demonstrates high accuracy, limited training requirements, and versatility in cross-species predictions, even with non-model organisms and human-virus interactions. Its performance decreases for phylogenetically more distant model and non-model organisms, but signal alteration is very slow. SENSE-PPI is state-of-the-art, outperforming all existing methods. In this regard, it demonstrates the important role of parameters in protein language models. SENSE-PPI is very fast and can test 10,000 proteins against themselves in a matter of hours, enabling the reconstruction of genome-wide proteomes.\n\nGraphical abstractSENSE-PPI is a general deep learning architecture predicting protein-protein interactions of different complexities, between stable proteins, between stable and intrinsically disordered proteins, within a species, and between species.

We found that proteins initiating LLPS are frequently implicated in somatic cancers, even surpassing their involvement in neurodegeneration, where several such LLPS scaffolds are linked to disease emergence. Cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds are connected to all cancer hallmarks and tend to be oncogenes with dominant genetic effects currently lacking therapeutic options. Since most cancer-associated LLPS scaffolds exert their oncogenic effects as oncogenic fusion proteins (OFPs), we undertook a systematic analysis of known OFPs by assessing their module-level molecular functions. We identified both known and novel combinations of molecular functions that are specific to OFPs and thus have a high potential for driving tumorigenesis. Protein regions driving condensate formation show an increased association with DNA- or chromatin-binding domains of transcription regulators within OFPs, indicating a common molecular mechanism underlying several soft tissue sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies where phase-separation-prone OFPs form abnormal, ectopic condensates along the DNA, and thereby dysregulate gene expression programs.",

    "abstract": "The fitness of organisms depends critically on regulatory strategies that balance multiple phenotypes, including physiological, developmental, and pathogenic. An important example is the trade-off between motility and growth determine competition for habitat colonization by microorganisms and the invasiveness of metastatic cells in cancer. Phenotype regulation relies on hierarchical gene networks, but how gene hierarchy contributes to adaptation remains unclear. Here, we show that global upstream regulators allow cells to adjust the impact of downstream local regulators in the context of a phenotypic trade-off. We performed single and double knockdowns of transcription factors in Escherichia Coli and measured their impact on swimming and growth in different environments. We observed that perturbations of local regulators affect only a specific phenotype independently of the genetic background, whereas perturbations of global regulators affect either one or both phenotypes to varying degrees depending on the genetic background. Global and local regulators strongly interact giving rise to sign, reciprocal sign and masking epistasis. Epistasis between particular genes is modulated by the environment, but only a restricted number of epistatic patterns are observed across environments. These epistatic constraints suggests that that local regulators should be typically acquired before tuning of the phenotypic trade-off by global regulators. These findings highlight the importance of pleiotropic regulators for coordinating phenotypic responses to complex environments and providing flexibility during evolution.",

However, how polygenic risk funnels through these pathways to translate into syndromic illness is unanswered. To evaluate biologically meaningful pathways of risk, we used tensor decomposition to characterize gene co-expression in post-mortem brain (of neurotypicals: N=154; patients with SCZ: N=84; and GTEX samples N=120) from caudate nucleus (CN), hippocampus (HP), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We identified a CN-predominant gene set showing dopaminergic selectivity that was enriched for genes associated with clinical state and for genes associated with SCZ risk. Parsing polygenic risk score for SCZ based on this specific gene set (parsed-PRS), we found that greater pathway-specific SCZ risk predicted greater in vivo striatal dopamine synthesis capacity measured by [18F]-FDOPA PET in three independent cohorts of neurotypicals and patients (total N=235) and greater fMRI striatal activation during reward anticipation in two additional independent neurotypical cohorts (total N=141). These results reveal a  bench to bedside translation of dopamine-linked genetic risk variation in driving in vivo striatal neurochemical and hemodynamic phenotypes that have long been implicated in the pathophysiology of SCZ.",

Here, we investigated the mouse as a model organism for studying speech processing and explored whether distinct regions of the mouse auditory cortex are sensitive to specific acoustic features of speech. We found that mice can learn to categorize frequency-shifted human speech sounds based on differences in formant transitions (FT) and voice onset time (VOT). Moreover, neurons across various auditory cortical regions were selective to these speech features, with a higher proportion of speech-selective neurons in the dorso-posterior region. Last, many of these neurons displayed mixed-selectivity for both features, an attribute that was most common in dorsal regions of the auditory cortex. Our results demonstrate that the mouse serves as a valuable model for studying the detailed mechanisms of speech feature encoding and neural plasticity during speech-sound learning.",

To reveal the regulatory role of genetic variations in phenotypic differences between Eastern and Western pig breeds, we performed a systematic analysis based on seven high-quality de novo assembled genomes, 1,081 resequencing data representing 78 domestic breeds, 162 methylomes, and 162 transcriptomes of skeletal muscle from Tongcheng (Eastern) and Landrace (Western) pigs at 27 developmental stages. Selective sweep uncovers different genetic architectures behind divergent selection directions for the Eastern and Western breeds. Notably, two loci showed functional alterations by almost fixed missense mutations. By integrating time-course transcriptome and methylome, we revealed differences in developmental timing during myogenesis between Eastern and Western breeds. Genetic variants under artificial selection have critical regulatory effects on progression patterns of heterochronic genes like GHSR and BDH1, by the interaction of local DNA methylation status, particularly during embryonic development. Altogether, our work not only provides valuable resources for understanding pig complex traits, but also contributes to human biomedical research.",
