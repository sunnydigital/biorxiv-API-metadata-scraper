    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a broad term for a range of chronic intestinal disorders, including Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. The global prevalence of IBD is rising, with over one million patients affected in the US alone. Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is a pathobiont frequently found in IBD biopsies. AIEC adhere to and invade epithelial cells, and can survive inside phagocytes in vitro. However, how AIEC contribute to IBD in vivo remains unclear. Here, we established a larval zevbrafish (Danio rerio) model to study the interplay between pre-existing intestinal inflammation and AIEC colonization of the gut. We used the pro-inflammatory drug dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis. This was followed by food-borne infection of larvae with AIEC using the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, a natural prey, as a vehicle.\n\nWe show that AIEC more robustly colonizes the zebrafish gut, and persists for longer, compared to non-pathogenic E. coli. In addition, DSS induced colitis increases both bacterial burden and persistence in the larval gut. We benchmark our model against existing rodent models using two mutants deficient in the known AIEC virulence factors FimH and IbeA, which have virulence defects in both rodent and the larval zebrafish model. Finally, we show that AIEC colonization exacerbates DSS induced colitis and prevents recovery from inflammation. In conclusion, we established a high-throughput, genetically tractable model to study AIEC-host interactions in the context of chronic inflammation.\n\nIMPORTANCEAlthough inflammatory bowel diseases are on the rise, a lot remains to be learned about the link between IBD severity and the underlying cause. Although host genetics, microbiome, and environmental factors have all been shown to correlate with the development of IBD, cause and effect are difficult to disentangle in this context. For example, AIEC is a known pathobiont found in IBD patients, but it remains unclear if gut inflammation during IBD facilitates colonization with AIEC, or if AIEC colonization makes the host more susceptible towards pro-inflammatory stimuli. To develop successful therapeutics, it is critical to understand the mechanisms that contribute to AIEC infections in a susceptible host. Here, we show that the larval zebrafish model recapitulates key features of AIEC infections in other animal models, and can be utilized to address these gaps in knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Reference-based alignment of short-reads is a widely used technique in genomic analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and the choice of reference sequence impacts the interpretation of analyses. The most widely used reference genomes include the ATCC type strain (H37Rv) and the putative MTBC ancestral sequence of Comas et al. both of which are based on a lineage 4 sequence. As such, these referents do not capture the complete structural variation now known to be present in the MTBC. To better represent the base of the MTBC, we generated an imputed ancestral genomic sequence, termed MTBC0 from reference-free alignments of closed MTBC genomes. When used as a reference sequence in alignment workflows, MTBC0 mapped more short sequencing reads and called more SNPs relative to the Comas et al. sequence while exhibiting minimal impact on the overall phylogeny of MTBC. The results also show that MTBC0 provides greater fidelity in capturing genomic variation and allows for the inclusion of regions absent in H37Rv such as the TbD1 and RvD4496/RD7/RD713 regions in standard MTBC workflows without additional steps. The use of MTBC0 as an ancestral reference sequence into a standard workflows modestly improved read mapping, SNP calling and intuitively facilitates the study of structural variation and evolution in MTBC.\n\nData SummaryThe MTBC0 sequence, is available in the online data supplement in FASTA format at https://github.com/lukebharrison/MTBC0. Included with the MTBC0 sequence in the data supplement are: the reference-free alignment of MTBC closed genomes in hierarchical alignment (HAL) format, control files for cactus, annotations for H37Rv and L8, a BED file of regions excluded from SNP calls lifted over onto MTBC0, as well as the scripts used to call SNPs and the phylogenetic trees generated in this article. All previously published sequence data is available at the NCBI nucleotide and SRA databases, accession number for sequences used in this manuscript are available in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.\n\nImpact StatementThis article describes an imputed ancestral genomic sequence (MTBC0) at the base of the MTBC for use as a reference sequence for Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic workflows. Widely used reference sequences are limited to the structural diversity present in H37Rv, a lineage 4 isolate. MTBC0 obviates this limitation by incorporating the structural variation present at the base of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) by encompassing a wide sample of human and animal lineages including newly discovered lineages (L8, M. orygis). Use of MTBC0 enables the mapping of more reads and calling of more SNPs and allows for the investigation of structural variation not present in the current used reference sequences within this important group of animal and human pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant biofilm infections have emerged as public health concerns because of their enhanced tolerance of high-dose antibiotic treatments. The biofilm life cycle involves multiple developmental stages, which are tightly regulated by active cell-cell communication via specific extracellular signal messengers such as exosomes. This study was aimed at exploring the roles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exosomes secreted at different developmental stages in controlling biofilm growth. Our results show that exosomes secreted by P. aeruginosa biofilms during their exponential growth phase (G-Exo) enhance biofilm growth. In contrast, exosomes secreted by P. aeruginosa biofilms during their death/survival phase (D-Exo) can effectively inhibit/eliminate P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms up to 4.8-log10 CFU/cm2. The inhibition effectiveness of D-Exo against P. aeruginosa biofilms grown for 96 hours improved further in the presence of 10-50 M Fe3+ ions. Proteomic analysis suggests the inhibition involves an iron-dependent ferroptosis mechanism. This study is the first to report the functional role of bacterial exosomes in bacterial growth, which depends on the developmental stage of the parent bacteria. The finding of D-Exo-activated ferroptosis-based bacterial death may have significant implications for preventing antibiotic resistance in biofilms.\n\nSignificance statementAntibiotic-resistant bacterial infections caused 1.27 million deaths in 2019 [1], and this number is projected to increase to 10 million deaths annually worldwide by 2050 [2]. Of these infections, up to 80% are caused by biofilm-associated infections [3, 4], which pose a significant challenge to human health. The treatment of biofilm infections remains a formidable problem because of the limited effectiveness of the currently available antibiotics against drug-resistant biofilms [5, 6]. The development of new therapeutic approaches that can effectively combat biofilm infections is required. This study represents a promising solution to antibiotic-resistant biofilm infections. The successful use of exosomes against biofilms opens new possibilities for combating challenging antibiotic-resistant biofilm infections.",

    "abstract": "A first line of defense during infection is expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene products which suppress viral lytic infection. To combat this, herpesviruses express endoribonucleases to deplete host RNAs. Here we demonstrate that IFN-induced circular RNAs (circRNAs) can escape viral-mediated degradation. We performed comparative circRNA expression profiling for representative alpha- (Herpes simplex virus-1, HSV-1), beta- (human cytomegalovirus, HCMV), and gamma-herpesviruses (Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, KSHV; murine gamma-herpesvirus 68, MHV68). Strikingly, we found that circRNAs are, as a population, resistant to host shutoff. This observation was confirmed by ectopic expression assays of human and murine herpesvirus endoribonucleases. During primary lytic infection, ten circRNAs were commonly regulated across all subfamilies of human herpesviruses, suggesting a common mechanism of regulation. We tested one such mechanism, namely how interferon-stimulation influences circRNA expression. 67 circRNAs were upregulated by either IFN-{beta} or -{gamma} treatment, with half of these also upregulated during lytic infection. Using gain and loss of function studies we found an interferon-stimulated circRNA, circRELL1, inhibited lytic HSV-1 infection. We have previously reported circRELL1 inhibits lytic KSHV infection, suggesting a pan-herpesvirus antiviral activity. We propose a two-pronged model in which interferon-stimulated genes may encode both mRNA and circRNA with antiviral activity. This is critical in cases of host shutoff, such as alpha- and gamma-herpesvirus infection, where the mRNA products are degraded but circRNAs escape.",

Using virological approaches, biochemical assays and mass spectrometry analysis, we report here that the NS5 protein of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping Ill virus (LIV), two related tick-borne flaviviruses, antagonize JAK-STAT signaling through interactions with tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, yeast gap-repair assays, computational protein-protein docking and functional studies identified a stretch of 10 residues of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain of tick-borne flavivirus NS5, but not mosquito-borne NS5, that is critical for interaction with the TYK2 kinase domain. Additional co-IP assays performed with several TYK2 orthologs revealed that the interaction was conserved across mammal species. In vitro kinase assays showed that TBEV and LIV NS5 reduced the catalytic activity of TYK2. Our results thus illustrate a novel mechanism by which viruses suppress the interferon response.\n\nTeaserInhibition of the catalytic activity of a key kinase of the JAK/STAT pathway by a viral protein",

    "abstract": "New drugs are needed to shorten and simplify treatment of tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Metabolic pathways that M. tuberculosis requires for growth or survival during infection represent potential targets for anti-tubercular drug development. Genes and metabolic pathways essential for M. tuberculosis growth in standard laboratory culture conditions have been defined by genome-wide genetic screens. However, whether M. tuberculosis requires these essential genes during infection has not been comprehensively explored because mutant strains cannot be generated using standard methods. Here we show that M. tuberculosis requires functional phenylalanine (Phe) and de novo purine and thiamine biosynthetic pathways for mammalian infection. We used a defined collection of M. tuberculosis transposon (Tn) mutants in essential genes, which we generated using a custom nutrient-rich medium, and transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify multiple central metabolic pathways required for fitness in a mouse infection model. We confirmed by individual retesting and complementation that mutations in pheA (Phe biosynthesis) or purF (purine and thiamine biosynthesis) cause death of M. tuberculosis in the absence of nutrient supplementation in vitro and strong attenuation in infected mice. Our findings show that Tn-seq with defined Tn mutant pools can be used to identify M. tuberculosis genes required during mouse lung infection. Our results also demonstrate that M. tuberculosis requires Phe and purine/thiamine biosynthesis for survival in the host, implicating these metabolic pathways as prime targets for the development of new antibiotics to combat tuberculosis.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMycobacterium tuberculosis causes more than 10 million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB) disease and 1.6 million deaths worldwide each year. Individuals with active TB must take a combination of four antibiotics for a minimum of 6-9 months to cure the infection. New anti-tubercular drugs are needed to simplify TB treatment and combat drug resistance. Here, we describe a novel collection of M. tuberculosis mutants lacking metabolic pathways essential for growth in standard laboratory conditions. Using these mutants, a mouse infection model, and deep sequencing we identified those metabolic pathways that M. tuberculosis also requires during infection. We find that M. tuberculosis mutants that cannot synthesize purine nucleotides, riboflavin, or certain amino acids are unable to grow in mice. We also find that mutant strains which cannot synthesize purine nucleotides or the amino acid phenylalanine die rapidly in laboratory cultures without nutrient supplementation, suggesting that new drugs targeting these pathways would kill M. tuberculosis. Overall, our work reveals multiple metabolic pathways that M. tuberculosis requires during infection, which could be pursued as new targets for development of anti-tubercular drugs.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria inhabit extreme environments, including drylands, providing multiple benefits to the ecosystem. Soil degradation in warm drylands is increasing due to land-use intensification. Restoration methods adapted to the strong stress in drylands are being developed, i.e. cyanobacterial inoculation to recover biocrusts. For success, it is crucial to optimize the survival of inoculated cyanobacterial in field. One strategy is to harden them to be re-adapted to stressful conditions after laboratory culturing. Here, we analyzed the genome and ecophysiological response to osmotic, desiccation and UVR stresses of an Antarctic cyanobacterium, Stenomitos frigidus ULC029, closely related to other cyanobacteria from warm and cold dryland soils. Chlorophyll a concentrations show that preculturing ULC029 under moderate osmotic stress improved its survival during an assay of desiccation plus rehydration under UVR. Besides, its sequential exposition to these stress factors increased the production of exopolysaccharides, carotenoids and scytonemin. Desiccation, but not osmotic stress, increased the concentrations of the osmoprotectants, trehalose and sucrose. However, osmotic stress might induce the production of other osmoprotectants, for which the complete pathways were found in the ULC029 genome. In total, 140 genes known to be involved in stress resistance were annotated and could potentially help ULC029 under stress. Here, we confirm that the sequential application of moderate osmotic stress and dehydration, could improve cyanobacterial hardening for soil restoration, by inducing several resistance mechanisms. We provide a high-quality genome of ULC029 and a description of the main resistance mechanisms found (i.e. production of exopolysaccharides, osmoprotectants, chlorophyll and carotenoids; DNA repair; oxidative stress protection).",

    "abstract": "In September 2023, the SARS-CoV-2 XBB descendants, such as XBB.1.5 and EG.5.1 (originally XBB.1.9.2.5.1), are predominantly circulating worldwide. Unexpectedly, however, a lineage distinct from XBB was identified and named BA.2.86 on August 14, 2023. Notably, BA.2.86 bears more than 30 mutations in the spike (S) protein when compared to XBB and the parental BA.2, and many of them are assumed to be associated with immune evasion. Although the number of reported cases is low (68 sequences have been reported as of 7 September 2023), BA.2.86 has been detected in several continents (Europe, North America and Africa), suggesting that this variant may be spreading silently worldwide. On 17 August 2023, the WHO designated BA.2.86 as a variant under monitoring. Here we show evidence suggesting that BA.2.86 potentially has greater fitness than current circulating XBB variants including EG.5.1. The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of BA.2.86 was significantly lower than that of B.1.1 and EG.5.1, suggesting that the increased fitness of BA.2.86 is not due to the increased infectivity. We then performed a neutralization assay using XBB breakthrough infection sera to address whether BA.2.86 evades the antiviral effect of the humoral immunity induced by XBB subvariants. The 50% neutralization titer of XBB BTI sera against BA.2.86 was significantly (1.6-fold) lower than those against EG.5.1. The sera obtained from individuals vaccinated with 3rd-dose monovalent, 4th-dose monovalent, BA.1 bivalent, and BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccines exhibited very little or no antiviral effects against BA.2.86. Moreover, the three monoclonal antibodies (Bebtelovimab, Sotrovimab and Cilgavimab), which worked against the parental BA.2, did not exhibit antiviral effects against BA.2.86. These results suggest that BA.2.86 is one of the most highly immune evasive variants ever.",

P. gingivalis W50 was resistant to LGL13K but susceptible to the stereo-isomer DGL13K. Upon prolonged exposure to DGL13K, a novel non-pigmented mutant was isolated that showed a low minimum inhibitory concentration and two-fold extended minimum duration for killing by DGL13K, consistent with tolerance to this peptide. The DGL13K tolerant bacteria exhibited synonymous mutations in the hagA gene. The mutations did not prevent mRNA expression but were predicted to alter mRNA structure. The non-pigmented bacteria were deficient in hemagglutination and hemoglobin binding, suggesting that the HagA protein was not expressed. This was supported by whole cell ELISA and gingipain activity assays, which suggested the absence of HagA but not two closely related gingipains.

We constructed a saturated Himar1 mariner transposon library and revealed by transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) that 498 protein-coding genes constitute the essential genome of C. insecticola for growth in free-living conditions. By comparing essential gene sets of C. insecticola and seven related Burkholderia s.l. strains, only 120 common genes were identified indicating that a large part of the essential genome is strain-specific. In order to reproduce specific nutritional conditions that are present in the gut of R. pedestris, we grew the mutant library in minimal media supplemented with candidate gut nutrients and identified several condition-dependent fitness-defect genes by Tn-seq. To validate the robustness of the approach, insertion mutants in six fitness genes were constructed and their growth-deficiency in media supplemented with the corresponding nutrient was confirmed. The mutants were further tested for their efficiency in R. pedestris gut colonization, confirming that gluconeogenic carbon sources, taurine and inositol, are nutrients consumed by the symbiont in the gut.",

This assumption is based on the genome structure, phylogenetic relationships, transmission electron microscopy investigations and, in part, on serological cross-reactivity of the virus. We also demonstrated its mechanical transmission to the indicator plant Nicotiana benthamiana and to the natural host Medicago sativa, both of which developed characteristic symptoms therefore suggesting a pathogenic nature of the disease.

    "abstract": "A feature of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BF.5 and BF.7 that recently circulated mainly in China and Japan was the high prevalence of ORF7a: H47Y mutation. Here we evaluated the effect of this mutation on the three main functions ascribed to SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a protein. Our findings show that H47Y mutation impairs the ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a to antagonize type-I interferon (IFN-I) response and to downregulate Major Histocompatibility Complex-I (MHC-I) cell surface levels, but had no effect in its anti-SERINC5 function. Overall, our results suggest that the H47Y mutation of ORF7a affects important functions of this protein resulting in changes in virus pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceIn late 2021, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) VOC emerged and outcompeted the circulating VOC Delta (B.1.617.2). Soon afterwards, Omicron VOC has expanded and diversified in the world. Among the emerged subvariants of Omicron are BF.5 and BF.7 that are characterized by the presence of a number of mutations across their genome and spread quite effectively across China and other countries later on. One such mutation that was found in the vast majority of isolates of the BF.5 and BF.7 subvariants was ORF7a: H47Y, whose effect on ORF7a is unknown. In this report, we show that H47Y inhibits a number of ORF7a functions, which can potentially affect virus pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades can survive remarkable doses of ionizing radiation, up to about 1000 times the lethal dose for humans. How they do so is incompletely understood. We found that the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris suffers DNA damage upon gamma irradiation, but damage is repaired. We show that tardigrades have a specific and robust response to ionizing radiation: irradiation induces a rapid, dramatic upregulation of many DNA repair genes. By expressing tardigrade genes in bacteria, we validate that increased expression of some repair genes can suffice to increase radiation tolerance. We show that at least one such gene is necessary for tardigrade radiation tolerance. Tardigrades ability to sense ionizing radiation and massively upregulate specific DNA repair pathway genes may represent an evolved solution for maintaining DNA integrity.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTardigrades exposed to ionizing radiation survive DNA damage by massively upregulating DNA repair pathway genes.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis infection is a vector-borne disease caused by the flavivirus Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). It is responsible of severe brain infection in humans worldwide. Given the ubiquitous nature of complications and tropism associated with Japanese encephalitis (JE) infection, a holistic understanding of its molecular mechanism is essential. The phenomenon of abnormal protein aggregation into pathogenic amyloids is now increasingly linked to multiple human diseases, also known as Amyloidosis. Most are neurodegenerative disorders but amyloidosis is not restricted to a specific organ or tissue type. The overlap of viral protein aggregation with human pathologies remains limited and it is gaining momentum, especially after the devastating Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, in this study we have examined the likelihood of aggregation for the entire collection of proteins in JEV. Multiple independent web server tools were employed to scan for potential amyloid prone-regions (APRs), and it was followed by in vitro validation using two JEV transmembrane domains, Capsid anchor and 2K peptides. These synthetic viral peptides were introduced to artificial aggregation-inducing conditions and then analyzed using a different dye-based assays and microscopy methods confirming amyloid-like fibril structure formation. We found these aggregates cytotoxic to human neuronal cell line and membrane damaging to human blood derived RBCs. The aggregation kinetics of both peptides is enhanced in the presence of artificial membrane models and seeds of self and diabetes hallmark protein Amylin. Our findings thereby strongly suggest the possibility of JEV protein aggregation playing a vital role in its pathogenesis, opening up a broad scope of future study. Also, the interplay between JEV protein aggregation and initiation/progression of other proteopathies is possible and needs further exploration.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/556571v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2956d0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@28128org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d7faaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d89f40_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Enhancers and their target promoters often come into close physical proximity when activated. This proximity may be explained by a variety of mechanisms; most recently via cohesin-mediated chromatin loop extrusion. Despite this compelling hypothesis, acute depletion of cohesin does not cause widespread changes in gene expression. We have tested the role of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion on gene expression at the mouse alpha-globin locus during erythropoiesis. Acute depletion of cohesin downregulates alpha-globin expression at early but not late stages of differentiation. When single or multiple CTCF sites are placed between the alpha-globin enhancers and promoters, alpha-gene expression is downregulated. Importantly, the orientation of the CTCF site plays a critical role, suggesting that within this activated domain, cohesin predominantly but not exclusively translocates from the enhancers to the promoters. We find that loop extrusion does play an important role in establishing enhancer-promoter proximity and consequent expression of inducible genes during differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) plays a crucial role in the cGAS-STING pathway of innate immunity, detecting DNA in the cytoplasm and defending against certain cancers, viruses, and bacteria. We designed and synthesized fluorinated carbocyclic cGAMP analogs, MD1203 and MD1202D (MDs), to enhance their stability against nucleases and their affinity for STING. These compounds demonstrated exceptional activity against wild-type STING and all its allelic variations, including the hard-to-target REF isoform. Despite their distinct chemical modifications relative to the canonical CDNs, such as the substitution of guanine with hypoxanthine and the fluorination of the (pseudo)ribose ring, crystallographic analysis revealed a consistent binding mode with STING. Importantly, these compounds were resistant to cleavage by viral poxin nucleases. The crystallographic analysis of poxin/MD complexes unveiled their binding mode at the interface of poxin monomers, with dynamic adenine base orientations. Interestingly, MDs-bound poxin adopted an unliganded-like conformation, distinct from the conformation of cGAMP-bound poxin. Moreover, when MDs were in complex with poxin, they exhibited a different conformation than cGAMP when bound to poxin; in fact, it closely resembled the conformation observed when MDs were bound to STING. In conclusion, the development of MD1203 and MD1202D, showcases their potential as potent STING activators with remarkable stability against poxin-mediated degradation--a crucial characteristic for future development of antivirals.",

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) plays an important role in the early phase of SARS-CoV2 infection through efficient interaction with ACE2. The S-protein is produced by RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, and has been hypothesized to be responsible for damaging cells of several tissues and for some important side effects of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine on erythroid differentiation of the human K562 cell line, that has been in the past intensively studied as a model system mimicking some steps of erythropoiesis. We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine suppresses mithramycin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Reverse-transcription-PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that suppression of erythroid differentiation was associated with sharp inhibition of the expression of -globin and {gamma}-globin mRNA accumulation. Inhibition of accumulation of {zeta}-globin and {varepsilon}-globin mRNAs was also observed. In addition, we provide in silico studies suggesting a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Hb Portland, that is the major hemoglobin produced by K562 cells. This study thus provides information suggesting the need of great attention on possible alteration of hematopoietic parameters following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination.",

    "abstract": "The ability to engineer adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for targeted infection of specific cell types is critically important to fully harness its potential of human gene therapy. A promising approach to achieve this objective involves chemically attaching retargeting ligands onto the virus capsid. Site-specific incorporation of a bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) into the AAV capsid proteins provides a particularly attractive strategy to introduce such modifications with exquisite precision. In this study, we show that using ncAA mutagenesis, it is possible to systematically alter the attachment site of a retargeting ligand (cyclic-RGD) on the AAV capsid to create diverse conjugate architectures, and that the site of attachment heavily impacts the retargeting efficiency. We further demonstrate that the performance of these AAV conjugates is highly sensitive to the stoichiometry of capsid labeling (labels per capsid), with an intermediate labeling density ([~]12 per capsid) providing optimal activity. Finally, we developed technology to precisely control the number of attachment sites per AAV capsid, by selectively incorporating a ncAA into the minor capsid proteins with high fidelity and efficiency, such that AAV-conjugates with varying stoichiometry can be synthesized in a homogeneous manner. Together, this platform provides unparalleled control over site and stoichiometry of capsid modification, which will enable the development of next-generation AAV vectors tailored with desirable attributes.",

The vinylglycine produced in situ is then used as a precursor of isoleucine and methionine, thus allowing the growth of strains of Escherichia coli requiring these essential amino acids.

Excitingly, this complex landscape of tumor-immune interactions can be studied using computational modeling. Mathematical oncology can provide quantitative insights into the TME, serving as a framework for understanding tumor dynamics. Here, we use an agent-based model to simulate the interactions among cancer cells, macrophages (naive, M1, and M2), and T cells (active CD8+ and inactive) in a 2D representation of the TME. Key diffusible factors, IL-4 and IFN-{gamma}, are also incorporated. We apply the model to predict how cell-specific properties influence tumor progression. The model predictions and analyses revealed the relationships between different cell populations and highlighted the importance of macrophages and T cells in shaping the TME. Thus, we quantify how components of the TME influence the final tumor state and the effects of macrophage-based therapies. The findings emphasize the significant role of computational models in unraveling the intricate dynamics of tumor-immune interactions and their potential for guiding the development of tailored immunotherapeutic strategies. This study provides a foundation for future investigations aiming to refine and expand the model, validate predictions experimentally, and pave the way for improved cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.",

Sde proteins have two additional activities of unclear relevance to the infection process: K63 linkage-specific deubiquitination and phosphoribosyl modification of polyubiquitin (pR-Ub). We show here that the deubiquitination activity (DUB) stimulates ER rearrangements while pR-Ub protects the replication vacuole from cytosolic surveillance by autophagy. Loss of DUB activity was tightly linked to lowered pR-Ub modification of Rtn4, consistent with the DUB activity fueling the production of pR-Ub-Rtn4. In parallel, phosphoribosyl modification of polyUb, in a region of the protein known as the isoleucine patch, caused an absolute block in binding by the autophagy adapter p62. An inability of Sde mutants to modify polyUb resulted in immediate p62 association, a critical precursor to autophagic attack. The ability of Sde WT to block p62 association decayed quickly after bacterial infection, as predicted by the presence of previously characterized L. pneumophila effectors that inactivate Sde and remove polyUb. In sum, these results show that the accessory Sde activities act to stimulate ER rearrangements and protect from host innate immune sensing in a temporal fashion.",

    "abstract": "The Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) genome consists of an approximately 140 kb unique coding region flanked by multiple copies of 0.8 kb terminal repeat (TR) sequence. While TRs function in plasmid maintenance is well-established, TRs transcription regulatory roles have not been fully explored. Here, we show KSHV TR is a large transcription regulatory domain.\n\nA series of Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease demonstrated that TR fragments are occupied by histone modifying enzymes that are known to interact with LANA in naturally infected cells, and the TR possessed characteristic enhancer histone modifications. The H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac modifications were conserved in unique region of the KSHV genome among naturally infected cells, and the KSHV Origin of lytic replication (Ori-Lyt) showed similar protein and histone modification occupancies with TRs. In the Ori-Lyt region, the LANA complex colocalizes with H3K27Ac-modified nucleosome along with paused RNA polymerase II, and two K-Rta recruitment sites frank the nucleosome. The isolated reporter assays demonstrated that neighboring TR fragments enhanced viral lytic gene promoter activity independent of orientation in KSHV-infected and non-infected 293FT cells. K-Rta transactivation function was drastically enhanced with TR, while LANA acquired promoter repression function with TR. KSHV TR is, therefore a regulatory domain for KSHV inducible genes. However, in contrast to cellular enhancers that are bound by multiple transcription factors, perhaps the KSHV enhancer is predominantly regulated by the LANA nuclear body with TR. KSHV evolved a clever mechanism to tightly control the latency-lytic switch with the TR/LANA complex.\n\nImportanceEnhancers are a crucial regulator of differential gene expression programs. Enhancer is the cis-regulatory sequences that determine target genes spatiotemporal and quantitative expression. Here, we show that KSHV terminal repeats fulfill the enhancer definition for KSHV inducible gene promoters. KSHV enhancer is occupied by LANA and its interacting proteins, such as CHD4, and CHD4 is known to restrict enhancers to access promoters for activation. This study thus proposes a new latency-lytic switch model in which TR accessibility to the KSHV gene promoters regulates lytic gene transcription.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid and abrupt changes. One possible explanation for differential adaptative abilities between these species is that the microbiome may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under such anthropic perturbations, the microbiota composition of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness, potentially causing local extirpation. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota (GM) could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We addressed this question by studying several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a forested gradient of urbanization (from rural forests to urban parks) during 2020 fall. The gut was collected and bacteria were described using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM. We analyzed these changes in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa and their putative functions to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found that urbanization had marked impacts on small mammal communities and their GM, either directly or indirectly depending on small mammal species categories. The urban dweller species had a lower taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, which could indicate dysbiosis in these urban species. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite potential dysbiosis. Urbanization could also impact the diversity and taxonomic composition of GM in urban adapter species. However, their functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could explain the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedback loops between the gut microbiota and the host species within communities, enabling rapid and flexible adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Host shifts to new plants can drive speciation for plant-feeding insects, but how commonly do host shifts also drive diversification for the parasites of those same insects? Oak gall wasps induce galls on oak trees and shifts to novel tree hosts and new tree organs have been implicated as drivers of oak gall wasp speciation. Gall wasps are themselves attacked by many insect parasites, which must find their hosts on the correct tree species and organ, but which also must navigate the morphologically variable galls with which they interact. Thus, we ask whether host shifts to new trees, organs, or gall morphologies correlate with gall parasite diversification. We delimit species and infer phylogenies for two genera of gall kleptoparasites, Synergus and Ceroptres, reared from a variety of North American oak galls. We find that most species were reared from galls induced by just one gall wasp species, and no parasite species was reared from galls of more than four species. Most kleptoparasite divergence events correlate with shifts to non-ancestral galls. These shifts often involved changes in tree habitat, gall location, and gall morphology. Host shifts are thus implicated in driving diversification for both oak gall wasps and their kleptoparasitic associates.",

    "abstract": "Robust genetic systems to control the expression of transgenes in a spatial and temporal manner are a valuable asset for researchers. The GeneSwitch system induced by the drug RU486 has gained widespread use in the Drosophila community. However, some concerns were raised as negative effects were seen depending on the stock, transgene, stage and tissue under study. Here, we characterized the adverse effects triggered by activating the GeneSwitch system in adult muscles using the MHC-GS-GAL4 driver. When a control, mock UAS-RNAi transgene was induced by feeding adult flies with RU486, we found that the overall muscle structure, including myofibrils and mitochondrial shape, was significantly disrupted and led to a significant reduction in the lifespan. Remarkably, lifespan was even shorter when two copies of the driver were used even without the mock UAS-RNAi transgene. Thus, researchers should be cautious when interpreting the results given the adverse effects we found when inducing RU486-dependent MHC-GS-GAL4 in adult muscles. To counter the impact of these effects we recommend setting up additional control groups, such as a mock UAS-RNAi transgene, to validate the findings when using this inducible genetic system, as comparing the phenotypes between RU486-treated and untreated animals could be insufficient.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Automated chromatin segmentation based on ChIP-seq data reveals insights into the epigenetic regulation of chromatin accessibility. Existing segmentation methods are constrained by simplifying modeling assumptions, which may have a negative impact on the segmentation quality. We introduce EpiSegMix, a segmentation tool based on a hidden Markov model with flexible read count distribution types and state duration modeling, allowing for a more flexible modeling of both histone signals and segment lengths. Results: In a comparison with two existing tools, ChromHMM and EpiCSeg, we show that EpiSegMix is more robust to technical variability. Furthermore, its flexible framework enables it to fit an accurate probabilistic model, which has the potential to increase the biological interpretability of chromatin states.

    "abstract": "Rapid progress in single-cell technologies has contributed to the availability of biological experiments pertaining to gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Although inferring GRNs can unveil insights about cellular mechanisms and functions to understand disease pathogenesis, existing deep learning tools are far from perfect and not providing appropriate interpretation as a guideline to explain the superior performance in the target task. Therefore, we provide an interpretation approach for our presented deep transfer learning (DTL) models to overcome such drawbacks, working as follows. We utilize several pre-trained models including SEResNet152, and SEResNeXt101. Then, we transfer knowledge from pre-trained models via keeping the weights in the convolutional base (i.e., feature extraction part) while modifying the classification part with the use of Adam optimizer to deal with classifying healthy controls and type 2 diabetes single-cell gene regulatory network (SCGRN) images. Another DTL models work in a similar manner but just with keeping weights of the bottom layers in the feature extraction unaltered while updating weights of consecutive layers through training from scratch. Experimental results on the whole 224 SCGRN images using 5-fold cross-validation show that our model (TFeSEResNeXT101) achieving the highest average balanced accuracy (BAC) of 0.97 and thereby significantly outperforming the baseline that resulted in an average BAC of 0.86. Moreover, the simulation study demonstrated that the superiority is attributed to the distributional conformance of model weight parameters obtained with Adam optimizer when coupled with weights from a pre-trained model.",
