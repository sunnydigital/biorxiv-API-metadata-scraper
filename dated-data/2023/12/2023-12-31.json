    "abstract": "Leak potassium (K+) currents, conducted by two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels, are critical for the stabilization of the membrane potential. The effect of K2P channels on motor rhythm remains enigmatic. We show here that the K2P TWK-40 regulates the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Disrupting TWK-40 suppresses the expulsion defects of nlp-40 and aex-2 mutants. By contrast, a gain-of-function (gf) mutant of twk-40 significantly reduces the expulsion frequency per DMP cycle. In situ whole-cell patch clamping demonstrates that TWK-40 forms an outward current that hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential of DVB neuron. In addition, TWK-40 substantially contributes to the rhythmic activity of DVB. Specifically, DVB Ca2+ oscillations exhibit obvious defects in twk-40 mutants. Expression of TWK-40(gf) in DVB recapitulates the expulsion deficiency of the twk-40(gf) mutant, and inhibits DVB Ca2+ oscillations in both wild-type and twk-40(lf) animals. Moreover, DVB innervated enteric muscles also exhibit rhythmic Ca2+ defects. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TWK-40 is an essential neuronal inhibitor of DMP, thus revealing a cellular mechanism linking leak K2P channels with rhythmic motor activity.",

    "abstract": "Heterophylly is a phenomenon in which an individual plant dramatically changes its leaf shape in response to the surrounding environment. Hygrophila difformis (Acanthaceae), also known as water wisteria, has recently emerged as a model plant to study heterophylly because of its striking leaf shape variation in response to various ecological factors. Under submerged conditions, H. difformis develops complex leaves and in terrestrial conditions it develops simple leaves. Here, we sequenced and assembled the chromosome-level genome of triploid H. difformis (scaffold N50: 60.43 Mb, genome size: 871.92 Mb), which reveals 36,099 predicted protein-coding genes distributed over 15 pseudochromosomes. H. difformis diverged from its relatives during the Oligocene climate-change period and expanded the gene families related to its amphibious lifestyle. Genes involved in environmental stimuli, leaf development, and other pathways are differentially expressed in submerged and terrestrial conditions, possibly modulating morphological and physiological acclimation to changing environments. We confirmed that auxin plays a role in the heterophylly of H. difformis. Finally, we discovered candidate genes that respond to different environmental conditions and elucidated the role of LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY 1 (LMI1) in heterophylly. Our study establishes H. difformis as a model for studying the interconnections between ecological adaptation and plant morphological features.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the development of neurodegenerative protein misfolding disorders. This category of progressive diseases includes, but is not limited to, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and prion diseases. Shared pathogenesis involves the accumulation of misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction, ultimately leading to irreversible neuronal loss, measurable cognitive deficits, and death. Presently, there are little to no effective treatments to halt the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized directly targeting neuroinflammation by downregulating the transcription factor, NF-{kappa}B and the inflammasome protein, NLRP3, with the brain-penetrant, non-toxic, SB_NI_112, would be neuroprotective. To achieve this, we used a cocktail of RNA targeting therapeutics (SB_NI_112) shown to be brain-penetrant, non-toxic, and targeting both NF-|B and NLRP3. We utilized a mouse-adapted prion strain as a model for neurodegenerative diseases to assess aggregation of misfolded proteins, glial inflammation, neuronal loss, cognitive deficits, and lifespan. Prion-diseased mice were treated either intraperitoneally or intranasally with SB_NI_112. Behavioral and cognitive deficits were significantly protected by this combination of NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 down-regulators. Treatment reduced glial inflammation, protected against neuronal loss, prevented spongiotic change, rescued cognitive deficits, and significantly lengthened lifespan of prion-diseased mice. We have identified a non-toxic, systemic pharmacologic that down-regulates NF-|B and NLRP3, prevents neuronal death and slows the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Though mouse models do not always predict human patient success, and the study was limited due to sample size and number of dosing methods utilized, these findings serve as a proof of principle for continued translation of the therapeutic SB_NI_112 for prion disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Based on success in a murine prion model, we will be continual testing SB_NI_112 in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models, including Alzheimers Disease and Parkinsons Disease.",

    "abstract": "The physical body of an organism serves as a vital interface for interactions with its environment. Here we investigated the impact of human body size on the perception of action possibilities (affordances) offered by the environment. We found that the body size delineated a distinct boundary on affordances, dividing objects of continuous real-world sizes into two discrete categories with each affording distinct action sets. Additionally, the boundary shifted with imagined body sizes, suggesting a causal link between body size and affordance perception. Intriguingly, ChatGPT, a large language model lacking physical embodiment, exhibited a modest yet comparable affordance boundary at the scale of human body size, suggesting the boundary is not exclusively derived from organism-environment interactions. A subsequent fMRI experiment revealed evidence of affordance processing exclusively for objects within the body size range, but not for those beyond. This suggests that only objects capable of being manipulated are the objects capable of offering affordance in the eyes of an organism. In summary, our study suggests a novel definition of object-ness in an affordance-based context, advocating the concept of embodied cognition in understanding the emergence of intelligence constrained by an organisms physical attributes.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are ubiquitously observed in many brain areas. One proposed functional role of these oscillations is that they serve as an internal clock, or  frame of reference. Information can be encoded by the timing of neural activity relative to the phase of such oscillations. In line with this hypothesis, there have been multiple empirical observations of such phase codes in the brain. Here we ask: What kind of neural dynamics support phase coding of information with neural oscillations? We tackled this question by analyzing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that were trained on a working memory task. The networks were given access to an external reference oscillation and tasked to produce an oscillation, such that the phase difference between the reference and output oscillation maintains the identity of transient stimuli. We found that networks converged to stable oscillatory dynamics. Reverse engineering these networks revealed that each phase-coded memory corresponds to a separate limit cycle attractor. We characterized how the stability of the attractor dynamics depends on both reference oscillation amplitude and frequency, properties that can be experimentally observed. To understand the connectivity structures that underlie these dynamics, we showed that trained networks can be described as two phase-coupled oscillators. Using this insight, we condensed our trained networks to a reduced model consisting of two functional modules: One that generates an oscillation and one that implements a coupling function between the internal oscillation and external reference.\n\nIn summary, by reverse engineering the dynamics and connectivity of trained RNNs, we propose a mechanism by which neural networks can harness reference oscillations for working memory. Specifically, we propose that a phase-coding network generates autonomous oscillations which it couples to an external reference oscillation in a multi-stable fashion.\n\nAuthor summaryMany of our actions are rhythmic--walking, breathing, digesting and more. It is not surprising that neural activity can have a strong oscillatory component. Indeed, such brain waves are common, and can even be measured using EEG from the scalp. Perhaps less obvious is the presence of such oscillations during non-rhythmic behavior--such as memory maintenance and other cognitive functions. Reports of these cognitive oscillations have accumulated over the years, and various theories were raised regarding their origin and utilization. In particular, oscillations have been proposed to serve as a clock signal that can be used for temporal-, or phase-coding of information in working memory. Here, we studied the dynamical systems underlying this kind of coding, by using trained artificial neural networks as hypothesis generators. We trained recurrent neural networks to perform a working memory task, while giving them access to a reference oscillation. We were then able to reverse engineer the learned dynamics of the networks. Our analysis revealed that phase-coded memories correspond to stable attractors in the dynamical landscape of the model. These attractors arose from the coupling of the external reference oscillation with oscillations generated internally by the network.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSoftware for labeling biological sequences typically produces a theory-based statistic for each match (the E-value) that indicates the likelihood of seeing that matchs score by chance. E-values accurately predict false match rate for comparisons of random (shuffled) sequences, and thus provide a reasoned mechanism for setting score thresholds that enable high sensitivity with low expected false match rate. This threshold-setting strategy is challenged by real biological sequences, which contain regions of local repetition and low sequence complexity that cause excess matches between non-homologous sequences. Knowing this, tool developers often develop benchmarks that use realistic-seeming decoy sequences to explore empirical tradeoffs between sensitivity and false match rate. A recent trend has been to employ reversed biological sequences as realistic decoys, because these preserve the distribution of letters and the existence of local repeats, while disrupting the original sequences functional properties. However, we and others have observed that sequences appear to produce high scoring alignments to their reversals with surprising frequency, leading to overstatement of false match risk that may negatively effect downstream analysis.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that an alignment between a sequence S and its (possibly mutated) reversal tends to produce higher scores than alignment between truly unrelated sequences, even when S is a shuffled string with no notable repetitive or low-complexity regions. This phenomenon is due to the unintuitive fact that (even randomly shuffled) sequences contain palin-dromes that are on average longer than the longest common substrings shared between permuted variants of the same sequence. Though the expected palindrome length is only slightly larger than the expected longest common substring, the distribution of alignment scores involving reversed sequences is strongly right-shifted, leading to greatly increased frequency of high-scoring alignments to reversed sequences.\n\nImpactOverestimates of false match risk can motivate unnecessarily high score thresholds, leading to potentially reduced true match sensitivity. Also, when tool sensitivity is only reported up to the score of the first matched decoy sequence, a large decoy set consisting of reversed sequences can obscure sensitivity differences between tools. As a result of these observations, we advise that reversed biological sequences be used as decoys only when care is taken to remove positive matches in the original (un-reversed) sequences, or when overstatement of false labeling is not a concern. Though the primary focus of the analysis is on sequence annotation, we also demonstrate that the prevalence of internal palindromes may lead to an overstatement of the rate of false labels in protein identification with mass spectrometry.",

    "abstract": "In rodents, exposure to predator odors such as cat urine acts as a severe stressor that engages innate defensive behaviors critical for survival in the wild. The neurotransmitters norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) modulate anxiety and predator odor responses, and we have shown previously that dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-), which reduces NE and increases DA in mouse noradrenergic neurons, disrupts innate behaviors in response to mild stressors such as novelty. We examined the consequences of Dbh knockout (Dbh -/-) on responses to predator odor (bobcat urine) and compared them to Dbh-competent littermate controls. Over the first 10 min of predator odor exposure, controls exhibited robust defensive burying behavior, whereas Dbh -/- mice showed high levels of grooming. Defensive burying was potently suppressed in controls by drugs that reduce NE transmission, while excessive grooming in Dbh -/- mice was blocked by DA receptor antagonism. In response to a cotton square scented with a novel \"neutral\" odor (lavender), most control mice shredded the material, built a nest, and fell asleep within 90 min. Dbh -/- mice failed to shred the lavender-scented nestlet, but still fell asleep. In contrast, controls sustained high levels of arousal throughout the predator odor test and did not build nests, while Dbh -/- mice were asleep by the 90-min time point, often in shredded bobcat urine-soaked nesting material. Compared with controls exposed to predator odor, Dbh -/- mice demonstrated decreased c-fos induction in the anterior cingulate cortex, lateral septum, periaqueductal gray, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, but increased c-fos in the locus coeruleus and medial amygdala. These data indicate that relative ratios of central NE and DA signaling coordinate the type and valence of responses to predator odor.",

These various TLRa-SNP adjuvant constructs induce unique acute cytokine and immune-signaling profiles, leading to specific Th-responses that could be of interest depending on the target disease for prevention.

    "abstract": "People with HIV (PWH) experience an increased vulnerability to premature aging and inflammation-associated comorbidities, even when HIV replication is suppressed by antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the factors that contribute to or are associated with this vulnerability remain uncertain. In the general population, alterations in the glycomes of circulating IgGs trigger inflammation and precede the onset of aging-associated diseases. Here, we investigate the IgG glycomes of cross-sectional and longitudinal samples from 1,216 women and men, both living with virally suppressed HIV and those without HIV. Our glycan-based machine learning models indicate that living with chronic HIV significantly accelerates the accumulation of pro-aging-associated glycomic alterations. Consistently, PWH exhibit heightened expression of senescence-associated glycan-degrading enzymes compared to their controls. These glycomic alterations correlate with elevated markers of inflammatory aging and the severity of comorbidities, potentially preceding the development of such comorbidities. Mechanistically, HIV-specific antibodies glycoengineered with these alterations exhibit reduced anti-HIV IgG-mediated innate immune functions. These findings hold significant potential for the development of glycomic-based biomarkers and tools to identify and prevent premature aging and comorbidities in people living with chronic viral infections.",

An analysis of DNA methylation in postnatal pancreas tissue showed that the dramatic temporal changes in DNA methylation occurring in the developing pancreas are largely limited to the prenatal period. Significant differences in DNA methylation were observed between males and females at a number of autosomal sites, with a small proportion of sites showing sex-specific DNA methylation trajectories across pancreas development. Pancreas dDMPs were not distributed equally across the genome, and were depleted in regulatory domains characterized by open chromatin and the binding of known pancreatic development transcription factors. Finally, we compared our pancreas dDMPs to previous findings from the human brain, identifying evidence for tissue-specific developmental changes in DNA methylation. To our knowledge, this represents the most extensive exploration of DNA methylation patterns during human fetal pancreas development, confirming the prenatal period as a time of major epigenomic plasticity.",

Thus, few genes involved in RG-II synthesis have been identified.

Plants homozygous for this mutation do not survive. We show that in the callus mutant cell walls, RG-II does not crosslink normally because it lacks 3-deoxy-D-manno- octulosonic acid (Kdo) and thus cannot form the -L-Rhap-(1[-&gt;]5)--D-kdop-(1[-&gt;] sidechain.

    "abstract": "The structure and function of the mitochondrial network are finely regulated. Among the proteins involved in these regulations, mitochondrial dynamics actors have been reported to regulate the apoptotic process. We show here in the Drosophila model that the mitophagy inducers, PINK1 (PTEN- induced putative kinase 1) and BNIP3 (Bcl-2 Interacting Protein 3), modulate mitochondrial apoptosis differently. If close links between the fission-inducing protein DRP1 and Bcl-2 family proteins, regulators of apoptosis, are demonstrated, the connection between mitophagy and apoptosis is still poorly understood. In Drosophila, we have shown that Rbf1, a homolog of the oncosuppressive protein pRb, induces cell death in proliferating larval tissues through a mechanism involving the interaction of Drp1 with Debcl, a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. This interaction is necessary to induce mitochondrial fission, ROS production, and apoptosis.\n\nTo better understand the interactions between the proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and the apoptotic process, we focused on the role of two known players in mitophagy, the proteins PINK1 and BNIP3, during mitochondrial apoptosis induced by Rbf1 and Debcl in a proliferating Drosophila larval tissue. We show that Rbf1- or Debcl-induced apoptosis is accompanied by mitophagy. Interestingly, PINK1 and BNIP3 have distinct effects in regulating cell death. PINK1 promotes rbf1- or debcl-induced apoptosis, whereas BNIP3 protects against Rbf1-induced apoptosis but reduces Debcl- induced tissue loss without inhibiting Debcl-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results indicate that BNIP3 is required to induce basal mitophagy while PINK1 is responsible for mitophagy induced by rbf1 overexpression. These results highlight the critical role of mitophagy regulators in controlling homeostasis and cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) can be considered as a probe of choice for living tissue microscopy and whole-body imaging. When choosing a specific RFP variant, the priority may be focused on fluorescence brightness, maturation rate, monomericity, excitation/emission wavelengths, low toxicity, which are rarely combined in optimal way in a single protein. If the additional requirements such as prolonged fluorescence lifetime and/or blinking ability are applied, the available probes repertoire could become surprisingly narrow. Since the whole diversity of the conventional single-component RFPs belongs to just a few phylogenetic lines (with DsRed-, eqFP578- and eqFP611-derived being the major ones), it is not unexpected that their advantageous properties are split between close homologs. In such cases, a systematic mutagenetic analysis focused on variant-specific amino acid residues can shed light on the origins of sibling RFPs distinctness and might be beneficial for consolidation of their strengths in new RFP variants. For instance, the protein FusionRed, although being efficient in the fluorescence labeling due its good monomericity and low cytotoxicity, has undergone a considerable lost in fluorescence brightness/lifetime and received an undesirable alteration in posttranslational chemistry upon its designing from the parental mKate2. In this contribution, we describe a fast-maturing monomeric RFP designed semi-rationally based on the mKate2 and FusionRed templates, outperforming both its parents in brightness, having extended fluorescence lifetime, and showing spontaneous blinking pattern promising for nanoscopy use.",

    "abstract": "Vaccine development targeting rapidly evolving pathogens such as HIV-1 requires induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with conserved paratopes and mutations, and, in some cases, the same Ig-heavy chains. The current trial-and-error search for immunogen modifications that improve selection for specific bnAb mutations is imprecise. To precisely engineer bnAb boosting immunogens, we used molecular dynamics simulations to examine encounter states that form when antibodies collide with the HIV-1 Envelope (Env). By mapping how bnAbs use encounter states to find their bound states, we identified Env mutations that were predicted to select for specific antibody mutations in two HIV-1 bnAb B cell lineages. The Env mutations encoded antibody affinity gains and selected for desired antibody mutations in vivo. These results demonstrate proof-of-concept that Env immunogens can be designed to directly select for specific antibody mutations at residue-level precision by vaccination, thus demonstrating the feasibility of sequential bnAb-inducing HIV-1 vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "As the SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly evolves, predicting the trajectory of viral variations has become a critical yet complex task. A deep understanding of future mutation patterns, in particular the mutations that will prevail in the near future, is vital in steering diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine strategies in the coming months.\n\nIn this study, we developed a model to forecast future SARS-CoV-2 mutation surges in real-time, using historical mutation frequency data from the USA. To improve upon the accuracy of traditional time-series models, we transformed the prediction problem into a supervised learning framework using a sliding window approach. This involved breaking the time series of mutation frequencies into very short segments. Considering the time-dependent nature of the data, we focused on modeling the first-order derivative of the mutation frequency. We predicted the final derivative in each segment based on the preceding derivatives, employing various machine learning methods, including random forest, XGBoost, support vector machine, and neural network models, in this supervised learning setting. Empowered by the novel transformation strategy and the high capacity of machine learning models, we witnessed low prediction error that is confined within 0.1% and 1% when making predictions for future 30 and 80 days respectively. In addition, the method also led to a notable increase in prediction accuracy compared to traditional time-series models, as evidenced by lower MAE, and MSE for predictions made within different time horizons. To further assess the methods effectiveness and robustness in predicting mutation patterns for unforeseen mutations, we categorized all mutations into three major patterns. The model demonstrated its robustness by accurately predicting unseen mutation patterns when training on data from two pattern categories while testing on the third pattern category, showcasing its potential in forecasting a variety of mutation trajectories.\n\nTo enhance accessibility and utility, we built our methodology into an R-shiny app (https://swdatpredicts.shinyapps.io/rshiny_predict/), a tool with potential applicability in studying other infectious diseases, thus extending its relevance beyond the current pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The Human Silencing Hub (HuSH) complex is composed of TASOR, MPP8, and PPHLN1 subunits and serves as a conserved protein complex responsible for silencing transposable elements in vertebrate animals. Despite its importance, the regulatory mechanisms and recruitment dynamics governing this complex remain poorly understood. In this study, we have identified a second HuSH complex, termed HuSH2, centered around TASOR2, a paralog of the core TASOR protein in HuSH. Our findings indicate that every subunit in both HuSH and HuSH2 has an important role in achieving precise genomic localization to distinct, non-overlapping genomic loci. We utilized in silico protein structure prediction to simulate the interactions between MPP8 and both TASOR paralogs. Drawing on the insights gained from these predictions, we implemented amino acid substitutions that interfered with the binding of MPP8 to each HuSH complex. Leveraging these MPP8 transgenes and other constructs, we identified an important role played by the relative quantities of HuSH complexes in controlling the activity of LINE-1 elements. Furthermore, our results suggest that dynamic changes in TASOR and TASOR2 expression enable cells to finely tune the extent of HuSH-mediated silencing. Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between HuSH complexes, illuminating their important role in the regulation of retrotransposon silencing.\n\nKey PointsO_LIThe identification of a previously unknown HuSH2 complex, with TASOR2 as its central component.\nC_LIO_LIHuSH and HuSH2 complexes exhibit unique genomic localization patterns within the human genome.\nC_LIO_LIDisruption of the delicate balance between the two HuSH complexes results in the desilencing of LINE-1.\nC_LIO_LITASOR and TASOR2 engage in a competitive interaction for the HuSH subunit MPP8.\nC_LIO_LIThe localization of MPP8 to either HuSH or HuSH2 sites is intricately regulated by its interaction with TASOR and TASOR2.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The current Mpox virus (MPXV) outbreak since 2022 has led to 92,783 cases and at least 171 fatalities across 116 countries, with increased transmission noted particularly among male homosexual activities, though the underlying causes remain unknown. The requirement of biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories poses a barrier to MPXV research and the formulation of antiviral strategies, while genetic modifications to the wild-type live virus raise biosafety and bioethical concerns. Here we report a novel trans-complementary system that produces a single-round infectious MPXV, preserving the viruss authentic architecture and enabling it to complete its life cycle in complementary cells. This deficient MPXV genome lacks two essential genes critical for viral late genes transcription, viral assembly, and release. The entire 197 kb genome of the deficient MPXV was synthesized and assembled in vitro, a method that reduces the risk of recombination with bacterial or yeast DNA, in contrast to traditional recombination techniques. The deficient MPXV, limited to single-round infection in various normal cell lines, regained reproductive capability in the complementary cells. Notably, SCID mice inoculated with this deficient MPXV exhibited no detectable disease or viral load in their organs. Therefore, this trans-complementation platform can be safely utilized in BSL-2 laboratories, providing a valuable tool for MPXV research and the development of countermeasures.",
