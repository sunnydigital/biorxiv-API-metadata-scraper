    "abstract": "A growing list of metazoans undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), where a significant amount of DNA is selectively lost from the somatic genome during development. In some nematodes, PDE leads to the removal and remodeling of the ends of all germline chromosomes. In several species, PDE also generates internal breaks that lead to sequence loss and an increased number of somatic chromosomes. The biological significance of these karyotype changes associated with PDE and the origin and evolution of nematode PDE remain largely unknown. Here, we assembled the single germline chromosome of the horse parasite Parascaris univalens and compared the karyotypes, chromosomal gene organization, and PDE features among ascarid nematodes. We show that PDE in Parascaris converts an XX/XY sex-determination system in the germline into an XX/XO system in the somatic cells. Comparisons of Ascaris, Parascaris, and Baylisascaris ascarid chromosomes suggest that PDE existed in the ancestor of these parasites, and their current distinct germline karyotypes were derived from fusion events of smaller ancestral chromosomes. The DNA breaks involved in PDE resolve these fused germline chromosomes into their pre-fusion karyotypes, leading to alterations in genome architecture and gene expression in the somatic cells. Cytological and genomic analyses further suggest that satellite DNA and the heterochromatic chromosome arms play a dynamic role in the Parascaris germline chromosome during meiosis. Overall, our results show that chromosome fusion and PDE have been harnessed in these ascarids to sculpt their karyotypes, altering the genome organization and serving specific functions in the germline and somatic cells.",

    "abstract": "Learning to exploit the contingencies of a complex experiment is not an easy task for animals. Individuals learn in an idiosyncratic manner, revising their approaches multiple times as they are shaped, or shape themselves, and potentially end up with different strategies. Their long-run learning curves are therefore a tantalizing target for the sort of individualized quantitative characterizations that sophisticated modelling can provide. However, any such model requires a flexible and extensible structure which can capture radically new behaviours as well as slow changes in existing ones. To this end, we suggest a dynamic input-output infinite hidden semi-Markov model, whose latent states are associated with specific components of behaviour. This model includes an infinite number of potential states and so has the capacity to describe substantially new behaviours by unearthing extra states; while dynamics in the model allow it to capture more modest adaptations to existing behaviours. We individually fit the model to data collected from more than 100 mice as they learned a contrast detection task over tens of sessions and around fifteen thousand trials each. Despite large individual differences, we found that most animals progressed through three major stages of learning, the transitions between which were marked by distinct additions to task understanding. We furthermore showed that marked changes in behaviour are much more likely to occur at the very beginning of sessions, i.e. after a period of rest, and that response biases in earlier stages are not predictive of biases later on in this task.",

Over the years, workflows used in metabolomics have been assumed to remove enzymes to preserve metabolite levels during processing. Here, we uncover a diverse landscape of over 1,000 proteins, strongly enriched for metabolic enzymes, within metabolite extracts generated using common extraction workflows. Moreover, by combining in-extract stable isotope additions and enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrate transaminase activity, which is preventable by protein removal by 3 kDa filtration. We extend these findings to untargeted metabolomics, revealing that both post-extraction formation of glutamate dipeptide and depletion of total glutathione can also be prevented by removing proteins. Finally, we present a simple yet novel workflow that integrates passive filtration for protein removal of crude metabolite extracts as a superior method for broad-coverage metabolomics.

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are a crucial component of anaesthesia and intensive care. NMBAs are a family of molecules defined by their ability to compete with acetylcholine for binding to the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. This functional homology relies on the presence of ammonium groups in all NMBAs that, however, display vastly different chemical structures. Among animal models, non-human primates (NHP) are an essential model for a great diversity of human disease models but remain poorly characterized for the effectiveness of the diverse NMBAs.\n\nMethodsSeven healthy male cynomolgus macaques were randomly assigned to this study. Experiments using macaques were approved by the local ethical committee (CEtEA #44). All animals were anaesthetized according to institutional guidelines, with ketamine and medetomidine, allowing IV line placement and tracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with isofluorane. Either rocuronium bromine or atracurium besylate was evaluated, with reversal with sugammadex. Monitoring was performed with two devices, TOF-Watch(R) and ToFscan(R), measuring the T4/T1 and the T4/Tref ratios, respectively. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney statistical analyses were done when indicated.\n\nResultsNMBA monitoring required adaptation compared to humans, such as stimulus intensity and electrodes placement, to be efficient and valid in Cynomolgus macaques. When administered, both NMBAs induced deep and persistent neuro-muscular blockade at equivalent doses to clinical doses in humans. Rocuronium-induced profound neuromuscular blockade could be reverted using the cyclodextrin sugammadexs reversal agent. We report no adverse effects in these models by clinical observation, blood chemistry, or complete blood count.\n\nConclusionThese results support the use of non-human primate models for neuromuscular blockade monitoring and testing novel NMBA or their reversal agents.",

    "abstract": "Excessive fibrogenesis serves to disrupt the anatomical and functional integrity of the kidneys contributing to renal failure. Renal fibroblast is the major precursor to myofibroblast, the effector cell type of renal fibrosis. How fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (FMyT) is regulated in the kidneys remains incompletely understood. In the present study we investigated the role of Brahma related gene 1 (Brg1), a chromatin remodeling protein, in renal fibrosis focusing on mechanistic insights and translational potential. We report that Brg1 was up-regulated during FMyT both in vitro and in vivo. Brg1 deletion in fibroblasts partially blocked TGF-{beta} induced FMyT in vitro and attenuated renal fibrosis in three different animal models. Importantly, conditional Brg1 knockout in Postn+ mature myofibroblasts mitigated renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) or ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in mice. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered Prune2 as a potential target for Brg1. Brg1 interacted with E2F1 to activate Prune2 transcription during FMyT. Concordantly, Prune2 knockdown suppressed TGF-{beta} induced FMyT in vitro and dampened renal fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, Prune2 likely contributed to FMyT by augmenting phosphorylation and activity of the pro-fibrogenic transcription factor PU.1. Finally, small-molecule Brg1 inhibitor PFI-3 exhibited strong antifibrotic potency in established models of renal fibrosis. In conclusion, our data provide compelling evidence that BRG1 is a pivotal regulator of as well as a promising therapeutic target for renal fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "In the context of global warming and climate change, as sessile organisms, plants are more vulnerable to environmental stresses than before. Stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation results in plant cell damages and even cell death. Anthocyanins are important antioxidants that scavenge ROS to maintain ROS homeostasis. However, the mechanism underlying ROS-induced anthocyanin accumulation is unclear. In this study, we determined that the HD-Zip I family member PuHB40 mediates ROS-dependent anthocyanin biosynthesis under high-light stress. Specifically, PuHB40 is a transcription factor that induces PuMYB123-like/PubHLH3 complex for anthocyanin biosynthesis. The transcriptional activation by PuHB40 depends on its phosphorylation level, which is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). High ROS contents maintain the phosphorylation of PuHB40 at a high level, while also enhancing PuHB40-induced PuMYB123-like transcription by decreasing PuPP2AA2 expression at the transcriptional and translational levels, ultimately leading to increased anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our study revealed the pathway regulating ROS-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in pear, further clarifying the mechanism underlying abiotic stress-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, which may have implications for improving plant stress tolerance.\n\nIN A NUTSHELL\n\nBackgroundVarious abiotic stresses, including high light, promotes the accumulation of anthocyanins in plants. Anthocyanins attenuate the negative effects of on photosynthesis and physiological metabolism of plants under high-light stress by absorbing excess light energy or by acting as an antioxidant to reduce ROS accumulation. Several reports have showed that ROS can stimulate anthocyanin accumulation, but whether the high-light induced anthocyanin accumulation depends on ROS is still under debate. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of ROS-dependent anthocyanin biosynthesis is still not clear. Question: What is the underlying molecular mechanism of high light stress-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis?\n\nFindingsWe found that various stresses-induced anthocyanin accumulation in pear plant is dependent on ROS. PuHB40 was the core TF involved in ROS-dependent anthocyanin biosynthesis under high-light stress, while PuMYB13-like is the key MYB TF for anthocyanin biosynthesis in ROS pathway. PuHB40 transcriptionally activates PuMYB123-like/PubHLH3 complex for promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis. The transcriptional activation by PuHB40 depends on its phosphorylation level, which is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). High ROS contents maintain the phosphorylation of PuHB40 at a high level, while also enhancing PuHB40-induced PuMYB123-like transcription by decreasing PuPP2AA2 expression at the transcriptional and translational levels, ultimately leading to increased anthocyanin biosynthesis.\n\nNext stepsAn important task for next step is to explore whether PuHB40 regulation pathway is applicable in other stresses and provide insight into theoretical basis of abiotic stress-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition, investigate other post-translational modifications involved in ROS-dependent anthocyanin biosynthesis. Moreover, we will explore the effects of different stress levels on anthocyanin accumulation in pear fruits, and try to regulate pear fruit coloration by appropriate stress.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathic pain is associated with elevated plasma levels of methylglyoxal (MGO). MGO is a metabolite of glycolysis that causes mechanical hypersensitivity in mice by inducing the integrated stress response (ISR), which is characterized by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (p-eIF2). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that neutralize MGO. We hypothesized that activating Nrf2 using diroximel fumarate (DRF) would alleviate MGO-induced pain hypersensitivity. We pretreated male and female C57BL/6 mice daily with oral DRF prior to intraplantar injection of MGO (20 ng). DRF (100 mg/kg) treated animals were protected from developing MGO-induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. Using Nrf2 knockout mice we demonstrate that Nrf2 is necessary for the anti-nociceptive effects of DRF. In cultured mouse and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, we found that MGO induced elevated levels of p-eIF2. Co-treatment of MGO (1 {micro}M) with monomethyl fumarate (MMF, 10, 20, 50 {micro}M), the active metabolite of DRF, reduced p-eIF2 levels and prevented aberrant neurite outgrowth in human DRG neurons. Our data show that targeting the Nrf2 antioxidant system with DRF is a strategy to potentially alleviate pain associated with elevated MGO levels.\n\nPerspectiveThis study demonstrates that activating Nrf2 with DRF prevents the development of pain caused by MGO in mice and reduces ISR in mouse and human DRG in vitro models. We propose that Nrf2 activators like DRF should be tested to alleviate diabetic neuropathic pain associated with elevated MGO in patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/572877v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5e0703org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e95bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f92f2borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@187f12d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Article HighlightsO_LIMGO induces mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in mice that is prevented with pre-treatment with DRF.\nC_LIO_LIDRF pre-treatment does not protect Nrf2-knockout mice from developing pain hypersensitivity suggesting that Nrf2 is necessary for DRFs antinociceptive effects.\nC_LIO_LIMMF, the active metabolite of DRF, prevents MGO-induced increase in p-eIF2a levels in mouse and human DRG neurons in vitro.\nC_LIO_LIMMF prevents MGO-induced aberrant neurite outgrowth in human DRG neurons.\nC_LIO_LINrf2 activators, like the FDA-approved DRF, is an option to alleviate neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes.\nC_LI",

We then devise computational strategies to confine seizures (prevent widespread propagation), simulating medical-like treatments such as tissue resection and the application of an anti-seizure drugs or neurostimulation to suppress hyperexcitability. Through selectively removing (blocking) specific connections informed by the structural connectome and graph network measurements or by locally reducing outgoing connection weights of EZ areas, we demonstrate that seizures can be kept constrained around the EZ region.

    "abstract": "Activation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, leading to the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been linked to cardiac remodeling, autonomic disbalance, and cognitive deficits in heart failure (HF). While previous studies emphasized the role of hippocampal Angiotensin II (AngII) signaling in HF-induced microglial activation, unanswered mechanistic questions persist. Evidence suggests significant interactions between microglia and local microvasculature, potentially affecting blood-brain barrier integrity and cerebral blood flow regulation. Still, whether the microglial-vascular interface is affected in the brain during HF remains unknow. Using a well-established ischemic HF rat model, we demonstrate increased vessel-associated microglia (VAM) in HF rat hippocampi, which showed heightened expression of AngII AT1a receptors. Acute AngII administration to sham rats induced microglia recruitment to the perivascular space, along with increased expression of TNFa. Conversely, administering an AT1aR blocker to HF rats prevented the recruitment of microglia to the perivascular space, normalizing their levels to those in healthy rats. These results highlight the critical importance of a rather understudied phenomenon (i.e., microglia-vascular interactions in the brain) in the context of the pathophysiology of a highly prevalent cardiovascular disease, and unveil novel potential therapeutic avenues aimed at mitigating neuroinflammation in cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWNeuroimaging-based pain biomarkers, when combined with machine learning techniques, have demonstrated potential in decoding pain intensity and diagnosing clinical pain conditions. However, a systematic evaluation of how different modeling options affect model performance remains unexplored. This study presents results from a comprehensive literature survey and benchmarking analysis. We conducted a survey of 57 previously published articles that included neuroimaging-based predictive modeling of pain, comparing classification and prediction performance based on the following modeling variables--the levels of data, spatial scales, idiographic vs. population models, and sample sizes. The findings revealed a preference for population-level modeling with brain-wide features, aligning with the goal of clinical translation of neuroimaging biomarkers. However, a systematic evaluation of the influence of different modeling options was hindered by a limited number of independent test results. This prompted us to conduct benchmarking analyses using a locally collected functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) dataset (N = 124) involving an experimental thermal pain task. The results clearly demonstrated that data levels, spatial scales, and sample sizes significantly impact model performance. Specifically, incorporating more pain-related brain regions, increasing sample sizes, and using less data averaging in training while increasing it in testing enhanced performance. These findings provide a useful reference for decision-making in the development of neuroimaging-based biomarkers, highlighting the importance of the careful selection of modeling strategies and options to build better-performing neuroimaging pain biomarkers. These findings offer useful guidance for developing neuroimaging-based biomarkers, underscoring the importance of strategic selection of modeling approaches to build better-performing neuroimaging pain biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Sound is jointly processed along acoustic and emotional dimensions. These dimensions can become distorted and entangled in persons with sensory disorders, producing a spectrum of loudness hypersensitivity, phantom percepts, and - in some cases - debilitating sound aversion. Here, we looked for objective signatures of disordered hearing (DH) in the human face. Pupil dilations and micro facial movement amplitudes scaled with sound valence in neurotypical listeners but not DH participants with chronic tinnitus (phantom ringing) and sound sensitivity. In DH participants, emotionally evocative sounds elicited abnormally large pupil dilations but blunted and invariant facial reactions that jointly provided an accurate prediction of individual tinnitus and hyperacusis questionnaire handicap scores. By contrast, EEG measures of central auditory gain identified steeper neural response growth functions but no association with symptom severity. These findings highlight dysregulated affective sound processing in persons with bothersome tinnitus and sound sensitivity disorders and introduce approaches for their objective measurement.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are proposed to be important in the pathogenesis of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. We report the first application of solid-state technology to perform multiplex analysis of single exosomes in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the lumbar sac of people diagnosed with Alzheimers disease dementia (ADD, n=30) or Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD, n=30), as well as age-matched health controls (HCN, n=30). Single events were captured with mouse monoclonal antibodies to one of three different tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, or CD81) or with mouse (M) IgG control, and then probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies to prion protein (PrP) or CD47 to mark neuronal or presynaptic origin, as well as ADD- and PDD-related proteins: amyloid beta (A{beta}), tau, -synuclein, and Apolipoprotein (Apo) E. Data were collected only from captured events that were within the size range of 50 to 200 nm. Exosomes were present at approximately 100 billion per mL human CSF and were similarly abundant for CD9+ and CD81+ events, but CD63+ were only 22% to 25% of CD9+ (P<0.0001) or CD81+ (P<0.0001) events. Approximately 24% of CSF exosomes were PrP+, while only 2% were CD47+. The vast majority of exosomes were surface ApoE+, and the number of PrP-ApoE+ (P<0.001) and PrP+ApoE+ (P<0.01) exosomes were significantly reduced in ADD vs. HCN for CD9+ events only. A{beta}, tau, and -synuclein were not detected on the exosome surface or in permeabilized cargo. These data provide new insights into single exosome molecular features and highlight reduction in the CSF concentration of ApoE+ exosomes in patients with ADD.",

    "abstract": "The ability to flexibly switch between tasks develops during childhood. Childrens task-switching performance improves with practice, but the underlying processes remain unclear. We examined how nine weeks of task-switching training affect performance and task-related activation and connectivity as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Children (8-11 years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to three groups: high-intensity task switching (SW; n = 70), high-intensity single tasking (SI; n = 72), and passive control (n = 41). After three weeks, drift-diffusion modeling revealed faster evidence accumulation and more cautious responding in both training groups relative to the control group. At the end of training, these changes were maintained in the SW group only, that also showed activation decreases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional connectivity increases associated with task-switching demands became less pronounced with practice in both training groups, with more persistent decreases in the SI group. We conclude that task-switching training altered performance by accelerating evidence accumulation and promoting more cautious responding. Faster evidence accumulation along with decreased task-related activations suggest increased processing efficiency in frontoparietal regions with training. More intense task-switching training helped maintain these changes, possibly by facilitating plastic change through the protracted mismatch between processing supplies and environmental demands.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveCochlear implants (CIs) are auditory prostheses for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss, offering substantial but incomplete restoration of hearing function by stimulating the auditory nerve using electrodes. However, progress in CI performance and innovation has been constrained by the inability to rapidly test multiple sound processing strategies. Current research interfaces provided by major CI manufacturers have limitations in supporting a wide range of auditory experiments due to portability, programming difficulties, and the lack of direct comparison between sound processing algorithms. To address these limitations, we present the CompHEAR research platform, designed specifically for the Cochlear Implant Hackathon, enabling researchers to conduct diverse auditory experiments on a large scale.\n\nStudy DesignQuasi-experimental\n\nSettingVirtual\n\nMethodsCompHEAR is an open-source, user-friendly platform which offers flexibility and ease of customization, allowing researchers to set up a broad set of auditory experiments. CompHEAR employs a vocoder to simulate novel sound coding strategies for CIs. It facilitates even distribution of listening tasks among participants and delivers real-time metrics for evaluation. The software architecture underlies the platforms flexibility in experimental design and its wide range of applications in sound processing research.\n\nResultsPerformance testing of the CompHEAR platform ensured that it could support at least 10,000 concurrent users. The CompHEAR platform was successfully implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and enabled global collaboration for the CI Hackathon (www.cihackathon.com).\n\nConclusionThe CompHEAR platform is a useful research tool that permits comparing diverse signal processing strategies across a variety of auditory tasks with crowdsourced judging.

    "abstract": "Understanding how brain activity is related to animal behavior requires measuring multi-area interactions on multiple timescales. However, methods to perform chronic, simultaneous recordings of neural activity from many brain areas are lacking.\n\nHere, we introduce a novel approach for independent chronic probe implantation that enables flexible, simultaneous interrogation of neural activity from many brain regions during head restrained or freely moving behavior. The approach enables repeated retrieval and reimplantation of probes. The chronic implantation approach can be combined with other modalities such as skull clearing for cortex wide access and optogenetics with optic fibers. Using this approach, we implanted 6 probes chronically in one hemisphere of the mouse brain.\n\nThe implant is lightweight, allows flexible targeting with different angles, and offers enhanced stability. Our approach broadens the applications of chronic recording while retaining its main advantages over acute recording (superior stability, longitudinal monitoring of activity and freely moving interrogations) and provides an appealing avenue to study processes not accessible by acute methods, such as the neural substrate of learning across multiple areas.",

    "abstract": "The application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to the human spinal cord is still a relatively small field of research and faces many challenges. Here we aimed to probe the limitations of task-based spinal fMRI at 3T by investigating the reliability of spinal cord blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses to repeated nociceptive stimulation across two consecutive days in 40 healthy volunteers. We assessed the test-retest reliability of subjective ratings, autonomic responses, and spinal cord BOLD responses to short heat pain stimuli (1s duration) using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). At the group level, we observed robust autonomic responses as well as spatially specific spinal cord BOLD responses at the expected location, but no spatial overlap in BOLD response patterns across days. While autonomic indicators of pain processing showed good-to-excellent reliability, both {beta}-estimates and z-scores of task-related BOLD responses showed poor reliability across days in the target region (gray matter of the ipsilateral dorsal horn). When taking into account the sensitivity of gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GE-EPI) to draining vein signals by including the venous plexus in the analysis, we observed BOLD responses with good reliability across days. Taken together, these results demonstrate that heat pain stimuli as short as one second are able to evoke a robust and spatially specific BOLD response, which is however strongly variable within participants across time, resulting in low reliability in the dorsal horn gray matter. Further improvements in data acquisition and analysis techniques are thus necessary before event-related spinal cord fMRI as used here can be reliably employed in longitudinal designs or clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "In graph theory, \"multilayer networks\" represent systems involving several interconnected topological levels. A neuroscience example is the hierarchy of connections between different cortical depths or \"lamina\". This hierarchy is becoming non-invasively accessible in humans using ultra-high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI). Here, we applied multilayer graph theory to examine functional connectivity across different cortical depths in humans, using 7T fMRI (1-mm3 voxels; 30 participants). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals were derived from five depths between the white matter and pial surface. We then compared networks where the inter-regional connections were limited to a single cortical depth only (\"layer-by-layer matrices\") to those considering all possible connections between regions and cortical depths (\"multilayer matrix\"). We utilized global and local graph theory features that quantitatively characterize network attributes such as network composition, nodal centrality, path-based measures, and hub segregation. Detecting functional differences between cortical depths was improved using multilayer connectomics compared to the layer-by-layer versions. Superficial aspects of the cortex dominated information transfer and deeper aspects clustering. These differences were largest in frontotemporal and limbic brain regions. fMRI functional connectivity across different cortical depths may contain neurophysiologically relevant information. Multilayer connectomics could provide a methodological framework for studies on how information flows across this hierarchy.",

Here we generated a single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of the frontal cortex of ALS cases with C9orf72 (C9) hexanucleotide repeat expansions and sporadic ALS (sALS). Our findings reveal shared pathways in C9-ALS and sALS, characterized by synaptic dysfunction in excitatory neurons and a disease-associated state in microglia. The disease subtypes diverge with loss of astrocyte homeostasis in C9-ALS, and a more substantial disturbance of inhibitory neurons in sALS. Leveraging high depth 3-end sequencing, we found a widespread switch towards distal polyadenylation (PA) site usage across ALS subtypes relative to controls. To explore this differential alternative PA (APA), we developed APA-Net, a deep neural network model that uses transcript sequence and expression levels of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to predict cell-type specific APA usage and RBP interactions likely to regulate APA across disease subtypes.",

However, whether this extends to the AD brain or the mechanisms that underlie these benefits remain unknown. To address this question, we delivered the LHCGR agonist human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) intracerebroventricularly (ICV), under reproductively intact and ovariectomized conditions to mimic the post-menopausal state in the APP/PS1mouse brain. Cognitive function was tested using the Morris water maze task, and hippocampal dendritic spine density, A{beta} pathology, and signaling changes associated with these endpoints were determined to address mechanisms. Here we show that central LHCGR activation restored function in ovariectomized APP/PS1 female mice to wild-type levels without altering A{beta} pathology. LHCGR activation increased hippocampal dendritic spine density regardless of reproductive status, and this was mediated by BDNF-dependent and independent signaling. We also show that ovariectomy in the APP/PS1 brain elicits an increase in peripherally derived pro-inflammatory genes which are inhibited by LHCGR activation. This may mediate reproductive status specific effects of LHCGR agonism on cognitive function and BDNF expression. Together, this work highlights the relevance of the LHCGR on cognition and its therapeutic potential in the \"menopausal\" AD brain.",

    "abstract": "Dogs are increasingly used as a model for neuroscience due to their ability to undergo functional MRI fully awake and unrestrained, after extensive behavioral training. Still, we know rather little about dogs basic functional neuroanatomy, including how basic perceptual and motor functions are localized in their brains. This is a major shortcoming in interpreting activations obtained in dog fMRI. The aim of this preregistered study was to localize areas associated with somatosensory processing. To this end, we touched N = 22 dogs undergoing fMRI scanning on their left and right flanks using a wooden rod. We identified activation in anatomically defined primary and secondary somatosensory areas (SI and SII), lateralized to the contralateral hemisphere depending on the side of touch, as well as activations, beyond an anatomical mask of SI and SII, in the cingulate cortex, right cerebellum and vermis, and the Sylvian gyri. These activations may partly relate to motor control (cerebellum, cingulate), but also potentially to higher-order cognitive processing of somatosensory stimuli (rostral Sylvian gyri), and the affective aspects of the stimulation (cingulate). We also found evidence for individual side biases in a vast majority of dogs in our sample, pointing at functional lateralization of somatosensory processing. These findings not only provide further evidence that fMRI is suited to localize neuro-cognitive processing in dogs in vivo, but also expand our understanding of touch processing in mammals, beyond classically defined primary and secondary somatosensory cortices.\n\nSignificance StatementTo understand brain function and evolution, it is necessary to look beyond the human lineage. This study provides insights into the engagement of brain areas related to somatosensation using whole-brain non-invasive neuroimaging of trained, non-sedated, and unrestrained pet dogs. It showcases again the usefulness of non-invasive methods, in particular fMRI, for investigating brain function and advances the mapping of brain functions in dogs; using this non-invasive approach without sedation, we are able to identify previously unknown potential higher-order processing areas and offer a quantification of touch processing lateralization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer in the world. Infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (HP) is associated with approximately 75% of gastric cancer cases. HP infection induces chronic gastric inflammation, damaging the stomach and fostering carcinogenesis. Most mechanistic studies on Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer initiation are performed in mice and utilize either mouse-adapted strains of HP or the natural mouse pathogen Helicobacter felis (HF). Each of these infection models is associated with strengths and weaknesses. Here, we identified the differences in immunogenicity and gastric pathological changes associated with HP and HF infection in mice.\n\nMaterial and MethodsPMSS1 HP strain or with the CS1 HF strain were co-cultured with mouse peritoneal macrophages to assess their immunostimulatory effects. C57BL/6J mice were infected with HP or HF, and gastric inflammation, atrophy, and metaplasia development were assessed 2 months post-infection.\n\nResultsHP and HF induced similar cytokine production from cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages. HP-infected mice caused modest inflammation within both the gastric corpus and antrum and did not induce significant atrophy within the gastric corpus. In contrast, HF induced significant inflammation throughout the gastric corpus and antrum. Moreover, HF infection was associated with significant atrophy of the chief and parietal cell compartments and induced expression of pyloric metaplasia markers.\n\nConclusionsHP is poorly immunogenic compared to HF. HF induces dramatic CD4+ T cell activation, which is associated with increased gastric cancer risk in humans. Thus, HP studies in mice are better suited for studies on colonization, while HF is more strongly suited for pathogenesis and cancer initiation studies.",

Here, we developed an individual-based model of a coevolving predator-prey-parasite system, in which predators can be infected by trophically transmitted parasites. With this setup we combined host-parasite coevolution with host-predator interactions, hence integrating evolutionary and ecological processes. We show that species coexist when parasite-mediated selection is weak on both the predator and the prey. The abundance and genotypic diversity of the hosts are highest at the intermediate parasite-mediated selection on the predator but not on the prey. Interestingly, we show that the evolution of super-resistant genotypes, where host genotypes have resistant alleles in all loci, is driven by interspecific interactions rather than the abundance of the focal species. Overall, host-parasite coevolution shapes the direction of interspecific ecological interactions which, in turn, determine species coexistence and community diversity in a complex system.",

Recent studies reported intraspecific variation in protein contents and biological activities of the hemolymph of honey bees related to their diet. Here we measured interspecific variation in three common bee species in the Mediterranean Basin with contrasting ecologies: Apis mellifera, Chalicodoma siculum, and Xylocopa pubescens. Despite all the bees were collected in the same area, we found important quantitative and qualitative variations of hemolymph extracts across species. Samples of A. mellifera and C. siculum had much higher protein concentration, anticancer, antimicrobial and antoxidant activities than samples of X. pubescens. This first descriptive study suggests life history traits of bee species have strong influences on their hemolymph properties and call for future large scale comparative analyses across more species and geographical areas.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater algal cultivation (WAC) in outdoor raceway ponds is a promising means of removing polluting nutrients from water while producing biomass feedstock for products like fertilizer or biofuel. However, algal cultivation in open ponds is often plagued by underproduction due to contamination by zooplankton. The use of biological controls, i.e., natural predators to control zooplankton, was evaluated as a potential low-cost solution in this study. Eighteen pilot-scale raceway ponds were inoculated with cultured algae and naturally-occurring zooplankton; bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were tested as biological control agents to suppress zooplankton. We installed cages in the ponds to protect the fish from the paddlewheels and control the area the fish could access. The cage either surrounded the paddlewheel - in which case the fish had access to the remaining area - or the cage was opposite the paddlewheel, in which case the fish had access to the smaller area inside the cage. We also implemented fishless controls. After 19 days, ponds with cages surrounding the paddlewheel had 93% more zooplankton, but the fish had reduced zooplankton by 89% on average across cage treatments. Cage placement did not affect algal biomass, but ponds with fish had 45% higher algal dry weight and 84% higher algal biovolume. However, no differences in nutrient levels were recorded among treatments after 19 days. We concluded hardy zooplanktivorous fish represent a promising means of boosting algal production in WAC, although further research is needed to determine whether the change in algal biomass could eventually translate to improved nutrient removal.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorals belong to the Cnidaria, an early branching phylum of metazoans. Over the course of their long evolutionary history, they have adapted to changing environments, such as rising sea levels and increasing ocean temperatures. While their history speaks to their evolutionary capacity, it is less clear how quickly they may respond to rapid changes. A critical aspect of adaptive capacity is the structure of their genome and the genetic diversity contained within.\n\nFindingsHere, we present chromosome-scale genome assemblies and genetic linkage maps of two critically endangered coral species, Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis, the two extant Atlantic acroporid corals. Genomes of both species were resolved into 14 chromosomes with comparable assembly sizes (A. palmata, 287Mb; A. cervicornis, 305Mb). Gene content, repeat content, gene collinearity and macrosynteny were largely preserved between the Atlantic acroporids but a 2.5 Mb inversion and 1.4 Mb translocation were detected between two of the chromosome pairs. Macrosynteny and gene collinearity decreased when comparing Atlantic with Pacific acroporids. Paracentric inversions of whole chromosome arms characterized A. hyacinthus, specifically. In the larger context of cnidarian evolution, the four acroporids and another scleractinian coral with chromosome-resolved genome assemblies retained six of 21 cnidarian ancestral linkage groups, while also privately sharing numerous ALG fission and fusion events compared to other distantly related cnidarians. Genetic linkage maps were built using a 30K genotyping array with 105 offspring in one family for A. palmata and 154 offspring across 16 families for A. cervicornis. The A. palmata consensus linkage map spans 1,013.42 cM and includes 2,114 informative markers. The A. cervicornis consensus map spans 927.36 cM across 4,859 markers. A. palmata and A. cervicornis exhibited similarly high sex-averaged genome-wide recombination rates (3.53 cM/Mb and 3.04 cM/Mb, respectively) relative to other animals. In our gamete-specific maps, we found pronounced sex-based differences in recombination, known as heterochiasmy, in this simultaneous hermaphrodite, with both species showing recombination rates 2-2.5X higher in eggs compared to sperm.\n\nConclusionsThe genomic resources presented here are the first of their kind available for Atlantic coral species. These data sets revealed that adaptive capacity of endangered Atlantic corals is not limited by their recombination rates, with both species exhibiting high recombination rates and heterochiasmy. Nevertheless, the two sister species maintain high levels of macrosynteny and gene collinearity between them. The few large-scale rearrangements detected deserve further study as a potential cause of fertilization barriers between the species. Together, the assemblies and genetic maps presented here now enable genome-wide association studies and discovery of quantitative trait loci; tools that can aid in the conservation of these endangered corals.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeats (STRs) are hotspots of genomic variability in the human germline because of their high mutation rates, which have long been attributed largely to polymerase slippage during DNA replication. This model suggests that STR mutation rates should scale linearly with a fathers age, as progenitor cells continually divide after puberty. In contrast, it suggests that STR mutation rates should not scale with a mothers age at her childs conception, since oocytes spend a mothers reproductive years arrested in meiosis II and undergo a fixed number of cell divisions that are independent of the age at ovulation. Yet, mirroring recent findings, we find that STR mutation rates covary with paternal and maternal age, implying that some STR mutations are caused by DNA damage in quiescent cells rather than the classical mechanism of polymerase slippage in replicating progenitor cells. These results also echo the recent finding that DNA damage in quiescent oocytes is a significant source of de novo SNVs and corroborate evidence of STR expansion in postmitotic cells. However, we find that the maternal age effect is not confined to previously discovered hotspots of oocyte mutagenesis, nor are post-zygotic mutations likely to contribute significantly. STR nucleotide composition demonstrates divergent effects on DNM rates between sexes. Unlike the paternal lineage, maternally derived DNMs at A/T STRs display a significantly greater association with maternal age than DNMs at GC-containing STRs. These observations may suggest the mechanism and developmental timing of certain STR mutations and are especially surprising considering the prior belief in replication slippage as the dominant mechanism of STR mutagenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have long known that tandem repeats are hypermutable and attributed that hypermutability to slippage during DNA replication. Contradicting this long-held theory, we show that tandem repeats accumulate mutations in maternal germ cells during periods when these cells do not replicate. This bolsters a new consensus that DNA replication is not the only driver of mutagenesis, even at loci where replicative slippage is possible. Patterns shared by certain loci enriched for mutations from older mothers may hint at mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in fungal genome sequencing have dramatically altered our understanding of the phylogeny and evolution of Fungi. However, there are still many poorly studied obligate parasitic or symbiotic fungi for which we lack any genomic information or knowledge of where they fit in the fungal phylogeny. Ancylistes, an endoparasite of desmid green algae, is such an understudied fungal genus. This genus has been taxonomically placed in the group of arthropod pathogens and saprobes, Entomophthoromycotina in Zoopagomycota. Understanding the phylogenetic position of Ancylistes provides insights into the nutritional evolution of Zoopagomycota, which is primarily composed of animal-associated fungi. In this study, we found and cultivated Ancylistes closterii with its host Closterium sp. and sequenced its genome to investigate its phylogenetic position and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses using rDNA and genome-scale datasets showed that A. closterii was sister to other Entomophthoromycotina fungi, confirming the taxonomic position of Ancylistes. Despite the ecological distinctiveness between Ancylistes and other Entomophthoromycotina fungi, our comparative genomic analyses revealed many shared traits of these fungi such as lineage-specific subtilases and hybrid histidine kinases. Ancylistes also possessed unique genes among Zoopagomycota fungi, such as plant cell wall degrading enzymes which could be important for infection of algae.\n\nSignificanceImproved taxon sampling is important for inferring a robust phylogeny of Fungi. However, there are still poorly studied obligate parasitic taxa whose DNA sequencing is challenging, especially in Zoopagomycota, one of the early diverging lineages of Fungi. This study focused on a long-neglected algal parasite, Ancylistes closterii, which belongs to the arthropod-associated group, Entomophthoromycotina. We rediscovered A. closterii and established a dual culture of fungus and its host alga, which enabled the first molecular analysis of this enigmatic parasite. Our results provide new insights into the nutritional evolution of primarily animal-associated Zoopagomycota.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of stable mating type polymorphisms is a classic example of balancing selection, underlying the nearly ubiquitous 50/50 sex ratio in species with separate sexes. One lesser known but intriguing example of a balanced mating polymorphism in angiosperms is heterodichogamy - polymorphism for opposing directions of dichogamy (temporal separation of male and female function in hermaphrodites) within a flowering season. This mating system is common throughout Juglandaceae, the family that includes globally important and iconic nut and timber crops - walnuts (Juglans), as well as pecan and other hickories (Carya). In both genera, heterodichogamy is controlled by a single dominant allele. We fine-map the locus in each genus, and find two ancient (>50 Mya) structural variants involving different genes that both segregate as genus-wide trans-species polymorphisms. The Juglans locus maps to a ca. 20 kb structural variant adjacent to a probable trehalose phosphate phosphatase (TPPD-1), homologs of which regulate floral development in model systems. TPPD-1 is differentially expressed between morphs in developing male flowers, with increased allele-specific expression of the dominant haplotype copy. Across species, the dominant haplotype contains a tandem array of duplicated sequence motifs, part of which is an inverted copy of the TPPD-1 3 UTR. These repeats generate various distinct small RNAs matching sequences within the 3 UTR and further downstream. In contrast to the single-gene Juglans locus, the Carya heterodichogamy locus maps to a ca. 200-450 kb cluster of tightly linked polymorphisms across 20 genes, some of which have known roles in flowering and are differentially expressed between morphs in developing flowers. The dominant haplotype in pecan, which is nearly always heterozygous and appears to rarely recombine, shows markedly reduced genetic diversity and is over twice as long as its recessive counterpart due to accumulation of various types of transposable elements. We did not detect either genetic system in other heterodichogamous genera within Juglandaceae, suggesting that additional genetic systems for heterodichogamy may yet remain undiscovered.",

    "abstract": "The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea can regenerate its entire body from small tissue fragments and is studied as regeneration model species. The assembly and functional analysis of planarian genomes has proven challenging due its high A/T content (70% A/T), repetitive nature, and limited transferability of routine laboratory protocols due to their divergent biochemistry. Only few and often fragmented genome assemblies are currently available, and open challenges include the provision of well-annotated chromosome-scale reference assemblies of the model species and other planarians for a comparative genome evolution perspective. Here we report a haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly and high-quality gene annotations of the sexual S2 strain of S. mediterranea and provide putative regulatory region annotations via optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols. To additionally leverage sequence conservation for regulatory element annotations, we generated chromosome-scale genome assemblies and chromatin accessibility data for the three closest relatives of S. mediterranea: S. polychroa, S. nova, and S. lugubris. We find substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions, yet reveal remarkable conservation in ChIP-mark bearing open chromatin regions identified as promoters and enhancers in S. mediterranea. The resulting high-confidence set of evolutionary conserved enhancers and promoters provides a valuable resource for the analysis of gene regulatory circuits and their evolution within the taxon. In addition, our four chromosome-scale genome assemblies provide a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations that lead to a degradation of synteny across the genus. Interestingly, we further find independent and near-complete losses of the ancestral metazoan synteny across Schmidtea and two other flatworm groups, indicating that platyhelminth genomes largely evolve without syntenic constraints. Our work provides valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and sets a foundation for the comparative genomics of planarians. We reveal a contrast between the fast structural evolution of planarian genomes and the conservation of their regulatory elements, suggesting a unique genome evolution in flatworms where gene positioning may not be essential.",

Here, we characterize an NRPS-PKS BGC with a putative lantibiotic dehydratase from the bacterium Stackebrandtia nassauensis (sna). Heterologous expression revealed several metabolites produced by the BGC, and the omission of selected biosynthetic enzymes revealed the biosynthetic sequence towards these compounds. The putative lantibiotic dehydratase catalyzes peptide bond formation that extends the peptide scaffold opposite to the NRPS and PKS biosynthetic direction. The condensation domain of the NRPS catalyzes the formation of a ureido group, and bioinformatics analysis revealed distinct active site residues of ureido-generating condensation (UreaC) domains.

TECdisplay measures RNA function by fractionating a TEC library based on the activity of cotranscriptionally displayed nascent RNA. In this way, RNA function is measured as the distribution of template DNA molecules between fractions of the transcription reaction. This approach circumvents typical RNA sequencing library preparation steps that can cause technical bias. We used TECdisplay to characterize the transcription antitermination activity of 32,768 variants of the Clostridium beijerinckii pfl ZTP riboswitch designed to perturb steps within its cotranscriptional folding pathway.

This dynamic process requires an intricate orchestration of cellular migration and proliferation. Our understanding of the intra-cellular signalling mechanisms that initialize, cease, and balance migration and proliferation during wound healing remains incomplete. Wound healing assays are a frequently used approach to examine this complex relationship in vitro. However, existing assays suffer from limited reproducibility, low throughput, and inflexibility in experimental design. We have developed the Automated Wound Healing (AWH) assay, a high-throughput robotics-assisted technique for reproducible wound creation and automated time-lapse image analysis.

The dynamics of migration and proliferation in individual cells are evaluated over the course of wound closure using live-cell fluorescence microscopy and our image processing pipeline. The AWH assay outperforms the standard scratch assay with enhanced consistency in wound geometry. Our ability to create diverse wound shapes in any multi-well plate with the BAB not only allows for multiple experimental conditions to be analyzed in parallel but also offers versatility in the design of wound healing experiments. Our method emerges as a valuable tool for the automated completion and analysis of high-throughput, reproducible, and adaptable in vitro wound healing assays.",

    "abstract": "Natural ecosystems offer efficient pathways for carbon sequestration, serving as a resilient approach to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with minimal environmental impact. However, the control of living systems outside of their native environments is often challenging. Here, we engineered a photosynthetic living material for dual CO2 sequestration by immobilizing photosynthetic microorganisms within a printable polymeric network. The carbon concentrating mechanism of the cyanobacteria enabled accumulation of CO2 within the cell, resulting in biomass production. Additionally, the metabolic production of OH- ions in the surrounding medium created an environment for the formation of insoluble carbonates via microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). Digital design and fabrication of the living material ensured sufficient access to light and nutrient transport of the encapsulated cyanobacteria, which were essential for long-term viability (more than one year) as well as efficient photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. The photosynthetic living materials sequestered approximately 2.5 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material over 30 days via dual carbon sequestration, with 2.2 {+/-} 0.9 mg stored as insoluble carbonates. Over an extended incubation period of 400 days, the living materials sequestered 26 {+/-} 7 mg of CO2 per gram of hydrogel material in the form of stable minerals. These findings highlight the potential of photosynthetic living materials for scalable carbon sequestration, carbon-neutral infrastructure, and green building materials. The simplicity of maintenance, coupled with its scalability nature, suggests broad applications of photosynthetic living materials as a complementary strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions.",

    "abstract": "Partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) of source-separated urine is less energy-intensive and potentially cheaper and more environmentally friendly than conventional nitrogen removal from mixed sewage. However, PN/A of undiluted source-separated urine has not yet been established. In this study, the feasibility of PN/A for source-separated urine (total nitrogen {approx} 2 to 3 g-N L-1). To evaluate the influence of different factors, one- and two-stage configurations were operated using different influents, i.e. source-separated urine, synthetic urine, and urine with additional divalent cations. While partial nitritation was successfully achieved in both configurations with digester supernatant and urine, anammox activity was lost shortly after switching from digester supernatant to the urine influents. Toxic organic compounds or pharmaceuticals and the high monovalent to divalent cation ratio were suspected as causes of anammox failure, but were ruled out due to the different reactor configurations and influent compositions tested. Other suspected factors such as COD/N ratio, phosphate and sulfate inhibition, nitrogen compound inhibition, metal inhibition, pH and dissolved oxygen were also systematically excluded. Instead, the high salt concentration in urine compared to the digester supernatant most likely caused the reactor to fail due to the disintegration of large flocs, and the resulting challenge of biomass retention. The shortcomings of the floccular sludge system were overcome by using biofilm carriers, resulting in successful PN/A. This hybrid system ran for 140 days with nitrogen removal rates of up to 1000 mg-N L-1 d-1 with an average of 410 {+/-} 220 mg-N L-1 d-1, and a nitrogen removal efficiency of 93 {+/-} 3% at 30{degrees}C.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal injuries, including tendinopathies, present a significant clinical burden for aging populations. While the biological drivers of age-related declines in tendon function are poorly understood, it is well accepted that dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays a role in chronic tendon degeneration. Senescent cells, which have been associated with multiple degenerative pathologies in musculoskeletal tissues, secrete a highly pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that has potential to promote ECM breakdown. However, the role of senescent cells in the dysregulation of tendon ECM homeostasis is largely unknown. To assess this directly, we developed an in vitro model of induced cellular senescence in murine tendon explants. This novel technique enables us to study the isolated interactions of senescent cells and their native ECM without interference from age-related systemic changes. We document multiple biomarkers of cellular senescence in induced tendon explants including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, and SASP production. We then utilize this in vitro senescence model to compare the ECM remodeling response of young, naturally aged, and senescent tendons to an altered mechanical stimulus. We found that both senescence and aging independently led to alterations in ECM-related gene expression, reductions in protein synthesis, and tissue compositional changes. Furthermore, MMP activity was sustained, thus shifting the remodeling balance of aged and senescent tissues towards degradation over production. Together, this demonstrates that cellular senescence plays a role in the altered mechano-response of aged tendons and likely contributes to poor clinical outcomes in aging populations.",

    "abstract": "Orofacial clefts are the most common craniofacial congenital anomaly. Following cleft palate repair, up to 60% of surgeries have wound healing complications leading to oronasal fistula (ONF), a persistent connection between the roof of the mouth and the nasal cavity. The current gold standard methods for ONF repair use human allograft tissues; however, these procedures have risks of graft infection and/or rejection, requiring surgical revisions. Immunoregenerative therapies present a novel alternative approach to harness the bodys immune response and enhance the wound healing environment. We utilized a repurposed FDA-approved immunomodulatory drug, FTY720, to reduce the egress of lymphocytes and induce immune cell fate switching toward pro-regenerative phenotypes. Here, we engineered a bilayer biomaterial system using Tegaderm, a liquid-impermeable wound dressing, to secure and control the delivery of FTY720- nanofiber scaffolds (FTY720-NF). We optimized release kinetics of the bilayer FTY720-NF to sustain drug release for up to 7d with safe, efficacious transdermal absorption and tissue biodistribution. Through comprehensive immunophenotyping, our results illustrate a pseudotime pro-regenerative state transition in recruited hybrid immune cells to the wound site. Additional histological assessments established a significant difference in full thickness ONF closure in mice on Day 7 following treatment with bilayer FTY720-NF, compared to controls. These findings demonstrate the utility of immunomodulatory strategies for oral wound healing, better positing the field to develop more efficacious treatment options for pediatric patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLocal delivery of bilayer FTY720-nanofiber scaffolds in an ONF mouse model promotes complete wound closure through modulation of pro-regenerative immune and stromal cells.",

To circumvent these problems, we have proposed an in-vitro biomimetic lipid-polymer composite membrane (BLCM) model as an artificial cornea to study drug permeability. We designed and fabricated a free-standing, electro-spun polystyrene (PS) nanofibrous membrane and impregnated its pores with phosphatidylcholine (PC).

    "abstract": "Glioma is currently one of the most prevalent types of primary brain cancer. Given its high level of heterogeneity along with the complex biological molecular markers, many efforts have been made to accurately classify the type of glioma in each patient, which, in turn, is critical to improve early diagnosis and increase survival. Nonetheless, as a result of the fast-growing technological advances in high throughput sequencing and evolving molecular understanding of glioma biology, its classification has been recently subject to significant alterations. In this study, we integrate multiple glioma omics modalities (including mRNA, DNA methylation, and miRNA) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), while using the revised glioma reclassified labels, with a supervised method based on sparse canonical correlation analysis (DIABLO) to discriminate between glioma types. We were able to find a set of highly correlated features distinguishing glioblastoma from lower-grade gliomas (LGG) that were mainly associated with the disruption of receptor tyrosine kinases signaling pathways and extracellular matrix organization and remodeling. On the other hand, the discrimination of the LGG types was characterized primarily by features involved in ubiquitination and DNA transcription processes. Furthermore, we could identify several novel glioma biomarkers likely helpful in both diagnosis and prognosis of the patients, including the genes PPP1R8, GPBP1L1, KIAA1614, C14orf23, CCDC77, BVES, EXD3, CD300A and HEPN1. Overall, this classification method allowed to discriminate the different TCGA glioma patients with very high performance, while seeking for common information across multiple data types, ultimately enabling the understanding of essential mechanisms driving glioma heterogeneity and unveiling potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Different strains of identical species can vary substantially in terms of their spectrum of biomedically relevant phenotypes. Reconstructing the genomes of a microbial community at strain level poses major methodical challenges, because relative frequencies of individual strains match the rate of sequencing errors, which hampers the identification of their characteristic genetic variants. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads are too short to span complex repetitive regions, the considerably longer third-generation sequencing (TGS) reads are affected by larger sequencing error rates or are just significantly more expensive. Suppressing TGS coverage to limit costs implies losses in terms of the accuracy of the assemblies. Therefore, existing approaches have remained fragmentary: all approaches presented so far agree on losses in strain awareness, accuracy, possibly excessive costs of the assemblies, or combinations thereof.\n\nWe present HyLight as, to the best of our knowledge, the first metagenome assembly approach that is not affected by any of the aforementioned drawbacks. In experiments, we demonstrate that HyLight assemblies are strain-aware, contiguous, contain little errors, and because operating on low coverage TGS data of the cheap kind, come at drastically reduced costs. HyLight implements hybrid assembly, which exploits the complementarity of TGS and NGS data. For unifying the two types of data, HyLight utilizes strain resolved overlap graphs (OG), which support the accurate reconstruction of the individual members of microbial communities at strain level: HyLight outperforms existing approaches in terms of strain identity preserving sequence by on average 25.53% (across all experiments / data sets: first quartile: 21.53%, median: 26.81%, third quartile: 31.98%), achieving near-complete strain awareness on many data sets. In summary, HyLight appears to implement the first protocol that delivers assemblies that are strain-aware, contiguous and accurate in combination.",

EnhancerTracker is trained, validated, and tested on 52,789 putative enhancers obtained from the FANTOM5 Project and control sequences derived from the human genome. Unlike available tools, which accept one sequence at a time, the input to our tool is three sequences; the first two are enhancers active in the same cell type. EnhancerTracker outputs 1 if the third sequence is an enhancer active in the same cell type(s) where the first two enhancers are active. It outputs 0 otherwise.

Trained on extensive data sources, including open-access publications, peer-reviewed research articles and biomedical websites, ChatGPT extracted information on gene relationships and biological pathways. However, a major challenge is model hallucination, i.e., high false positive rates. To assess and address this challenge, we systematically evaluated ChatGPTs capacity for predicting gene relationships using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Benchmarking against the KEGG Pathway Database as the ground truth, we experimented with diverse prompting strategies, targeting gene relationships of activation, inhibition, and phosphorylation. We introduced an innovative iterative prompt refinement technique. By assessing prompt efficacy using metrics like F-1 score, precision, and recall, GPT-4 was re-engaged to suggest improved prompts. A refined prompt, which combines a specialized role with explanatory text, significantly enhances the performance. Going beyond pairwise gene relationships, we also deciphered complex gene interplays, such as gene interaction chains and pathways pertinent to diseases like non-small cell lung cancer. Direct prompts showed limited success, but \"least-to-most\" prompting exhibited significant potentials for such network constructions.

    "abstract": "Clinical genomics sequencing is rapidly expanding the number of variants that need to be functionally elucidated. Interpreting genetic variants (i.e., mutations) usually begins by identifying how they affect protein-coding sequences. Still, the 3D protein molecule is rarely considered for large-scale variant analysis, nor for their effects on how proteins interact with each other and their environment. We propose a standardized approach to scoring protein surface property changes as a new dimension for functionally and mechanistically interpreting genomic variants. Further, it directs hypothesis generation for functional genomics research to learn more about the encoded proteins function. We developed a novel method leveraging 3D structures and time-dependent simulations to score and statistically evaluate protein surface property changes. We evaluated positive controls composed of 8 thermophilic versus mesophilic orthologs and variants that experimentally change protein solubility, which all showed large and statistically significant differences in charge distribution (p<0.01). We scored static 3D structures and dynamic ensembles for 43 independent variants (23 pathogenic and 20 uninterpreted) across four proteins. Focusing on the potassium ion channel, KCNK9, average local surface potential shifts were 0.41 kBT/ec with an average p-value of 1x10-2. In contrast, dynamic ensemble shifts averaged 1.15 kBT/ec and an average p-value of 1x10-5, enabling the identification of changes far from mutated sites. This study demonstrates that an objective assessment of how mutations affect electrostatic distributions of protein surfaces can aid in interpreting genomic variants discovered through clinical genomics sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) can make up more than 50% of any given vertebrates genome, with substantial variability in TE composition among lineages. TE variation is often linked to changes in gene regulation, genome size, and speciation. However, the role that genome duplication events have played in generating abrupt shifts in the composition of the mobilome over macroevolutionary timescales remains unclear. We investigated the degree to which the teleost genome duplication (TGD) shaped the diversification trajectory of the ray-finned fish mobilome. We integrate a new high coverage genome of Polypterus bichir with data from over 100 publicly available actinopterygian genomes to assess the macroevolutionary implications of genome duplication events on TE evolution. Our results provide no evidence for a substantial shift in mobilome composition following the TGD event. Instead, the diversity of the actinopterygian mobilome appears to have been shaped by a history of lineage specific shifts in composition that are not correlated with commonly evoked drivers of diversification such as body size, water column usage, or latitude. Collectively, these results provide a new perspective on the early diversification of the actinopterygian mobilome and suggest that historic ploidy events may not necessarily catalyze bursts of TE diversification and innovation.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow researchers to predict protein-lipid interaction sites and generate testable models. MD simulations are however computationally expensive and require specialist expertise. In this study, we demonstrate that graph neural networks trained on coarse-grained MD simulation data can predict phosphoinositide lipid interaction sites on Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain structures, a large family of membrane binding domains. The predictions are comparable to the results of simulations and require only seconds to compute. Comparison with experimental data shows that the model can predict known phosphoinositide interaction sites and can be used to form hypotheses for PH domains for which there is no experimental data. This model is a next generation tool for predicting protein-lipid interactions of PH domains and offers a basis for further development of models applicable to other membrane protein classes.",

    "abstract": "The human growth factor receptor MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell proliferation, migration, and survival. MET is also hijacked by the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Its invasion protein, internalin B (InlB), binds to MET and promotes the formation of a signaling dimer that triggers the internalization of the pathogen. Here, we use a combination of structural biology, modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and in situ single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments to elucidate the early events in MET activation by Listeria. Simulations show that InlB binding stabilizes MET in a conformation that promotes dimer formation. smFRET identifies the organization of the in situ signaling dimer. Further MD simulations of the dimer model are in quantitative agreement with smFRET. We accurately describe the structural dynamics underpinning an important cellular event and introduce a powerful methodological pipeline applicable to studying the activation of other plasma membrane receptors.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions lie at the center of much biology and are a challenge in formulating biological drugs such as antibodies. A key to mitigating protein association is to use small molecule additives, i.e. excipients that can weaken protein-protein interactions. Here, we develop a computationally efficient model for predicting the viscosity-reducing effect of different excipient molecules by combining atomic-resolution MD simulations, binding polynomials and a thermodynamic perturbation theory. In a proof of principle, this method successfully rank orders four types of excipients known to reduce the viscosity of solutions of a particular monoclonal antibody. This approach appears useful for predicting effects of excipients on protein association and phase separation, as well as the effects of buffers on protein solutions.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=68 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573113v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10fc9e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ee2b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c5fcc0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@154b5a6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

As it has been recently observed that the process of amyloid aggregation can take place within an intermediate liquid-like condensed phase, we investigated whether A{beta} could undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, and whether A{beta} amyloid aggregation could take place within A{beta} liquid condensates. By using a microfluidic protocol, we observed that the 40-residue form of A{beta} (A{beta}40) can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, and that accessing a liquid intermediate state enhances primary nucleation and enables A{beta}40 to readily self-assemble into amyloid fibrils.

    "abstract": "Auxetic structures are unique with a negative Poissons ratio. Unlike regular materials, they response to external loading with simultaneous expansion or compression in all directions, rendering powerful properties advantageous in diverse applications from manufacturing to space engineering. The auxetic behaviors are determined by structural design and architecture. Such structures have been discovered in natural crystals and demonstrated synthetically with bulk materials. Recent development of DNA-based structures has pushed the unit cell size to nanometer scale. DNA nanotechnology utilizes sequence complementarity between nucleotides. By combining sequence designs with programmable self-assembly, it is possible to construct complex structures with nanoscale accuracy and to perform dynamic reconfigurations. Herein, we report a novel design of auxetic nanostars with sliding behaviors using DNA origami. Our proposed structure, inspired by an Islamic pattern, demonstrates a unit cell with two distinct reconfigurations by programming directed sliding mechanisms. Compared to previous metamaterials, the DNA nanostars show an architecture with tunable auxetic properties for the first time. We envision that this strategy may form the basis of novel metastructures with adaptability and open new possibilities in bioengineering.",

    "abstract": "Avena Sativa phototropin 1 Light-oxygen-voltage 2 domain (AsLOV2) is the model protein of Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) superfamily, characterized by conformational changes in response to external environmental stimuli. This conformational change is initiated by the unfolding of the N-terminal helix in the dark state followed by the unfolding of the C-terminal helix. The light state is defined by the unfolded termini and the subsequent modifications in hydrogen bond patterns. In this photoreceptor, {beta}-sheets have been identified as crucial components for mediating allosteric signal transmission between the two termini. In this study, we combined microsecond all-atm molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling of conformational states to quantify molecular basis of mutation-induced allostery in the AsLOV2 protein. Through a combination of computational investigations, we determine that the H{beta} and I{beta} strands are the most critical structural elements involved in the allosteric mechanism. To elucidate the role of these {beta}-sheets, we introduced 13 distinct mutations (F490L, N492A, L493A, F494L, H495L, L496F, Q497A, R500A, F509L, Q513A, L514A, D515V, and T517V) and conducted comprehensive simulation analysis. The results highlighted the role of two hydrogen bond Asn482-Leu453 and Gln479-Val520 in the observed distinct behaviors of L493A, L496F, Q497A, and D515V mutants. The comprehensive atomistic-level analysis of the conformational landscapes revealed the critical functional role of {beta}-sheet segments in the transmission of the allosteric signal upon the photoactivation of the light state.",

To decipher the genes and pathways affected by -syn, we conducted an RNA sequencing analysis of human SK-MEL-28 cells and several SK-MEL-28 SNCA-KO clones. We identified 1098 significantly up-regulated genes and 660 significantly down-regulated genes. Several of the upregulated genes are related to the immune system, i.e., the inflammatory response and the matrisome. We validated five upregulated genes (IL-1y, SAA1, IGFBP5, CXCL8, and CXCL10) by RT-qPCR and detected IGFBP5 and IL-1y in spent media of control and SNCA-KO cells. The levels of each of these secreted proteins were significantly higher in the spent media of the SNCA-KO clones than control cells. We suggest that the loss of -syn expression unleashes chemokine/cytokine secretion, which could help melanoma cells evade the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with chronic multi-system bioenergetic stress that may be improved by increasing the number of healthy mitochondria available across organ systems. However, treatments capable of increasing mitochondrial content are generally limited to endurance exercise training paradigms, which are not always sustainable long-term, let alone feasible for many patients with obesity. Recent studies have shown that local transfer of exogenous mitochondria from healthy donor tissues can improve bioenergetic outcomes and alleviate the effects of tissue injury in recipients with organ specific disease. Thus, the aim of this project was to determine the feasibility of systemic mitochondrial transfer for improving energy balance regulation in the setting of diet-induced obesity. We found that transplantation of mitochondria from lean mice into mice with diet-induced obesity attenuated adiposity gains by increasing energy expenditure and promoting the mobilization and oxidation of lipids. Additionally, mice that received exogenous mitochondria demonstrated improved glucose uptake, greater insulin responsiveness, and complete reversal of hepatic steatosis. These changes were, in part, driven by adaptations occurring in white adipose tissue. Together, these findings are proof-of-principle that mitochondrial transplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for limiting the deleterious metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity in mice.",

    "abstract": "Breast-cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) poses a significant clinical challenge, resulting in an end-stage diagnosis and hindered by limited therapeutic options. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as an anatomical and physiological hurdle for therapeutic compounds, restricting the effective delivery of therapies to the brain. In order to grow and survive in a nutrient-poor environment, tumors in the brain must adapt to their metabolic needs, becoming highly dependent on acetate. These tumors rely on the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA by the enzyme Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), a key metabolic enzyme involved in regulating fatty acid synthesis and protein acetylation in tumor cells. ACSS2 has emerged as a crucial enzyme required for the growth of tumors in the brain. Here, we utilized a computational pipeline, combining pharmacophore-based shape screen methodology with ADME property predictions to identify novel brain-permeable ACSS2 inhibitors. From a small molecule library, this approach identified 30 potential ACSS2 binders, from which two candidates, AD-5584 and AD-8007, were validated for their binding affinity, predicted metabolic stability, and, notably, their ability to traverse the BBB. We show that treatment of BCBM cells, MDA-MB-231BR, with AD-5584 and AD-8007 leads to a significant reduction in lipid storage, reduction in colony formation, and increase in cell death in vitro. Utilizing an ex vivo orthotopic brain-slice tumor model, we show that treatment with AD-8007 and AD-5584 significantly reduces tumor size and synergizes with radiation in blocking BCBM tumor growth ex vivo. Importantly, we show that following intraperitoneal injections with AD-5584 and AD-8007, we can detect these compounds in the brain, confirming their BBB permeability. Thus, we have identified and validated novel ACSS2 inhibitor candidates for further drug development and optimization as agents for treating patients with breast cancer brain metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Here, we examine the impact of mechanosensitive ion channels on the durotaxis of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). PSCs are primarily responsible for producing the stiff tumor tissue in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Thereby, PSCs generate a stiffness gradient between the healthy pancreas and the tumor. This gradient induces durotaxis, a form of directional cell migration driven by differential stiffness. The molecular sensors behind durotaxis are still unclear. To investigate the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in PSC durotaxis, we established a two-dimensional linear stiffness gradient mimicking PDAC. Using pharmacological and genetic methods, we investigated the role of the ion channels Piezo1, TRPC1, and TRPV4 in durotaxis of primary murine PSCs. We found that PSCs migrate towards a stiffer substrate, which is abolished by clamping Piezo1 activity to zero (knockout) or to its maximal value (Piezo1 activator Yoda1). Hence, PSC durotaxis is optimal with an intermediary, dynamically changing level of Piezo1 channel activity. Based on these findings we developed and numerically discretized a mathematical model of partial differential equations to simulate PSC durotaxis, raising the possibility that PSC accumulation during PDAC progression is partly due to durotaxis. We extended our biological model to TRPV4 and TRPC1, key sensors, and signal transducers for mechanical forces in PSCs. Disrupting TRPC1 along with TRPV4 abolishes PSC durotaxis even when Piezo1 is functional. These findings suggest that mechanosensitive ion channels, particularly Piezo1, detect the mechanical microenvironment to guide PSC migration. Yet, Piezo1 relies on TRPC1 and TRPV4 to orchestrate durotaxis.\n\nSignificance StatementCells, located on a substrate of differential stiffness, move toward regions with higher stiffness in a process called durotaxis. The exact mechanisms of sensing the changes in environmental stiffness during durotaxis are unclear. This study shows that mechanosensitive ion channels are crucial sensors in pancreatic stellate cell durotaxis. Key ion channels involved in sensing and transducing mechanical cues in these cells include Piezo1, TRPV4, and TRPC1. We found that these ion channels need to be in an intermediary active state to guide durotaxis. This helps to understand pancreatic cancer pathophysiology better and highlights mechanosensitive ion channels as targets to affect durotaxis.",

Most of the 3,188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of CHEK2, however, have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein (CHK2). One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity. Here we tested all but two of the 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a novel high throughput technique. Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases.

    "abstract": "Testicular cancer is an increasing burden in modern societies and the most common malignancy among young adult males. Environment contaminants, especially endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC), may play a significant role in the development of these cancers through epigenetic alterations occurring during fetal and neonatal development. As long-term studies in humans and suitable experimental models with the potential to develop testicular cancer are lacking, no causal link can be established between endocrine disruptor exposure and testicular cancer incidence. Therefore, we developed an experimental model that recapitulates the differentiation of germ cells from primordial germ cells (pluripotency) into spermatocytes (meiosis) by using xenografted human fetal testis combined with germ cell transplantation into adult testis compartments. Using this model, we demonstrate that long-term fetal exposure (until 12 weeks) to a mixture of Di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) and Bisphenol A (BPA), two most prevalent plasticizers, could interfere with fetal germ cell differentiation, leading to carcinogenesis and seminomas. Transcriptome, methylome, and histological analyses reveal that BPA/DEHP exposure induced some significant hallmarks of germ cell tumors to occur: persistent pluripotent and proliferative germ cells, global hypomethylation of CpGs in germ cells, abnormal expression of meiotic markers and fibrotic signatures in fetal testis. Additionally, we found that EDC-exposed fetal germ cells were more likely to develop seminoma in a context that allows spermatogenesis to begin. This study proposes the first experimental evidence that EDC exposure can cause long-term, irreversible lesions in fetal germ cells, which then lead to testicular tumorigenesis in adults.",

    "abstract": "Loss of afferent auditory fiber function (cochlear synaptopathy) has been suggested to occur before a clinically measurable deterioration of subjective hearing threshold. This so-called \"hidden\" hearing loss is characterized by speech comprehension difficulties. We examined young, middle-aged, and older individuals with and without hearing loss using pure-tone (PT) audiometry, short-pulsed distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), auditory brainstem responses (ABR), auditory steady state responses (ASSR), speech comprehension (OLSA), and syllable discrimination in quiet and noise. After normalizing OLSA thresholds for PT thresholds (\"PNOT\"), differences in speech comprehension still remained and showed no significant dependence on age, allowing us to categorize participants into groups with good, standard, and poor speech comprehension. Listeners with poor speech comprehension in quiet exhibited smaller firing rate adaptions at stimulus onset (as measured by the difference between DPOAE threshold and pure-tone threshold) and delayed supra-threshold ABR waves I-V, suggesting high spontaneous rate low threshold fiber cochlear synaptopathy. In contrast, when speech comprehension was tested in noise, listeners with poor speech comprehension had larger DPOAEs acceptance rate, putatively resulting from altered basilar membrane compression (recruitment). This was linked with higher uncomfortable loudness levels and larger ASSR amplitudes. Moreover, performance in phoneme discrimination was significantly different below (/o/-/u/) and above the phase-locking limit (/i/-/y/), depending on whether vowels were presented in quiet or ipsilateral noise. This suggests that neural firing rate adaptation at stimulus onset is critical for speech comprehension, independent of hearing threshold and age, whereas the recruitment phenomenon counterbalances the loss in speech-in-noise discrimination due to impaired threshold.\n\nSignificance StatementAge-related hearing loss is the third largest modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. It has been suggested that the link between hearing loss and cognitive decline is not fully explained by hearing threshold loss. We here suggest that language comprehension deficits may be used as an early indication of future hearing loss and therefore cognitive decline. We found that, independent of age and pure-tone thresholds, speech comprehension in quiet and ipsilateral noise depend on different onset firing-rate adaptations of inner hair cells (measured by DPOAE threshold), along with cochlear synaptopathy of high spontaneous rate auditory nerve fibers and neural spiking synchronicity. These measures may be used as possible future indicators of risk for cognitive decline.",

Here, we use a whole-brain modeling approach to investigate these pathological alterations in neuronal activity. By fitting a Hopf whole-brain model to empirical functional connectivity, we demonstrate that phase correlations are largely determined by the ratio of interregional coupling strength and intraregional excitability. Furthermore, we observe considerable differences in interregional-versus-intraregional dynamics between glioma patients and healthy controls, both on an individual and population-based level. In particular, we show that local tumor pathology induces shifts in the global brain dynamics by promoting the contribution of interregional interactions.

    "abstract": "Understanding the immunological control of pathogens requires a detailed evaluation of the mechanistic contributions of individual cell types within the immune system. While knockout mouse models that lack certain cell types have been used to help define the role of those cells, the biological and physiological characteristics of mice do not necessarily recapitulate that of a human. To overcome some of these differences, studies often look towards nonhuman primates (NHPs) due to their close phylogenetic relationship to humans.\n\nTo evaluate the immunological role of select cell types, the NHP model provides distinct advantages since NHP more closely mirror the disease manifestations and immunological characteristics of humans. However, many of the experimental manipulations routinely used in mice (e.g., gene knock-out) cannot be used with the NHP model. As an alternative, the in vivo infusion of monoclonal antibodies that target surface proteins on specific cells to either functionally inhibit or deplete cells can be a useful tool. Such depleting antibodies have been used in NHP studies to address immunological mechanisms of action. In these studies, the extent of depletion has generally been reported for blood, but not thoroughly assessed in tissues.\n\nHere, we evaluated four depleting regimens that primarily target T cells in NHP: anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD8{beta}, and immunotoxin-conjugated anti-CD3. We evaluated these treatments in healthy unvaccinated and IV BCG-vaccinated NHP to measure the extent that vaccine-elicited T cells - which may be activated, increased in number, or resident in specific tissues - are depleted compared to resting populations in unvaccinated NHPs. We report quantitative measurements of in vivo depletion at multiple tissue sites providing insight into the range of cell types depleted by a given mAb. While we found substantial depletion of target cell types in blood and tissue of many animals, residual cells remained, often residing within tissue. Notably, we find that animal-to-animal variation is substantial and consequently studies that use these reagents should be powered accordingly.",

Microbial chondroitin-like polysaccharides emerged as a safer and more sustainable alternative source. However, chondroitin titers using either natural or recombinant microorganisms are still far from meeting the increasing demand. The use of genome-scale models and computational predictions can assist the design of microbial cell factories with possible improved titers of these value-added compounds. Genome-scale models have been used to predict genetic modifications in Escherichia coli engineered strains that would potentially lead to improved chondroitin production. Additionally, using synthetic biology approaches, a pathway for producing chondroitin has been designed and engineered in E. coli. Afterwards, the most promising mutants identified based on bioinformatics predictions were constructed and evaluated for chondroitin production in flask fermentation. This resulted in the production of 118 mg/L of extracellular chondroitin by overexpressing both superoxide dismutase (sodA) and a lytic murein transglycosylase (mltB). Then, batch and fed-batch fermentations at bioreactor scale were also evaluated, in which the mutant overexpressing mltB led to an extracellular chondroitin production of 427 mg/L and 535 mg/L, respectively. The computational approach herein described identified several potential novel targets for improved chondroitin biosynthesis, which may ultimately lead to a more efficient production of this glycosaminoglycan.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNowadays, the treatment of mitral valve prolapse involves two distinct repair techniques: chordal replacement (Neochordae technique) and leaflet resection (Resection technique). However, there is still a debate in the literature about which is the optimal one. In this context, we performed an image-based computational fluid dynamic study to evaluate blood dynamics in the two surgical techniques.\n\nMethodsWe considered a healthy subject (H) and two patients (N and R) who underwent surgery for the prolapse of the posterior leaflet and were operated with the Neochordae and Resection technique, respectively. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was employed with prescribed motion of the entire left heart coming from cine-MRI images, with a Large Eddy Simulation model to describe the transition to turbulence and a resistive method for managing valve dynamics. We created three different virtual scenarios where the operated mitral valves were inserted in the same left heart geometry of the healthy subject to study the differences attributed only to the two techniques.\n\nResultsWe compared the three scenarios by quantitatively analyzing ventricular velocity patterns and pressures, transition to turbulence, and the ventricle ability to prevent thrombi formation. From these results we found that both the operated cases were able to restore almost physiological blood dynamic conditions, with some differences due to the reduced mobility of the Resection posterior leaflet. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the Neochordae technique developed a slightly more physiological flow with respect to the Resection technique. The latter gave rise to a different direction of the mitral jet during diastole increasing the turbulence that is associated with ventricular effort and hemolysis, with also a larger ability to washout the ventricular apex preventing from thrombi formation.",

This representation captures not only structural features but energetic patterns of local and global residue fluctuations. The learnt representations are interpretable: they reveal similarities of binding patterns among antibodies targeting the same antigen type, and can be used to quantify the importance of antibody regions contributing to binding affinity.

Notably, pure RNA systems composed of RNA repeat sequences can phase separate and form liquid-like droplets. Significantly, such RNA tandem repeats have been implicated in several neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Thus, investigating the principles governing RNA repeat condensation can provide insights into RNA repeat expansion disorders. However, it is still challenging to characterize the microscopic structures and dynamics of RNA condensates. To address this, we have implemented and optimized a coarse-grained model to study the phase behavior of RNA. Our simulations reproduce key experimental findings on RNA-RNA phase separation. Importantly, we achieve multifold speed up in the simulation time compared to previous work. Leveraging this efficiency, we study the phase separation propensity of all 20 non-redundant trinucleotide repeat sequences. Our study aligns with findings from in vivo experiments, emphasizing that canonical base pairing and G-U wobble pairs play a dominant role in influencing the condensation of RNA repeat sequences and regulating the composition of ensuing condensates. Our implementation of this RNA model should make it feasible to efficiently probe sequence-phase behavior relationships for RNAs, and, when combined with coarse-grained protein models, elucidate the rules governing composition and dynamics of normal and aberrant biomolecular condensates.",

    "abstract": "Tight coordination of the spatial relationships between protein complexes is required for cellular function. In neuronal synapses, many proteins responsible for neurotransmission organize into subsynaptic nanoclusters whose trans-cellular alignment modulates synaptic signal propagation. However, the spatial relationships between these proteins and NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which are required for learning and memory, remain undefined. Here, we mapped the relationship of key NMDAR subunits to reference proteins in the active zone and postsynaptic density using multiplexed super-resolution DNA-PAINT microscopy. GluN2A and GluN2B subunits formed nanoclusters with diverse configurations that, surprisingly, were not localized near presynaptic vesicle release sites marked by Munc13-1. However, a subset of presynaptic sites was configured to maintain NMDAR activation: these were internally denser, aligned with abundant PSD-95, and associated closely with specific NMDAR nanodomains. This work reveals a new principle regulating NMDAR signaling and suggests that synaptic functional architecture depends on assembly of multiprotein nanodomains whose interior construction is conditional on trans-cellular relationships.",

However, individual responses to TSS vary, and often the muscle responses are insufficient to produce enough force for self-supported standing. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can activate individual muscles and assist in closing this functional gap, but it introduces questions regarding timing between modalities.\n\nMethodsTo assess the effects of TSS and FES on force generation, ten neurologically intact participants underwent (1) TSS only, (2) FES only, and (3) TSS + FES. TSS was delivered using four electrodes placed at T10-T11 through the L1-L2 intervertebral spaces simultaneously, while FES was delivered to the skin over the right knee extensors and plantarflexors. For all conditions, TSS and FES were delivered using three 0.5 ms biphasic square-wave pulses at 15 Hz. During the TSS + FES condition, timing between the two modalities was adjusted in increments of [1/4] time between pulses (16.5 ms).\n\nResultsWhen TSS preceded FES, a larger force production was observed. We also determined several changes in muscle activation amplitude at different relative stimulus intervals, which help characterize our finding and indicate the facilitating and inhibitory effects of the modalities.\n\nConclusionsUtilizing a delay ranging from 15 to 30 ms between stimuli resulted in higher mean force generation in both the knee and ankle joints, regardless of the selected FES location (Average; knee: 112.0%, ankle: 103.1%).",

Studying biobehavioral mechanisms in the species most closely related to humans can provide insights into the origins of human communication, and the impact of genetic variation on complex behavioral phenotypes. Here, we aimed to determine if bonobos (Pan paniscus) exhibit individual variation in FOXP2 and OXTR loci that have been associated with human social development and behavior. Although the ASD-related variants were reported in 13-41% of the human population, we did not find variation at these loci in our sample of 13 bonobos. However, we did identify a novel variant in bonobo FOXP2, as well as four novel variants in bonobo OXTR that were 17-184 base pairs from the human ASD variants. We also found the same linked, homozygous allelic combination across the 4 novel OXTR SNPs (homozygous TGTC) in 6 of the 13 bonobos, indicating that this combination may be under positive selection. When comparing the combined OXTR genotypes, we found significant group differences in social behavior; bonobos with zero copies of the TGTC combination were less social than bonobos with one copy of the TGTC combination. Taken together, our findings suggest that these OXTR variants may influence individual-level social behavior in bonobos and support the notion that linked genetic variants are promising risk factors for social communication deficits in humans.",

    "abstract": "The comprehension of phonemes is a fundamental component of speech processing which relies on both, temporal fine structure (TFS) and temporal envelope (TE) coding. EEG amplitude in response to phonemes has been identified as indicator of speech performance in hearing aid users. Presbyacusis may also alter neuro-electric responses to phonemes, even with minimally or unaffected hearing thresholds. Elevated speech reception thresholds (SRT) in absence of pure-tone threshold (PTT) elevation suggest central processing deficits. We therefore collected audiometric data (PTT, SRT) and EEG during passive listening in 80 subjects, ranging in age from 18 to 76 years. We confirm phoneme-evoked EEG response amplitude (PEA) as indicator of speech comprehension. Specifically, PEA decreased with elevated SRT, PTT and increased age. As novel observation, we report the temporal delay of phoneme-evoked EEG responses (PED) to increase with age and PTT. The absolute duration of PED, its age-correlation, and the lack of PEA-lateralization combined with the frequency of phoneme stimuli used here suggest a predominantly thalamic generator of phoneme-evoked EEG responses. Hearing loss in extended high-frequencies affects PED more than PEA. In our sample, neural compensation for increased PTT came at the cost of decreased temporal processing speed. Most importantly, PED correlates with SRT and explains SRT-variance in quiet and in ipsilateral noise that PTT cannot. PED was a better predictor of TFS coding in quiet and of TE coding in ipsilateral noise. As PED reflects both TFS and TE coding, thalamic activity may provide integrated information at the gate of neocortex.\n\nSignificance StatementIntact speech comprehension is essential for social participation which protects against depression and dementia. Age-related hearing loss is a growing problem in aging societies, as hearing deficits constitute the third most important modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. This work uses electrical brain responses to phonemes in a cohort covering age 18 to 76 years. As the temporal delay of phoneme responses showed the most significant correlations with age and high-frequency thresholds, we demonstrated that speed of neural processing seems essential for speech comprehension. The observed neural signals likely originate from thalamus which receives feedback from neocortex and is embedded in cognitive processing. Developing objective markers for speech processing is key for ensuring cognitive fitness in aging.",

    "abstract": "Seedlessness is a crucial quality trait in table grape (Vitis vinifera L.) breeding. However, the development of seeds involved intricate regulations, while the polygenic basis of seed abortion remains unclear. Here, we combine comparative genomics, population genetics, quantitative genetics, and integrative genomics to unravel the evolution and polygenic basis of seedlessness in grapes. We generated four haplotype-resolved telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes for two seedless grape cultivars,  Thompson Seedless (TS, syn.  Sultania) and  Black Monukka (BM). Comparative genomics identified a [~]4.25 Mb hemizygous inversion on Chr10 specific in seedless cultivars, with seedless-associated genes VvTT16 and VvSUS2 located at breakpoints. Population genomic analyses of 548 grapevine accessions revealed two distinct clusters of seedless cultivars, tracing the origin of the seedlessness trait back to  Sultania. Introgression, rather than convergent selection, shaped the evolutionary history of seedlessness in grape improvement. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis identified 110 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with 634 candidate genes, including novel candidate genes, such as three 11S GLOBULIN SEED STORAGE PROTEIN and two CYTOCHROME P450 genes, and well-known genes like VviAGL11. Integrative genomic analyses resulted in 339 core candidate genes categorized into 13 groups related to seed development. Machine learning based genomic selection achieved a remarkable 99% precision in predicting grapevine seedlessness. Our findings highlight the polygenic nature of seedless and provide novel candidate genes for molecular genetics and an effective prediction for seedlessness in grape genomic breeding.",

    "abstract": "Study questionCan single-nuclei and bulk RNA sequencing technologies be used to elucidate novel mechanisms of ovarian insufficiency in Turner Syndrome (TS)?\n\nSummary answerUsing single-nucleus and bulk RNA sequencing approaches, we identified novel potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying ovarian insufficiency in TS including and beyond X chromosome haploinsufficiency.\n\nWhat is known alreadyTurner syndrome (TS) is the most common genetic cause of Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) in humans. Morphological analyses of human fetal 45,X ovaries have demonstrated fewer germ cells and marked apoptosis established by 15-20 weeks post conception (wpc); however, we do not understand why POI develops mechanistically in the first instance.\n\nStudy design, size, durationSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq): two 46,XX and two 45,X (TS) human fetal ovaries at 12-13 wpc. Bulk RNA sequencing: 19 human fetal ovary, 20 fetal testis, and 8 fetal control tissue (n=47 total samples; Carnegie Stage 22-16wpc).\n\nParticipants/materials, setting, methodsTo identify novel potential mechanisms of ovarian insufficiency in TS and to characterise X chromosome gene expression in the 45,X ovary, we performed snRNA-seq of peri-meiotic 46,XX (n=2) and 45,X (n=2) fetal ovaries at 12-13 weeks post conception (wpc); and 2) a bulk RNA sequencing time-series analysis of fetal ovary, testis, and control samples across four developmental timepoints.\n\nMain results and the role of chanceGerm and somatic cell subpopulations were mostly shared across 46,XX and 45,X ovaries, aside from a 46XX-specific/45,X-depleted cluster of oogonia (\"synaptic oogonia\") containing genes with functions relating to sex chromosome synapsis; histone modification; intracellular protein regulation and chaperone systems. snRNA-seq enabled accurate cell counting localised to individual cell clusters; the 45,X ovary has fewer germ cells than the 46,XX ovary in every germ cell subpopulation, confirmed by histopathological analysis. The normal sequence of X-chromosome inactivation and reactivation is disrupted in 45,X ovaries; XIST was not expressed in 45,X somatic cells but was present in germ cell clusters, albeit with lower expression than in corresponding 46,XX clusters. The 45,X ovary has a globally abnormal transcriptome, with low expression of genes with proteostasis functions (RSP4X); cell cycle progression (BUB1B); and OXPHOS mitochondrial energy production (COX6C, ATP11C). Genes with higher expression in 45,X cell populations were enriched for apoptotic functions (e.g., NR4A1).\n\nLimitations, reasons for cautionLimitations include the relatively small sample size of the snRNA-seq analysis and the focus on a fixed meiotic timepoint which may overlook a dynamic process over time.\n\nWider implications of the findingsWe characterise the human fetal peri-meiotic 45,X ovary at single-cell resolution and offer insights into novel pathogenic mechanisms underlying ovarian insufficiency in TS. Although asynapsis due to X chromosome haploinsufficiency likely plays a significant role, these data suggest meiotic failure and ovarian insufficiency may be a combinatorial process characterised by periods of vulnerability throughout early 45,X germ cell development\n\nStudy funding/competing interest(s)This research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Wellcome Trust Grants 216362/Z/19/Z to SMcG-B and 209328/Z/17/Z to JCA.

    "abstract": "Pathological activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is among the most frequent defects in human cancer and is also the cause of rare overgrowth disorders. Yet, there is currently no systematic understanding of the quantitative flow of information within PI3K/AKT signaling and how it is perturbed by disease-causing mutations. Here, we develop scalable, single-cell approaches for systematic analyses of signal processing within the PI3K pathway, enabling precise calculations of its information transfer for different growth factors. Using genetically-engineered human cell models with allele dose-dependent expression of PIK3CAH1047R, we show that this oncogene is not a simple, constitutive pathway activator but a context-dependent modulator of extracellular signal transfer. PIK3CAH1047Rreduces information transmission downstream of IGF1 while selectively enhancing EGF-induced signaling and transcriptional responses. This leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, akin to \"blurred\" signal perception. The associated increase in signaling heterogeneity promotes phenotypic diversity in a human cervical cancer cell line model and in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Collectively, these findings and the accompanying methodological advances lay the foundations for a systematic mapping of the quantitative mechanisms of PI3K/AKT-dependent signal processing and phenotypic control in health and disease.\n\nOne-sentence summarySingle-cell signaling and information theoretic analyses reveal that oncogenic PI3K/AKT activation leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, context-dependent EGF response amplification as well as increased phenotypic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) methods have been developed to unlock molecular mechanisms underlying tissue development, homeostasis, or disease. However, there is a need for easy-to-use, high-resolution, cost-efficient, and 3D-scalable methods. Here, we report Open-ST, a sequencing-based, open-source experimental and computational resource to address these challenges and to study the molecular organization of tissues in 3D. In mouse brain, Open-ST captured transcripts at subcellular resolution and reconstructed cell types. In primary tumor and patient-matched healthy/metastatic lymph nodes, Open-ST captured the diversity of immune, stromal and tumor populations in space. Distinct cell states were organized around cell-cell communication hotspots in the tumor, but not the metastasis. Strikingly, the 3D reconstruction and multimodal analysis of the metastatic lymph node revealed spatially contiguous structures not visible in 2D and potential biomarkers precisely at the 3D tumor/lymph node boundary. We anticipate Open-ST to accelerate the identification of spatial molecular mechanisms in 2D and 3D.",

    "abstract": "Understanding variation in chromatin contact patterns across human populations is critical for interpreting non-coding variants and their ultimate effects on gene expression and phenotypes. However, experimental determination of chromatin contacts at a population-scale is prohibitively expensive. To overcome this challenge, we develop and validate a machine learning method to quantify the diversity 3D chromatin contacts at 2 kilobase resolution from genome sequence alone. We then apply this approach to thousands of diverse modern humans and the inferred human-archaic hominin ancestral genome. While patterns of 3D contact divergence genome-wide are qualitatively similar to patterns of sequence divergence, we find that 3D divergence in local 1-megabase genomic windows does not follow sequence divergence. In particular, we identify 392 windows with significantly greater 3D divergence than expected from sequence. Moreover, 26% of genomic windows have rare 3D contact variation observed in a small number of individuals. Using in silico mutagenesis we find that most sequence changes to do not result in changes to 3D chromatin contacts. However in windows with substantial 3D divergence, just one or a few variants can lead to divergent 3D chromatin contacts without the individuals carrying those variants having high sequence divergence. In summary, inferring 3D chromatin contact maps across human populations reveals diverse contact patterns. We anticipate that these genetically diverse maps of 3D chromatin contact will provide a reference for future work on the function and evolution of 3D chromatin contact variation across human populations.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese striped-necked turtle Mauremys sinensis was first reported in the wild in South Korea in 2012. Owing to its potential to hybridize with the native and endangered Mauremys reevesii in South Korea, leading to ecosystem disturbance, M. sinensis was designated as an ecosystem-disturbing species (EDS; hereafter) in 2020. Such hybridization between M. sinensis and M. reevesii has previously been reported in Taiwan. To protect and conserve the native South Korean M. reevesii population, the extent of its hybridization needed to be examined. Therefore, we developed novel high-resolution melting markers to elucidate the status of hybridization between Mauremys sinensis and Mauremys reevesii in South Korea. We identified the presence of M. sinensis, M. reevesii, and their hybrid across 47 sites in South Korea. Among these sites, five locations were confirmed as areas of sympatry for both M. sinensis and M. reevesii, with one hybrid individual identified at the Jeonju-si site. In total, hybrids were identified at four different sites. For more definitive species identification, blood samples were collected from the specimens and subjected to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and nuclear DNA (nDNA) R35 gene analysis, leading to the identification of two more hybrids from two other sites. To date, no hybrids of M. sinensis have been confirmed to reproduce in the wild, yet this requires further research for validation. The high-resolution melting (HRM) marker in the R35 gene developed in this study yielded three distinct curves that were designated as M. sinensis, M. reevesii, and M. sinensis x M. reevesii, aligning with those of the R35 gene sequencing. The novel markers developed in this study serve as a valuable tool that can be used in future research on rapid detection of hybridization.",

This study characterized the cold tolerance of two members of the Rhagoletis genus in Colorado, U.S.A. Pupae were collected from infested fruit in late summer and early fall. For the first time, we show that the rosehip fly Rhagoletis basiola is freeze-avoidant; overwintering pupae could supercool to temperatures as low as -26{degrees}C and survive. Interestingly, the temperature at which ice forms (supercooling point; SCP) did not vary between R. basiola at high (c. 2900 m above sea level) and lower (c. 1650 m a.s.l.) elevations. We also report the apple maggot Rhagoletis pomonella infesting an unusual host fruit, the Dolgo crabapple, in close proximity to infested hawthorn trees. R. pomonella infesting hawthorn fruits and crabapples had similar SCPs, and survived temperatures as low as -21{degrees}C. Pupae from both host fruits also survived prolonged exposure (2 weeks or more) to mild low temperatures (0 to -5{degrees}C). Further study into the mechanisms underlying the impressive and conserved cold tolerance of R. pomonella and R. basiola is an interesting avenue for future research.",

The brain must effectively process potential interactions between elements in such an environment to make appropriate decisions in critical situations. We trained male Long-Evans rats to discriminate static and dynamic visuospatial stimuli displayed on an inaccessible computer screen. We demonstrated that the rats learned to discriminate dynamic visuospatial stimuli faster, with greater accuracy and shorter reaction time than complementary static stimuli. Furthermore, we provide behavioral evidence indicating that rats internally represent dynamic environments as static maps that capture meaningful future interactions. These observations highlight the ecological importance of dynamic stimuli in the outside world and support previous findings in humans that internal static representations can encapsulate relevant spatiotemporal information of dynamic environments. Such a mechanism would allow animals and humans to process complex time-changing situations neatly.",
