    "abstract": "The octopus brain shows a robust hippocampal-like activity-dependent LTP, which is NMDA-independent, yet associative and presynaptically expressed and, as shown here, also independent of protein synthesis. Have the molecular mechanisms for mediating this LTP evolved independently or have they converged? Here we report on a distinctive adaptation of the nitric-oxide (NO) system for mediation of the octopus LTP. Unlike the suggested role of NO in LTP induction in the hippocampus, in octopus, inhibitors of NO-synthase (NOS) did not block LTP induction but either 1) reversibly  erased LTP expression, suggesting that a constitutive elevation in NO mediates the presynaptic LTP expression or 2)  reversed LTP induction and maintenance because a second LTP could be induced after inhibitor washout. We therefore propose a protein synthesis-independent  molecular-switch, whereby NO-dependent NOS reactivation maintains NOS in its active state. Thus, while the octopus LTP shows marked evolutionary convergence with LTP in vertebrates, an extreme molecular novelty has evolved to mediate it.",

    "abstract": "The sense of touch is conferred by the conjoint function of somatosensory neurons and skin cells. These cells meet across a gap filled by a basal lamina, an ancient structure found in metazoans. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that membrane-matrix complexes containing laminin, nidogen, and the MEC-4 mechano-electrical transduction channel reside at this interface and are instrumental for proper touch sensation. These complexes fail to coalesce in touch-insensitive extracellular matrix mutants and in dissociated neurons. MEC-4, but not laminin or nidogen, is destabilized by point mutations in the C-terminal Kunitz domain of the extracellular matrix component, MEC-1. Thus, neuron-epithelial cell interfaces are instrumental in mechanosensory complex assembly and function. Loss of nidogen reduces the density of mechanoreceptor complexes and the amplitude of the touch-evoked currents they carry. These findings imply that somatosensory neurons secrete proteins that actively repurpose the basal lamina to generate special-purpose mechanosensory complexes responsible for vibrotactile sensing.",

    "abstract": "During cell adhesion, integrins form clusters that transmit mechanical forces to the substrate (mechanotransduction) and regulate biochemical signaling depending on substrate stiffness. Studies on mechanotransduction significantly advanced our understanding of cell adhesion and were mostly performed on rigid substrates. In contrast to rigid substrates, integrins ligands on fluid supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) are mobile and adhesive complexes cannot serve as anchoring points promoting cell spreading. Here, we demonstrate that cells spread on SLBs coated with Invasin, a high-affinity integrin ligand. We show that in contrast to SLBs functionalized with RGD peptides, integrin clusters grow in size and complexity on Invasin-SLBs to a similar extent as on glass. While actomyosin contraction dominates adhesion maturation on stiff substrates, we find that integrin mechanotransduction and cell spreading on fluid SLBs rely on dynein pulling forces along microtubules perpendicular to membranes and microtubules pushing on adhesive complexes, respectively. These forces that may also occur on non-deformable surfaces are revealed in fluid substrate set ups. Our findings, supported by a theoretical model, demonstrate a new mechanical role for microtubules in integrin clustering.",

    "abstract": "The oscillatory nature of intrinsic brain networks is largely taken for granted in the systems neuroscience community. However, the hypothesis that brain rhythms--and by extension transient bursting oscillations--underlie functional networks has not been demonstrated per se. Electrophysiological measures of functional connectivity are indeed affected by the power bias, which may lead to artefactual observations of spectrally specific network couplings not genuinely driven by neural oscillations, bursting or not. We investigate this crucial question by introducing a unique combination of a rigorous mathematical analysis of the power bias in frequency-dependent amplitude connectivity with a neurobiologically informed model of cerebral background noise based on hidden Markov modeling of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). We demonstrate that the power bias may be corrected by a suitable renormalization depending nonlinearly on the signal-to-noise ratio, with noise identified as non-bursting oscillations. Applying this correction preserves the spectral content of amplitude connectivity, definitely proving the importance of brain rhythms in intrinsic functional networks. Our demonstration highlights a dichotomy between spontaneous oscillatory bursts underlying network couplings and non-bursting oscillations acting as background noise but whose function remains unsettled.\n\nSignificance statementBrain rhythms are paramount electrophysiological correlates of human cerebral activity as they coordinate neurons across distinct brain areas and establish neural synchronization. Spontaneous cortical oscillations, and particularly transient \"bursts\" of oscillations, also appear as the main electrophysiological subtrate of intrinsic functional brain networks. However, we argue that this oscillatory theory of brain networks, despite being widely accepted, should be requestioned due to a critical bias in electrophysiological measures of network connectivity. Here, we combined mathematical and neurobiological modeling techniques with magnetoencephalography recordings to set this theory on firm and rigorous grounds. Key to our analysis are scarcely studied non-bursting cortical oscillations. Although their precise function remains elusive, our results reveal that dissociating bursting and non-bursting oscillations is fundamental to the rigorous interpretation of electrophysiological network connectivity.",

While emerging light-field microscopy can mitigate this issue through threedimensionally capturing biological dynamics with merely single snapshot, it suffers from suboptimal resolution insufficient for resolving subcellular structures. Here we propose an adaptive light-field microscopy (VCD-LFM 2.0) with new optics-aware and adaptive-tuning deep learning strategies (VCD 2.0) capable for highly-generalizable light-field reconstruction of diverse subcellular dynamics. VCD-LFM 2.0 accomplishes isotropic spatial resolution down to 120 nm without compromising superior temporal resolution and low phototoxicity. With the development of a compact light-field add-on and an open-source reconstruction software, we realize rapid (up to 333 volumes per second), sustained (up to 60 hours) 3D super-resolution imaging of diverse intracellular dynamics simply on a retrofitted inverted microscope. With VCD-LFM 2.0 approach, we quantitatively analyze both the instantaneous processes of lysosome-mitochondrial interaction and long-term evolution of mitochondrial across two complete cell cycles.",

    "abstract": "Brain activity patterns are highly flexible and often complex, but also highly structured. Here we examined how fundamental properties of brain activity patterns relate to ongoing cognitive processes. To this end, we applied dimensionality reduction algorithms and pattern classifiers to functional neuroimaging data collected as participants listened to a story, temporally scrambled versions of the story, or underwent a resting state scanning session. These experimental conditions were intended to require different depths of processing and inspire different levels of cognitive engagement. We considered two primary aspects of the data. First, we treated the maximum achievable decoding accuracy across participants as an indicator of the \"informativeness\" of the recorded patterns. Second, we treated the number of features (components) required to achieve a threshold decoding accuracy as a proxy for the \"compressibility\" of the neural patterns (where fewer components indicate greater compression). Overall, we found that the peak decoding accuracy (achievable without restricting the numbers of features) was highest in the intact (unscrambled) story listening condition. However, the number of features required to achieve comparable classification accuracy was also lowest in the intact story listening condition. Taken together, our work suggests that our brain networks flexibly reconfigure according to ongoing task demands, and that the activity patterns associated with higher-order cognition and high engagement are both more informative and more compressible than the activity patterns associated with lower-order tasks and lower levels of engagement.\n\nSignificance StatementHow our brains respond to ongoing experiences depends on what we are doing and thinking about, among other factors. To study how brain activity reflects ongoing cognition, we examined two fundamental aspects of brain activity under different cognitive circumstances: informativeness and compressibility. Informativeness refers to the extent to which brain patterns are both temporally specific and consistent across different people. Compressibility refers to how robust the informativeness of brain patterns is to dimensionality reduction. Brain activity evoked by higher-level cognitive tasks are both more informative and more compressible than activity evoked by lower-level tasks. Our findings suggest that our brains flexibly reconfigure themselves to optimize different aspects of how they function according to ongoing cognitive demands.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are viscoelastic materials. Here, we report results from investigations into molecular-scale determinants of sequence-encoded and age-dependent viscoelasticity of condensates formed by prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs). The terminally viscous forms of PLCD condensates are Maxwell fluids. Measured viscoelastic moduli of these condensates are reproducible using a Rouse-Zimm model that accounts for the network-like organization engendered by reversible physical crosslinks among PLCDs in the dense phase. Measurements and computations show that the strengths of aromatic inter-sticker interactions determine the sequence-specific amplitudes of elastic and viscous moduli as well as the timescales over which elastic properties dominate. PLCD condensates also undergo physical aging on sequence-specific timescales. This is driven by mutations to spacer residues that weaken the metastability of terminally viscous phases. The aging of PLCD condensates is accompanied by disorder-to-order transitions, leading to the formation of non-fibrillar, beta-sheet-containing, semi-crystalline, terminally elastic, Kelvin-Voigt solids. Our results suggest that sequence grammars, which refer to the identities of stickers versus spacers in PLCDs, have evolved to afford control over the metastabilities of terminally viscous fluid phases of condensates. This selection can, in some cases, render barriers for conversion from metastable fluids to globally stable solids to be insurmountable on functionally relevant timescales.",

We present an extension of this theory to the aversive domain that explains why free-operant avoidance responding increases with both the experienced rate of negative reinforcement and the difference between this rate and that programmed by the avoidance schedule. The theory also assumes that the habitual component is reinforced by the acquisition of aversive inhibitory properties by the feedback stimuli generated by responding, which then act as safety signals that reinforce habit performance.

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome affects the health status of the host through complex interactions with the hosts intestinal wall. These host-microbiome interactions may spatially vary along the physical and chemical environment of the intestine, but these changes remain unknown. This study investigated these intricate relationships through a gene co-expression network analysis based on dual transcriptome profiling of different intestinal sites--cecum, transverse colon, and rectum-- of the primate common marmoset. We proposed a gene module extraction algorithm based on graph theory to find tightly interacting gene modules of the host and the microbiome from a vast co-expression network. The 27 gene modules identified by this method, which include both host and microbiome genes, not only produced results consistent with previous studies regarding the host-microbiome relationships, but also provided new insights into microbiome genes acting as potential mediators in host-microbiome interplays. Specifically, we discovered associations between the host gene FBP1, a cancer marker, and polysaccharide degradation-related genes (pfkA and fucI) coded by Bacteroides vulgatus, as well as relationships between host B-cell specific genes (CD19, CD22, CD79B, PTPN6) and a tryptophan synthesis gene (trpB) coded by Parabacteroides distasonis. Furthermore, our proposed module extraction algorithm surpassed existing approaches by successfully defining more functionally related gene modules, providing insights for understanding the complex relationship between the host and the microbiome.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe unveiled the intricate dynamics of the host-microbiome interactions along the intestinal tract by identifying closely interacting gene modules from a vast gene co-expression network, constructed based on simultaneous profiling of both host and microbiome transcriptomes. Our proposed gene module extraction algorithm, designed to interpret inter-species interactions, enabled the identification of functionally related gene modules encompassing both host and microbiome genes, which was challenging with conventional modularity maximization algorithms. Through these identified gene modules, we discerned previously unrecognized bacterial genes that potentially mediate in known relationships between host genes and specific bacterial species. Our findings underscore the spatial variations in host-microbiome interactions along the colon, rather than displaying a uniform pattern throughout the colon.",

    "abstract": "As the geographical distance between populations increases, populations are known to become more distant (dissimilar) in biological measures such as cranial shape. Relationships between geographical distance and biological distance are thought to be explained by modern humans having expanded from Africa. Expansion from Africa is also thought to explain why biological diversities (e.g., cranial shape diversity) decrease as geographical distance from Africa goes up. Research has suggested that modern humans expanded through different routes. If there were different routes, perhaps the relationship between geographical distance and cranial shape distance declines as the population (that distances are measured from) gets further away from Africa. This study used cranial shape measurements derived from the Howells data, and found that such a decline was suggested for males, unlike for females. It has been reasoned that variables which indicate the global expansion should signal an area of origin which is only in Africa. The relationship between geographical and cranial shape distances did not signal an exclusively African area. However, for males, the area was primarily in Africa. Overall, the relationship seemed to represent the expansion better amongst males than females. Congruently, cranial shape diversity declined more strongly for males than females as geographical distance from Africa accrued. To estimate which area of Africa the global expansion originated in, previous research pooled an estimate from genetic diversities, and suggested a southern origin. This estimate was supported when adding cranially-derived variables to the pooling, including the relationship between geographical distance and male cranial shape distance.",

    "abstract": "Spermiogenesis is a critical, post-meiotic phase of male gametogenesis, in which the proper gene expression is essential for sperm maturation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism that controls mRNA expression in the round spermatids remains elusive. Here, we identify that FBXO24, an orphan F-box protein, is highly expressed in the testis of humans and mice and interacts with the splicing factors (SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9) to modulate the gene alternative splicing in the round spermatids. Genetic mutation of FBXO24 in mice causes many abnormal splicing events in round spermatids, thus affecting a large number of critical genes related to sperm formation that were dysregulated. Further molecular and phenotypical analyses revealed that FBXO24 deficiency results in aberrant histone retention, incomplete axonemes, oversized chromatoid body (CB), and abnormal mitochondrial coiling along sperm flagella, ultimately leading to male sterility. In addition, we discovered that FBXO24 interacts with MIWI and SCF subunits and mediates the degradation of MIWI via K48-linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, we show that FBXO24 depletion could lead to aberrant piRNA production in testes, which suggests FBXO24 is required for normal piRNA counts. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FBXO24 is essential for sperm formation and piRNA production by regulating mRNA alternative splicing and MIWI degradation during spermiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "While machine learning (ML) research has recently grown more in popularity, its application in the omics domain is constrained by access to sufficiently large, high-quality datasets needed to train ML models. Federated Learning (FL) represents an opportunity to enable collaborative curation of such datasets among participating institutions. We compare the simulated performance of several models trained using FL against classically trained ML models on the task of multi-omics Parkinsons Disease prediction. We find that FL model performance tracks centrally trained ML models, where the most performant FL model achieves an AUC-PR of 0.876 {+/-} 0.009, 0.014 {+/-} 0.003 less than its centrally trained variation. We also determine that the dispersion of samples within a federation plays a meaningful role in model performance. Our study implements several open source FL frameworks and aims to highlight some of the challenges and opportunities when applying these collaborative methods in multi-omics studies.\n\nThe Bigger PictureThe wide-scale application of artificial intelligence and computationally intensive analytical approaches in the biomedical and clinical domain is largely restricted by access to sufficient training data. This data scarcity exists due to the isolated nature of biomedical and clinical institutions, mandated by patient privacy policies in the health system or government legislation. Federated Learning (FL), a machine learning approach that facilitates collaborative model training is a promising strategy to address these restrictions. Therefore, understanding the limitations of cooperatively trained FL models, and their performance differences to similar, centrally trained models, is crucial to valuing their implementation in the broader biomedical research community.",

    "abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics induce altered states of consciousness and have shown potential in treating a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and addiction. Yet their modes of action are currently not fully understood. Here, we provide three systematic reviews and meta-analyses of three hierarchical levels relevant to the effects of psychedelics, i.e., 1) subjective experience (phenomenology), 2) whole-brain neuroimaging and 3) molecular pharmacology. Phenomenologically, medium and high doses of LSD yield significantly higher ratings of visionary restructuralisation than psilocybin on the 5- dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Scale. Our neuroimaging results reveal that psychedelics significantly strengthen between-network functional connectivity (FC) while diminishing within-network FC. Pharmacologically, we found no significant between-drug differences in the selectivity of psychedelics for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, or D2 receptors, relative to the 5-HT1A receptor, but we did observe that LSD induces significantly more inositol phosphate formation at the 5-HT2A receptor than DMT and psilocin. Our meta-analyses link each of the classic psychedelics - DMT, LSD, and psilocybin - to specific neural fingerprints at each level of the tripartite hierarchy. The results show a highly non-linear relationship between these fingerprints. Overall, the results point to the need for standardising experimental procedures and analysis techniques, as well as for more research on the emergence between different levels of psychedelic effects. Future work could use our tripartite hierarchy framework to investigate the dose- dependent effects of different psychedelics in the same participants.",

    "abstract": "For many viruses, narrow bottlenecks acting during transmission sharply reduce genetic diversity in a recipient host relative to the donor. Since genetic diversity represents adaptive potential, such losses of diversity are though to limit the opportunity for viral populations to undergo antigenic change and other adaptive processes. Thus, a detailed picture of evolutionary dynamics during transmission is critical to understanding the forces driving viral evolution at an epidemiologic scale. To advance this understanding, we used a novel barcoded virus library and a guinea pig model of transmission to decipher where in the transmission process diversity is lost for influenza A viruses. In inoculated guinea pigs, we show that a high level of viral genetic diversity is maintained across time. Continuity in the barcodes detected furthermore indicates that stochastic effects are not pronounced within inoculated hosts. Importantly, in both aerosol-exposed and direct contact-exposed animals, we observed many barcodes at the earliest time point(s) positive for infectious virus, indicating robust transfer of diversity through the environment. This high viral diversity is short-lived, however, with a sharp decline seen 1-2 days after initiation of infection. Although major losses of diversity at transmission are well described for influenza A virus, our data indicate that events that occur following viral transfer and during the earliest stages of natural infection have a predominant role in this process. This finding suggests that immune selection may have greater opportunity to operate during influenza A transmission than previously recognized.",

    "abstract": "In birds and insects, females uptake sperm for a specific duration post-copulation known as the ejaculate holding period (EHP) before expelling unused sperm and the mating plug through sperm ejection. Our study uncovered that encountering males or mated females after mating substantially shortens EHP, a phenomenon we term  male-induced EHP shortening (MIES). MIES requires Or47b+ olfactory and ppk23+ gustatory neurons, activated by 2-methyltetracosane and 7-Tricosene, respectively. These odorants raise cAMP levels in pC1 neurons, responsible for processing male courtship and regulating female mating receptivity. Elevated cAMP levels in pC1 neurons reduce EHP and reinstate their responsiveness to male courtship cues, promoting re-mating with faster sperm ejection. This study establishes MIES as a genetically tractable model of sexual plasticity with a conserved neural mechanism.\n\nSignificance StatementSexual plasticity, adapting reproductive behaviors to social changes, was explored in the fruit fly, a genetically tractable model insect. Findings revealed that inseminated females, encountering another courting male post-mating, shorten the ejaculate holding period (EHP). Specific olfactory and gustatory pathways regulating this phenomenon were identified, converging on the pC1 neurons in the brain-a conserved neural circuit regulating female mating activity. Odors associated with EHP shortening increased the second messenger cAMP. The elevated cAMP transiently heightened the excitability of pC1 neurons, enabling inseminated females to promptly remove the male ejaculate and engage in the subsequent mating more readily. This study establishes a behavioral model for sexual plasticity and provide a framework for understanding the involved neural processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimer pathology (AD) is accompanied by the deposition of amyloid beta (A{beta}) and chronic neuroinflammation, where NLRP3 inflammasome is particularly involved. In this study, we found that the OCD drug fluvoxamine maleate (FXN) can potently ameliorate AD pathology in 5XFAD mice by autophagy-mediated clearance of A{beta} and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nMethodsWe used mice primary astrocytes to establish the mechanism of action of FXN against NLRP3 inflammasome by using various techniques like ELISA, Western blotting, confocal microscopy, Immunofluorescence, etc. The validation of the anti-AD activity of FXN was done in transgenic 5XFAD mice after two months of treatment followed by behavior analysis and studying inflammatory and autophagy proteins along with immunohistochemistry analysis for A{beta} load in the hippocampi.\n\nResultsOur data showed that FXN induces autophagy to inhibit NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 inflammasome at a low concentration of 78 nM apart from directly inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in primary astrocytes. FXN activated the PRKAA2 pathway through CAMKK2 signaling, which led to the induction of autophagy in primary astrocytes. FXN inhibited the ATP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome through autophagic degradation of NF-{kappa}B and thus caused the downregulation of pro-IL-1{beta} and NLRP3. The anti-NLRP3 inflammasome effect of FXN was reversed when autophagy was inhibited either by genetic knockdown of the PRKAA2 pathway or by bafilomycin A1.\n\nFurthermore, FXN treatment led to improved AD pathology in 5XFAD mice, which displayed a significant improvement in multiple behavior parameters like working memory and neuromuscular coordination and they behaved more like wild-type animals. We found that FXN improved behavior in 5XFAD mice by clearing the A{beta} deposits from the hippocampi along with a significant reduction in multiple inflammatory proteins, including NF-{kappa}B, GFAP, IBA1, IL-1{beta}, TNF-, and IL-6 associated with NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 inflammasome in the brain. Moreover, these changes were accompanied by increased expression of autophagic proteins.\n\nConclusionOur data suggest that to ameliorate AD pathology, FXN simultaneously targets two key pathological features of AD that is A{beta} deposits and neuroinflammation. Being an approved drug, FXN can be pushed as a potential drug candidate for human studies against AD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPreeclampsia (PE) is one hypertensive disorder and a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity during human pregnancy. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor, which regulates vascular functions. Exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands can induce hypertension in animals. However, if dysregulation of endogenous AhR ligands contributes to the pathophysiology of PE remains elusive.\n\nMethodsWe measured AhR activities in human maternal and umbilical vein sera. We also applied physiological, cellular, and molecular approaches to dissect the role of endogenous AhR ligands in vascular functions during pregnancy using pregnant rats and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as models.\n\nResultsPE elevated AhR activities in human umbilical vein sera. Exposure of pregnant rats to an endogenous AhR ligand, 2-(1H-indole-3-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE) increased blood pressure and proteinuria, while decreased uteroplacental blood flow and reduced fetal and placental weights, all of which are hallmarks of PE. ITE dampened vascular growth and fetal sex-specifically altered immune cell infiltration in rat placentas. ITE also decreased cell proliferation and cell monolayer integrity in HUVECs in vitro. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ITE dysregulated transcriptome in rat placentas and HUVECs in a fetal sex-specific manner. Bottom-up phosphoproteomics showed that ITE disrupted phosphoproteome in HUVECs. These ITE-dysregulated genes and phosphoproteins were enriched in biological functions and pathways which are highly relevant to diseases of heart, liver, and kidney, vascular functions, inflammation responses, cell death, and kinase inhibition.\n\nConclusionsDysregulation of endogenous AhR ligands during pregnancy may lead to the development of PE with underlying impaired vascular functions, fetal sex-specific immune cell infiltration and transcriptome, and phosphoproteome. Thus, this study has provided a novel mechanism for the development of PE and potentially other forms of hypertensive pregnancies. These AhR ligand-activated genes and phosphoproteins might represent promising therapeutic and fetal sex-specific targets for PE-impaired vascular functions.",

    "abstract": "Pathological activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is among the most frequent defects in human cancer and is also the cause of rare overgrowth disorders. Yet, there is currently no systematic understanding of the quantitative flow of information within PI3K/AKT signaling and how it is perturbed by disease-causing mutations. Here, we develop scalable, single-cell approaches for systematic analyses of signal processing within the PI3K pathway, enabling precise calculations of its information transfer for different growth factors. Using genetically-engineered human cell models with allele dose-dependent expression of PIK3CAH1047R, we show that this oncogene is not a simple, constitutive pathway activator but a context-dependent modulator of extracellular signal transfer. PIK3CAH1047Rreduces information transmission downstream of IGF1 while selectively enhancing EGF-induced signaling and transcriptional responses. This leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, akin to \"blurred\" signal perception. The associated increase in signaling heterogeneity promotes phenotypic diversity in a human cervical cancer cell line model and in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Collectively, these findings and the accompanying methodological advances lay the foundations for a systematic mapping of the quantitative mechanisms of PI3K/AKT-dependent signal processing and phenotypic control in health and disease.\n\nOne-sentence summarySingle-cell signaling and information theoretic analyses reveal that oncogenic PI3K/AKT activation leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, context-dependent EGF response amplification as well as increased phenotypic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have established that de novo genes, evolving from non-coding sequences, enhance protein diversity through a stepwise process. However, the pattern and rate of their structural evolution over time remain unclear. Here, we addressed these issues within a short evolutionary timeframe ([~]1 million years for 97% of rice de novo genes). We found that de novo genes evolve faster than gene duplicates in the intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs, such as random coils), secondary structural elements (such as -helix and {beta}-strand), hydrophobicity, and molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Specifically, we observed an 8-14% decay in random coils and IDR lengths per million years per protein, and a 2.3-6.5% increase in structured elements, hydrophobicity, and MoRFs. These patterns of structural evolution align with changes in amino acid composition over time. We also revealed significantly higher positive charges but smaller molecular weights for de novo proteins than duplicates. Tertiary structure predictions demonstrated that most de novo proteins, though not typically well-folded on their own, readily form low-energy and compact complexes with extensive residue contacts and conformational flexibility, suggesting \"a faster-binding\" scenario in de novo proteins to promote interaction. Our findings illuminate the rapid evolution of protein structure in the early life of de novo proteins in rice genome, originating from noncoding sequences, highlighting their quick transformation into active, complex-forming components within a remarkably short evolutionary timeframe.",

    "abstract": "The precise regulation of Ca2+ signals plays a crucial role in the physiological functions of neurons. Here, we investigated the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on Ca2+ signals in hippocampal neurons. In cultured hippocampal neurons, glucocorticoids inhibited the spontaneous somatic Ca2+ spikes generated by Kv2.1-organized Ca2+ microdomains. Furthermore, glucocorticoids rapidly reduced the cell surface expressions of Kv2.1 and CaV1.2 channels in hippocampal neurons. In HEK293 cells transfected with Kv2.1 alone, glucocorticoids significantly reduced the surface expression of Kv2.1 with little effect on K+ currents. Glucocorticoids inhibited CaV1.2 currents but had no effect on the cell surface expression of CaV1.2 in HEK293 cells transfected with CaV1.2 alone. Notably, in the presence of wild-type Kv2.1, glucocorticoids caused a decrease in the surface expression of CaV1.2 channels in HEK293 cells. However, this effect was not observed in the presence of non-clustering Kv2.1S586A mutant channels. Live cell imaging showed that glucocorticoids rapidly decreased Kv2.1 clusters on the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, western blot results indicated a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of Kv2.1, suggesting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 clusters. Glucocorticoids rapidly decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration and the phosphorylation level of PKA in hippocampal neurons. The PKA inhibitor H89 mimicked the effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.1, while the PKA agonist forskolin abrogated the effect. In conclusion, glucocorticoids rapidly regulate CaV1.2-mediated Ca2+ signals in hippocampal neurons by promoting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 channel clusters through reducing PKA activity.\n\nSignificance StatementThe rapid non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids on the central nervous system is not fully understood. CaV1.2-mediated Ca2+ signaling microdomains control somatic Ca2+ signals and regulate excitation-transcription coupling in hippocampal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that glucocorticoids rapidly inhibit CaV1.2-mediated somatic Ca2+ spikes in hippocampal neurons. Glucocorticoids reduce the surface expression of Kv2.1 clusters but do not affect the surface expression of non-clustering Kv2.1. Moreover, glucocorticoids induce the endocytosis of CaV1.2 channels through wild-type Kv2.1. However, glucocorticoids cannot induce the endocytosis of CaV1.2 channels through Kv2.1S586A mutant channels, which cannot form clusters. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay between glucocorticoids, Kv2.1 channels, and CaV1.2 channels, unraveling a dual mechanism that influences both overall Ca2+ signaling and the intricate organization of neural microdomains.",

These cells are typically quiescent but become activated upon muscle injury, transitioning from proliferation to differentiation. Myogenic regulatory factors, including myoblast determination protein 1 (MyoD), regulate the fate transition of MuSCs. However, the role of MYOD in this process is not yet clear. Using previously established MyoD knock-in (MyoD-KI) mice, we revealed that MyoD targets dual-specificity phosphatase (Dusp) 13 and Dusp27. In Dusp13:Dusp27 double knock-out (DKO) mice, the ability for muscle regeneration after injury was found to be reduced. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing of MyoD-high expressing MuSCs from MyoD-KI mice revealed that Dusp13 and Dusp27 are only expressed in specific populations within MyoD-high MuSCs, which also express Myogenin. Overexpressing Dusp13 in MuSCs causes premature muscle differentiation.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes must balance the need for gene transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) against the danger of mutations caused by transposable element (TE) proliferation. In plants, these gene expression and TE silencing activities are divided between different RNA polymerases. Specifically, RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), which evolved from Pol II, transcribes TEs to generate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide DNA methylation and block TE transcription by Pol II. While the Pol IV complex is recruited to TEs via SNF2-like CLASSY (CLSY) proteins, how Pol IV partners with the CLSYs remains unknown. Here we identified a conserved CYC-YPMF motif that is specific to Pol IV and is positioned on the complex exterior. Furthermore, we found that this motif is essential for the co-purification of all four CLSYs with Pol IV, but that only one CLSY is present in any given Pol IV complex. These findings support a \"one CLSY per Pol IV\" model where the CYC-YPMF motif acts as a CLSY-docking site. Indeed, mutations in and around this motif phenocopy pol iv null mutants. Together, these findings provide structural and functional insights into a critical protein feature that distinguishes Pol IV from other RNA polymerases, allowing it to promote genome stability by targeting TEs for silencing.",

    "abstract": "The endosperm in cereal grains is instrumental in determining grain yield and seed quality, as it controls the production of starch and protein. In this study, we identified a specific TaNF-Y trimeric complex, consisting of TaNF-YA3-D, TaNF-YB7-B, and TaNF-YC6-B, exhibiting robust expression within endosperm during grain filling stage in wheat. Knock-down of either TaNF-YA3 or TaNF-YC6 led to less starch but more gluten proteins. Detailed analyses have unveiled that the TaNF-Y indirectly boosts starch biosynthesis genes by reducing TaNAC019, a repressor of TaAGPS1a, TaSuS2, thereby regulating starch biosynthesis. Conversely, the TaNF-Y directly inhibits the expression of gliadin and low molecular weight (LMW)-GS coding genes, including TaGli-{gamma}-700 and TaLMW-400. Furthermore, the TaNF-Y components interact with TaSWN, the histone methyltransferase subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), to repress the expression of TaNAC019, TaGli-{gamma}-700, and TaLMW-400 through H3K27me3 modification. Notably, weak mutation of TaFIE, core subunit of PRC2, has reduced starch but elevated gliadin and LMW-GS levels. Intriguingly, DNA variations of TaNF-Y components are widely associated with seed developmental traits. In particular, variation within the coding region of TaNF-YB7-B is linked to differences in starch and protein content. Distinct haplotypes of TaNF-YB7-B affect its interaction with TaSWN, influencing the repression of targets like TaNAC019 and TaGli-{gamma}-700. Our findings illuminate the intricate molecular mechanisms governing epigenetic regulation by the TaNF-Y-PRC2 for wheat endosperm development. Manipulating the TaNF-Y complex holds potential for optimizing grain yield and enhancing quality.",

Profiling and quantitative analysis of the bioactive metabolites would evaluate if they can be natural sources. This study is focused on comprehensive profiling of secondary metabolites in the petals of Red and Pink Rhododendron flowers (R. arboreum and R. campanulatum) using Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS/MS) and Proton-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) Spectroscopy. The profiling highlighted the presence of secondary metabolites belonging to phenolic acids and flavonoids. Specifically, the flowers are rich in promising bioactive molecules such as quinic acid, chlorogenic acid (3-O-caffeoyl quinic acid), protocatechuic acid, coumaroyl quinic acids, catechin, epigallocatechin, and shikimic acid. The profiles are correlated with the metabolic pathways which reflected the activity of shikimic acid, phenolic acid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. These metabolites are well reported for their bioactive potential as anti-oxidative, anti-viral, anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, etc. While the quantitative and multivariate analysis showed variations in the levels of phenolic acids and flavonoids, it is established that red and pink Rhododendron flower petals are a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals of interest to the phytochemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "The fight against COVID-19 pandemic has gained a strong consensus about the importance of developing mRNA vaccines to rapidly respond to an outbreak. Several studies have shown that mRNA vaccines formulated as mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for vaccination can elicit a robust and efficient immune response. In this study, we report the preparation of mRNA-bifunctional lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-BLNPs) as vaccines for targeted delivery to dendritic cells (DCs) to improve safety and enhance immune response. Using this DC-targeted delivery system, mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA-BLNP vaccine elicited a stronger immune response with higher titer of neutralizing IgG antibody response than the LNPformulated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the spike mRNA-BLNP vaccine with deletion of glycosites in the stem elicited a broadly protective immune response against SARS-CoV2 and variants. These findings suggest the importance and potential of developing DC-targeted mRNA vaccines to elicit broadly protective immune responses against human viruses.",

    "abstract": "ex vivo physiological experiments using small insect models such as Drosophila larvae have become increasingly useful to address fundamental biological questions. To perform such experiments, various artificial saline solutions have been developed, but their osmolality varies significantly from one to the next. Such a variation of osmolality stems, in part, from the difficulty of determining the true value of haemolymph osmolality in Drosophila larvae. Thus, there is a pressing need to refine protocols for collecting and measuring the osmolality of the larval haemolymph. Two major obstacles are thought to impede the accurate analysis of haemolymph collected from small insects: melanin formation and gut-derived contamination. Here, we greatly refined existing haemolymph collecting methods, evaluated the purity of the collected haemolymph under melanin-free conditions, and concluded that the true value of haemolymph osmolality is close to 306.0 mOsm kg-1 in Drosophila larvae.",

TMEM41B, an ER-resident membrane protein previously known for its crucial roles in autophagy, lipid scrabbling and viral infections, is identified as a novel type of concentration-dependent ER Ca2+ release channel. Ablation of TMEM41B induces ER Ca2+ overload, triggering the upregulation of IL-2 and IL-7 receptors in naive T cells. Consequently, this leads to increased basal signaling of the JAK-STAT, AKT-mTOR, and MAPK pathways, propelling TMEM41B-deficient naive T cells into a metabolically activated yet immunologically naive state. ER Ca2+ overload also downregulates CD5, a suppressor of TCR signaling, thereby reducing the activation threshold of TMEM41B-deficient T cells, resulting in attenuated tolerance and heightened T cell responses during infections. In summary, TMEM41B-mediated ER Ca2+ release is a pivotal determinant governing metabolic quiescence and responsiveness of naive T cells.",

    "abstract": "The maturation of HIV-1 virions is a crucial process in viral replication. Although T cells are a primary source of virus production, much of our understanding of virion maturation comes from studies using the HEK293T human embryonic kidney cell line. Notably, there is a lack of comparative analyses between T cells and HEK293T cells in terms of virion maturation efficiency in existing literature. We previously developed an advanced virion visualization system based on the FRET principle, enabling the effective distinction between immature and mature virions via fluorescence microscopy. In this study, we utilized pseudotyped, single-round infectious viruses tagged with FRET labels (HIV-1 Gag-iFRET{Delta}Env) derived from Jurkat (a human T lymphocyte cell line) and HEK293T cells to evaluate their virion maturation rates. HEK293T-derived virions demonstrated a maturity rate of 81.79%, consistent with other studies and our previous findings. However, virions originating from Jurkat cells demonstrated a significantly reduced maturation rate of 68.67% (p < 0.0001). Correspondingly, viruses produced from Jurkat cells exhibited significantly reduced infectivity compared to those derived from HEK293T cells, with the relative infectivity measured at 65.3%. This finding is consistent with the observed relative maturation rate of viruses produced by Jurkat cells. These findings suggest that initiation of virion maturation directly correlates with viral infectivity. Our observation highlights the dynamic nature of virus-host interactions and their implications for virion production and infectivity.",

This work is focused on the role of the microbiome in understanding a rarely investigated environmental involvement in schizophrenia (SZ), especially in relation to brain circuit dysfunction. We leveraged high throughput microbial 16s rRNA sequencing and functional neuroimaging techniques to enable the delineation of microbiome-brain network links in SZ. N=213 SZ and healthy control (HC) subjects were assessed for the oral microbiome. Among them, 139 subjects were scanned by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to derive brain functional connectivity. We found a significant microbiome compositional shift in SZ beta diversity (weighted UniFrac distance, p= 6x10-3; Bray-Curtis distance p = 0.021). Fourteen microbial species involving pro-inflammatory and neurotransmitter signaling and H2S production, showed significant abundance alterations in SZ. Multivariate analysis revealed one pair of microbial and functional connectivity components showing a significant correlation of 0.46. Thirty five percent of microbial species and 87.8% of brain functional network connectivity from each component also showed significant differences between SZ and HC with strong performance in classifying SZ from HC, with an area under curve (AUC) = 0.84 and 0.87, respectively. The results suggest a potential link between oral microbiome dysbiosis and brain functional connectivity alteration in relation to SZ, possibly through immunological and neurotransmitter signaling pathways and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, supporting for future work in characterizing the role of oral microbiome in mediating effects on SZ brain functional activity.",

    "abstract": "Sustained community spread of influenza viruses relies on efficient person-to-person transmission. Current experimental transmission systems do not mimic environmental conditions (e.g., air exchange rates, flow patterns), host behaviors or exposure durations relevant to real-world settings. Therefore, results from these traditional systems may not be representative of influenza virus transmission in humans. To address this pitfall, we developed a modified, more realistic transmission setup and used it to investigate the impact of ventilation rates on transmission in a close-range, play-based scenario. In this setup, four immunologically naive recipient ferrets were exposed to a donor ferret infected with a genetically barcoded 2009 H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09) for four hours. The ferrets interacted in a shared space that included toys, similar to a child care setting. The transmission efficiency was determined under conditions of low and high ventilation rates; air exchange rates of [~] 1.3 hr-1 and 23 hr-1, respectively. Despite the large difference in ventilation rate, transmission efficiency was the same, 50% in two independent replicate studies. The presence of infectious virus or viral RNA on surfaces and in air throughout the exposure area was similar regardless of ventilation rate. While high viral genetic diversity in donor ferret nasal washes was maintained during infection, recipient ferret nasal washes displayed low diversity, revealing a narrow transmission bottleneck regardless of ventilation rate. Our findings indicate that in exposures characterized by frequent close-range, play-based interactions and the presence of fomites, ventilation does not significantly impact transmission efficiency.\n\nSignificanceImproved ventilation in building has the potential to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses, but its effect in different settings is not well understood. We developed a novel system to study influenza virus transmission in the ferret animal model in an environment that mimics a child care center. We demonstrate that increased ventilation is not effective at disrupting transmission in this setting, suggesting that transmission occurs mainly at close-range or via fomites. Multiple interventions are needed to reduce the spread of influenza virus in this type of setting.",

    "abstract": "Translation of aberrant or damaged mRNAs results in ribosome stalling and collisions. The Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) mechanism detects collided ribosomes and removes aberrant mRNAs and nascent peptides, thus preventing their cytotoxic effects. Conversely, excessive or unresolved ribosome collisions can induce apoptosis. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) forms the backbone of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimens for several types of cancer. Although best known for its incorporation into DNA and inhibition of thymidylate synthase, a major determinant of 5FUs anticancer activity is its incorporation into RNAs. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) underlying RNA-dependent 5FU cytotoxicity and the cellular response to its impact on RNA metabolism remain unclear. Here, we report a key role for RQC in mitigating the cytotoxic effects of 5FU-induced dysregulation of mRNA translation. We show that acute 5FU treatment results in the rapid induction of the mTOR signalling pathway, an enhanced rate of mRNA translation initiation, and increased ribosome collisions that trigger RQC. We also found that RQC deficiency, caused by the depletion of ZNF598, results in increased 5FU-induced cell death, a phenotype that is reversed by inhibition of mTOR or repression of mRNA translation initiation. Importantly, 5FU treatment enhances the expression of key RQC factors, including ZNF598 and GIGYF2, via an mTOR-dependent post-translational regulation mechanism. This acute adaptation likely mitigates the cytotoxic consequences of increased ribosome collisions upon 5FU treatment. Overall, our data indicate a heretofore unknown mTOR-dependent mechanism that augments the RQC process, mitigating the cytotoxicity of 5FU and undermining its anticancer efficacy.",

We have recently developed a method to produce skeletal myogenic cells with exceptional engraftability and expandability through an in vivo pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation approach. We have subsequently mapped engraftment and gene expression and found that leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (Lifr) expression is positively correlated with engraftability. We therefore investigated the effect of LIF, the endogenous ligand of LIFR, on cultured MuSCs and examined their engraftment potential. We found that LIF-treated MuSCs exhibited elevated expression of PAX7, formed larger colonies from single cells, and favored the retention of PAX7+ \"reserve cells\" upon myogenic differentiation. This suggested that LIF promoted the maintenance of cultured MuSCs at a stem cell stage. Moreover, LIF enhanced the engraftment capability of MuSCs that had been expanded in vitro for 12 days by 5-fold and increased the number of MuSCs that repopulated the stem cell pool post-transplantation. These results thereby demonstrated the effectiveness of our in vivo PSC differentiation platform to identify positive regulators of the engraftability of cultured MuSCs.",

Chromosome breaks, which form spontaneously in bovine embryos at sites concordant with human embryos, preferentially locate to late replicating regions. In mice, late replicating regions show enhanced fragility due to a sparsity of dormant origins that can be activated under conditions of replication stress. This pattern predisposes regions with long neuronal genes to fragility and genetic change prior to segregation of soma and germ line. Our studies show that the formation of early and late replicating regions is among the first layers of epigenetic regulation established on the mammalian genome after fertilization.",

Here, we show that in Fundulus heteroclitus, a single generation of selection drives significant phenotypic divergence (5-15%) in organismal metabolic rate, cardiac metabolic rate and hypoxia tolerance. This divergence occurs among individuals of the same panmictic population residing in environmentally distinct microhabitats. Phenotypic divergence remains observable following long-term common-gardening and is supported by previous work documenting fine-scale, genetic divergence among microhabitat residents. We show that the magnitude of within-generation trait divergence is on the order of what is commonly observed among more isolated populations that have diverged over multiple generations. Although panmictic reproduction among microhabitat residents erodes trait divergence every generation, strong selection could potentially reestablish it in the next. In heterogeneous habitats, transient, fine-scale divergence could have a considerable impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Ignoring its contribution to overall trait variance could limit our ability to define meaningful, evolved divergence.\n\nSummaryNatural selection can lead to changes in organisms traits over time. Typically, these changes occur slowly over multiple generations and over large spatial scales. By studying a wild population of Atlantic killifish, we show that a single generation of natural selection can generate substantial trait variation over short distances. We observe significant differences in several physiological traits among individuals inhabiting distinct  microhabitats in a patchy salt marsh environment. These differences are unlikely due to physiological acclimation and are best explained by strong, natural selection removing those individuals not suited to a particular microhabitat. Previous studies support natural selection as the most likely explanation, having shown subtle genetic differences among microhabitat residents. Remarkably, the magnitude of trait divergence is on the order of what is typically observed among populations that have diverged over multiple generations and larger spatial scales. Our results highlight the significant contribution of natural selection to trait variation in patchy environments, even over exceptionally short time and small spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "In fission yeast lacking the telomere binding protein, Taz1, replication stalls at telomeres, triggering deleterious downstream events. Strand invasion from one taz1{Delta} telomeric stalled fork to another on a separate (non-sister) chromosome leads to telomere entanglements, which are resolved in mitosis at 32{degrees}C; however, entanglement resolution fails at [&le;]20{degrees}C, leading to cold-specific cell lethality. Previously, we found that loss of the mitotic function of Rif1, a conserved DNA replication and repair factor, suppresses cold sensitivity by promoting resolution of entanglements without affecting entanglement formation. To understand the underlying pathways of mitotic entanglement resolution, we performed a series of genomewide synthetic genetic array screens to generate a comprehensive list of genetic interactors of taz1{Delta} and rif1{Delta}. We modified a previously described screening method to ensure that the queried cells were kept in log phase growth. In addition to recapitulating previously identified genetic interactions, we find that loss of genes encoding components of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) promotes telomere disentanglement and suppresses taz1{Delta} cold sensitivity; we attribute this to more rapid anaphase midregion nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown in the absence of these NPC components. Moreover, loss of genes involved in lipid metabolism reverses the ability of rif1+ deletion to suppress taz1{Delta} cold sensitivity, again pinpointing NE modulation. A rif1+ separation-of-function mutant that specifically loses Rif1s mitotic functions yields similar genetic interactions. Genes promoting membrane fluidity were enriched in a parallel taz1+ synthetic lethal screen at permissive temperature, cementing the idea that the cold specificity of taz1{Delta} lethality stems from altered NE homeostasis.",

Different REDs differ with respect to the repeat involved, the cells that are most expansion prone and the extent of expansion and whether these diseases share a common expansion mechanism is unclear. To date, expansion has only been studied in a limited number of REDs. Here we report the first studies of the expansion mechanism in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in the 5 UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few as [~]100 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low levels of R-looped formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-cas9 knockout approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutL and MutL{psi}, the 2 mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well understood MutL complex, MutL{beta}, is also important, if not essential, for repeat expansion in these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important for expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, many, if not all, REDs likely expand via in very similar ways.",

Integration with GWAS data further pinpointed the impact of specific TFs on a set of immune traits.

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) presents with extra-skeletal calcification and renal osteodystrophy (ROD). The origins of ROD likely lie with elevated uremic toxins and/or an altered hormonal profile but the cellular events responsible remain unclear. Here, we report that stalled mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in bones of a CKD-MBD mouse model, and also human CKD-MBD patients. RNA-seq analysis exposed an altered expression of genes associated with mitophagy and mitochondrial function in tibia of CKD-MBD mice. The accumulation of damaged osteocyte mitochondria and the expression of mitophagy regulators, p62/SQSTM1, ATG7 and LC3 was inconsistent with functional mitophagy, and in mito-QC reporter mice with CKD-MBD, there was a 2.3-fold increase in osteocyte mitolysosomes. Altered expression of mitophagy regulators in human CKD-MBD bones was also observed. To determine if uremic toxins were possibly responsible for these observations, indoxyl sulfate treatment of osteoblasts revealed mitochondria with distorted morphology and whose membrane potential and oxidative phosphorylation were decreased, and oxygen-free radical production increased. The altered p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II expression was consistent with impaired mitophagy machinery and the effects of indoxyl sulfate were reversible by rapamycin. In conclusion, mitolysosome accumulation from impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria may contribute to the skeletal complications, characteristic of ROD. Targeting mitochondria and the mitophagy process may therefore offer novel routes for intervention to preserve bone health in patients with ROD. Such approaches would be timely as our current armamentarium of anti-fracture medications has not been developed for, or adequately studied in, patients with severe CKD-MBD.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573355v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f23caforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e3e94org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce6adeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ca5558_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG TRANSLATIONAL STATEMENTRenal osteodystrophy (ROD) remains the major skeletal complication of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). As a disease characterised by biochemical and hormone abnormalities, ROD is exacerbated by osteocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Advances in our understanding of the mitophagy pathway are vital to improving the clinical management of ROD. The dysregulation of mitophagy in murine and human CKD-MBD bone provided evidence of delayed clearance of damaged mitochondria, which was also observed in uremic toxin-treated-osteoblasts but reversible upon rapamycin treatment. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of managing ROD by restoring defective mitophagy in osteocytes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce MnM, an efficient tool for characterising single-cell DNA replication states and revealing genomic subpopulations in heterogeneous samples, notably cancers. MnM uses single-cell copy-number data to accurately perform missing-value imputation, classify cell replication states and detect genomic heterogeneity, which allows to separate somatic copy-number alterations from copy-number variations due to DNA replication. By applying our machine learning methods, our research unveils critical insights into chromosomal aberrations and showcases ubiquitous aneuploidy in tumorigenesis. MnM democratises single-cell subpopulation detection which, in hand, enables the extraction of single-cell DNA replication timing (scRT) profiles from genomically-heterogenous subpopulations detected by DNA content and issued from single samples. By analysing over 119,000 human single cells from cultured cell lines, patient tumours as well as patient-derived xenograft samples, the copy-number and replication timing profiles issued in this study lead to the first multi-sample subpopulation-disentangled scRT atlas and act as data contribution for further cancer research. Our results highlight the necessity of studying in vivo samples to comprehensively grasp the complexities of DNA replication, given that cell lines, while convenient, lack dynamic environmental factors. This tool offers to advance our understanding of cancer initiation and progression, facilitating further research in the interface of genomic instability and replication stress.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573369v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@25047forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a57faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d61dd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140c6e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Pooled genetic screens are powerful tools to study gene function in a high-throughput manner. Typically, sequencing-based screens require cell lysis, which limits the examination of critical phenotypes such as cell morphology, protein subcellular localization, and cell-cell/tissue interactions. In contrast, emerging optical pooled screening methods enable the investigation of these spatial phenotypes in response to targeted CRISPR perturbations. In this study, we report a multi-omic optical pooled CRISPR screening method, which we have named CRISPRmap. Our method combines a novel in situ CRISPR guide identifying barcode readout approach with concurrent multiplexed immunofluorescence and in situ RNA detection. CRISPRmap barcodes are detected and read out through combinatorial hybridization of DNA oligos, enhancing barcode detection efficiency, while reducing both dependency on third party proprietary sequencing reagents and assay cost. Notably, we conducted a multi-omic base-editing screen in a breast cancer cell line on core DNA damage repair genes involved in the homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways investigating how nucleotide variants in those genes influence DNA damage signaling and cell cycle regulation following treatment with ionizing radiation or DNA damaging agents commonly used for cancer therapy. Approximately a million cells were profiled with our multi-omic approach, providing a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of the functional consequences of the studied variants. CRISPRmap enabled us to pinpoint likely-pathogenic patient-derived mutations that were previously classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore, our approach effectively distinguished barcodes of a pooled library in tumor tissue, and we coupled it with cell-type and molecular phenotyping by cyclic immunofluorescence. Multi-omic spatial analysis of how CRISPR-perturbed cells respond to various environmental cues in the tissue context offers the potential to significantly expand our understanding of tissue biology in both health and disease.",

A cryo-EM reconstruction revealed that SipAs globular core binds at the grove between actin strands, whereas the extended C-terminal arm penetrates deeply into the inter-strand space, stabilizing F-actin from within. The unusually strong binding of SipA is achieved via a combination of fast association via the core and very slow dissociation dictated by the arm. Similarly to Pi, BeF3, and phalloidin, SipA potently inhibited actin depolymerization by ADF/cofilin, which correlated with the increased filament stiffness, supporting the hypothesis that F-actins mechanical properties contribute to the recognition of its nucleotide state by protein partners.

The modulation of these inhibitory neurons influences the activity in the output layer of the network towards encoding more frequently an active type of response and less frequently a protective type of response in larvae fed on sugar compared to those fed on a balanced diet.

Moreover, OPCs and reactive astrocytes were involved in a shared immuno-glial cross talk with stroke specific myeloid cells. In situ, osteopontin positive myeloid cells accumulated in close proximity to proliferating OPCs and reactive astrocytes, which expressed the osteopontin receptor CD44, within the perilesional zone specifically.

    "abstract": "The somatosensory nervous system surveils external stimuli at barrier tissues, regulating innate immune cells under infection and inflammation. The roles of sensory neurons in controlling the adaptive immune system, and more specifically immunity to the microbiota, however, remain elusive. Here, we identified a novel mechanism for direct neuroimmune communication between commensal-specific T lymphocytes and somatosensory neurons mediated by the neuropeptide Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in the skin. Intravital imaging revealed that commensal-specific T cells are in close proximity to cutaneous nerve fibers in vivo. Correspondingly, we observed upregulation of the receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP, RAMP1, in CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by skin commensal colonization. Neuroimmune CGRP-RAMP1 signaling axis functions in commensal-specific T cells to constrain Type 17 responses and moderate the activation status of microbiota-reactive lymphocytes at homeostasis. As such, modulation of neuroimmune CGRP-RAMP1 signaling in commensal-specific T cells shapes the overall activation status of the skin epithelium, thereby impacting the outcome of responses to insults such as wounding. The ability of somatosensory neurons to control adaptive immunity to the microbiota via the CGRP-RAMP1 axis underscores the various layers of regulation and multisystem coordination required for optimal microbiota-reactive T cell functions under steady state and pathology.\n\nSignificance statementMultisystem coordination at barrier surfaces is critical for optimal tissue functions and integrity, in response to microbial and environmental cues.

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells can mediate anti-tumor responses in a variety of preclinical models and clinical settings, however, strategies to enhance anti-tumor potency is the subject of intense investigation. Signals emanating from gamma-c cytokine receptors modulate the transcriptional state of activated T cells impacting proliferation, survival, differentiation, and effector functioning through the STAT family of transcription factors. Design of ligand-independent cell-intrinsic cytokine STAT activation scaffolds is a conceptually attractive strategy to provide CAR T cells with a surrogate for exogenous cytokine support. Here, we designed a series of ligand-autonomous STAT inducer (LASI) scaffolds comprised of an extracellular identification tag, a homodimerizing transmembrane domain, and a membrane proximal IL7R Box1 domain followed by STAT5 and/or STAT3 docking sequences derived from IL7R and IL21R, respectively. We constructed LASI scaffolds having STAT5 (LASI-5), STAT3 (LASI-3), and combined STAT5 and STAT3 (LASI-5+3) docking domains and then interrogated their impact in primary human CD8+ anti-CD19 (4-1BB:zeta) CAR T cells. While LASI-5 expression had limited effects on CAR T cells, LASI-3 transcriptional programming was found to be indispensable to achieving anti-tumor functional enhancement associated with limited terminal differentiation, heightened T cell proliferation in response to antigen, and dampened expression of exhaustion-associated genes. Moreover, CAR T cells supplemented with LASI-3 or 5+3 displayed superior potency against human leukemia tumors in NSG mice. LASI-5+3 mediated the highest magnitude of CAR T cell engraftment in vivo that evolved into a fatal lymphoproliferative syndrome. However, the same efficacy enhancement was achieved with LASI-3 without the lymphoproliferative complication. Our findings provide a rationale for utilization of constitutively expressed LASI-3 to enhance the anti-tumor potency of CAR T cells, the need to regulate the activity of LASI-5+3, and a generalizable scaffold design for studying additional combinations of STAT family transcription factors.",

However, it has thus far been restricted to relatively low-plex phenotypic readouts in cancer cell lines in culture, due to limitations associated with in situ sequencing (ISS) of perturbation barcodes. Here, we developed PerturbView, an OPS technology that leverages in vitro transcription (IVT) to amplify barcodes prior to ISS, enabling screens with highly multiplexed phenotypic readouts across diverse systems, including primary cells and tissues. We demonstrate PerturbView in iPSC-derived neurons, primary immune cells, and tumor tissue sections from animal models. In a screen of immune signaling pathways in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, PerturbView uncovered both known and novel regulators of NF{kappa}B signaling. Furthermore, we combined PerturbView with spatial transcriptomics in tissue sections from a mouse xenograft model, paving the way to in vivo screens with rich optical and transcriptomic phenotypes. PerturbView broadens the scope of OPS to a wide range of models and applications.",

    "abstract": "The rational discovery of behaviorally active odorants is impeded by a lack of understanding on how the olfactory system generates percept or valence for a volatile chemical. In previous studies we showed that chemical informatics could be used to model prediction of ligands for a large repertoire of odorant receptors in Drosophila (Boyle et al., 2013). However, it remained difficult to predict behavioral valence of volatiles since the activities of a large ensembles of odor receptors encode odor information, and little is known of the complex information processing circuitry. This is a systems-level challenge well-suited for Machine-learning approaches which we have used to model olfaction in two organisms with completely unrelated olfactory receptor proteins: humans ([~]400 GPCRs) and insects ([~]100 ion-channels). We use chemical structure-based Machine Learning models for prediction of valence in insects and for 146 human odor characters. Using these predictive models, we evaluate a vast chemical space of >10 million compounds in silico. Validations of human and insect behaviors yield very high success rates. The discovery of desirable fragrances for humans that are highly repulsive to insects offers a powerful integrated approach to discover new insect repellents.",

In this work, we describe the Geometric Attention-based networks for Peptide binding Sites identification (GAPS). The GAPS constructs atom representations using geometric feature engineering and employs various attention mechanisms to update pertinent biological features. In addition, the transfer learning strategy is implemented for leveraging the pre-trained protein-protein binding sites information to enhance training of the protein-peptide binding sites recognition, taking into account the similarity of proteins and peptides. Consequently, GAPS demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in this task. Our model also exhibits exceptional performance across several expanded experiments including predicting the apo protein-peptide, the protein-cyclic peptide, and the predicted protein-peptide binding sites.

    "abstract": "A prerequisite for Dengue viral infection is the clustering of NS2B3 viral protein in the infected cell. This calls for drugs capable of reversing the biological processes leading to the declustering of NS2B3 viral complex. In this work, we report a new drug (leflunomide) that shows reversal of NS2B3 clustering, post 24 hours of cell transfection with a recombinant probe (Dendra2-NS2B3) containing the viral complex of interest (NS2B3). To study, we constructed a photoactivable recombinant plasmid for visualizing the activity of the target protein-of-interest (Dendra2-NS2B3). This enabled a better understanding of the underlying biological processes involved in Dengue and the role of NS2B3. The study was performed in a cellular system by transfecting the cell (NIH3T3 -mouse fibroblast cell line), followed by drug treatment studies. A range of physiologically relevant concentrations (250 nM - 10 M) of the FDA-approved drug (leflunomide) was used. The single molecule super-resolution microscopy (scanSM LM) study showed declustering of NS2B3 clusters for concentrations > 250 nM and near complete disappearance of clusters at concentrations > 5 M . Moreover, the associated critical biophysical parameters suggest a substantial decrease in clustered molecules (from 53.2 {+/-} 1.77% for control to 14.89 {+/-} 4.80% at 250 nM, and further reduction to 10.55 {+/-} 2.91% at 500 nM). Moreover, the number of clusters reduced from 46 {+/-} 15 to 13 {+/-} 4, and the number of molecules per cluster decreased from 133 {+/-} 29 to 62 {+/-} 3, with a depletion in large clusters (from 24 to 12). The parameters collectively indicate the clustering nature of NS2B3 viral protein during the infection process at a cellular level and the effect of leflunomide in declustering. The results supported by statistical analysis suggest strong declustering promoted by leflunomide, which holds the promise to contain/treat dengue viral infection.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe fact that there is no approved antiviral approach for Dengue makes it life-threatening and calls for ways to tackle viral infection. Hence, understanding Dengue biology at a single molecule level plays a vital role. In the present super-resolution study, we noted the formation of key viral protein (NS2B3) clusters post 24 hours of transfection in a cellular system. We identified a repurposed FDA-approved drug (Leflunomide) that inhibits the clustering process and promotes declustering at higher drug concentrations. This may become the basis of future studies, which may have therapeutic potential against Dengue.",

    "abstract": "Orphan nuclear receptor NR2E3 activates p53 and induces cancer cell apoptosis. Further studies on p53-dependent and -independent functions of wild-type and mutated NR2E3 are needed. Herein, we showed that NR2E3 enhanced p53-DNA interactions in diverse cancer cells and up-regulated p53 and IFN pathways while down-regulating MYC pathway in cervical cancer cells. Studies of \"All of Us\" and TCGA databases showed NR2E3 nonsynonymous mutations associating with four cancers. We stratified NR2E3 SNVs for their cancer implications with the p53 reporter. A cancer-associated NR2E3R97Hmutation not only lost the wild-types tumor-suppressing functions but also prohibited the wild-type from enhancing p53 acetylation. These observations implicated the potential for pharmaceutically activating NR2E3 to suppress cancer. Indeed, NR2E3s small-molecule agonist 11a repressed 2-D and 3-D cultures of primary cells and cell lines of cervical cancer, in which screening FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs identified HDAC-1/2 inhibitor Romidepsin operating synergistically with 11a. The underlying molecular mechanisms included 11as down-regulating the transcription of Multidrug Resistance Protein ABCB1 that Romidepsin up-regulated. Transcriptomics studies revealed three synergy modes: (1) \"sum-up\" mode that the p53 pathway activated individually by 11a and Romidepsin got stronger by the combo; (2) \"antagonism\" mode that Romidepsin counteracted the activation of the Kras pathway by 11a; and (3) \"de novo\" mode that the combo instead of each individual drug repressed the MYC pathway. Conclusively, our experiments provide new data supporting tumor-suppressor like functions for wild-type NR2E3, reveal roles of mutated NR2E3 in cancer, and address values of NR2E3s agonist 11a in cancer therapy alone and combined.",

We propose Multiband Artifact Regression in Simultaneous Slices (MARSS), a regression-based detection and correction technique that successfully mitigates this shared signal in unprocessed data. We demonstrate that the signal isolated by MARSS correction is likely non-neural, appearing stronger in neurovasculature than grey matter. We show that MARSS correction leads to study-wide increases in signal-to-noise ratio, decreases in cortical coefficient of variation, and mitigation of systematic artefactual spatial patterns in participant-level task betas. Finally, we demonstrate that MARSS correction has substantive effects on second-level t-statistics in analyses of task-evoked activation.

We applied this method to test conflicting hypotheses about the third-tier visual cortex, where areal boundaries have remained controversial. The results support a hypothesis whereby an area contains representations of both the upper and lower contralateral quadrants (DM) is located immediate anterior to V2, and unveil pronounced tuning preferences in the third-tier areas.

    "abstract": "Nearly two-thirds of patients with Alzheimers are women. Identifying therapeutics specific for women is critical to lowering their elevated risk for developing this major cause of adult dementia. Moreover, targeting epigenetic processes that regulate multiple cellular pathways is advantageous given Alzheimers multifactorial nature. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic process heavily involved in memory consolidation. Its disruption is linked to Alzheimers.\n\nThrough our computational studies, we predicted that the investigational drug RG2833 (N-[6-(2-aminoanilino)-6-oxohexyl]-4-methylbenzamide) has repurposing potential for Alzheimers. RG2833 is a histone deacetylase HDAC1/3 inhibitor that is orally bioavailable and permeates the blood-brain-barrier. We investigated the RG2833 therapeutic potential in TgF344-AD rats, which are a model of Alzheimers that exhibits age-dependent progression, thus mimicking this aspect of Alzheimers patients that is difficult to establish in animal models. We investigated the RG2833 effects on cognitive performance, gene expression, and AD-like pathology in 11-month TgF344-AD female and male rats. A total of 89 rats were used: wild type n = 45 (17 females, 28 males), and TgF344-AD n = 44 (24 females, 20 males)] across multiple cohorts.\n\nNo obvious toxicity was detected in the TgF344-AD rats up to 6 months of RG2833-treatment starting at 5 months of age administering the drug in rodent chow at [~]30mg/kg of body weight. We started treatment early in the course of pathology when therapeutic intervention is predicted to be more effective than in later stages of the disease. The drug-treatment significantly mitigated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits in 11-month TgF344-AD females but not in males, compared to wild type littermates. This female sex-specific drug effect has not been previously reported. RG2833-treatment failed to ameliorate amyloid beta accumulation and microgliosis in female and male TgF344-AD rats. However, RNAseq analysis of hippocampal tissue from TgF344-AD rats showed that drug-treatment in females upregulated the expression of immediate early genes, such as Arc, Egr1 and c-Fos, and other genes involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Remarkably, out of 17,168 genes analyzed for each sex, no significant changes in gene expression were detected in males at P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05, and fold-change [&ge;] 1.5.\n\nOur data suggest that histone modifying therapeutics such as RG2833 improve cognitive behavior by modulating the expression of immediate early, neuroprotective and synaptic plasticity genes. Our preclinical study supports that RG2833 has therapeutic potential specifically for female Alzheimers patients. RG2833 evaluations using other AD-related models is necessary to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "This study leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens, focusing on their responses to both visual (umbrella opening) and auditory (dog barking) stressors at different ages. The aim is to understand how these diverse stressors, along with the hens age and the timing of stress application, affect their vocal behavior. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of chicken vocal recordings, both from stress-exposed and control groups, the research enables a detailed comparative analysis of vocal responses to varied environmental stimuli. A significant outcome of this study is the distinct vocal patterns exhibited by younger chickens compared to older ones, suggesting developmental variations in stress response. This finding contributes to a deeper understanding of poultry welfare, demonstrating the potential of non-invasive vocalization analysis for early stress detection and aligning with ethical livestock management practices. The CNN models ability to distinguish between pre- and post-stress vocalizations high-lights the substantial impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. This study not only sheds light on the nuanced interactions between stress stimuli and animal behavior but also marks a significant advancement in smart farming. It paves the way for real-time welfare assessments and more informed decision-making in poultry management. Looking forward, the study suggests avenues for longitudinal research on chronic stress and the application of these methodologies across different species and farming contexts. Ultimately, this research represents a pivotal step in integrating technology with animal welfare, offering a promising approach to transforming welfare assessments in animal husbandry.",

    "abstract": "In social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this \"swarming\" behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.",

    "abstract": "PurposeProspective motion correction (PMC) is a promising method in mitigating motion artifacts in MRI. However, its effectiveness in improving the visibility of vessel-like thin structures in routine studies is unclear. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the ability of fat-navigator based PMC in improving the visibility of perivascular spaces (PVS) using data from two earlier studies.\n\nMethodsTwo open source MRI data set were used for motion artifact simulation and evaluating PMC, which consist of 66 T2-weighted images without PMC and 38 T2-weighted images with PMC. PMC was performed by adjusting field of view during scan based on motion parameters derived from fat navigators. Motion artifact simulation was performed by misplacing k-space data at a motion-related non-cartesian grid onto the cartesian grid calculated using motion-free images to generate the images without effects of PMC. The simulations ability to reproduce motion-induced blurring and ringing artifacts was evaluated using the sharpness at the lateral ventricle/white matter (WM) boundary and the magnitude of ringing artifact component in the Fourier spectrum. PVS volume fraction in WM was employed to reflect its visibility. Sharpness, magnitude of ringing artifact and PVS volume fraction were then compared between simulated images and real images with and without PMC.\n\nResultsThe consistencies in sharpness (rho [&ge;] 0.86, corrected p [&le;] 4.4 x10-16) and ringing artifact magnitude (rho [&ge;] 0.42, corrected p [&le;] 0.001) were found between simulated images and real images without PMC. There was a significant negative correlation (rho [&le;] -0.27, corrected p [&le;] 0.08) between PVS volume fraction and motion severity in both simulated and real images without PMC. PMC removed the above correlations (rho [&ge;] -0.02, corrected p > 1) and increased the boundary sharpness compared to the images simulated using the same motion traces.\n\nConclusionsMotion artifact simulation can reproduce the desired motion-induced artifacts on images. PMC reduces the negative impacts of motion on image quality and improves PVS visibility.",

    "abstract": "With the advancements in instrumentation, image processing algorithms, and computational capabilities, single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) has achieved nearly atomic resolution in determining the 3D structures of viruses. The virus structures play a crucial role in studying their biological function and advancing the development of antiviral vaccines and treatments. Despite the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in general image processing, its development for identifying and extracting virus particles from cryo-EM micrographs (images) has been hindered by the lack of manually labelled high-quality datasets. To fill the gap, we introduce CryoVirusDB, a labeled dataset containing the coordinates of expert-picked virus particles in cryo-EM micrographs. CryoVirusDB comprises 9,941 micrographs of 9 different viruses along with the coordinates of 339,398 labeled virus particles.

    "abstract": "Proteins are responsible for most biological functions, many of which require the interaction of more than one protein molecule. However, accurately predicting protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites (the interfacial residues of a protein that interact with other protein molecules) remains a challenge. The growing demand and cost associated with the reliable identification of PPI sites using conventional experimental methods call for computational tools for automated prediction and understanding of PPIs. Here, we present Pair-EGRET, an edge-aggregated graph attention network that leverages the features extracted from pre-trained transformer-like models to accurately predict PPI sites. Pair-EGRET works on a k-nearest neighbor graph, representing the three-dimensional structure of a protein, and utilizes the cross-attention mechanism for accurate identification of interfacial residues of a pair of proteins. Through an extensive evaluation study using a diverse array of experimental data, evaluation metrics, and case studies on representative protein sequences, we find that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for predicting PPI sites. Moreover, Pair-EGRET can provide interpretable insights from the learned cross-attention matrix. Pair-EGRET is freely available in open source form at (https://github.com/1705004/Pair-EGRET).",

Our previous work presents the first one-stop software that utilizes cell nuclei staining images and statistical methods to generate high-confidence single-cell spatial gene expression profiles for Stereo-seq data. With recent advancements in Stereo-seq technology, it is possible to acquire cell boundary information, such as cell membrane/wall staining images. To take advantage of this progress, we update our software to a new version, named STCellbin, which utilizes the cell nuclei staining images as a bridge to align cell membrane/wall staining images with spatial gene expression maps. By employing an advanced cell segmentation technique, accurate cell boundaries can be obtained, leading to more reliable single-cell spatial gene expression profiles. Experimental results verify that STCellbin can be applied on the mouse liver (cell membranes) and Arabidopsis seed (cell walls) datasets and outperforms other competitive methods. The improved capability of capturing single cell gene expression profiles by this update results in a deeper understanding of the contribution of single cell phenotypes to tissue biology.\n\nAvailability & ImplementationThe source code of STCellbin is available at https://github.com/STOmics/STCellbin.",

    "abstract": "Quercus suber (cork oak) is a sustainably exploited forest resource, producing a unique renewable raw material known as cork. With drought events imposing a negative impact on tree vitality, we need more knowledge on the genetic and environmental regulation of cork development to protect the cork sector. We focused on characterizing long-term drought-induced molecular adaptations occurring in stems, and identifying key genetic pathways regulating phellem development. One-year-old cork oak plants were grown for 6 months under well-watered, or water-deficit (WD) conditions and main stems were targeted for histological characterization and transcriptomic analysis. WD treatment impaired secondary growth, by reducing meristem activity at both vascular cambium and phellogen. We analyzed the transcriptional changes imposed by WD in phellem, inner bark, and xylem, and found a global downregulation of genes related to cell division, differentiation, and cell wall biogenesis. Phellem and inner bark showed upregulation of photosynthesis-related genes, highlighting a determinant role of stem photosynthesis in the adaptation to long-term drought. We show that developing phellem cells contain chloroplasts and their abundance increases under WD. Finally, we propose new candidate regulatory genes involved in the regulation of phellogen activity and demonstrate the involvement of phellem in drought-induced bark photosynthesis in young plants.\n\nHighlightPhellem development in cork oak is impaired in drought adaptation, by negative regulation of cell division and differentiation programs, while photosynthesis is induced to contributing to CO2 recycling in the stem.",

    "abstract": "Segregating important stimuli from distractors is crucial for successful speech perception. Neural activity aligned to speech, also termed \"neural entrainment\", is thought to be instrumental for this purpose. However, the relative contribution of neural entrainment to target and distractors in speech perception remained unclear. In this study, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to manipulate entrainment to two simultaneously presented sequences of rhythmic speech while participants attended to one of them. A random temporal relationship between speech streams allowed us to disentangle effects of tACS on target and distractor processing, and to examine their combined effect on a behavioural measure of speech perception. We found that the phase relation between tACS and both target and distracting speech modulated word report accuracy, and to a similar degree. The phasic modulation of target processing correlated with that of the distractor across subjects, and their combined effect on speech perception was stronger than each of the two alone. In contrast to our expectation, the tACS phases leading to most accurate perception were uncorrelated between target and distracting speech modulations. Together, our results suggest that entrainment to target and distracting speech jointly and causally contributes to speech perception. They also demonstrate how effect sizes might be increased in future work and for technological or clinical applications.\n\nSignificance statementSynchronising neural activity to moments of important information in speech is beneficial for its perception. Successful speech perception is a consequence of both target processing and the suppression of potential distractors; so far, it has remained unclear whether brain-speech synchronisation plays a more important role for either of these two tasks. We used transcranial brain stimulation (tACS) in a multi-speaker scenario to independently manipulate synchronisation to target- or distracting speech, respectively. We found that both manipulations led to changes in speech perception that were of comparable magnitude, and their combined effect was stronger than either of them alone. These results give an insight into the cortical processing of competing speech streams and how brain-speech synchronisation causally contributes to their perception. Our findings also have implications for practical applicability of brain stimulation protocols, showing how they could be used and made more effective in improving speech perception. This approach could have potential for medical application such as additional support in hearing aids.",

We employed Cell-Specific Network Inference via Integer Value Programming and Causal Reasoning (CS-NIVaCaR) to identify core modules and Cell-Specific Probabilistic Contextualization for mRNA Regulatory Networks (CS-ProComReN) to quantitatively reveal activated sub-pathways involving MAPK1, MKNK1, RPS6KA5, and MTOR across different cell types in ASD.\n\nThe results indicate that specific pivotal molecules, such as EIF4EBP1 and EIF4E, lacking Differential Expression (DE) characteristics and responsible for protein translation with long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), are dysregulated. We further uncovered distinct activation patterns causally linked to the EIF4EBP1-EIF4E module in excitatory and inhibitory neurons.\n\nImportantly, our work has introduced a methodology for leveraging extensive transcriptomics data to parse the signal transduction network, transforming it into mSiReN, and mapping it back to the protein level. These algorithms can serve as potent tools in systems biology to analyze other omics and regulatory networks. Furthermore, the biomarkers within the activated sub-pathways, revealed by identifying convergent dysregulation, illuminate potential diagnostic and prognostic factors in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Single cells actively coordinate growth and division to regulate their size, yet how this size homeostasis at the single-cell level propagates over multiple generations to impact clonal expansion remains fundamentally unexplored. Classical timer models for cell proliferation (where the duration of the cell cycle is an independent variable) predict that the stochastic variation in colony size will increase monotonically over time. In stark contrast, implementing size control according to adder strategy (where on average a fixed size added from cell birth to division) leads to colony size variations that eventually decay to zero. While these results assume a fixed size of the colony-initiating progenitor cell, further analysis reveals that the magnitude of the intercolony variation in population number is sensitive to heterogeneity in the initial cell size. We validate these predictions by tracking the growth of isogenic microcolonies of Corynebacterium glutamicum in microfluidic chambers. Approximating their cell shape to a capsule, we observe that the degree of random variability in cell size is different depending on whether the cell size is quantified as per length, surface area, or volume, but size control remains an adder regardless of these size metrics. A comparison of the observed variability in the colony population with the predictions suggests that proliferation matches better with a cell division based on the cell surface. In summary, our integrated mathematical-experimental approach bridges the paradigms of single-cell size regulation and clonal expansion at the population levels. This innovative approach provides elucidation of the mechanisms of size homeostasis from the stochastic dynamics of colony size for rod-shaped microbes.",
