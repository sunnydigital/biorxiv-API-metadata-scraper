    "abstract": "While single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size (i.e., the total number of transcripts per cell) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, \"cell type-specific weighting-factor (cWF)\". Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells. Furthermore, we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism. Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs. Furthermore, our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs.",

    "abstract": "Spatial periodicity in grid cell firing has been interpreted as a neural metric for space providing animals with a coordinate system in navigating physical and mental spaces. However, the specific computational problem being solved by grid cells has remained elusive. Here, we provide mathematical proof that spatial periodicity in grid cell firing is the only possible solution to a neural sequence code of 2-D trajectories and that the hexagonal firing pattern of grid cells is the most parsimonious solution to such a sequence code. We thereby provide a teleological cause for the existence of grid cells and reveal the underlying nature of the global geometric organization in grid maps as a direct consequence of a simple local sequence code. A sequence code by grid cells provides intuitive explanations for many previously puzzling experimental observations and may transform our thinking about grid cells.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering the regulators of cellular aging will unravel the complexity of aging biology and identify potential therapeutic interventions to delay the onset and progress of chronic, aging-related diseases. In this work, we systematically compared gene sets involved in regulating the lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a powerful model organism to study the cellular aging of humans) and those with expression changes under rapamycin treatment. Among the functionally uncharacterized genes in the overlap set, YBR238C stood out as the only one downregulated by rapamycin and with an increased chronological and replicative lifespan upon deletion. We show that YBR238C and its paralogue RMD9 oppositely affect mitochondria and aging. YBR238C deletion increases the cellular lifespan by enhancing mitochondrial function. Its overexpression accelerates cellular aging via mitochondrial dysfunction. We find that the phenotypic effect of YBR238C is largely explained by HAP4- and RMD9-dependent mechanisms. Further, we find that genetic or chemical-based induction of mitochondrial dysfunction increases TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) activity that, subsequently, accelerates cellular aging. Notably, TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin (or deletion of YBR238C) improves the shortened lifespan under these mitochondrial dysfunction conditions in yeast and human cells. The growth of mutant cells (a proxy of TORC1 activity) with enhanced mitochondrial function is sensitive to rapamycin whereas the growth of defective mitochondrial mutants is largely resistant to rapamycin compared to wild type. Our findings demonstrate a feedback loop between TORC1 and mitochondria (the TORC1-MItochondria-TORC1 (TOMITO) signaling process) that regulates cellular aging processes. Hereby, YBR238C is an effector of TORC1 modulating mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "AbstractComputer models of the human ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) have reached a level of detail and maturity that has led to an increasing number of applications in the pharmaceutical sector. However, interfacing the models with experimental data can become a significant computational burden. To mitigate the computational burden, the present study introduces a neural network (NN) that emulates the AP for given maximum conductances of selected ion channels, pumps, and exchangers. Its applicability in pharmacological studies was tested on synthetic and experimental data. The NN emulator potentially enables massive speed-ups compared to regular simulations and the forward problem (find drugged AP for pharmacological parameters defined as scaling factors of control maximum conductances) on synthetic data could be solved with average root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.47 mV in normal APs and of 14.5 mV in abnormal APs exhibiting early afterdepolarizations (72.5% of the emulated APs were alining with the abnormality, and the substantial majority of the remaining APs demonstrated pronounced proximity). This demonstrates not only very fast and mostly very accurate AP emulations but also the capability of accounting for discontinuities, a major advantage over existing emulation strategies. Furthermore, the inverse problem (find pharmacological parameters for control and drugged APs through optimization) on synthetic data could be solved with high accuracy shown by a maximum RMSE of 0.21 in the estimated pharmacological parameters. However, notable mismatches were observed between pharmacological parameters estimated from experimental data and distributions obtained from the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative. This reveals larger inaccuracies which can be attributed particularly to the fact that small tissue preparations were studied while the emulator was trained on single cardiomyocyte data. Overall, our study highlights the potential of NN emulators as powerful tool for an increased efficiency in future quantitative systems pharmacology studies.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development in advanced imaging techniques, massive image data have been acquired for various biomedical applications, posing significant challenges to their efficient storage, transmission, and sharing. Classical model-or learning-based compression algorithms are optimized for specific dimensional data and neglect the semantic redundancy in multidimensional biomedical data, resulting limited compression performance. Here, we propose a Semantic redundancy based Implicit Neural Compression guided with Saliency map (SINCS) approach which achieves high-performance compression of various types of multi-dimensional biomedical images. Based on the first-proved semantic redundancy of biomedical data in the implicit neural function domain, we accomplished saliency-guided implicit neural compression, thereby notably improving the compression efficiency for large-scale image data in arbitrary dimensions. We have demonstrated that SINCS surpasses the alternative compression approaches in terms of image quality, compression ratio, and structure fidelity. Moreover, with using weight transfer and residual entropy coding strategies, SINCS improves compression speed while maintaining high-quality compression. It yields near-lossless compression with over 2000-fold compression ratio on 2D, 2D-T, 3D, 4D biomedical images of diverse targets ranging from single virus to entire human organs, and ensures reliable downstream tasks, such as object segmentation and quantitative analyses, to be conducted at high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between a ligand and its molecular target is crucial in guiding the optimization of molecules for any in-silico drug-design workflow. Multiple experimental and computational methods have been developed to better understand these intermolecular interactions. With the availability of a large number of structural datasets, there is a need for developing statistical frameworks that improve upon existing physics-based solutions. Here, we report a method based on geometric deep learning that is capable of predicting the binding conformations of ligands to protein targets. A technique to generate graphical representations of protein was developed to exploit the topological and electrostatic properties of the binding region. The developed framework, based on graph neural networks, learns a statistical potential based on the distance likelihood, which is tailor-made for each ligand-target pair. This potential can be coupled with global optimization algorithms such as differential evolution to reproduce the experimental binding conformations of ligands. We show that the potential based on distance likelihood, described here, performs similarly or better than well-established scoring functions for docking and screening tasks. Overall, this method represents an example of how artificial intelligence can be used to improve structure-based drug design.\n\nSignificance statementCurrent machine learning-based solutions to model protein-ligand interactions lack the level of interpretability that physics-based methods usually provide. Here, a workflow to embed protein binding surfaces as graphs was developed to serve as a viable data structure to be processed by geometric deep learning. The developed architecture based on mixture density models was employed to accurately estimate the position and conformation of the small molecule within the binding region. The likelihood-based scoring function was compared against existing physics-based alternatives, and significant performance improvements in terms of docking power, screening power and reverse screening power were observed. Taken together, the developed framework provides a platform for utilising geometric deep-learning models for interpretable prediction of protein-ligand interactions at a residue level.",

We previously demonstrated that disuse reduces the abundance of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in skeletal muscle. Deletion of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD), an enzyme that generates mitochondrial PE, was sufficient to promote muscle atrophy. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deletion is driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). Mice with muscle-specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO) were crossed with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) transgenic mice (GPx4Tg) to suppress the accumulation of LOOH. However, PSD-MKO x GPx4Tg mice and PSD-MKO mice demonstrated equally robust loss of muscle mass. These results suggest that muscle atrophy induced by PSD deficiency is not driven by the accumulation of LOOH.",

    "abstract": "The linear polymer polyphosphate (poly-P) is present across all three domains of life and serves diverse physiological functions. The enzyme polyphosphate kinase (Ppk) is responsible for poly-P synthesis, whereas poly-P degradation is carried out by the enzyme exopolyphosphatase (Ppx). In many Lactobacillaceae, the Ppk-encoding gene (ppk) is found clustered together with two genes encoding putative exopolyphosphatases (ppx1 and ppx2) each having different domain compositions, with the gene order ppx1-ppk-ppx2. However, the specific function of these ppx genes remains unexplored. An in-frame deletion of ppx1 in Lacticaseibacillus paracasei BL23 resulted in bacteria unable to accumulate poly-P, whereas disruption of ppx2 had no effect on poly-P synthesis. Expression of ppk was not altered in the {Delta}ppx1 strain, and poly-P synthesis in this strain was only restored by expressing ppx1 in trans. Moreover, no poly-P synthesis was observed when ppk was expressed from a plasmid in the {Delta}ppx1 strain. Purified Ppx2 exhibited in vitro exopolyphosphatase activity, whereas no in vitro enzymatic activity could be demonstrated for Ppx1. This observation corresponds with the absence in Ppx1 of conserved motifs essential for catalysis found in characterized exopolyphosphatases. Furthermore, assays with purified Ppk and Ppx1 evidenced that Ppx1 enhanced Ppk activity. These results demonstrate that Ppx1 is essential for poly-P synthesis in Lc. paracasei and have unveiled, for the first time, an unexpected role of Ppx1 exopolyphosphatase in poly-P synthesis.\n\nImportancePoly-P is a pivotal molecular player in bacteria, participating in a diverse array of processes ranging from stress resilience to pathogenesis, while also serving as a functional component in probiotic bacteria. The synthesis of poly-P is tightly regulated, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Our study sheds light on the distinctive role played by the two exopolyphosphatases (Ppx) found in the Lactobacillaceae bacterial group, of relevance in food and health. This particular group is noteworthy for possessing two Ppx enzymes, supposedly involved in poly-P degradation. Remarkably, our investigation uncovers an unprecedented function of Ppx1 in Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, where its absence leads to the total cessation of poly-P synthesis, paralleling the impact observed upon eliminating the poly-P forming enzyme, poly-P kinase. Unlike the anticipated role as a conventional exopolyphosphatase, Ppx1 demonstrates an unexpected function. Our results added a layer of complexity to our understanding of poly-P dynamics in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Populations of quiescent adult neural stem cells (NSCs) that reside in the mammalian brain aid in neurogenesis throughout life and can be identified by molecular markers including Nestin, a type VI intermediate filament protein. Cell cycle regulation plays an important role in determining the fate of NSCs in the adult brain and maintaining a crucial balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Data from our group and others support that the atypical cyclin-like protein Spy1 (also called RingoA; gene SPDYA) plays a critical role in activating NSCs from a quiescent state. Elevated levels of Spy1 are found in aggressive human brain cancers, including glioblastoma. Using a conditional mouse model, we demonstrate that driving the expression of Spy1 in the Nestin-enriched NSC population of the brain directs the cells toward symmetric cellular division, increases stemness characteristics, decreases differentiation, and increases susceptibility to oncogenic transformation & drug resistance. This study contributes to better understanding of intricate cell cycle mechanisms which lead to deviation from the homeostatic state, promoting aberrant changes in adult NSCs.",

The macromolecular concentration of the cytoplasm varies in response to physiological and environmental fluctuations, raising the question of how or if trigger waves can robustly operate in the face of such fluctuations. Using Xenopus extracts, we found that mitotic and apoptotic trigger wave speeds are remarkably invariant. We derived a model that accounts for this robustness and for the eventual slowing at extremely high and low cytoplasmic concentrations. The model implies that the positive and negative effects of cytoplasmic concentration (increased reactant concentration vs. increased viscosity) are nearly precisely balanced. Accordingly, artificially maintaining a constant cytoplasmic viscosity during dilution abrogates this robustness. The robustness in trigger wave speeds may contribute to the reliability of the extremely rapid embryonic cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation in the form of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most abundant base modification in animals. However, 5mC levels vary widely across taxa. While vertebrate genomes are hypermethylated, in most invertebrates, 5mC concentrates on constantly and highly transcribed genes (gene body methylation; GbM) and, in some species, on transposable elements (TEs), a pattern known as  mosaic. Yet, the role and developmental dynamics of 5mC and how these explain interspecific differences in DNA methylation patterns remain poorly understood, especially in Spiralia, a large clade of invertebrates comprising nearly half of the animal phyla.\n\nResultsHere, we generate base-resolution methylomes for three species with distinct genomic features and phylogenetic positions in Annelida, a major spiralian phylum. All possible 5mC patterns occur in annelids, from typical invertebrate intermediate levels in a mosaic distribution to hypermethylation and methylation loss. GbM is common to annelids with 5mC, and methylation differences across species are explained by taxon-specific transcriptional dynamics or the presence of intronic TEs. Notably, the link between GbM and transcription decays during development, and there is a gradual and global, age-dependent demethylation in adult stages. Moreover, reducing 5mC levels with cytidine analogues during early development impairs normal embryogenesis and reactivates TEs in the annelid Owenia fusiformis.\n\nConclusionsOur study indicates that global epigenetic erosion during development and ageing is an ancestral feature of bilateral animals. However, the tight link between transcription and gene body methylation is likely important in early embryonic stages, and 5mC-mediated TE silencing probably emerged convergently across animal lineages.",

To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new pipeline, CentIER, for the automatic and accurate identification and annotation of centromere regions by taking advantage of the sequence specificity information. CentIER only requires users to input the genomic sequence, and then it can partition the centromeric region from a chromosome, identify tandem repeat monomers, annotate retrotransposons, and ultimately output visualized results. By referencing the experimentally determined centromere regions, it was discovered that the predictive accuracy of centromere recognition by CentIER exceeded 90%. Following the evaluation of CentIERs accuracy, it was applied to investigate the sequence and distribution characteristics of centromeric retrotransposons and tandem repeat sequences of different species, providing insights into these traits in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.",

By contrast, temperature significantly impacted the expression of a large fraction of MED134 genes (>60%), including components of the stress response, cellular translation, DNA replication, and some metabolic pathways such as the anaplerotic carbon fixation and the glyoxylate shunt, suggesting intracellular carbon flow adjustments to temperature.

    "abstract": "In both mice and humans, Type II interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) is crucial for regulation of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection, during acute or chronic phases. To thwart this defense, T. gondii secretes protein effectors hindering the hosts immune response. For example, T. gondii relies on the MYR translocon complex to deploy soluble dense granule effectors (GRAs) into the host cell cytosol or nucleus. Recent genome-wide loss-of-function screens in IFN{gamma}-primed primary human fibroblasts identified MYR translocon components as crucial for parasite resistance against IFN{gamma} driven vacuole clearance. However, these screens did not pinpoint specific MYR-dependent GRA proteins responsible for IFN{gamma} signaling blockade, suggesting potential functional redundancy.\n\nOur study reveals that T. gondii depends on the MYR translocon complex to prevent host cell death and parasite premature egress in human cells stimulated with IFN{gamma} post-infection, a unique phenotype observed in various human cell lines but not in murine cells. Intriguingly, inhibiting parasite egress did not prevent host cell death, indicating this mechanism is distinct from those described previously. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens uncovered TgIST, GRA16, GRA24, and GRA28 as effectors necessary for a complete block of IFN{gamma} response. GRA24 and GRA28 directly influenced IFN{gamma} driven transcription, GRA24s action depended on its interaction with p38 MAPK, while GRA28 disrupted histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300. Given the intricate nature of the immune response to T. gondii, it appears that the parasite has evolved equally elaborate mechanisms to subvert IFN{gamma} signaling, extending beyond direct interference with the JAK/STAT1 pathway, to encompass other signaling pathways as well.",

    "abstract": "Pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is crucial for successful sexual reproduction. Previous studies have shown that the fission yeast sme2 RNA, a meiosis-specific long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), accumulates at the sme2 locus and plays a key role in mediating robust pairing during meiosis. Several RNA-binding proteins accumulate at the sme2 and other lncRNA gene loci in conjunction with the lncRNAs transcribed from these loci. These lncRNA-protein complexes form condensates that exhibit phase separation properties on chromosomes and are necessary for robust pairing of homologous chromosomes. To further understand the mechanisms by which phase separation affects homologous chromosome pairing, we conducted an in vitro phase separation assay with the sme2 RNA-associated proteins (Smps) and RNAs. Our research has revealed that one of the Smps, Seb1, exhibits phase separation, which is enhanced by the addition of another Smp, Rhn1, and significantly increased by the addition of purified RNAs. Additionally, we have found that RNAs protect Smp condensates from treatment with 1,6-hexanediol. The Smp condensates containing different types of RNA display distinct FRAP profiles, and the Smp condensates containing the same type of RNA tend to fuse together more efficiently than those containing different types of RNA. Taken together, these results indicate that the RNA species in condensates determine their physical properties and suggest that regional RNA-Smp condensates with distinct properties ensure the pairing of homologous chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have established that de novo genes, evolving from non-coding sequences, enhance protein diversity through a stepwise process. However, the pattern and rate of their structural evolution over time remain unclear. Here, we addressed these issues within a short evolutionary timeframe ([~]1 million years for 97% of rice de novo genes). We found that de novo genes evolve faster than gene duplicates in the intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs, such as random coils), secondary structural elements (such as -helix and {beta}-strand), hydrophobicity, and molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Specifically, we observed an 8-14% decay in random coils and IDR lengths per million years per protein, and a 2.3-6.5% increase in structured elements, hydrophobicity, and MoRFs. These patterns of structural evolution align with changes in amino acid composition over time. We also revealed significantly higher positive charges but smaller molecular weights for de novo proteins than duplicates. Tertiary structure predictions demonstrated that most de novo proteins, though not typically well-folded on their own, readily form low-energy and compact complexes with extensive residue contacts and conformational flexibility, suggesting \"a faster-binding\" scenario in de novo proteins to promote interaction. Our findings illuminate the rapid evolution of protein structure in the early life of de novo proteins in rice genome, originating from noncoding sequences, highlighting their quick transformation into active, complex-forming components within a remarkably short evolutionary timeframe.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene transcription dynamics across cell types and in response to the environment. In asthma, multiple immune cell types play an important role in the inflammatory process. Genetic variants in CREs can also affect gene expression response dynamics and contribute to asthma risk. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying control of transcriptional dynamics across different environ-mental contexts and cell-types at single cell resolution remains to be elucidated. To resolve this question, we performed scATAC-seq in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from children with asthma with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and treated with dexamethasone (DEX), an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid. We analyzed changes in chromatin accessibility, measured transcription factor motif activity, and identified treatment and cell-type specific transcription factors that drive changes in both gene expression mean and variability. We observed strong positive linear dependence between motif response and their target gene expression changes, but negative in variability changes. This result suggests that an in-crease of transcription factor binding tightens the variability of gene expression around the mean. We then annotated genetic variants in chromatin accessibility peaks and response motifs followed by computational fine-mapping of eQTL signals from a pediatric asthma cohort. We found that eQTLs were highly enriched in peaks with response motifs and refined the credible set of several asthma risk genes. In conclusion, scATAC-seq enhances the understanding of molecular mechanisms for asthma risk variants mediated by gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Dictionary learning (DL), implemented via matrix factorization (MF), is commonly used in computational biology to tackle ubiquitous clustering problems. The method is favored due to its conceptual simplicity and relatively low computational complexity. However, DL algorithms produce results that lack interpretability in terms of real biological data. Additionally, they are not optimized for graph-structured data and hence often fail to handle them in a scalable manner.\n\nIn order to address these limitations, we propose a novel DL algorithm called online convex network dictionary learning (online cvxNDL). Unlike classical DL algorithms, online cvxNDL is implemented via MF and designed to handle extremely large datasets by virtue of its online nature. Importantly, it enables the interpretation of dictionary elements, which serve as cluster representatives, through convex combinations of real measurements. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to data with a network structure by incorporating specialized subnetwork sampling techniques.\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply cvxNDL on 3D-genome RNAPII ChIA-Drop data with the goal of identifying important long-range interaction patterns (long-range dictionary elements). ChIA-Drop probes higher-order interactions, and produces data in the form of hypergraphs whose nodes represent genomic fragments. The hyperedges represent observed physical contacts. Our hypergraph model analysis has the objective of creating an interpretable dictionary of long-range interaction patterns that accurately represent global chromatin physical contact maps. Through the use of dictionary information, one can also associate the contact maps with RNA transcripts and infer cellular functions.\n\nTo accomplish the task at hand, we focus on RNAPII-enriched ChIA-Drop data from Drosophila Melanogaster S2 cell lines. Our results offer two key insights. First, we demonstrate that online cvxNDL retains the accuracy of classical DL (MF) methods while simultaneously ensuring unique interpretability and scalability. Second, we identify distinct collections of proximal and distal interaction patterns involving chromatin elements shared by related processes across different chromosomes, as well as patterns unique to specific chromosomes. To associate the dictionary elements with biological properties of the corresponding chromatin regions, we employ Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and perform multiple RNA coexpression studies.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe code and test datasets are available at:\\ https://github.com/rana95vishal/chromatin_DL/\n\nAuthor summaryWe introduce a novel method for dictionary learning termed online convex Network Dictionary Learning (online cvxNDL). The method operates in an online manner and utilizes representative subnetworks of a network dataset as dictionary elements. A key feature of online cvxNDL is its ability to work with graph-structured data and generate dictionary elements that represent convex combinations of real data points, thus ensuring interpretability.\n\nOnline cvxNDL is used to investigate long-range chromatin interactions in S2 cell lines of Drosophila Melanogaster obtained through RNAPII ChIA-Drop measurements represented as hypergraphs. The results show that dictionary elements can accurately and efficiently reconstruct the original interactions present in the data, even when subjected to convexity constraints. To shed light on the biological relevance of the identified dictionaries, we perform Gene Ontology enrichment and RNA-seq coexpression analyses. These studies uncover multiple long-range interaction patterns that are chromosome-specific. Furthermore, the findings affirm the significance of convex dictionaries in representing TADs cross-validated by imaging methods (such as 3-color FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization)).",

Here, we describe the development of HaloMS, a high-throughput HaloTag-based affinity purification-mass spectrometry assay for protein interaction discovery. The approach enables the rapid capture of newly expressed proteins, eliminating tedious conventional one-by-one assay. As a proof-of-principle, we used HaloMS to evaluate protein complex interactions of 17 regulatory proteins in human adipocytes. The adipocyte interactome network was validated using an in vitro pull-down assay and artificial intelligence-based prediction tools. The application of HaloMS to probe adipocyte differentiation facilitated the identification of previously unknown transcription factor-protein complexes, revealing proteome-wide human adipocyte transcription factor networks, and shedding light on how different pathways are integrated.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater-based pathogen monitoring has recently become a ubiquitous method for tracking the abundance and evolution of pathogens in a community or port of entry. But accurate inference of disease incidence from wastewater remains challenging, in large part due to noise and bias arising from wastewater transport and measurement. We developed a new system of tracer particles designed to enhance wastewater monitoring of viral pathogens. These tracers, which consist of synthetic DNA barcodes packaged into non-infectious viral capsids, can be deposited at known amounts and times into the sewer system and measured in wastewater samples to assess features such as assay sensitivity, and the decay and delay in viral signal arising from a shedding event. Here we describe the design, construction, and initial characterization of a 25-plex tracer library. Our tracer library supports simultaneous measurement of up to 5 distinct tracers by qPCR and up to 25 distinct tracers by amplicon or metagenomic sequencing. We demonstrate experimentally that the tracers are biologically inert and exhibit good stability and qPCR-assay performance in wastewater. These features collectively suggest that barcoded, virus-like tracers have the required properties for high-accuracy, high-resolution characterization of wastewater monitoring systems.",

Homo/heterodimers of these protein homologs, majorly recognize their ligands via conserved motifs from a plethora of cellular proteins to modulate the localization and functions of those effector ligands. In most of the genetic backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, disruption of both 14-3-3 homologs (Bmh1 and Bmh2) are either lethal or survive with severe growth defects showing gross chromosomal missegregation and prolonged cell cycle arrest. To elucidate their contributions to chromosome segregation, in this work we investigated their centromere/kinetochore-related functions. Analysis of appropriate deletion mutants shows that Bmh isoforms have cumulative and unshared isoform-specific contributions in maintaining the proper integrity of the kinetochore ensemble. Consequently, bmh mutant cells exhibited perturbations in kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) dynamics, characterized by kinetochore declustering, mis-localization of kinetochore proteins, and Mad2-mediated transient G2/M arrest. These defects also caused an asynchronous chromosome congression in bmh mutants during metaphase. In summary, this report advances the knowledge on contributions of budding yeast 14-3-3 proteins in chromosome segregation by demonstrating their roles in kinetochore integrity and chromosome congression.",

We compared feeding rates (measured as body mass increments) and sap exudation rates among F. griffithii, Q. acutissima, and L. subcostata. We found that beetles feeding on L. subcostata and Q. acutissima exhibited significantly higher feeding rates than those feeding on F. griffithii. No significant differences in feeding rates were observed between L. subcostata and Q. acutissima. The sap exudation rate was significantly higher for Q. acutissima than for F. griffithii. However, there were no significant differences in the sap exudation rates between F. griffithii and L. subcostata or between Q. acutissima and L. subcostata. These findings suggest that lower feeding rates on F. griffithii prolong the feeding duration, resulting in daytime activity.

    "abstract": "Cyclic peptides are versatile therapeutic agents with many excellent properties, such as high binding affinity, minimal toxicity, and the potential to engage challenging protein targets. However, the pharmaceutical utilities of cyclic peptides are limited by their low membrane permeability--an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting. Current machine learning-based models of cyclic peptide permeability show variable performance due to the limitations of experimental data. Furthermore, these methods use features derived from the whole molecule which are used to predict small molecules and ignore the unique structural properties of cyclic peptides. This study presents CycPeptMP: an accurate and efficient method for predicting the membrane permeability of cyclic peptides. We designed features for cyclic peptides at the atom-, monomer-, and peptide-levels, and seamlessly integrated these into a fusion model using state-of-the-art deep learning technology. Using the latest data, we applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance model training efficiency. The fusion model exhibited excellent prediction performance, with root mean squared error of 0.503 and correlation coefficient of 0.883. Ablation studies demonstrated that all feature levels were essential for predicting membrane permeability and confirmed the effectiveness of augmentation to improve prediction accuracy. A comparison with a molecular dynamics-based method showed that CycPeptMP accurately predicted the peptide permeability, which is otherwise difficult to predict using simulations.",

    "abstract": "Identifying differentially expressed transcripts poses a crucial yet challenging problem in transcriptomics. Substantial uncertainty is associated with the abundance estimates of certain transcripts which, if ignored, can lead to the exaggeration of false positives and, if included, may lead to reduced power. For a given set of RNA-Seq samples, TreeTerminus arranges transcripts in a hierarchical tree structure that encodes different layers of resolution for interpretation of the abundance of transcriptional groups, with uncertainty generally decreasing as one ascends the tree from the leaves. We introduce trenDi, which utilizes the tree structure from TreeTerminus for differential testing. The candidate nodes are determined in a data-driven manner to maximize the signal that can be extracted from the data while controlling for the uncertainty associated with estimating the transcript abundances. The identified candidate nodes can include transcripts and inner nodes, with no two nodes having an ancestor/descendant relationship. We evaluated our method on both simulated and experimental datasets, comparing its performance with other tree-based differential methods as well as with uncertainty-aware differential transcript/gene expression methods. Our method detects inner nodes that show a strong signal for differential expression, which would have been overlooked when analyzing the transcripts alone.",

    "abstract": "One of the critical stages of the T-cell immune response is the dimerization of the intramembrane domains of T-cell receptors (TCR). Structural similarities between the immunosuppressive domains of viral proteins and the transmembrane domains of TCR have led several authors to hypothesize the mechanism of immune response suppression by highly pathogenic viruses: viral proteins embed themselves in the membrane and act on the intramembrane domain of the TCRalpha subunit, hindering its functional oligomerization. It has also been suggested that this mechanism is used by influenza A virus in NS1-mediated immunosuppression. We have shown that the peptide corresponding to the primary structure of the potential immunosuppressive domain of NS1 protein (G51) can reduce concanavalin A-induced proliferation of PBMC cells, as well as in vitro, G51 can affect the oligomerization of the core peptide corresponding to the intramembrane domain of TCR, using AFM and small-angle neutron scattering.\n\nThe results obtained using in cellulo and in vitro model systems suggest the presence of functional interaction between the NS1 fragment and the intramembrane domain of the TCR alpha subunit. We have proposed a possible scheme for such interaction obtained by computer modeling.\n\nThis suggests the existence of another NS1-mediated mechanism of immunosuppression in influenza.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=73 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573289v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12b4ce4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c53557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30f519org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2b71bf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Muscles consume metabolic energy for force production and movement. A mathematical model of metabolic energy cost will be useful in predicting instantaneous costs during human exercise and in computing effort-minimizing movements via simulations. Previous in vivo data-derived models usually assumed either zero or linearly increasing cost with force, but a nonlinear relation could have significant metabolic or behavioural implications. Here, we show that metabolic cost scales nonlinearly with joint torque with an exponent of about 1.64, using calorimetric measurements of isometric squats. We then demonstrate that this metabolic nonlinearity is reflected in human behaviour: minimizing this nonlinear cost predicts how humans share forces between limbs in additional experiments involving arms and legs. This shows the utility of the nonlinear energy cost in predictive models and its generalizability across limbs. Finally, we show mathematical evidence that the same nonlinear metabolic objective may underlie force sharing at the muscle level.",

    "abstract": "Understanding neurodegenerative disease pathology depends on a close examination of neurons and their processes. However, image-based single-cell analyses of neurons often require laborious and time-consuming manual classification tasks. Here, we present a machine learning approach leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers that have the capability to accurately identify various classes of neuronal images, including single neurons. We developed the Single Neuron Identification Model 20-Class (SNIM20) which was trained on a dataset of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, containing over 12,000 images from 20 distinct classes. SNIM20 is built in TensorFlow and trained on images of differentiated iPSC cultures stained for nuclei and microtubules. This classifier demonstrated high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.99) for distinguishing single neurons. Additionally, the 2-stage training framework can be used more broadly for cellular classification tasks. A variation was successfully trained on images of a human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) for single-cell classification (AUC = 0.99). While this framework was primarily designed for single-cell microraft-based identification and capture, it also works with cells in standard plate formats. We additionally explore the impact of specific fluorescent channels and brightfield images, class groupings, and transfer learning on the quality of the classification. This framework can both assist in high throughput neuronal or cellular identification and be used to train a custom classifier for the users needs.",

    "abstract": "Orientation selectivity is an emergent property of visual neurons across species with columnar and non-columnar organization of the visual cortex. To compute the orientation selectivity of a neuron, a tuning function is fit on the raw responses of a neuron and then a measure, termed orientation selectivity index (OSI), is derived from this fitted curve to determine the tuning of the neuron. Previously, it has been shown that adaptation (a protocol where a neuron under observation is presented a non-optimal stimulus for a specific time) has varying effects on the tuning properties of neurons, such as, orientation, spatial frequency, motion etc. The emergence of OSI is more established in columnar cortices than the non-columnar ones. However, how adaptation impinges upon the OSI of the latter has not been systematically investigated. Here, in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we show that a 12-min adaptation protocol sharpens the OSI (tuning) of the visual neurons, underlying a specific dendritic neural mechanism, potentially facilitating the learning of novel features.",

Through a panel of genetic screens, where each sex of Plasmodium berghei was mutagenised separately with barcoded vectors, we identify 401 sex and transmission-related gene functions and define roles for hundreds of unstudied fertility genes as putative targets for transmission blocking interventions. The functional data provide a deeper understanding of female metabolic reprogramming, meiosis and the axoneme. We identify a protein complex of a SUN domain protein, SUN1, and a moonlighting putative allantoicase, ALLC1, that is essential for male fertility by linking the microtubule organising centre to the nuclear envelope and enabling mitotic spindle formation during male gametogenesis. Both proteins have orthologs in mouse testis, and the data point to an ancient role for atypical SUN domain proteins in fertility. Altogether, our data provide an unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission but also highlight ancestral aspects of sex that have evolved close to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "To ensure their survival, animals must be able to respond adaptively to threats within their environment. However, the precise neural circuit mechanisms that underlie such flexible defensive behaviors remain poorly understood. Using neuronal manipulations, machine-learning-based behavioral detection, Electron Microscopy (EM) connectomics and calcium imaging in Drosophila larva, we have mapped the second-order interneurons differentially involved in the competition between different defensive actions and the main pathways to the motor side putatively involved in inhibiting startle-type behaviors and promoting escape behaviors in a context dependent manner. We found that mechanosensory stimulation modulates the nociceptive escape sequences and inhibits C-shape bends and Rolls in favor of startle-like behaviors. This suggests a competition between mechanosensory-induced startle responses and escape behaviors. Structural and functional connectivity revealed that the second order interneurons receive their main input from projection neurons that integrate mechanosensory and nociceptive stimuli. The analysis of their postsynaptic connectivity in EM revealed that they make indirect connections to the pre-motor and motor neurons. Finally, we identify a pair of descending neurons that could promote modulate the escape sequence and promote startle behaviors. Altogether, these results characterize the pathways involved in the Startle and Escape competition, modulated by the sensory context.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol-associated memories play an important role in relapse in alcohol use disorder. Disrupting these memories, which become labile upon retrieval, through interference with their reconsolidation process, could reduce relapse. Memories are thought to be encoded within specific patterns of sparsely distributed neurons, called neuronal ensembles. Here, we explored the role of neuronal ensembles in alcohol-memory reconsolidation and relapse and characterized their transcriptional signature. Upon retrieving alcohol-related memories, we observed increased neuronal activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We established the causal role of these NAc ensembles in alcohol-memory reconsolidation using the Daun02 method with the Fos-LacZ transgenic rat, which expresses {beta}-galactosidase ({beta}-gal) under the Fos promoter, allowing the selective ablation of activated neurons. Selective inactivation of the active NAc neuronal ensemble produced a long-lasting attenuation of relapse. Through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA sequencing, we found a unique transcriptional fingerprint in activated Fos-positive neuronal ensembles in NAc following alcohol memory retrieval (vs. no retrieval controls) that was not present in the Fos-negative neurons. Our findings underscore the critical role of NAc neuronal ensembles in alcohol-associated memory reconsolidation. These neurons have a unique transcriptional profile that can provide novel targets for reducing alcohol relapse.",

    "abstract": "The precise regulation of Ca2+ signals plays a crucial role in the physiological functions of neurons. Here, we investigated the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on Ca2+ signals in hippocampal neurons. In cultured hippocampal neurons, glucocorticoids inhibited the spontaneous somatic Ca2+ spikes generated by Kv2.1-organized Ca2+ microdomains. Furthermore, glucocorticoids rapidly reduced the cell surface expressions of Kv2.1 and CaV1.2 channels in hippocampal neurons. In HEK293 cells transfected with Kv2.1 alone, glucocorticoids significantly reduced the surface expression of Kv2.1 with little effect on K+ currents. Glucocorticoids inhibited CaV1.2 currents but had no effect on the cell surface expression of CaV1.2 in HEK293 cells transfected with CaV1.2 alone. Notably, in the presence of wild-type Kv2.1, glucocorticoids caused a decrease in the surface expression of CaV1.2 channels in HEK293 cells. However, this effect was not observed in the presence of non-clustering Kv2.1S586A mutant channels. Live cell imaging showed that glucocorticoids rapidly decreased Kv2.1 clusters on the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, western blot results indicated a significant increase in the cytoplasmic level of Kv2.1, suggesting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 clusters. Glucocorticoids rapidly decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration and the phosphorylation level of PKA in hippocampal neurons. The PKA inhibitor H89 mimicked the effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.1, while the PKA agonist forskolin abrogated the effect. In conclusion, glucocorticoids rapidly regulate CaV1.2-mediated Ca2+ signals in hippocampal neurons by promoting the endocytosis of Kv2.1 channel clusters through reducing PKA activity.\n\nSignificance StatementThe rapid non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids on the central nervous system is not fully understood. CaV1.2-mediated Ca2+ signaling microdomains control somatic Ca2+ signals and regulate excitation-transcription coupling in hippocampal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that glucocorticoids rapidly inhibit CaV1.2-mediated somatic Ca2+ spikes in hippocampal neurons. Glucocorticoids reduce the surface expression of Kv2.1 clusters but do not affect the surface expression of non-clustering Kv2.1. Moreover, glucocorticoids induce the endocytosis of CaV1.2 channels through wild-type Kv2.1. However, glucocorticoids cannot induce the endocytosis of CaV1.2 channels through Kv2.1S586A mutant channels, which cannot form clusters. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay between glucocorticoids, Kv2.1 channels, and CaV1.2 channels, unraveling a dual mechanism that influences both overall Ca2+ signaling and the intricate organization of neural microdomains.",

    "abstract": "Assigning neurotransmitter identity to neurons is key to understanding information flow in a nervous system. It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. Neurotransmitter identities have been assigned to most neurons in the C. elegans nervous system through the expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant cis-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 13 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered reporter knock-in strains, which report on the deployment of all main types of neurotransmitters in C. elegans (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, tyramine, and octopamine) throughout the entire nervous system of both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia and defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic. Furthermore, we also identified unusual combinations of expression of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive nervous system-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "We previously found that uptake of cellular debris prompts conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) to undergo maturation. This transformation results in DCs entering the molecular state termed  mregDC. In this state, mregDCs dampen their ability to acquire new antigens, upregulate chemokine receptors to migrate to lymphoid organs, and upregulate MHC-I and -II, co-stimulatory, and -inhibitory molecules to promote the differentiation of antigen-specific T cells. Here, we show that cholesterol mobilization - through both de novo synthesis and the acquisition of the metabolite during debris uptake - drives cDCs to mature into mregDCs. This cholesterol is used to assemble lipid nanodomains on the plasma membrane of mregDCs to support cell surface expression of maturation markers. This process is dependent on both de novo synthesis and Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), which shuttles cholesterol from the endolysosomal pathway. Specifically, NPC1 mediated the accumulation of IFN-{gamma} receptor (IFN{gamma}R) in cell surface lipid nanodomains, enabling optimal IFN{gamma}R signaling required for IL-12 production and efficient T cell activation. Importantly, we also show that the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL constitutively dampens the cholesterol-dependent construction of lipid nanodomains on mregDCs; its deletion from cDCs enhance mregDC immunogenicity and yielded potent anti-tumor immunity in an experimental model of lung cancer. Altogether, our findings present novel insights into the mobilization of cholesterol for proper immune receptor signaling as a basis for cDC maturation and the novel role of AXL as a central regulator of this process that can be therapeutically targeted to leverage the immunostimulatory features of mregDCs.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic Th17 cells are crucial to CNS autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), though their control by endogenous mechanisms is unknown. RNAseq analysis of brain glial cells identified immuno-responsive gene 1 (Irg1), a mitochondrial-related enzyme-coding gene, as one of the highly upregulated gene under inflammatory conditions which were further validated in the spinal cord of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Moreover, Irg1 mRNA and protein levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells were higher in the EAE group, raising questions about its function in CNS autoimmunity. We observed that Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease and greater mononuclear cell infiltration, including triple-positive CD4 cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFN{gamma}. Lack of Irg1 in macrophages led to higher levels of Class II expression and polarized myelin primed CD4 cells into pathogenic Th17 cells through the NLRP3/IL1{beta} axis. Our findings show that Irg1 in macrophages plays an important role in the formation of pathogenic Th17 cells, emphasizing its potential as a therapy for autoimmune diseases, including MS.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac disease and represents a viable therapeutic target for heart failure. Cardiac injury elicits recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and T-cells. Monocytes and their progeny represent are highly abundant, display incredible functional diversity, and are key determinants of myocardial inflammation. Much remains to be learned regarding mechanisms and signaling events that instruct monocyte fate decisions. We devised a genetic lineage tracing strategy using Ccr2crERT2Rosa2LSL-tdTomato mice in combination with single cell RNA-sequencing to map the fate and differentiation trajectories of monocytes that infiltrate the heart after reperfused myocardial infarction (MI). We observe that monocyte recruitment is restricted to the first 5 days following MI. Infiltrating monocytes give rise to transcriptionally distinct and spatially restricted macrophage and dendritic cell-like subsets, dynamically shift over time, and chronically persist within the myocardium. Pseudotime analysis predicted two differentiation trajectories of monocyte-derived macrophages that are initially partitioned into the border and infarct zones, respectively. Among these trajectories, we show that macrophages expressing a type I IFN responsive signature are an intermediate population localized within the border zone and promote myocardial protection. Collectively, these data uncover new complexities of monocyte differentiation in the infarcted heart and suggest that modulating monocyte fate decisions may have clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics offers unprecedented challenges in characterizing tumor ecosystems, encompassing tumor cells and their surrounding tumor microenvironments (TME) along with cellular interactions therein. Here, we conducted Visium-based spatial transcriptomics on nine primary gastric cancers (GC) to translate the spatial organization of GC ecosystems into the functional landscape of cellular crosstalk across malignant, stromal and immune cells. We identified three distinct GC subtypes of 3 immunogenic, 3 epithelial and 3 stromal GCs with elevated infiltration of immune, malignant cells and fibroblasts reflecting the heterogeneity of the cell types and their interactions in GC TME. GC spatial architecture was further delineated into 6 regional compartments with varying degree of TME infiltration, among which the fibroblast-enriched TME was associated with the upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and immune response in malignant and immune cells, respectively. Cell type-specific transcriptional dynamics representing cellular crosstalk between TME cells were further identified, e.g., the infiltration of malignant and endothelial cells promote the cellular proliferations of TME cells whereas the fibroblasts and immune cells are associated with pro-cancer and anti-cancer immunity, respectively. Ligand-receptor analysis further revealed that CCL2-expressing fibroblasts promote the pro-cancer signaling of immune cells including JAK-STAT3 signaling and inflammatory response in tumor-infiltration macrophages. The CCL2+fibroblasts and macrophages with activated JAK-STAT3 signals are co-localized in spatial GC architecture and their co-abundance was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Taken together, GC spatial transcriptomes can be regionally and functionally delineated into functional cellular crosstalk involving multiple cell types with potential clinical relevance, particularly the interaction between CCL2+ fibroblasts and JAK-STAT3+macrophages contributing to cancer-favoring immune contexture in GC TME.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCell free DNA (cfDNA)-based assays hold great potential in detecting early cancer signals yet determining the tissue-of-origin (TOO) for cancer signals remains a challenging task. Here, we investigated the contribution of a methylation atlas to TOO detection in low depth cfDNA samples.\n\nMethodsWe constructed a tumor-specific methylation atlas (TSMA) using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data from five types of tumor tissues (breast, colorectal, gastric, liver and lung cancer) and paired white blood cells (WBC). TSMA was used with a non-negative least square matrix factorization (NNLS) deconvolution algorithm to identify the abundance of tumor tissue types in a WGBS sample. We showed that TSMA worked well with tumor tissue but struggled with cfDNA samples due to the overwhelming amount of WBC-derived DNA. To construct a model for TOO, we adopted the multi-modal strategy and used as inputs the combination of deconvolution scores from TSMA with other features of cfDNA.\n\nResultsOur final model comprised of a graph convolutional neural network using deconvolution scores and genome-wide methylation density features, which achieved an accuracy of 69% in a held-out validation dataset of 239 low-depth cfDNA samples.\n\nConclusionsIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that our TSMA in combination with other cfDNA features can improve TOO detection in low-depth cfDNA samples.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axis plays a significant role in modulating T-cell infiltration into the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Despite promising preclinical findings, clinical trials combining inhibitors of CXCR4 (AMD3100/BL-8040) and anti-programmed death 1/ligand1 (anti-PD1/PD-L1) have failed to improve outcomes.\n\nExperimental DesignWe utilized a novel ex vivo autologous patient-derived immune/organoid (PDIO) co-culture system using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and patient derived tumor organoids, and in vivo the autochthonous LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) pancreatic cancer mouse model to interrogate the effects of either monotherapy or all combinations of gemcitabine, AMD3100, and anit-PD1 on CD8+ T cell activation and survival.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that disruption of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis using AMD3100 leads to increased migration and activation of CD8+ T-cells. In addition, when combined with the cytotoxic chemotherapy gemcitabine, CXCR4 inhibition further potentiated CD8+ T-cell activation. We next tested the combination of gemcitabine, CXCR4 inhibition, and anti-PD1 in the KPC pancreatic cancer mouse model and demonstrate that this combination markedly impacted the tumor immune microenvironment by increasing infiltration of natural killer cells, the ratio of CD8+ to regulatory T-cells, and tumor cell death while decreasing tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, this combination extended survival in KPC mice.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that combining gemcitabine with CXCR4 inhibiting agents and anti-PD1 therapy controls tumor growth by reducing immunosuppression and potentiating immune cell activation and therefore may represent a novel approach to treating pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a collective term for disorders of the heart and blood vessels. The molecular events and biochemical pathways associated with CVD are difficult to study in clinical settings on patients and in vitro conditions. Animal models play a pivotal and indispensable role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research. Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode species, has emerged as a prominent experimental organism widely utilised in various biomedical research fields. However, the specific number of CVD-related genes and pathways within the C. elegans genome remains undisclosed to date, limiting its in-depth utilisation for investigations. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genes and pathways related to CVD within the genomes of humans and C. elegans through a systematic bioinformatic approach.\n\nA total of 1113 genes in C. elegans orthologous to the most significant CVD-related genes in humans were identified, and the GO terms and pathways were compared to study the pathways that are conserved between the two species. In order to infer the functions of CVD-related orthologous genes in C. elegans, a PPI network was constructed. Orthologous gene PPI network analysis results reveal the hubs and important KRs: pmk-1, daf-21, gpb-1, crh-1, enpl-1, eef-1G, acdh-8, hif-1, pmk-2, andaha-1 in C. elegans. Modules were identified for determining the role of the orthologous genes at various levels in the created network. We also identified 9 commonly enriched pathways between humans and C. elegans linked with CVDs that include autophagy (animal), the ErbB signalling pathway, the FoxO signalling pathway, the MAPK signalling pathway, ABC transporters, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and metabolic pathways. This study provides the first systematic genomic approach to explore the CVD-associated genes and pathways that are present in C. elegans, supporting the use of C. elegans as a prominent animal model organism for cardiovascular diseases.",
