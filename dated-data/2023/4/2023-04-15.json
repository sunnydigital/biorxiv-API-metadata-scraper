    "abstract": "Efficient metabolic waste clearance is essential for optimal brain function. Waste accumulation can cause inflammation, tissue damage, and potentially lead to dementia and other neurological disorders. The primary waste exit route is debated, with evidence suggesting the lymphatic system or arachnoid villi/granulations as possible pathways.\n\nThis study uses an ultrastructural dataset to emphasize the potential underestimation of macrophages and arachnoid villi/granulations in waste removal.\n\nBased on brain surface ultrastructure analysis of the MICrONS dataset, waste clearance may occur through a transcellular route involving astrocytes to the perivascular space. Waste is then either phagocytosed by perivascular macrophages or directed to the subarachnoid space for meningeal macrophage phagocytosis.\n\nEvidence is provided that macrophages transport non-degradable waste in lysosomes to arachnoid villi for exocytosis into the villus lumen and venous system routing. Additionally, the study investigates fibroblast-macrophage interactions via primary cilia, potentially optimizing waste clearance. The role of astrocytes in brain water homeostasis and GFAPs potential significance in water filtration are also examined. This study offers valuable insights into waste clearance mechanisms in the brain, potentially aiding dementia understanding and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cell (SMC) accumulation is central to the pathogenesis of elastin-defective arterial diseases, such as atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). We previously demonstrated that elastin insufficiency activates the Notch pathway in aortic SMCs, resulting in hypermuscularization. Activation of Notch is catalyzed by the enzyme gamma-secretase, but the role of specific catalytic subunits PSEN-1 or PSEN-2 in elastin aortopathy is not defined. This study utilizes genetic approaches to query the role of PSEN-1/2 in the pathogenesis of elastin mutant mice, which model human SVAS. Although endothelial cell-specific Psen1 deletion does not improve elastin aortopathy, deletion of either Psen1 in SMCs or Psen2 globally attenuates Notch downstream gene expression and SMC proliferation, mitigating aortic disease. With SMC-specific Psen1 deletion in elastin nulls, these rescue effects are more robust and in fact, survival is increased. On the background of Psen1 deletion in SMCs, global Psen2 deletion yields additional benefits in regard to elastin aortopathy. Finally, SMC deletion of Psen1 also attenuates hypermuscularization in newborns heterozygous for the elastin null gene, which genetically mimics SVAS. Taken together, these findings put forth SMC PSEN-1 as a potential therapeutic target in elastin aortopathy.",

    "abstract": "Blood filtering by the kidney requires the establishment of an intricate vascular system that works to support body fluid and organ homeostasis. Despite these critical roles, little is known about how vascular architecture is established during kidney development. More specifically, how signals from the kidney influence vessel maturity and patterning remains poorly understood. Netrin-1 (Ntn1) is a secreted ligand critical for vessel and neuronal guidance. Here, we demonstrate that Ntn1 is expressed by stromal progenitors in the developing kidney, and conditional deletion of Ntn1 from Foxd1+ stromal progenitors (Foxd1GC/+;Ntn1fl/fl) results in hypoplastic kidneys that display extended nephrogenesis. Despite expression of the netrin-1 receptor Unc5c in the adjacent nephron progenitor niche, Unc5c knockout kidneys develop normally. The netrin-1 receptor Unc5b is expressed by embryonic kidney endothelium and therefore we interrogated the vascular networks of Foxd1GC/+;Ntn1fl/fl kidneys. Wholemount, 3D analyses revealed the loss of a predictable vascular pattern in mutant kidneys. As vascular patterning has been linked to vessel maturity, we investigated arterialization in these mutants. Quantification of the CD31+ endothelium at E15.5 revealed no differences in metrics such as the number of branches or branch points, whereas the arterial vascular smooth muscle metrics were significantly reduced at both E15.5 and P0. In support of these results, whole kidney RNA-seq showed upregulation of angiogenic programs and downregulation of muscle-related programs which included smooth muscle-associated genes. Together, our findings highlight the significance of netrin-1 to proper vascularization and kidney development.",

    "abstract": "The kidney vasculature has a uniquely complex architecture that is essential to proper renal function. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that direct where and when blood vessels form during kidney development. We identified a regionally-restricted, stroma-derived signaling molecule, netrin-1 (Ntn1), as a putative regulator of vascular patterning. We generated a stromal progenitor-specific knockout of netrin-1 (Ntn1SPKO) that resulted in smaller postnatal kidneys with altered epithelial development and profound defects in arterial and capillary architecture. We also found significant loss of arterial vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) coverage and ectopic smooth muscle cell deposition at the kidney cortex. Transcriptomic analysis of Ntn1SPKO kidneys revealed downregulation of Klf4, which we find expressed in stromal progenitors. Deletion of Klf4 in the stroma largely phenocopies loss of Ntn1, and expression of Klf4 in Ntn1SPKO kidneys rescues ectopic vSMC deposition. Vascular defects observed in Ntn1SPKO are transient, as both arterial and smooth muscle coverage defects resolve late in development, however ectopic peripheral smooth muscle perdures perinatally. These data suggest a stromal-intrinsic Ntn1-Klf4 axis acting as an essential mediator of stromal crosstalk and vascular progenitor differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Early-life stress and ovarian hormones contribute to increased female vulnerability to cocaine addiction. Here we reveal molecular substrates in the key reward area, the nucleus accumbens, through which these female-specific factors affect immediate and conditioning responses to cocaine in mice. We find shared involvement of X chromosome and estrogen signaling gene regulation in enhanced conditioning responses seen after early-life stress and during the low-estrogenic state in females. During the low-estrogenic state, females respond to acute cocaine exposure by increasing the accessibility of neuronal chromatin enriched for the binding sites of {Delta}FosB, a transcription factor implicated in chronic cocaine response and addiction. Conversely, high-estrogenic females respond to cocaine by preferential closing of neuronal chromatin, providing a mechanism for limiting cocaine-driven chromatin and synaptic plasticity. We find that physiological estrogen withdrawal, exposure to early-life stress, and absence of the second X chromosome all nullify the protective effect of high-estrogenic state on cocaine conditioning in females. Our findings offer a molecular framework to understand sex-specific neuronal mechanisms underlying cocaine use disorder.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring the intra-erythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum, the host erythrocyte invasion is regarded as a complex and tightly regulated process comprising multiple receptor-ligand interactions, and numerous secretory molecules. Proteins secreted sequentially from apical organelles of merozoites serve as adhesins that play a crucial role in RBC invasion and can serve as vaccine and therapeutic targets.\n\nMethodsPurified merozoites were triggered to discharge apical organelle contents by exposure to ionic conditions mimicking that of blood plasma. The secreted proteins were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry, and a well-characterized invasion ligand, RhopH3, was identified. A novel RhopH3 receptor, 14-3-3{square} was unearthed using a Bacterial two-hybrid approach. This interaction was confirmed using multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches. We were successful in disrupting this interaction using a de novo peptide binder of 14-3-3{square}, and we subsequently assessed its effect on merozoite invasion.\n\nResultsA total of 66 proteins were identified in the secretory fraction with apical organellar or merozoite membrane localization. The well-known adhesin, RhopH3 was also identified and its interaction with the host phosphopeptide-binding protein, 14-3-3{square} was established. We also discovered a de novo peptide with the potency to disrupt this crucial interaction, thereby blocking merozoite invasion.\n\nConclusionWe, for the first time, report the secretory repertoire of plasmodium merozoite. Our study shows the importance of the erythrocyte protein, 14-3-3{square} during the invasion process and paves the way for developing anti-malarial peptides or small molecules that inhibit the host-pathogen interaction, hence abrogating the invasion process.",

    "abstract": "The study of microbiota has been revolutionized by the development of DNA metabarcoding. This sequence-based approach enables the direct detection of microorganisms without the need for culture and isolation, which significantly reduces analysis time and offers more comprehensive taxonomic profiles across broad phylogenetic lineages. While there has been an accumulating number of researches on bacteria, molecular phylogenetic analysis of fungi still remains challenging due to the lack of standardized tools and the incompleteness of reference databases limiting the accurate and precise identification of fungal taxa. Here, we present a DNA metabarcoding workflow for characterizing fungal microbiota with high taxonomic resolution. This method involves amplifying longer stretches of ribosomal RNA operons and sequencing them using nanopore long-read sequencing technology. The resulting reads were error-polished to generate consensus sequences with 99.5-100% accuracy, which were then aligned against reference genome assemblies. The efficacy of this method was explored using a polymicrobial mock community and patient-derived specimens, demonstrating the marked potential of long-read sequencing combined with consensus calling for accurate taxonomic classification. Our approach offers a powerful tool for the rapid identification of pathogenic fungi and has the promise to significantly improve our understanding of the role of fungi in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition of the vaginal microbiome in which there are lower levels of \"healthy\" Lactobacillus species and an outgrowth of diverse anaerobic bacteria. BV is associated with increased risk of infection by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae - the causative agent of gonorrhea. Here we test if one known facet of BV - the presence of bacterial cytolysins - leads to the mobilization of specific intracellular contents that aid in gonococcal virulence. We cloned and expressed recombinant vaginolysin (VLY), a cytolysin produced by the BV-associated bacterium Gardnerella, verifying that it liberates the contents of red blood cells and cervical epithelial (HeLa) cells while vector control preparations made in parallel did not. We tested if VLY mediates a well-known virulence mechanism of gonococcus - the molecular mimicry of host glycans. To evade host immunity, N. gonorrhoeae caps its surface lipooligosaccharide (LOS) with 2-3-linked sialic acid. To do this, gonococci must scavenge an intermediate metabolite made and used inside host cells. Flow-cytometry based lectin-binding assays showed that, compared to controls, gonococci exposed to vaginolysin-liberated contents of HeLa cells displayed greater sialic acid capping of their LOS. This higher level of bacterial sialylation was accompanied by increased binding of the complement regulatory protein Factor H, and greater resistance to complement attack. Together these results suggest that cytolytic activities present during BV may enhance the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to capture intracellular metabolites and evade host immunity via glycan molecular mimicry.",

    "abstract": "A multi-layered structure known as the cell envelope separates the controlled interior of bacterial cells from a fluctuating physical and chemical environment. The transcription of genes that determine cell envelope structure and function is commonly regulated by two-component signaling systems (TCS), comprising a sensor histidine kinase and a cognate response regulator. To discover TCS genes that contribute to cell envelope function in the intracellular mammalian pathogen, Brucella ovis, we subjected a comprehensive collection of non-essential TCS deletion mutants to compounds that disrupt cell membranes and the peptidoglycan cell wall. Our screen led to the discovery of three TCS proteins that coordinately function to confer resistance to cell envelope stressors and to support B. ovis replication in the intracellular niche. This tripartite regulatory system includes the conserved envelope regulator, CenR, and a previously uncharacterized TCS, EssR-EssS. The CenR and EssR response regulators bind a shared set of sites on the B. ovis chromosomes to control transcription of an overlapping set of genes with cell envelope functions. CenR directly interacts with EssR and functions to stimulate phosphoryl transfer from the EssS kinase to EssR and control steady-state levels of EssR protein in the cell. Our data provide evidence for a new mode of TCS cross-regulation in which a non-cognate response regulator regulates both activity and cellular levels of a cognate TCS protein pair.\n\nSignificanceBrucella species are the etiologic agents of brucellosis, a disease that inflicts a significant burden on global human health and agricultural production. As intracellular pathogens, Brucella must contend with a variety of host-derived stressors when infecting a host cell. The inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane -- i.e. the cell envelope -- of Brucella provides a critical barrier to host assault. A conserved regulatory mechanism known as two component signaling (TCS) commonly controls transcription of genes that determine the structure and biochemical composition of the cell envelope during stress. The importance of this study lies in the identification of previously uncharacterized TCS genes that determine B. ovis survival in the presence of cell envelope disruptors and within infected mammalian host cells. Our study has further uncovered a new molecular mechanism of TCS gene regulation, and thereby advances fundamental understanding of transcriptional regulatory processes in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is well known for its ability to develop competence for natural DNA transformation. Competence development is regulated by an autocatalytic loop driven by variations in the basal level of transcription of the comCDE and comAB operons. These genes are part of the early gene regulon that controls expression of the late competence genes known to encode the apparatus of transformation. Several stressful conditions are known to promote competence development, although the induction pathways are remain poorly understood so far. To date there have been no reports of the response of the pneumococcal competence regulon to changes in the physical conditions of the environment, oxidative potential and temperature. Here we demonstrate that transient temperature elevation induces an immediate increase in the basal expression level of the comCDE operon and early genes that, in turn, stimulates its full induction, including that of the late competence regulon. This thermal regulation depends on the HtrA chaperone/protease and its proteolytic activity. We find that certain other competence induction stimuli are not conveyed by the HtrA-dependent pathway. This finding strongly supports that competence can be induced by any of several independent pathways and thus reinforces the view that competence is a general stress response system in the pneumococcus.\n\nAuthors summaryStreptococcus pneumoniae is a commensal bacterium and an opportunistic pathogen of humans. Certain environmental stimuli, such as a variety of antibiotics targeting distinct cellular functions, trigger the induction of the distinct physiological state of competence, in which cells can, among other things, import and integrate external DNA. Competence is thus considered a general stress response in this highly adaptable species. To understand the role of competence in pneumococcal interaction with its host and in pathogenicity, we attempted to decipher the pathways that enable appropriate reactions to environmental stress, and have focused here on induction of competence by elevation of temperature to levels similar to that of a host in fever. We found that elevated temperature raises the basal expression level of the competence control operon, and thus lowers the threshold of transition to full competence induction. By genetic characterisation of the thermal induction pathway of competence, we demonstrated that the chaperone/protease HtrA is essential to relaying of the thermal signal but is not involved in transmitting other stimuli such as those arising from the presence of certain antibiotics. Our work supports the view that competence can be induced through various pathways in response to distinct aggressions, but also by fever-like bursts of temperature that the pneumococcus could face in its natural habitat.",

A study on Astrovirus circulation and diversity in different insectivorous and frugivorous chiropteran species roosting in trees, caves and building basements was carried out at 11 different sites across Zimbabwe. Pooled and individual faecal sampling methods were used for this study, collection date ranged from June 2016 to July 2021. In two sites, Magweto and Chirundu, sampling was carried out at monthly intervals from August 2020 to July 2021. Astroviruses and bat mitochondrial genes were amplified using pan-AstVs and CytB /12S RNA PCR systems respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp Astrovirus sequences revealed a high genetic diversity of astroviruses. All the bat astroviruses tested in this study clustered with the Mamastrovirus genus. Two distinct groups of the amplified sequences were identified. One group comprised of sequences isolated from Hipposideros, Rhinolophus and E. helvum spp clustered with Human Astrovirus strains: HuAstV types1-6, HuAstV-MLB1-3 and HuAstV-VA-1. A second group comprised of the majority of the sequences clustered with different strains of Bat AstVs. Results from the longitudinal study at Magweto and Chirundu showed an overall AstV prevalence of 13.7% and 10.4% respectively. Peaks of AstV infection at Chirundu coincided with the period when juveniles are 4-6 months old. Coinfection of bats with CoVs and AstVs at Magweto and Chirundu sites was 2.6% and 3.5% respectively.",

We performed an arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 scan of the genome in primary human cells, targeting 17,065 genes for knockout with 101,029 guides. High-dimensional phenomics reveals a \"proximity bias\" in which CRISPR knockouts bear unexpected phenotypic similarity to knockouts of biologically-unrelated genes on the same chromosome arm, recapitulating both canonical genome structure and structural variants. Transcriptomics connects proximity bias to chromosome-arm truncations. Analysis of published large-scale knockout and knockdown experiments confirms that this effect is general across cell types, labs, Cas9 delivery mechanisms, and assay modalities, and suggests proximity bias is caused by DNA double-strand-breaks with cell cycle control in a mediating role.

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a majority of biotherapeutics on the market today. These glycoproteins undergo post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, that influence the structural & functional characteristics of the antibody. Glycosylation is a heterogenous post-translational modification that may influence therapeutic glycoprotein stability and clinical efficacy, which is why it is often considered a critical quality attribute (CQA) of the mAb product. While much is known about the glycosylation pathways of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and how cell culture chemical modifiers may influence the N-glycosylation profile of the final product, this knowledge is often based on the final cumulative glycan profile at the end of the batch process. Building a temporal understanding of N-glycosylation and how mAb glycoform composition responds to real-time changes in the biomanufacturing process will help build integrated process models that may allow for glycosylation control to produce a more homogenous product. Here, we look at the effect of specific nutrient feed media additives (e.g., galactose, manganese) and feeding times on the N-glycosylation pathway to modulate N-glycosylation of a Herceptin biosimilar mAb (i.e., Trastuzumab). We deploy the N-GLYcanyzer process analytical technology (PAT) to monitor glycoforms in near real-time for bench-scale bioprocesses operated in both fed-batch and perfusion modes to build an understanding of how temporal changes in mAb N-glycosylation are dependent on specific media additives. We find that Trastuzumab terminal galactosylation is sensitive to media feeding times and intracellular nucleotide sugar pools. Temporal analysis reveals an increased desirable production of single and double galactose-occupied glycoforms over time under glucose-starved fed-batch cultures. Comparable galactosylation profiles were also observed between fed-batch (nutrient-limited) and perfusion (non-nutrient-limited) bioprocess conditions. In summary, our results demonstrate the utility of real-time monitoring of mAb glycoforms and feeding critical cell culture nutrients under fed-batch and perfusion bioprocessing conditions to produce higher-quality biologics.",

    "abstract": "Cyanophycin is a natural polymer composed of a poly-aspartate backbone with arginine attached to each of the aspartate sidechains. Produced by a wide range of bacteria, which mainly use it as a store of fixed nitrogen, it has many promising industrial applications. Cyanophycin can be synthesized from the amino acids Asp and Arg by the widespread cyanophycin synthetase 1 (CphA1), or from the dipeptide {beta}-Asp-Arg by the cyanobacterial enzyme cyanophycin synthetase 2 (CphA2). CphA2 enzymes display a range of oligomeric states, from dimers to dodecamers. Recently, the crystal structure of a CphA2 dimer was solved but could not be obtained in complex with substrate. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the hexameric CphA2 from Stanieria sp. at ~2.8 [A] resolution, both with and without ATP and cyanophycin. The structures show a trimer-of-dimers hexameric architecture, and substrate-binding interactions that are similar to those of CphA1. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrate the importance of several conserved substrate-binding residues. We also find that a Q416A/R528G double mutation prevents hexamer formation and use this double mutant to show that hexamerization augments the rate of cyanophycin synthesis. Together, these results increase our mechanistic understanding of how an interesting green polymer is biosynthesized.",

    "abstract": "The STING pathway is the first line of defense against a variety of threats. STING activation leads to two main signaling branches, IRF3 signaling and NF-{kappa}B signaling, that have differential roles in anti-cancer, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial immunity and autoimmunity. However, it is unknown how these two signaling branches are differentially regulated depending on context. Here, we identify PELI2 as a regulator of STING that preferentially inhibits IRF3 signaling while enhancing NF-{kappa}B signaling. Mechanistically, we show that PELI2 inhibits IRF3 signaling by binding to phosphorylated Thr354 and Thr356 on the C-terminal tail of STING, leading to ubiquitination and function switching of TBK1. PELI2 is expressed under basal conditions to suppress IRF3 signaling and prevent interferonopathies. During viral infection, however, STING signaling rapidly downregulates PELI2 to unleash production of anti-viral type-I interferons. Normally, PELI2 levels are restored following viral clearance. However, lupus patients have insufficient PELI2 levels and high basal interferon production, suggesting dysregulation of PELI2 may have a causative role in lupus and other interferonopathies.",

    "abstract": "Cells migrate by adapting their leading-edge behaviours to heterogeneous extracellular microenvironments (ECMs) during cancer invasions and immune responses. Yet it remains poorly understood how such complicated dynamic behaviours emerge from millisecond-scale assembling activities of protein molecules, which are hard to probe experimentally. To address this gap, we established a spatiotemporal \"resistance-adaptive propulsion\" theory based on the protein interactions between Arp2/3 complexes and polymerizing actin filaments, and a multiscale dynamic modelling system spanning from molecular proteins to the cell. Combining spatiotemporal simulations with experiments, we quantitatively find that cells can accurately self-adapt propulsive forces to overcome heterogeneous ECMs via a resistance-triggered positive feedback mechanism, dominated by polymerization-induced actin filament bending and the bending-regulated actin-Arp2/3 binding. However, for high resistance regions, resistance triggered a negative feedback, hindering branched filament assembly, which adapts cellular morphologies to circumnavigate the obstacles. Strikingly, the synergy of the two opposite feedbacks not only empowers cells with both powerful and flexible migratory capabilities to deal with complex ECMs, but also endows cells to use their intracellular proteins efficiently. In addition, we identify that the nature of cell migration velocity depending on ECM history stems from the inherent temporal hysteresis of cytoskeleton remodelling. We also quantitatively show that directional cell migration is dictated by the competition between the local stiffness of ECMs and the local polymerizing rate of actin network caused by chemotactic cues. Our results reveal that it is the polymerization force-regulated actin filament-Arp2/3 complex binding interaction that dominates self-adaptive cell migrations in complex ECMs, and we provide a predictive theory and a spatiotemporal multiscale modelling system at the protein level.",

Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we explore the phenotypic space of growth and development in various genetic and environmental contexts. Our data are growth curves and developmental parameters obtained by automated microscopy. Using these, we show that among the traits that make up the developmental space, correlations within a particular context are predictive of correlations among different contexts. Further we find that the developmental variability of this animal can be captured on a relatively low dimensional phenoptypic manifold and that on this manifold, genetic and environmental contributions to plasticity can be deconvolved independently. Our perspective offers a new way of understanding the relationship between robustness and flexibility in complex systems, suggesting that projection and concentration of dimension can naturally align these forces as complementary rather than competing.",

    "abstract": "Halophilic fungi, which thrive in hypersaline habitats and face a range of extreme conditions. These fungal species have gained considerable attention due to their potential applications in harsh industrial processes, such as bioremediation and fermentation under unfavorable conditions of hypersalinity, low water activity, and extreme pH. However, the role of the cell wall in surviving these environmental conditions remains unclear. Here we employ solid-state NMR spectroscopy to compare the cell wall architecture of Aspergillus sydowii across salinity gradients. Analyses of intact cells reveal that A. sydowii cell walls contain a rigid core comprising chitin, {beta}-glucan, and chitosan, shielded by a surface shell composed of galactomannan and galactosaminogalactan. When exposed to hypersaline conditions, A. sydowii enhances chitin biosynthesis and incorporates -glucan to create thick, stiff, and hydrophobic cell walls. Such structural rearrangements enable the fungus to adapt to both hypersaline and salt-deprived conditions, providing a robust mechanism for withstanding external stress. These molecular principles can aid in the optimization of halophilic strains for biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "The rate of translation elongation in Escherichia coli is limited by diffusive transport of matching aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to ribosomes. Our previous work revealed that, as cell growth quickens, stoichiometric crowding speeds this diffusive search by optimizing encounters between cognate translation molecules, inclusive of chemical kinetics taken from in vitro experiments. However, we predicted absolute elongation rates three-fold slower than in vivo measurements. We hypothesized that  pre-loading of EF-Tu{middle dot}GTP{middle dot}aa-tRNA ternary complexes onto ribosomal L7/L12 subunits - suggested experimentally but not included in our initial model - might further speed elongation and close this gap. Here, we develop a first-principles physico-chemical model of the E. coli cytoplasm including explicit EF-Tu{middle dot}L7/L12 interactions and elongation reaction kinetics, which quantitatively predicts in vivo binding and rheology. Our model reveals that transient co-localization of the translation machinery by EF-Tu{middle dot}L7/L12 interactions shortens wait times at the ribosomal A-site, doubling elongation speed and improving prediction of the absolute elongation rate. We posit pre-loading efficiency as a competition between durable binding and frequent sampling of new ternary complexes, and show that the naturally-observed E. coli copy number of four L7/L12 subunits optimizes this tradeoff. Paired with literature data supporting a correlation between lower L7/L12 copy number and faster bacterial growth rate, we suggest a colloidal-scale evolutionary and functional advantage of having fewer L7/L12 per ribosome: frequent ternary complex sampling in dense, fast-growing cytoplasm.",

Additionally, we discovered that Vibrio suppresses host interferon signaling, and that ectopic activation of interferon significantly alters the course of infection. Notably, we also found that the adult zebrafish gut shares many similarities with mammalian counterparts, including the presence of previously undescribed Best4+ cells, tuft cells, and a population of basal cycling cells.

    "abstract": "The decline in gut microbial diversity of modern human is closely associated with the rising prevalence of various diseases. It is imperative to investigate the underlying causes of gut microbial loss and the rescue measures. Although the impact of non-perinatal antibiotic use on gut microbiota has been recognized, its intergenerational effects remain unexplored. Our previous research has highlighted soil in the farm environment as a key prebiotic for gut microbiome health by restoring gut microbial diversity and balance. In this study, we investigated the intergenerational consequences of antibiotic exposure and the therapeutic potential of soil prebiotics. We treated mice with vancomycin and streptomycin for 2 weeks continuously, followed by 4-8 weeks of withdrawal period before breeding. The process was repeated across 3 generations. Half of the mice in each generation received an oral soil prebiotic intervention. We assessed gut microbial diversity, anxiety behavior, microglia reactivity, and gut barrier integrity across generations. The antibiotics exposure led to a decrease in gut microbial diversity over generations, along with aggravated anxiety behavior, microglia abnormalityies, and altered intestinal tight junction protein expression. Notably, the third generation of male mice exhibited impaired reproductive capacity. Oral sterile soil intervention restored gut microbial diversity in adult mice across generations, concomitantly rescuing abnormalities in behavior, microglia activity, and intestinal barrier integrity. In conclusion, this study simulated an important process of the progressive loss gut microbiota diversity in modern human and demonstrated the potential of sterile soil as a prebiotic to reverse this process. The study provides a theoretical and experimental basis for the research and therapeutic interventions targeting multiple modern chronic diseases related to intestinal microorganisms.",

Here, using micrococcal nuclease-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, macrophage-signalling and genetic analyses, we demonstrate that chromatin reorganization in macrophage-internalized Cg, via CgSnf2 (ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex), leads to upregulation and downregulation of immunosuppressive seven mannosyltransferase-cluster (CgMT-C) and immunostimulatory cell surface adhesin EPA1 genes, respectively. Consistently, EPA1 overexpression and CgMT-C deletion led to increased IL-1{beta} (pro-inflammatory cytokine) production and reduced Cg proliferation in macrophages. Further, CgSNF2 deletion evoked increased IL-1{beta} secretion, and the consequent killing of macrophage-internalized Cg, with elevated IL-1{beta} levels being partially reversed in Akt-, p38-, NF-{kappa}B- or NLRP3 inflammasome-inhibited macrophages. Importantly, macrophages respond to multiple Candida pathogens via NF-{kappa}B-dependent IL-1{beta} production, underscoring NF-{kappa}B signallings role in fungal diseases. Finally, we present the first genome-wide nucleosome map of macrophage-internalized Cg consisting of [~]12,000 dynamic and 70,000 total nucleosomes.

    "abstract": "Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is defined as the transmission of traits or gene expression patterns across multiple generations that do not derive from DNA alterations. The effect of multiple stress factors or metabolic changes resulting in such inheritance have been documented in plants, worms and flies and mammals. The molecular basis for epigenetic inheritance has been linked to histone and DNA modifications and non-coding RNA. In this study, we show that mutation of a promoter element, the CCAAT box, disrupts stable expression of an MHC Class I transgene, resulting in variegated expression among progeny for at least 4 generations in multiple independently derived transgenic lines. Histone modifications and RNA polII binding correlate with expression, whereas DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy do not. Mutation of the CCAAT box abrogates NF-Y binding and results in changes to CTCF binding and DNA looping patterns across the gene that correlate with expression status from one generation to the next. These studies identify the CCAAT promoter element as a regulator of stable transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Considering that the CCAAT box is present in 30% of eukaryotic promoters, this study could provide important insights into how fidelity of gene expression patterns is maintained through multiple generations.",

    "abstract": "Prime editor (PE) is a highly versatile CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique. The current constructs, however, have variable efficiency and may require laborious experimental optimization. This study presents statistical models for learning the salient epigenomic and sequence features of target sites modulating the editing efficiency and provides guidelines for designing optimal PEs. We found that both regional constitutive heterochromatin and local nucleosome occlusion of target sites impede editing, while position-specific G/C nucleotides in the primer binding site (PBS) and reverse transcription (RT) template regions of PE guide-RNA (pegRNA) yield high editing efficiency, especially for short PBS designs. The presence of G/C nucleotides was most critical immediately 5 to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site for all designs. The effects of different last templated nucleotides were quantified and seen to depend on both PBS and RT template lengths. Our models found AGG to be the preferred PAM and detected a guanine nucleotide four bases downstream of PAM to facilitate editing, suggesting a hitherto-unrecognized interaction with Cas9. A neural network interpretation method based on nonextensive statistical mechanics further revealed multi-nucleotide preferences, indicating dependency among several bases across pegRNA. Our work clarifies previous conflicting observations and uncovers context-dependent features important for optimizing PE designs.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas species have been extensively studied as major and model pathogens of plants. However, there is an increasing recognition of the complex and large world of non-pathogenic species of Xanthomonas in the recent decades. One pathogenic Xanthomonas species has been known in rice for the last hundred years, yet in recent years, three non-pathogenic Xanthomonas (NPX) species have been reported. Thus, there is a need to understand the species-level diversity of NPXs like their pathogenic counterparts. In the present study, we report isolation and investigation into the genomic diversity of Xanthomonas indica, a newly discovered NPX species from rice. The study allowed us to establish the relationship of X. indica strains within clade I of Xanthomonads. All the strains formed a distinct but diverse clade compared to clades corresponding to other NPX species from rice and other hosts. X. indica lacks major virulence factors found in their pathogenic counterparts. Identification of highly diverse strains and open-pan genome indicates ongoing selection to acquire new functions for adaptation. X. indica also harbours large-scale interstrain variations in the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthetic gene cluster, which hints at the selection at this locus. Interestingly, all the diverse strains of X. indica were able to protect rice from bacterial leaf blight pathogen of rice upon leaf clip inoculation. Comparative genomics revealed the association of a RiPP, a metalloprotease and a bacterial-killing type IV secretion system conserved across its related member species, including X. sontii, in the clade I with in-vivo anti-pathogenic properties. Overall the study has provided novel evolutionary insights into an important NPX member species. The findings and genomic resources will allow further systematic molecular studies to understand its interaction with the host plant.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the dynamics of the protein kinase, ERK2, have been shown to accompany its activation by dual phosphorylation. However, our knowledge about the conformational changes represented by these motions is incomplete. Previous NMR relaxation dispersion studies showed that active, dual-phosphorylated ERK2 undergoes global exchange between at least two energetically similar conformations. These findings, combined with measurements by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS), suggested that the global conformational exchange involves motions of the activation loop (A-loop) that are coupled to regions surrounding the kinase active site. In order to better understand the contribution of dynamics to the activation of ERK2, we applied long conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from crystal structures of active, phosphorylated (2P), and inactive, unphosphorylated (0P) ERK2. Individual trajectories were run for (5 to 25) {micro}s and totaled 727 {micro}s. The results showed that the A-loop is unexpectedly flexible in both 2P- and 0P-ERK2, and able to adopt multiple long-lived (>5 {micro}s) conformational states. Simulations starting from the X-ray structure of 2P-ERK2 (2ERK) revealed A-loop states corresponding to restrained dynamics within the N-lobe, including regions surrounding catalytic residues. One A-loop conformer forms lasting interactions with the C-terminal L16 segment and shows reduced RMSF and greater compaction in the active site. By contrast, simulations starting from the most common X-ray conformation of 0P-ERK2 (5UMO) reveal frequent excursions of A-loop residues away from a C-lobe docking site pocket and towards a new state that shows greater dynamics in the N-lobe and disorganization around the active site. Thus, the A-loop in ERK2 appears to switch between distinct conformational states that reflect allosteric coupling with the active site, likely occurring via the L16 segment. Analyses of crystal packing interactions across many structural datasets suggest that the A-loop observed in X-ray structures of ERK2 may be driven by lattice contacts and less representative of the solution structure. The novel conformational states identified by MD expand our understanding of ERK2 regulation, by linking the activated state of the kinase to reduced dynamics and greater compaction surrounding the catalytic site.",

    "abstract": "Fibrosis, characterized by sustained activation of myofibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, is known to be associated with chronic inflammation. RIPK3, the central kinase of necroptosis signaling, is upregulated in fibrosis and contributes to the TNF-mediated inflammation. In bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis, we found that myofibroblasts are the major cell type expressing RIPK3. Genetic ablation of {beta}1 integrins, the major profibrotic ECM receptors in fibroblasts, not only abolished ECM fibrillogenesis but also blunted RIPK3 expression via an epigenetic mechanism mediated by the chromatin remodeling factor CHD4. While the function of CHD4 has been conventionally linked to NuRD and ChAHP complexes, we found that CHD4 potently repressed a set of genes, including Ripk3, with high locus specificity but independent of either the NuRD or ChAHP complex. Thus, our data uncover that {beta}1 integrin intrinsically links fibrotic signaling to RIPK3-driven inflammation via a novel mode of action of CHD4.",

    "abstract": "Learning to process speech in a foreign language involves learning new representations for mapping the auditory signal to linguistic structure. Behavioral experiments suggest that even listeners that are highly proficient in a non-native language experience interference from representations of their native language. However, much of the evidence for such interference comes from tasks that may inadvertently increase the salience of native language competitors. Here we tested for neural evidence of proficiency and native language interference in a naturalistic story listening task. We studied electroencephalography responses of native Dutch listeners to an English short story, spoken by a native speaker of either American English or Dutch. We modeled brain responses with multivariate temporal response functions, using acoustic and language models. We found evidence for activation of Dutch language statistics when listening to English, but only when it was spoken with a Dutch accent. This suggests that a naturalistic, monolingual setting decreases the interference from native language representations, whereas an accent in the listeners own native language may increase native language interference, by increasing the salience of the native language and activating native language phonetic and lexical representations. Brain responses suggest that words from the native language compete with the foreign language in a single word recognition system, rather than being activated in a parallel lexicon. We further found that secondary acoustic representations of speech (after 200 ms latency) decreased with increasing proficiency. This may reflect improved acoustic-phonetic models in more proficient listeners.",

    "abstract": "Learning can induce neurophysiological plasticity in the auditory cortex at multiple timescales. Lasting changes to auditory cortical function that persist over days, weeks, or even a lifetime, require learning to induce de novo gene expression. Indeed, transcription is the molecular determinant for long-term memories to form with a lasting impact on sound-related behavior. However, auditory cortical genes that support auditory learning, memory, and acquired sound-specific behavior are largely unknown. This report is the first to identify in young adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley) genome-wide changes in learning-induced gene expression within the auditory cortex that may underlie the formation of long-lasting discriminative memory for acoustic frequency cues. Auditory cortical samples were collected from animals in the initial learning phase of a two-tone discrimination sound-reward task known to induce sound-specific neurophysiological and behavioral effects (e.g., Shang et al., 2019). Bioinformatic analyses on gene enrichment profiles from bulk RNA sequencing identified cholinergic synapse (KEGG 04725), extra-cellular matrix receptor interaction (KEGG 04512), and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (KEGG 04080) as top biological pathways for auditory discrimination learning. The findings characterize key candidate effectors underlying changes in cortical function that support the initial formation of long-term discriminative auditory memory in the adult brain. The molecules and mechanisms identified are potential therapeutic targets to facilitate lasting changes to sound-specific auditory function in adulthood and prime for future gene-targeted investigations.",
