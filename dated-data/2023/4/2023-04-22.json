    "abstract": "Monosynaptic tracing is a widely-used technique for mapping neural circuitry, but its cytotoxicity has confined it primarily to anatomical applications. Here we present a second-generation system for labeling direct inputs to targeted neuronal populations with minimal toxicity, using double-deletion-mutant rabies viruses. Spread of the viruses requires expression of both deleted viral genes in trans in postsynaptic source cells; suppressing this expression with doxycycline following an initial period of viral replication reduces toxicity to postsynaptic cells. Longitudinal two-photon imaging in vivo indicated that over 90% of both presynaptic and source cells survived for the full twelve-week course of imaging. Ex vivo whole-cell recordings at 5 weeks postinfection showed that the second-generation system perturbs input and source cells much less than does the first-generation system. Finally, two-photon calcium imaging of labeled networks of visual cortex neurons showed that their visual response properties appeared normal for 10 weeks, the longest we followed them.",

    "abstract": "When we pay attention to someone, do we focus only on the sound they make, the word they use, or do we form a mental space shared with the speaker we want to pay attention to? Some would argue that the human language is no other than a simple signal, but others claim that human beings understand each other not only by relying on the words that have been said but also formed a shared ground in the specific conversation. This debate was raised early, but the conclusion remains vague. Our study aimed to investigate how attention modulates the neural coupling between the speaker and the listener in a cocktail party paradigm. The temporal response function (TRF) method was employed to reveal how the listener was coupled to the speaker at the neural level. The results showed that the neural coupling between the listener and the attended speaker peaked 5 seconds before speech onset at the delta band over the left frontal region, and was correlated with speech comprehension performance. In contrast, the attentional processing of speech acoustics and semantics occurred primarily at a later stage after speech onset and was not significantly correlated with comprehension performance. These findings suggest that our human brain might have adopted a predictive mechanism to achieve speaker-listener neural coupling for successful speech comprehension.\n\nThree key pointsO_LIListeners EEG signals coupled to the speakers 5 s before the speech onset, which revealed a \"beyond the stimulus\" attentional modulation.\nC_LIO_LISpeaker-listener attentional coupling is correlated to the listeners comprehension performance, but the speech-listeners coupling didnt.\nC_LIO_LIThe implementation of temporal response function methods and the neural language methods yielded novel perspectives to the analysis of the inter-brain studies.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Coordinated behaviors are prevalent in the animal kingdom as they promote the survival of social specie. Meanwhile, the distinct social roles of males and females predict sex differences in behavioral coordination. However, because of its complexity, behavioral coordination and the underlying circuits have not been studied extensively in laboratory animals. Recently, we established a mouse model of social synchronization of conditioned fear and identified the ventral hippocampus to the amygdala pathway as the integrator of the affective and social information. We also found that males synchronized freezing bouts more strongly than females. Here, we investigated sex differences further by manipulating the animals social cues or emotional states. First, familiarity with social cues increased freezing synchrony in male but not female dyads. Second, the emotional distress from brief immobilization had a sex-dimorphic effect by disrupting freezing synchrony in males and enhancing it in females. Finally, inactivation of the ventral hippocampus abolished fear synchrony in both sexes but elicited negative synchrony in females only. In addition, we evaluated the coordination of snout movement during periods of non-freezing. While males and females did not differ in snout velocities, only females coordinated snout movement, and stress diminished that coordination. These findings reveal that conspecific identity and emotional state are sex-specific modulators of social synchrony, suggesting sex-specific functions within the socio-emotional integrator, which includes the ventral hippocampus and yet unknown circuits.",

    "abstract": "Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is used in numerous biophysical and biomedical applications to monitor inter- and intramolecular interactions and conformational changes in the 2-10 nm range. FRET is currently being extended to in vivo optical imaging, its main application being in quantifying drug-target engagement or drug release in animal models of cancer using organic dye or nanoparticle-labeled probes. Herein, we compared FRET quantification using intensity-based FRET (sensitized emission FRET analysis with the 3-cube approach using an IVIS imager) and macroscopic fluorescence lifetime (MFLI) FRET using a custom system using a time-gated ICCD, for small animal optical in vivo imaging. The analytical expressions and experimental protocols required to quantify the product fD E of the FRET efficiency E and the fraction of donor molecules involved in FRET, fD, are described in detail for both methodologies. Dynamic in vivo FRET quantification of transferrin receptor-transferrin binding was acquired in live intact nude mice upon intravenous injection of near infrared-labeled transferrin FRET pair and benchmarked against in vitro FRET using hybridized oligonucleotides. Even though both in vivo imaging techniques provided similar dynamic trends for receptor-ligand engagement, we demonstrate that MFLI FRET has significant advantages. Whereas the sensitized emission FRET approach using the IVIS imager required 9 measurements (6 of which are used for calibration) acquired from three mice, MFLI FRET needed only one measurement collected from a single mouse, although a control mouse might be needed in a more general situation. Based on our study, MFLI therefore represents the method of choice for longitudinal preclinical FRET studies such as that of targeted drug delivery in intact, live mice.\n\nWHY IT MATTERSFRET measurements in live animals open a unique window into drug-target interaction monitoring, by sensing the close proximity between a donor and acceptor-labeled molecular probes. To perform these measurements, a 3-cube fluorescent intensity measurement strategy can be adopted, as is common for in vitro FRET microscopy studies. However, it is challenging to translate this already cumbersome approach to in vivo small animal imaging. Here, we compare this standard approach, for which we provide a revised analytical framework, to a conceptually much simpler and more powerful one based on fluorescence lifetime measurements. Our results demonstrate that the technical challenge of in vivo fluorescence lifetime macroscopic imaging is well worth surmounting to obtain quantitative, whole-animal information regarding molecular drug-target engagement.",

To mimic more complex behaviours, however, artificial cells would need to perform many of these functions in a synergistic and coordinated fashion, which remains elusive. Here we considered a sophisticated biological response, namely the capture and deactivation of pathogens by neutrophil immune cells, through the process of netosis. We designed a consortium consisting of two synthetic agents - responsive DNA-based particles and antibiotic-loaded lipid vesicles - whose coordinated action mimics the sought immune-like response when triggered by bacterial metabolism. The artificial netosis-like response emerges from a series of interlinked sensing and communication pathways between the live and synthetic agents, and translates into both physical and chemical antimicrobial actions, namely bacteria immobilisation and exposure to antibiotics. Our results demonstrate how advanced life-like responses can be prescribed with a relatively small number of synthetic molecular components, and outlines a new strategy for artificial-cell-based antimicrobial solutions.",

This research represents a critical step in the development of genomic tools that enable the deployment of next-generation sequencing methods in the breeding of hazelnut, specifically the improvement of well-adapted Midwestern hazelnut varieties. To produce this map, we first developed high-density molecular markers using short-read Illumina sequencing of genotype-by-sequencing libraries. By aligning reads to a newly assembled reference genome for C. americana, we were able to identify over 75,000 high-quality indel-based polymorphisms across an F1 experimental population. These markers exhibited both high allele depth coverage, and low linkage disequilibrium, making them well-suited to genetic map development. We constructed such a map using 95 individuals from a single F1 family, demonstrating the utility of next-generation sequencing to efficiently and accurately generate high-density genetic maps. This research will improve the efficiency of breeding efforts, both through the validation of specific molecular markers that are associated with agronomically-relevant traits in breeding populations of interest.",

    "abstract": "Despite the distortion of speech signals caused by unavoidable noise in daily life, our ability to comprehend speech in noisy environments is relatively stable. However, the neural mechanisms underlying reliable speech-in-noise comprehension remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the neural tracking of acoustic and semantic speech information during noisy naturalistic speech comprehension. Participants listened to narrative audio recordings mixed with spectrally matched stationary noise at three signal-to-ratio (SNR) levels (no noise, 3 dB, -3 dB), and 60-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded. A temporal response function (TRF) method was employed to derive event-related-like responses to the continuous speech stream at both the acoustic and the semantic levels. Whereas the amplitude envelope of the naturalistic speech was taken as the acoustic feature, word entropy and word surprisal were extracted via the natural language processing method as two semantic features. Theta-band frontocentral TRF responses to the acoustic feature were observed at around 400 ms following speech fluctuation onset over all three SNR levels, and the response latencies were more delayed with increasing noise. Delta-band frontal TRF responses to the semantic feature of word entropy were observed at around 200 to 600 ms leading to speech fluctuation onset over all three SNR levels. The response latencies became more leading with increasing noise and were correlated with comprehension performance and perceived speech intelligibility. While the following responses to speech acoustics were consistent with previous studies, our study revealed the robustness of leading responses to speech semantics, which suggests a possible predictive mechanism at the semantic level for maintaining reliable speech comprehension in noisy environments.\n\nHighlightsO_LILeading responses were observed in the semantic-level neural tracking, with more leading latencies as noise increased.\nC_LIO_LIFollowing responses were observed in the acoustic-level neural tracking, with more delayed latencies as noise increased.\nC_LIO_LISemantic-level neural tracking is correlated with comprehension performance and perceived intelligibility.\nC_LIO_LIDistinct frequency bands were involved in speech semantic and acoustic processing.\nC_LI",

In this study, we used a universal marker for T lymphocytes/natural killer cells (ZAP70) and advanced imaging techniques to investigate the lymphoid architecture of the zebrafish branchial cavity. We identified a new lymphoid organ, which we tentatively named \"Nemausean Lymphoid Organ\" (NEMO), situated below the pharynx, and closely associated with gill lymphoid tissues. Besides T/NK cells, NEMO is enriched in plasma/B cells and antigen-presenting cells embedded in a network of reticulated epithelial cells. Presence of activated T cells and lymphocyte proliferation but not V(D)J recombination or hematopoiesis, suggests a function as secondary lymphoid organ. In response to infection, NEMO displays structural changes including the formation of T/NK cells clusters. NEMO and gill lymphoid aggregates form a cohesive unit within a lymphoid network that extends throughout the pharyngo-respiratory area. Collectively, our findings reveal a new mucosal lymphoid organ reminiscent of mammalian tonsils that evolved in fish. Importantly, NEMO could clearly be identified in multiple teleost fish families.\n\nOne sentence summaryA previously unreported lymphoid organ has been identified within the pharyngo-respiratory tract of the zebrafish, and other teleost fish, providing new insights into the immune system of teleost fish and the evolution of vertebrate immunology.",

Here, we show that GD2 is expressed on a small subpopulation of PC cells in a subset of patients, especially in metastatic PC. Variable levels of cell surface GD2 expression are seen in most PC cell lines, and the expression is highly upregulated by experimental induction of lineage progression or enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cell models.

    "abstract": "Understanding the brains perception algorithm is a highly intricate problem, as the inherent complexity of sensory inputs and the brains nonlinear processing make characterizing sensory representations difficult. Recent studies have shown that functional models--capable of predicting large-scale neuronal activity in response to arbitrary sensory input--can be powerful tools for characterizing neuronal representations by enabling high-throughput in silico experiments. However, accurately modeling responses to dynamic and ecologically relevant inputs like videos remains challenging, particularly when generalizing to new stimulus domains outside the training distribution. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, where foundation models--trained on vast quantities of data-- have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and generalization, we developed a \"foundation model\" of the mouse visual cortex: a deep neural network trained on large amounts of neuronal responses to ecological videos from multiple visual cortical areas and mice. The model accurately predicted neuronal responses not only to natural videos but also to various new stimulus domains, such as coherent moving dots and noise patterns, underscoring its generalization abilities. The foundation model could also be adapted to new mice with minimal natural movie training data. We applied the foundation model to the MICrONS dataset: a study of the brain that integrates structure with function at unprecedented scale, containing nanometer-scale morphology, connectivity with >500,000,000 synapses, and function of >70,000 neurons within a [~] 1mm3 volume spanning multiple areas of the mouse visual cortex. This accurate functional model of the MICrONS data opens the possibility for a systematic characterization of the relationship between circuit structure and function. By precisely capturing the response properties of the visual cortex and generalizing to new stimulus domains and mice, foundation models can pave the way for a deeper understanding of visual computation.",

    "abstract": "Homologous protein search is one of the most commonly used methods for protein annotation and analysis. Compared to structure search, detecting distant evolutionary relationships from sequences alone remains challenging. Here we propose PLMSearch (Protein Language Model), a homologous protein search method with only sequences as input. With deep representations from a pre-trained protein language model to predict similarity, PLMSearch can capture the remote homology information hidden behind the sequences. Extensive experimental results show that PLMSearch can search millions of query-target protein pairs in seconds like MMseqs2 while increasing the sensitivity by more than threefold, and is comparable to state-of-the-art structure search methods. In particular, unlike traditional sequence search methods, PLMSearch can recall most remote homology pairs with low sequence similarity but sharing similar structures.

    "abstract": "Visual inspection of histopathology slides via optical microscope is the routine medical examination for clinical diagnosis of tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated that computational pathology not only automate the tumor diagnosis, but also showed great potential to uncover tumor-related genetic alterations and transcriptomic patterns. In this paper, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We firstly conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract histopathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic task, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agree greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In particular, our method achieved 0.79 AUC value in predicting the response of breast cancer patients to the drug trastuzumab treatment. These findings showed the remarkable potential of deep learning-based morphological feature is very indicative of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "During economic choice, we often consider options in alternation, until we commit to one. Nonetheless, neuroeconomics typically ignores the dynamic aspects of deliberation. We trained macaques to perform a value-based decision-making task where two risky offers were presented in sequence at different locations of the visual field, each followed by a delay epoch where offers were invisible. Subjects looked at the offers in sequence, as expected. Surprisingly, during the delay epochs, we found that subjects still tend to look at empty locations where the visual offers were formerly presented; and, moreover, longer fixation to given empty location increases the probability of choosing the associated offer, even after controlling for the offer values. We show that activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) reflects the value of the gazed offer, but also the value of the offer associated to the gazed spatial location, even if it is not the most recently viewed. This reactivation reflects a reevaluation process, as fluctuations in neural spiking during offer stimuli presentation and delays correlate with upcoming choice. Our results suggest that look-at-nothing gazing triggers the reactivation of a previously seen offer for further reevaluation, revealing novel aspects of deliberation.",

    "abstract": "One of the barriers for breast cancer prevention and treatment is our poor understanding of the dynamic cellular shifts that naturally occur within the breast and how these changes contribute to tumour initiation. In this study we report the use of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to compile a Human Breast Cell Atlas (HBCA) assembled from 55 donors that had undergone reduction mammoplasties or risk reduction mammoplasties. The data from more than 800,000 cells identified 41 cell subclusters distributed across the epithelial, immune, and stromal compartments. We found that the contribution of these different clusters varied according to the natural history of the tissue. Breast cancer risk modulating factors such as age, parity, and germline mutation affected the homeostatic cellular state of the breast in different ways however, none of the changes observed were restricted to any one cell type. Remarkably, we also found that immune cells from BRCA1/2 carriers had a distinct gene expression signature indicative of potential immune exhaustion. This suggests that immune escape mechanisms could manifest in non-cancerous tissues during very early stages of tumour initiation. Therefore, the Atlas presented here provides the research community with a rich resource that can be used as a reference for studies on the origins of breast cancer which could inform novel approaches for early detection and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the atrial and ventricular chambers of the heart maintain their distinct identity is a prerequisite for treating chamber-specific diseases. Here, we selectively inactivated the transcription factor Tbx5 in the atrial working myocardium of the neonatal mouse heart to show that it is required to maintain atrial identity. Atrial Tbx5 inactivation downregulated highly chamber specific genes such as Myl7 and Nppa, and conversely, increased the expression of ventricular identity genes including Myl2. Using combined single nucleus transcriptome and open chromatin profiling, we assessed genomic accessibility changes underlying the altered atrial identity expression program, identifying 1846 genomic loci with greater accessibility in control atrial cardiomyocytes compared to KO aCMs. 69% of the control-enriched ATAC regions were bound by TBX5, demonstrating a role for TBX5 in maintaining atrial genomic accessibility. These regions were associated with genes that had higher expression in control aCMs compared to KO aCMs, suggesting they act as TBX5-dependent enhancers. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing enhancer chromatin looping using HiChIP and found 510 chromatin loops that were sensitive to TBX5 dosage. Of the loops enriched in control aCMs, 73.7% contained anchors in control-enriched ATAC regions. Together, these data demonstrate a genomic role for TBX5 in maintaining the atrial gene expression program by binding to atrial enhancers and preserving tissue-specific chromatin architecture of atrial enhancers.",

    "abstract": "The translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathway mediated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) monoubiquitination is an essential mechanism by which cancer cells bypass DNA damage caused by DNA replication stress to maintain genomic stability and cell survival. Chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit A (CHAF1A) traditionally promotes histone assembly during DNA replication. Here, we revealed that CHAF1A is a novel regulator of the TLS pathway. High expression of CHAF1A is significantly associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. CHAF1A promotes fork restart under DNA replication stress and maintains genome integrity. CHAF1A enhances the interaction between PCNA and E3 ubiquitin protein ligase RAD18 and promotes PCNA monoubiquitination, thereby promoting the recruitment of Y-family DNA polymerase Pol {eta} and enhancing cancer cell resistance to stimuli that trigger replication fork blockade. Mechanistically, CHAF1A-mediated PCNA monoubiquitination is independent of CHAF1A-PCNA interaction. CHAF1A interacts with both RAD18 and replication protein A2 (RPA2), mediating RAD18 binding on chromatin in response to DNA replication stress. Taken together, these findings improve our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the TLS pathway and provide insights into the relationship between CHAF1A and the malignant progression of cancers.",

    "abstract": "The lipid droplet (LD) organization proteins Ldo16 and Ldo45 affect multiple aspects of LD biology in yeast. They are linked to the LD biogenesis machinery seipin, and their loss causes defects in LD positioning, protein targeting, and breakdown. However, their molecular roles remained enigmatic. Here we report that Ldo16/45 form a tether-complex with Vac8 for creation of vacuole lipid droplet (vCLIP) contact sites, which can form in the absence of seipin. The phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Pdr16 is a further vCLIP-resident recruited by Ldo45. While only an LD-subpopulation is engaged in vCLIPs at glucose-replete conditions, nutrient stress results in vCLIP expansion, and vCLIP defects impair lipophagy upon prolonged starvation. In summary, Ldo16/45 are multifunctional proteins that orchestrate formation of a metabolically-regulated contact site. Our studies suggest an unexpected link between LD biogenesis and breakdown, and open the door to a deeper understanding of how lipid homeostasis is maintained during metabolic challenges.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt was assumed that the cause of chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis is a disturbance of the innate immunity response, caused, among other factors, by mitochondrial dysfunctions. It was also suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction may be caused by heteroplasmic mutations in mitochondrial DNA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the mitochondrial nonsense mutation m.15059G>A on cellular functions in atherosclerosis: lipoidosis, pro-inflammatory response, and mitophagy.\n\nMethodsThe human monocytic cell line THP-1 and cytoplasmic hybrid cell line TC-HSMAM1 were used. An original approach based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system was developed and used for the elimination of mtDNA copies carrying the m.15059G>A mutation in the MT-CYB gene. Using this approach, the Cas9-TC-HSMAM1 cells with an eliminated m.15059G>A mutation was obtained. The gene expression levels of genes encoding enzymes related to cholesterol metabolism were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. The evaluation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was assessed using ELISA. Mitophagy in cells was detected using confocal microscopy.\n\nResultsIn contrast to intact TC-HSMAM1 cybrids, in Cas9-TC-HSMAM1 cells, incubation with atherogenic LDL led to a decrease in the expression of the gene encoding fatty acid synthase (FASN). It was found that TC-HSMAM1 cybrids are characterized by defective mitophagy and are also unable to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (to form immune tolerance) in response to repeated LPS stimulation. Elimination of mtDNA carrying the m.15059G>A mutation led to the restoration of immune tolerance and activation of mitophagy in the studied cells.\n\nConclusionsThe m.15059G>A mutation was found to be associated with defective mitophagy, immune tolerance, and impaired metabolism of intracellular lipids due to upregulation of the FASN. Thus, this mutation may play an important role in atherogenesis due to its contribution to the chronification of inflammation, which aggravates the progression of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Cl-/H+ antiporter ClC-5 cause Dents Disease 1 (DD1), a rare primary tubulopathy that eventually progresses to renal failure. In fact, even with normal kidney function, DD1 patients present renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, the link between ClC-5 loss-of-function and renal fibrosis remains unclear. Here, we have shown that DD1 mice models lacking ClC-5 present higher renal collagen deposition and fibrosis. Accordingly, deletion of ClC-5 in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (CLCN5 KD) recapitulates this effect. We have demonstrated that CLCN5 KD causes an increase of collagen I (Col I) and IV (Col IV) intracellular levels by promoting their transcription through {beta}-catenin pathway and impairing their lysosomal-mediated degradation. In addition, CLCN5 KD cells release more Col I and IV at the extracellular space that form fibres with altered properties and resistance to removal compared to control cells. Altogether, we describe a new regulatory mechanism for collagens production and release by ClC-5, which is altered in DD1 and provides a better understanding of disease progression to renal fibrosis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRenal fibrosis is a common pathologic process occurring as consequence of chronic kidney injury and leading to renal dysfunction. Dents Disease is a rare renal pathology that progresses to chronic kidney disease and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Interestingly, it is caused by mutations in a single gene called CLCN5, therefore it can help understanding the cellular mechanisms of renal fibrosis. Using cellular and mice models of the disease, we describe a mechanism linking CLCN5 function, cell differentiation and regulation of collagen levels, major component of extracellular matrix and important player for renal fibrosis development. In conclusion, our results provide a link between CLCN5 and altered collagen deposition, which could be relevant for other renal Fanconi syndrome related diseases also progressing to fibrosis.",

While recent work provides insights into the molecular alterations in the brain of patients with MDD, whether these molecular signatures can be associated with the expression of specific symptom domains in males and females remains unclear. Here, we identified sex-specific gene modules associated with the expression of MDD, combining differential gene expression and co-expression network analyses in six cortical and subcortical brain regions. Our results show varying levels of network homology between males and females across brain regions, although the association between these structures and the expression of MDD remains highly sex-specific. We refined these associations to several symptom domains and identified transcriptional signatures associated with distinct functional pathways, including GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, metabolic processes, and intracellular signal transduction, across brain regions associated with distinct symptomatic profiles in a sex-specific fashion. In most cases, these associations were specific to males or to females with MDD, although a subset of gene modules associated with common symptomatic features in both sexes was also identified. Together, our findings suggest that the expression of distinct MDD symptom domains is associated with sex-specific transcriptional structures across brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Drug exposure during adolescence, when the  reward circuitry of the brain is developing, can permanently impact reward-related behavior. Epidemiological studies show that opioid treatment during adolescence, such as pain management for a dental procedure or surgery, increases the incidence of psychiatric illness including substance use disorders. Moreover, the opioid epidemic currently in the United States is affecting younger individuals raising the impetus to understand the pathogenesis of the negative effects of opioids. One reward-related behavior that develops during adolescence is social behavior. We previously demonstrated that social development occurs in rats during sex-specific adolescent periods: early to mid-adolescence in males (postnatal day (P)30-40) and pre-early adolescence in females (P20-30). We thus hypothesized that morphine exposure during the female critical period would result in adult sociability deficits in females, but not males, and morphine administered during the male critical period would result in adult sociability deficits in males, but not females. We found that morphine exposure during the female critical period primarily resulted in deficits in sociability in females, while morphine exposure during the male critical period primarily resulted in deficits in sociability primarily in males. However, depending on the test performed and the social parameter measured, social alterations could be found in both sexes that received morphine exposure at either adolescent stage. These data indicate that when drug exposure occurs during adolescence, and how the endpoint data are measured, will play a large role in determining the effects of drug exposures on social development.",

We mimicked this inflammation by intra-masseteric muscle (MM) injections of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) or collagenase type 2 (Col), which emulates tissue damage. CFA triggered mechanical hypersensitivity at 1d post-injection was mainly linked to processes controlling chemotactic activity of monocytes and neutrophils. At 5d post-CFA, when hypersensitivity was resolved, there was minimal inflammation whereas tissue repair processes were pronounced. Low dose Col (0.2U) also produced acute orofacial hypersensitivity that was linked to tissue repair, but not inflammatory processes. High dose Col (10U) triggered prolonged orofacial hypersensitivity with inflammatory processes dominating at 1d post-injection. At pre-resolution time point (6d), tissue repair processes were underway and a significant increase in pro-inflammatory gene expressions compared to 1d post-injection were detected. RNA-seq and flow cytometry showed that immune processes in MM were linked to accumulation of macrophages, natural killer and natural killer T cells, dendritic cells and T-cells.

We obtained the spatiotemporal transcriptome from 90 sagittal sections of 16 whole human embryos from 3 to 8 post-conception weeks by Stereo-seq with high resolution and ultra-large field, establishing the development trajectory/regulatory profiling of 49 organs. We uncovered the organ-specific regulons as potential lineage-determining factors and identified the new regulatory networks during heart and brain development. The atlas refines the key organs/cell types vulnerable to virus infection and genetic disorders, and, reveals the dynamics of allelic gene expression in specific organs at different stages.

    "abstract": "Animals need to be able to sharpen circadian behavioural output in the adaptation to the variable environment. Light is the main entraining signal of the circadian clock, but can also directly increase alertness, locomotor activity, body temperature and heart rate in diurnal animals including humans. Thus, immediate effects of light can enhance or even overwrite circadian output and thereby mask circadian behaviour.\n\nIn Drosophila melanogaster, immediate light effects are most evident as a lights-on response in two well described behavioural rhythms of the fly - the emergence rhythm of the adult insect from the pupa, called eclosion, and the diurnal rhythm of locomotor activity. Here, we show that the immediate effect of light on rhythmic eclosion depends on the R8 photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, while the light response of locomotor activity is triggered by different light detecting cells and organs, that seem to compensate for the loss of each other.",

    "abstract": "Object classification has been proposed as a principal objective of the primate ventral visual stream and has been used as an optimization target for deep neural network models (DNNs) of the visual system. However, visual brain areas represent many different types of information, and optimizing for classification of object identity alone does not constrain how other information may be encoded in visual representations. Information about different scene parameters may be discarded altogether (\"invariance\"), represented in non-interfering subspaces of population activity (\"factorization\") or encoded in an entangled fashion. In this work, we provide evidence that factorization is a normative principle of biological visual representations. In the monkey ventral visual hierarchy, we found that factorization of object pose and background information from object identity increased in higher-level regions and strongly contributed to improving object identity decoding performance. We then conducted a large-scale analysis of factorization of individual scene parameters - lighting, background, camera viewpoint, and object pose - in a diverse library of DNN models of the visual system. Models which best matched neural, fMRI and behavioral data from both monkeys and humans across 12 datasets tended to be those which factorized scene parameters most strongly. Notably, invariance to these parameters was not consistently associated with matches to neural and behavioral data, suggesting that maintaining non-class information in factorized activity subspaces is preferred to dropping it altogether. Thus, we propose that factorization of visual scene information is a widely used strategy in brains and DNN models thereof.",

    "abstract": "Sensory eye dominance occurs when the visual cortex weighs one eyes data more heavily than those of the other. Encouragingly, mechanisms underlying sensory eye dominance in human adults retain a certain degree of plasticity. Notably, perceptual training using dichoptically presented motion signal-noise stimuli has been shown to elicit changes in sensory eye dominance both in visually impaired and normal observers. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these learning-driven improvements are not well understood. Here, we measured changes in fMRI responses before and after a five-day visual training protocol to determine the neuroplastic changes along the visual cascade. Fifty visually normal observers received training on a dichoptic or binocular variant of a signal-in-noise (left-right) motion discrimination task over five consecutive days. We show significant shifts in sensory eye dominance following training, but only for those who received dichoptic training. Pattern analysis of fMRI responses revealed that responses of V1 and hMT+ predicted sensory eye dominance for both groups, but only before training. After dichoptic (but not binocular) visual training, responses of V1 and hMT+ could no longer predict sensory eye dominance. Our data suggest that perceptual training-driven changes in eye dominance are driven by a reweighting of the two eyes data in both primary and task-related extrastriate visual areas. These findings may provide insight into developing region-targeted rehabilitative paradigms for the visually impaired, particularly those with severe binocular imbalance.",

    "abstract": "Network representation has been a groundbreaking concept for understanding the behavior of complex systems in social sciences, biology, neuroscience, and beyond. Network science is mathematically founded on graph theory, where nodal importance is gauged using measures of centrality. Notably, recent work suggests that the topological centrality of a node should not be over-interpreted as its dynamical or causal importance in the network. Hence, identifying the influential nodes in dynamic causal models (DCM) remains an open question. This paper introduces causal centrality for DCM, a dynamics-sensitive and causally-founded centrality measure based on the notion of intervention in graphical models. Operationally, this measure simplifies to an identifiable expression using Bayesian model reduction. As a proof of concept, the average DCM of the extended default mode network (eDMN) was computed in 74 healthy subjects. Next, causal centralities of different regions were computed for this causal graph, and compared against major graph-theoretical centralities. The results showed that the subcortical structures of the eDMN are more causally central than the cortical regions, even though the (dynamics-free) graph-theoretical centralities unanimously favor the latter. Importantly, model comparison revealed that only the pattern of causal centrality was causally relevant. These results are consistent with the crucial role of the subcortical structures in the neuromodulatory systems of the brain, and highlight their contribution to the organization of large-scale networks. Potential applications of causal centrality - to study other neurotypical and pathological functional networks - are discussed, and some future lines of research are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Decision confidence, an internal estimate of how accurate our choices are, is essential for metacognitive self-evaluation and guides behaviour. However, it can be suboptimal and hence understanding the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms is crucial. To do so, it is essential to establish the extent to which both behavioural and neurophysiological measures of metacognition are reliable over time and shared across cognitive domains. The evidence regarding domain-generality of metacognition has been mixed, while the test-retest reliability of the most widely used metacognitive measures has not been reported. Here, in human participants of both sexes, we examined behavioural and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of metacognition across two tasks that engage distinct cognitive domains - visual perception and semantic memory. The test-retest reliability of all measures was additionally tested across two experimental sessions. The results revealed a dissociation between metacognitive bias and efficiency, whereby only metacognitive bias showed strong test-retest reliability and domain-generality whilst metacognitive efficiency (measured by M-ratio) was neither reliable nor domain-general. Hence, overall confidence calibration (i.e., metacognitive bias) is a stable trait-like characteristic underpinned by domain-general mechanisms whilst metacognitive efficiency may rely on more domain-specific computations. Additionally, we found two distinct stimulus-locked EEG signatures related to the trial-by-trial fluctuations in confidence ratings during decision formation. A late event-related potential was reliably linked to confidence across cognitive domains, while evoked spectral power predicted confidence most reliably in the semantic knowledge domain. Establishing the reliability and domain-generality of neural predictors of confidence represents an important step in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying self-evaluation.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying metacognition is essential for addressing deficits in self-evaluation. Open questions exist regarding the domain-generality and reliability of both behavioural and neural measures of metacognition. We show that metacognitive bias is reliable across cognitive domains and time, whereas the most adopted measure of metacognitive efficiency is domain-specific and shows poor test-retest reliability. Hence, more reliable measures of metacognition, tailored to specific domains, are needed. We further show that decision confidence is linked to two EEG signatures: late event-related potentials and evoked alpha/beta spectral power. While the former predicts confidence in both perception and semantic knowledge domains, the latter is only reliably linked to knowledge confidence. These findings provide crucial insights into the computations underlying metacognition across domains.",

These alterations lead to (4) stress susceptibility, (5) emotional and feeding dysregulation, and (6) obesity. Dysregulation of feeding control and obesity leads to increased hedonic feeding and engages individuals in a cycle of aberrant feeding behaviors.\n\nC_FIG BackgroundChildhood overweight/obesity is associated with the development of stress-related psychopathology. However, the pathways connecting childhood obesity to stress susceptibility remain poorly understood. Here, we used a systems biology approach to determine linkages underlying obesity-induced stress susceptibility.\n\nMethodsSixty-two (62) adolescent Lewis rats (PND21) were fed for four weeks with a Western-like high-saturated fat diet (WD, 41% kcal from fat) or a matched control diet (CD, 13% kcal from fat). Subsequently, a group of rats (n = 32) was exposed to a well-established 31-day model of predator exposures and social instability (PSS). The effects of the WD and PSS were assessed with a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests, DTI (diffusion tensor imaging), NODDI (neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging), high throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing for gut microbiome profiling, hippocampal microglia morphological and gene analysis, and gene methylation status of the stress marker, FKBP5. Parallel experiments were performed on human microglial cells (HMC3) to examine molecular mechanisms by which palmitic acid primes these cells to aberrant responses to cortisol.\n\nResultsRats exposed to the WD and PSS exhibited deficits in sociability indices and increased fear and anxiety-like behaviors, food consumption, and body weight. WD and PSS interacted to alter indices of microstructural integrity within the hippocampal formation (subiculum) and subfields (CA1). Microbiome diversity and taxa distribution revealed that WD/PSS exposure caused significant shifts in the diversity of gut dominant bacteria and decreased the abundance of various members of the Firmicutes phylum, including Lachnospiracae NK4A136. Interestingly, the WD and PSS synergized to promote hippocampal microglia morphological and gene signatures implicated in neuroinflammation. These alterations were associated with changes in the microbiome, and in the expression and methylation status of the corticosterone receptor chaperone rat gene Fkbp5. HMC3 responses to cortisol were markedly disrupted after incubating cells in palmitate, shown by morphological changes and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and release. Notably, these effects were partly mediated by the human FKBP5 gene.\n\nConclusionsThe combination of psychosocial stress and poor diet during adolescence has a deleterious synergistic impact on brain health. This study enhances our understanding of mechanisms and adaptations by which obesogenic environments shape the maturational trajectories of common neurobiological correlates of resilience.\n\nHighlightsO_LIObesogenic diet consumption during adolescence leads to stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in rats.\nC_LIO_LIExposure to an obesogenic environment during adolescence alters indices of hippocampal microstructural integrity.\nC_LIO_LIObesogenic diet and chronic stress promote selective gut microbiota dysbiosis.\nC_LIO_LIObesogenic diet and chronic stress synergize to expand putative pro-inflammatory microglia populations in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus.\nC_LIO_LIObesogenic diet and chronic stress influence hippocampal Fkbp5 gene methylation status at specific sites.\nC_LIO_LIFKBP5 integrates microglial pro-inflammatory signals under obesogenic conditions.\nC_LI",

BackgroundA critical knowledge gap in freshwater plants research is the lack of genetic tools necessary to answer fundamental questions about their demographic histories, adaptation, and phylogenetic relationships. One example of this is Typha, a global genus of freshwater plants foundational to wetlands that is also becoming an increasingly problematic biological invader in numerous regions worldwide; while important insights have been discovered for this genus, existing markers are insufficient to answer fundamental questions about their demographic histories, adaptation, and phylogenetic relationships, to identify introduced and hybrid lineages, and to examine patterns of hybridisation and introgression.\n\n2. MethodsWe optimised a library preparation and data processing protocol to develop genome-wide nuclear and plastid resources for studying the evolutionary history, genetic structure and diversity, hybridisation, local adaptation, invasiveness, and geographic expansion dynamics of Typha.\n\n3.

    "abstract": "High circulating levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) have been associated with cardiovascular disease risk. TMAO is formed through a microbiome-host pathway utilizing primarily dietary choline as a substrate. Specific gut microbiota transform choline into trimethylamine (TMA), and, when absorbed, host hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) oxidizes TMA into TMAO. Chlorogenic acid and its metabolites reduce microbial TMA production in vitro. However, little is known regarding the potential for chlorogenic acid and its bioavailable metabolites to inhibit the last step: hepatic conversion of TMA to TMAO. We developed a screening methodology to study FMO3-catalyzed production of TMAO from TMA. HepG2 cells were unable to oxidize TMA into TMAO due to their lack of FMO3 expression. Although Hepa-1 cells did express FMO3 when pre-treated with TMA and NADPH, they lacked enzymatic activity to produce TMAO. Rat hepatic microsomes contained active FMO3. Optimal reaction conditions were: 50 {micro}M TMA, 0.2 mM NADPH and 33 {micro}L microsomes/mL reaction. Methimazole (a known FMO3 competitive substrate) at 200 {micro}M effectively reduced FMO3-catalyzed conversion of TMA to TMAO. However, bioavailable chlorogenic acid metabolites did not generally inhibit FMO3 at physiological (1 {micro}M) nor supra-physiological (50 {micro}M) doses. Thus, the effects of chlorogenic acid in regulating TMAO levels in vivo are unlikely to occur through direct FMO3 enzyme inhibition. Potential effects on FMO3 expression remain unknown. Intestinal inhibition of TMA production and/or absorption are thus likely their primary mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins generally couple ATP hydrolysis to the active transport of solutes across cellular membranes. All ABC proteins contain a core structure of two transmembrane domains (TMD1, TMD2) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1, NBD2), and many ABC proteins contain additional domains. Some members of the C subfamily of ABC (ABCC) proteins, such as the multidrug resistant protein 1 (MRP1), contain an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0) and L0 linker that regulate transport activity and cellular trafficking, and mediate interactions with other proteins. Regulation can also be imparted by phosphorylation, proteolytic processing, and/or oligomerization of the proteins. Here we present the structure of yeast cadmium factor 1 (Ycf1p), a homologue of MRP1, in its mature form following cleavage by the yeast protease Pep4p. Remarkably, proteolytically cleaved Ycf1p forms a well-ordered dimer, with some monomeric particles also present in solution. Numerous other ABC proteins have been proposed to form dimers but no high-resolution structures have been reported. The monomeric and dimeric Ycf1p species are differentially phosphorylated at the intrinsically disordered regulatory (R) region, which links NBD1 to TMD2, and possess different ATPase activities indicating that dimerization affects the function of the protein. Protein-protein interactions involving TMD0, the L0 linker, and the R region mediate contacts between Ycf1p protomers in the dimer. In addition, cryo-EM density is observed for lipids at the interface between protomers, which suggests that lipids stabilize the dimer. The Ycf1p dimer structure is consistent with proposed dimerization interfaces of other ABCC dimers, such as MRP1.",

Besides, the acquired images are required to undergo a complicated image registration process for 3D reconstruction. Here, by incorporating a recently developed vibratome-assisted block-face imaging technique with deep learning, we developed a pipeline termed HistoTRUST that can rapidly and automatically generate subcellular whole organs virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological images which can be reconstructed into 3D by simple image stacking (i.e., without registration). The performance and robustness of HistoTRUST have been successfully validated by imaging all vital mouse organs (brain, liver, kidney, heart, lung, and spleen) within 1-3 days depending on the size. The generated 3D dataset has the same color tune as the traditional H&E stained histological images. Therefore, the virtual H&E stained images can be directly analyzed by pathologists. HistoTRUST has a high potential to serve as a new standard in providing 3D histology for research or clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Dietary trans 10, cis 12-conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12-CLA) has been shown to induce white fat reduction. In this study, the transgenic mice that produce endogenous t10c12-CLA were used to determine the long-term impact of this substance on lipid metabolism in lean female mammals. Phenotype profiling showed that the t10c12-CLA did not induce fat loss but resulted in less heat release and oxygen consumption, as well as excessive adrenaline, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in either biallelic Pai/Pai or monoallelic Pai/wt mice compared to their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the following effects of t10c12-CLA were genotype-specific. Pai/wt mice specifically exhibited increased chronic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and reduced physical activities. Contrarily, Pai/Pai mice showed the overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), corticosterone, and glucagon, accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. Further analysis of Pai/Pai livers revealed that the steatosis resulted from attenuated lipid metabolism via down-regulating phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and fatty acid synthase. Analysis of Pai/Pai brown adipose tissue indicated stimulated thermogenesis and lipolysis by up-regulating uncoupling proteins 1 and 2, phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, and AMPK, as well as down-regulating phosphorylated AMPK. These results suggest that chronic t10c12-CLA may affect lipid metabolism by stimulating the overproduction of multiple hormones (FGF21, PEG2, adrenaline, etc.) in a dose-dependent manner in lean female mammals. It also suggests that t10c12-CLA-induced fatty liver, inflammation, hypothermia and excess hormones are major health concerns.",

    "abstract": "Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an extraordinarily versatile crop, with applications ranging from medicinal compounds to seed oil and fibre products. Cannabis sativa is a short-day plant, and its flowering is tightly controlled by photoperiod. However, substantial genetic variation exists for photoperiod sensitivity in C. sativa, and photoperiod-insensitive (\"autoflower\") cultivars are available.\n\nUsing a bi-parental mapping population and bulked segregant analysis, we identified Autoflower2, a 0.5 Mbp locus significantly associated with photoperiod-insensitive flowering in hemp. Autoflower2 contains an ortholog of the central flowering time regulator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) from Arabidopsis thaliana which we termed CsFT1. Extensive sequence divergence between alleles of CsFT1 was identified between photoperiod-sensitive and insensitive cultivars of C. sativa, including a duplication of CsFT1 and sequence differences especially in introns. Genotyping of several mapping populations and a diversity panel confirmed a strong correlation between CsFT1 alleles and photoperiod response as well as affirming that at least two independent loci for this agriculturally important trait, Autoflower1 and Autoflower2, exist in the C. sativa gene pool.\n\nThis study reveals the multiple independent origins of photoperiod insensitivity in C. sativa, supporting the likelihood of a complex domestication history in this species. By integrating the genetic relaxation of photoperiod sensitivity into novel C. sativa cultivars, expansion to higher latitudes will be permitted, thus allowing the full potential of this versatile crop to be reached.",

    "abstract": "Ordered collections of precise gene deletions in E. coli and other model microbes have proven to be invaluable resources to study the dispensability of the non-essential genome in different environmental and genetic contexts. The dispensability of canonically essential genes, however, has been largely unstudied in such contexts. Advances in gene editing, in particular CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), have enabled depletion of essential cellular machinery to study the downstream effects on bacterial physiology. Here, we describe the construction of an ordered E. coli CRISPRi collection, designed to knock down the expression of 356 essential genes with the induction of a catalytically inactive Cas9, harbored on the conjugative plasmid pFD152, that also encodes for expression of specific guide RNA scaffolds. This mobile CRISPRi library can be conjugated into other ordered genetic libraries, to assess combined effects of essential gene knockdowns with non-essential gene deletions. As proof of concept, we probed cell envelope synthesis with two crosses. First, we crossed a deletion in the gene lpp with the entire CRISPRi library. Similarly, we crossed the CRISPRi knockdown of lolA with [~]4,000 deletion strains of the Keio collection. These experiments revealed a number of notable genetic interactions for the essential phenotype probed and, in particular, showed supressing interactions for the loci in question.",

    "abstract": "SummaryMonocytes restrict Yersinia infection within intestinal granulomas. Here, we report that monocyte-intrinsic TNF signaling drives production of IL-1 that signals to non-hematopoietic cells to control intestinal Yersinia infection within granulomas.\n\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine that mediates antimicrobial defense and granuloma formation in response to infection by numerous pathogens. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis colonizes the intestinal mucosa and induces recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes into organized immune structures termed pyogranulomas that control the bacterial infection. Inflammatory monocytes are essential for control and clearance of Yersinia within intestinal pyogranulomas, but how monocytes mediate Yersinia restriction is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that TNF signaling in monocytes is required for bacterial containment following enteric Yersinia infection. We further show that monocyte-intrinsic TNFR1 signaling drives production of monocyte-derived interleukin-1 (IL-1), which signals through IL-1 receptor on non-hematopoietic cells to enable pyogranuloma-mediated control of Yersinia infection. Altogether, our work reveals a monocyte-intrinsic TNF-IL-1 collaborative circuit as a crucial driver of intestinal granuloma function, and defines the cellular target of TNF signaling that restricts intestinal Yersinia infection.",

Fermented food consumption has been encouraged to replenish disrupted gut microbiota; however, its overall impact on host gut health remains to be elucidated. This study examined traditionally fermented foods and the gut microbiota of consumers of fermented foods for antibiotic resistance. Dietary intervention with fermented foods was found to lead to a surge in the antibiotic resistome in the gut microbiota of most human subjects. The antibiotic resistome was further illustrated in traditionally fermented food samples, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were isolated from approximately 90% of the retail kimchi and all artisan cheeses assessed in this pilot screening. The identified isolates included pathogens of importance in nosocomial infections such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus, as well as commensals and lactic acid bacteria, and some isolates exhibited extremely high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against antibiotics of clinical significance. Exposing fermented food microbiota to representative antibiotics further led to a boost in the corresponding antibiotic and multidrug resistance gene pools and disturbed microbiota. The results revealed an underestimated public health risk associated with fermented food interventions, particularly in susceptible populations with gastrointestinal tract symptoms and compromised immune functions seeking gut microbiota rescue. These findings call for more comprehensive assessments of the benefits and potential safety challenges associated with traditionally fermented foods and strategic movements to mitigate unnecessary damage to the host gut microbiota and improve food safety.",

    "abstract": "Like for many enteric bacteria, flagella are a crucial virulence factor for the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, allowing the bacteria to move through the viscous mucus of the human intestine. Assembly of the complex flagellar machinery and filament requires hierarchical regulation via transcriptional control of each component. In C. jejuni, class I genes are transcribed from {sigma}70-dependent promoters and class II/III genes with the help of the alternative sigma factors RpoN ({sigma}54) and FliA ({sigma}28). In contrast to transcriptional control, less is known about post-transcriptional regulation of flagellar biosynthesis cascades via small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we characterized two sRNAs with opposing effects on the cascade that fine-tune C. jejuni flagellar filament assembly and thereby impact motility. We demonstrate that the highly conserved Campylobacter sRNA CJnc230 (FlmE, flagellar length and motility enhancer), encoded downstream of the flagellar hook structural protein FlgE, is dependent on RpoN and that RNase III processes CJnc230 from the flgE mRNA, while RNase Y and PNPase mature its 3 end. We identify mRNAs encoding a regulator of flagella-flagella interactions and the anti-{sigma}28 factor FlgM as direct targets of CJnc230 repression. Overexpression of CJnc230 de-represses FliA activity and upregulates class III flagellar genes, such as the major flagellin flaA, culminating in longer flagella and increased motility. In contrast, overexpression of the FliA-dependent sRNA CJnc170 (FlmR, flagellar length and motility repressor) reduces flagellar length and motility. Overall, our study demonstrates sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation fine-tunes C. jejuni flagellar biosynthesis through balancing of the hierarchically expressed components.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsWNT2B is a canonical Wnt ligand previously thought to be fully redundant with other Wnts in the intestinal epithelium. However, humans with WNT2B deficiency have severe intestinal disease, highlighting a critical role for WNT2B. We sought to understand how WNT2B contributes to intestinal homeostasis.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the intestinal health of Wnt2b knock out (KO) mice. We assessed the impact of inflammatory challenge to the small intestine, using anti-CD3{chi} antibody, and to the colon, using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). In addition, we generated human intestinal organoids (HIOs) from WNT2B-deficient human iPSCs for transcriptional and histological analyses.\n\nResultsMice with WNT2B deficiency had significantly decreased Lgr5 expression in the small intestine and profoundly decreased expression in the colon, but normal baseline histology. The small intestinal response to anti-CD3{chi} antibody was similar in Wnt2b KO and wild type (WT) mice. In contrast, the colonic response to DSS in Wnt2b KO mice showed an accelerated rate of injury, featuring earlier immune cell infiltration and loss of differentiated epithelium compared to WT. WNT2B-deficient HIOs showed abnormal epithelial organization and an increased mesenchymal gene signature.\n\nConclusionWNT2B contributes to maintenance of the intestinal stem cell pool in mice and humans. WNT2B deficient mice, which do not have a developmental phenotype, show increased susceptibility to colonic injury but not small intestinal injury, potentially due to a higher reliance on WNT2B in the colon compared to the small intestine.\n\nWNT2B deficiency causes a developmental phenotype in human intestine with HIOs showing a decrease in their mesenchymal component and WNT2B-deficient patients showing epithelial disorganization.\n\nData Transparency StatementAll RNA-Seq data will be available through online repository as indicated in Transcript profiling.

The inducement of HPAH penetrance and the mechanism of sex differential penetrance are still elusive.\n\nMethodsWe infected or transfected pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) with shBMPR2 lentivirus or siBMPR2 to simulate the pathologic condition of BMPR2 heterozygous mutation and treated them with progesterone. The HPAH patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were induced into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to further verify the cellular phenotype. Wild-type flox+/- female mice and SM22-cre BMPR2 flox+/- female mice (CKO mice) were administered with 1-month progesterone, and their phenotype of PAH was evaluated by right heart catheterization and histopathological examination.\n\nResultsProgesterone promoted the proliferation of PASMCs with BMPR2-knockdownby activating ERK pathway via progesterone receptor (PGR). Activated ERK not only upregulated the phosphorylation and elevation of cMYC, but also induced the transcription of endothelin (EDN1) by promoting the nuclear entry of c-JUN and combination on the its promoter region. Similar results were confirmed by iPSCs-VSMCs experiment. CKO mice developed PAH spontaneously and had increased expression of EDN1, which was further aggravated by exogenous progesterone.\n\nConclusionsProgesterone might be an inducement of HPAH penetrance caused by BMPR2 mutation, accounting for sex differential penetrance.",

Here we use comparative transcriptomics to identify cis-acting elements coupling AS to translational control (AS-TC). We sequenced total cytosolic and polyribosome-associated mRNA from human, chimpanzee, and orangutan induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), revealing thousands of transcripts with splicing differences between subcellular fractions. We found both conserved and species-specific polyribosome association patterns for orthologous splicing events. Intriguingly, alternative exons with similar polyribosome profiles between species have stronger sequence conservation than exons with lineage-specific ribosome association. These data suggest that sequence variation underlies differences in the polyribosome association. Accordingly, single nucleotide substitutions in luciferase reporters designed to model exons with divergent polyribosome profiles are sufficient to regulate translational efficiency. We used position specific weight matrixes to interpret exons with species-specific polyribosome association profiles, finding that polymorphic sites frequently alter recognition motifs for trans-acting RNA binding proteins.

    "abstract": "Stochastic simulation models have played an important role in efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of prokaryotic transcription and translation. Despite the fundamental linkage of these processes in bacterial cells, however, most simulation models have been limited to representations of either transcription or translation. In addition, the available simulation models typically either attempt to recapitulate data from single-molecule experiments without considering cellular-scale high-throughput sequencing data or, conversely, seek to reproduce cellular-scale data without paying close attention to many of the mechanistic details. To address these limitations, we here present spotter (Simulation of Prokaryotic Operon Transcription & Translation Elongation Reactions), a flexible, user-friendly simulation model that offers highly-detailed combined representations of prokaryotic transcription, translation, and DNA supercoiling. In incorporating nascent transcript and ribosomal profiling sequencing data, spotter provides a critical bridge between data collected in single-molecule experiments and data collected at the cellular scale. Importantly, in addition to rapidly generating output that can be aggregated for comparison with next-generation sequencing and proteomics data, spotter produces residue-level positional information that can be used to visualize individual simulation trajectories in detail. We anticipate that spotter will be a useful tool in exploring the interplay of processes that are crucially linked in prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived brain organoids could recapitulate the earliest phase of brain development, making them an effective in vitro system for simulating both normal brain development and disorders. However, the current techniques for creating brain organoids are low throughput, suffer from high variability in organoid generation, and frequently involve lengthy processes of transferring and encapsulating the cells in hydrogels. These limitations hinder the application of brain organoids for high-throughput assessment of compounds in academic and industry settings. Here we demonstrate a simple method of generating multiple cerebral organoids from iPSCs on a unique 36PillarPlate with sidewalls and slits without tedious manual intervention that leads to the reproducible generation of cerebral organoids. Embryoid bodies (EBs) formed in an ultra-low attachment (ULA) 384-well plate were transferred to the 36PillarPlate with Matrigel on one-to-one basis by a simple sandwiching and inverting method. The success rate of spheroid transfer was 95 - 100%. Cerebral organoids were generated robustly with the coefficient of variation (CV) below 19% by differentiating EBs on the pillar plate, which demonstrate the robustness of our approach to support organoid culture. The spheroid transfer method on the pillar plate could overcome the potential limitation of organoid variability, reduce cell culture volume, and enhance assay throughput as compared to conventional organoid culture in petri dishes, spinner flasks, and 6-/24-well plates.",

    "abstract": "The human fungal pathogen Histoplasma changes its morphology in response to temperature. At 37{degrees}C it grows as a budding yeast whereas at room temperature it transitions to hyphal growth. Prior work has demonstrated that 15-20% of transcripts are temperature-regulated, and that transcription factors Ryp1-4 are necessary to establish yeast growth. However, little is known about transcriptional regulators of the hyphal program. To identify TFs that regulate filamentation, we utilize chemical inducers of hyphal growth. We show that addition of cAMP analogs or an inhibitor of cAMP breakdown overrides yeast morphology, yielding inappropriate hyphal growth at 37{degrees}C. Additionally, butyrate supplementation triggers hyphal growth at 37{degrees}C. Transcriptional profiling of cultures filamenting in response to cAMP or butyrate reveals that a limited set of genes respond to cAMP while butyrate dysregulates a larger set. Comparison of these profiles to previous temperature- or morphology-regulated gene sets identifies a small set of morphology-specific transcripts. This set contains 9 TFs of which we characterized three, STU1, FBC1, and PAC2, whose orthologs regulate development in other fungi. We found that each of these TFs is individually dispensable for room-temperature (RT) induced filamentation but each is required for other aspects of RT development. FBC1 and PAC2, but not STU1, are necessary for filamentation in response to cAMP at 37{degrees}C. Ectopic expression of each of these TFs is sufficient to induce filamentation at 37{degrees}C. Finally, PAC2 induction of filamentation at 37{degrees}C is dependent on STU1, suggesting these TFs form a regulatory circuit that, when activated at RT, promotes the hyphal program.\n\nImportanceFungal illnesses pose a significant disease burden. However, the regulatory circuits that govern the development and virulence of fungi remain largely unknown. This study utilizes chemicals that can override the normal growth morphology of the human pathogen Histoplasma. Using transcriptomic approaches, we identify novel regulators of hyphal morphology and refine our understanding of the transcriptional circuits governing morphology in Histoplasma.",
