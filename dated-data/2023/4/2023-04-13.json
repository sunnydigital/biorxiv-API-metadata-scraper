    "abstract": "Extremophiles can reveal the origins of life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. Most identified extremophiles are single-cell microbes, leaving gaps in our knowledge concerning the origins and habitable limits of multicellular organisms. Here, we report the recovery of roundworms (Phylum Nematoda) from the Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT, a hypersaline lake referred to as \"Americas Dead Sea\". Nematodes were found primarily in microbialites, benthic organosedimentary structures once abundant on early Earth. 16S sequencing of individual nematodes revealed a diverse bacterial community distinct from its surrounding habitat. Phylogenetic divergence compared to Owens Lake, another terminal lake in the Great Basin, suggests that GSL nematodes represent multiple previously undescribed species. These findings update our understanding of halophile ecosystems and the habitable limit of animals.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe report the discovery of novel halophilic nematodes in microbialites of the Great Salt Lake, UT.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. Here, we chart quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that modulate levels of methylation at highly conserved CpGs using liver methylome data from mouse strains belonging to the BXD Family. A regulatory hotspot on chromosome 5 had the highest density of trans-acting methylation QTLs (trans-meQTLs) associated with multiple distant CpGs. We refer to this locus as meQTL.5a. The trans-modulated CpGs showed age-dependent changes, and were enriched in developmental genes, including several members of the MODY pathway (maturity onset diabetes of the young). The joint modulation by genotype and aging resulted in a more \"aged methylome\" for BXD strains that inherited the DBA/2J parental allele at meQTL.5a. Further, several gene expression traits, body weight, and lipid levels mapped to meQTL.5a, and there was a modest linkage with lifespan. DNA binding motif and protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis identified the hepatic nuclear factor, Hnf1a (MODY3 gene in humans), as a strong candidate. The pleiotropic effects of meQTL.5a could contribute to variation in body size and metabolic traits, and influence CpG methylation and epigenetic aging that could have an impact on lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Individuals who suffer from severe paralysis often lose the capacity to perform fundamental body movements and everyday activities. Empowering these individuals with the ability to operate robotic arms, in high-dimensions, helps to maximize both functional utility and human agency. However, high-dimensional robot teleoperation currently lacks accessibility due to the challenge in capturing high-dimensional control signals from the human, especially in the face of motor impairments. Body-machine interfacing is a viable option that offers the necessary high-dimensional motion capture, and it moreover is noninvasive, affordable, and promotes movement and motor recovery. Nevertheless, to what extent body-machine interfacing is able to scale to high-dimensional robot control, and whether it is feasible for humans to learn, remains an open question. In this exploratory multi-session study, we demonstrate the feasibility of human learning to operate a body-machine interface to control a complex, assistive robotic arm in reaching and Activities of Daily Living tasks. Our results suggest the manner of control space mapping, from interface to robot, to play a critical role in the evolution of human learning.",

    "abstract": "The subcutaneous mechanical response of the fingertip is highly anisotropic due to the presence of a network of collagen fibers linking the outer skin layer to the bone. Yet, the impact of this anisotropy on the fingerpad deformation had not been studied until now. This issue is here tackled using a two-dimensional finite element model of a transverse section of the finger. Different hypotheses about the orientation of the fibers are considered: radial (physiologic), circumferential, and random (isotropic behavior). The three variants of the model are assessed using experimental observations of a finger leaning on a flat surface. Predictions relying on the physiological orientation of fibers align best with reality. Moreover, the orientation of fibers plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of internal strain and stress. These factors, combined with the abrupt shift in contact pressure during the transition from sticking to slipping, represent important sensory cues for partial slip detection. This is valuable information for the development of haptic devices.",

    "abstract": "The genome of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is made up of a single-stranded RNA fragment that can assume a specific secondary structure, whose stability can influence the virus ability to reproduce. Recent studies have identified putative guanine quadruplex sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments that are involved in coding for both structural and non-structural proteins. In this contribution, we focus on a specific G-rich sequence referred as RG-2, which codes for the non-structural protein 10 (Nsp10) and assumes a parallel guanine-quadruplex (G4) arrangement. We provide the secondary structure of the RG-2 G4 at atomistic resolution by molecular modeling and simulation, validated by the superposition of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectrum. Through both experimental and simulation approaches, we have demonstrated that pyridostatin (PDS), a widely recognized G4 binder, can bind to and stabilize RG-2 G4 more strongly than RG-1, another G4 forming sequence that was previously proposed as a potential target for antiviral drug candidates. Overall, this study highlights RG-2 as a valuable target to inhibit the translation and replication of SARS-CoV-2 paving the way towards original therapeutic approaches against emerging RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundObesity is the number one cardiovascular risk factor for both men and women and is a complex condition. Although a sex dimorphism on vascular function has already been noted, the underlying processes remain unclear. The Rho-kinase pathway has a unique role in controlling vascular tone, and in obese male mice, hyperactivation of this system results in worsened vascular constriction. We investigated whether female mice exhibit decreased Rho-kinase activation as a protective mechanism in obesity.\n\nMethodsWe exposed male and female mice to a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. At the end, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, adipose tissue inflammation, and vascular function were investigated.\n\nResultsMale mice were more sensitive to HFD-induced body weight gain, glucose tolerance, and inflammation than female mice. After establishing obesity, female mice demonstrated increase in energy expenditure, characterized by an increase in heat, whereas male mice did not. Interestingly, obese female mice, but not male, displayed attenuated vascular contractility to different agonists, such difference was blunted by inhibition of Rho-kinase. Finally, aortae from obese female mice, but not male, responded prematurely to Rho-kinase inhibitor, which was accompanied by a suppressed Rho-kinase activation, measured by western blot.\n\nConclusionIn obesity, female mice demonstrate a vascular protective mechanism - suppression of vascular Rho-kinase - to minimize the cardiovascular risk associated with obesity, whereas male mice do not generate any adaptive response. Future investigations can help to understand how Rho-kinase becomes suppressed in female during obesity.",

    "abstract": "The validation of mathematical models of tumour growth is frequently hampered by the lack of sufficient experimental data, resulting in qualitative rather than quantitative studies. Recent approaches to this problem have attempted to extract information about tumour growth by integrating multiscale experimental measurements, such as longitudinal cell counts and gene expression data. In the present study, we investigated the performance of several mathematical models of tumour growth, including classical logistic, fractional and novel multiscale models, in terms of quantifying in-vitro tumour growth in the presence and absence of therapy. We further examined the effect of genes associated with changes in chemosensitivity in cell death rates. State-of-the-art Bayesian inference, likelihood maximisation and uncertainty quantification techniques allowed a thorough evaluation of model performance. The results suggest that the classical single-cell population model (SCPM) was the best fit for the untreated and low-dose treatment conditions, while the multiscale model with a cell death rate symmetric with the expression profile of OCT4 (SymSCPM) yielded the best fit for the high-dose treatment data. Further identifiability analysis showed that the multiscale model was both structurally and practically identifiable under the condition of known OCT4 expression profiles. Overall, the present study demonstrates that model performance can be improved by incorporating multiscale measurements of tumour growth.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFollowing SARS-CoV-2 infection a significant proportion of convalescent individuals develop the post-COVID condition (PCC) that is characterized by wide spectrum of symptoms encompassing various organs. Even though the underlying pathophysiology of PCC is not known, detection of viral transcripts and antigens in tissues other than lungs raise the possibility that PCC may be a consequence of aberrant immune response to the viral antigens. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated B cell and antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens in PCC patients who experienced mild COVID-19 disease during the pre-vaccination period of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethodsThe study subjects included unvaccinated male and female subjects who developed PCC or not (No-PCC) after clearing RT-PCR confirmed mild COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 D614G and omicron RBD specific B cell subsets in peripheral circulation were assessed by flow cytometry. IgG, IgG3 and IgA antibody titers toward RBD, spike and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma were evaluated by ELISA.\n\nResultsThe frequency of the B cells specific to D614G-RBD were comparable in convalescent groups with and without PCC in both males and females. Notably, in females with PCC, the anti-D614G RBD specific double negative (IgD-CD27-) B cells showed significant correlation with the number of symptoms at acute of infection. Anti-spike antibody responses were also higher at 3 months post-infection in females who developed PCC, but not in the male PCC group. On the other hand, the male PCC group also showed consistently high anti-RBD IgG responses compared to all other groups.\n\nConclusionsThe antibody responses to the spike protein, but not the RBD-specific B cell responses diverge between convalescent males and females, and those who develop PCC or not. Our findings suggest that sex-related factors may also be involved in the development of PCC via modulating antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens.\n\nShort SummaryPost-COVID Condition (PCC) is lingering illness that afflicts a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients from three months after clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therapy for PCC is only palliative and the underlying disease mechanisms are unclear. The wide spectrum of PCC symptoms that can affect different organs and the detection of viral components in tissues distant from lungs raise the possibility that PCC may be associated with aberrant immune response due to presence of viral antigens. Therefore, we studied B cell and antibody responses to the spike and nucleoprotein antigens in PCC patients who cleared mild SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-vaccination COVID-19 pandemic period. We observed divergent patterns of immune reactivity to the spike protein in PCC males and females at different times post-infection, suggesting that the immune responses in PCC may also be influenced by sex-related factors.",

    "abstract": "Maternal antibodies (matAbs) protect against a myriad of pathogens early in life; however, these antibodies can also inhibit de novo immune responses against some vaccine platforms. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) matAbs are efficiently transferred during pregnancy and protect infants against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections. It is unknown if matAbs inhibit immune responses elicited by different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Here, we established a mouse model to determine if SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific matAbs inhibit immune responses elicited by recombinant protein and nucleoside-modified mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) vaccines. We found that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccines elicited robust de novo antibody responses in mouse pups in the presence of matAbs. Recombinant protein vaccines were also able to circumvent the inhibitory effects of matAbs when adjuvants were co-administered. While additional studies need to be completed in humans, our studies raise the possibility that mRNA-LNP-based and adjuvanted protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have the potential to be effective when delivered very early in life.",

    "abstract": "ACBD3 is a protein localised to the Golgi apparatus and recruits other proteins, such as PI4KIII{beta}, to the Golgi. However, the mechanism through which ACBD3 itself is recruited to the Golgi is poorly understood. This study demonstrates there are two mechanisms for ACBD3 recruitment to the Golgi. First, we identified that an MWT374-376 motif in the unique region upstream of the GOLD domain in ACBD3 is essential for Golgi localisation. Second, we use unbiased proteomics to demonstrate that ACBD3 interacts with SCFD1, a Sec1/Munc-18 (SM) protein, and a SNARE protein, SEC22B. CRISPR-KO of SCFD1 causes ACBD3 to become cytosolic. We also found that ACBD3 is redundantly recruited to the Golgi apparatus by two golgins: golgin-45 and giantin, which bind to ACBD3 through interaction with the MWT374-376 motif. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ACBD3 is recruited to the Golgi in a two-step sequential process, with the SCFD1-mediated interaction occurring upstream of the interaction with the golgins.",

    "abstract": "Vertical gradients in microclimate, resource availability and interspecific interactions are thought to underly stratification patterns in tropical insect communities. However, only a few studies have explored the adaptive significance of vertical space use during early population divergence. We analysed flight-height variation across speciation events in Heliconius butterflies representing parallel instances of divergence between low and high-altitude populations. We measured flight-height in wild H. erato venus and H. chestertonii, lowland and mountain specialists respectively, and found that H. chestertonii consistently flies at a lower height. We compared these data with previously published results for H. e. cyrbia and H. himera, the latter of which flies lower and, like H. chestertonii, recently colonised high-altitude, dry forests. We show that these repeated trends largely result from shared patterns of selection across equivalent environments, producing parallel trait-shifts in H. himera and H. chestertonii. Although our results imply a signature of local adaptation, we did not find an association between resource distribution and flight-height in H. e. venus and H. chestertonii. We discuss how this pattern may be explained by variation in forest structure and microclimate. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of behavioural adjustments during early divergence mediated by altitude-shifts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe microtubule-associated protein Tau has attracted diverse and increasing research interest, with Tau being mentioned in the title/abstract of nearly 34,000 PubMed-indexed publications to date. To accelerate studies into Tau biology, the characterisation of its multiple proteoforms, including disease-relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs), and its role in neurodegeneration, a multitude of Tau-targeting antibodies have been developed, with hundreds of distinct antibody clones currently available for purchase. Nonetheless, concerns over antibody specificity and limited understanding of the performance of many of these reagents has hindered research.\n\nMethodsWe have employed a range of techniques in combination with samples of murine and human origin to characterise the performance and specificity of 53 commercially-available Tau antibodies by Western blot, and a subset of these, 35 antibodies, in immunohistochemistry.\n\nResultsContinued expression of residual protein was found in presumptive Tau \"knockout\" human cells and further confirmed through mass-spectrometry proteomics, providing evidence of Tau isoforms generated by exon skipping. Importantly, many total and isoform-specific antibodies failed to detect this residual Tau, as well as Tau expressed at low, endogenous levels, thus highlighting the importance of antibody choice. Our data further reveal that the binding of several \"total\" Tau antibodies, which are assumed to detect Tau independently of post-translational modifications, was partially inhibited by phosphorylation. Many antibodies also displayed non-specific cross-reactivity, with some total and phospho-Tau antibodies cross-reacting with MAP2 isoforms, while the \"oligomer-specific\" T22 antibody detected monomeric Tau on Western blot. Regardless of their specificity, with one exception, the phospho-Tau antibodies tested were found to not detect the unphosphorylated protein.\n\nConclusionsWe identify Tau antibodies across all categories (total, PTM-dependent and isoform-specific) that can be employed in Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry applications to reliably detect even low levels of Tau expression with high specificity. This is of particular importance for studying Tau in non-neuronal cells and peripheral tissues, as well as for the confident validation of knockout cells and/or animal models. This work represents an extensive resource that serves as a point of reference for future studies. Our findings may also aid in the re-interpretation of existing data and improve reproducibility of Tau research.",

    "abstract": "Early-life inflammation can have long lasting impact on pain processing and pain behaviours. For example, we have shown neonatal inflammation can result in changes within spinal neuronal networks and altered flinching of the hind paw following formalin injection three weeks later. This suggests mechanisms for altered pain behaviours lie in first and second order neurons in the pain neuroaxis. Exactly how these changes progress during postnatal development is not known. Accordingly, we investigated neuroinflammatory markers in sensory neurons (dorsal root ganglia; DRGs) and spinal cords of Wistar rats (both sexes) after early life inflammation. Rats were injected with LPS or saline on postnatal days (P) 3 and 5. DRGs and spinal cords (SC) were isolated on P7, 13 and 21, and the expression of six inflammatory mediators were quantified via RT-qPCR. In the DRG, four proinflammatory mediators were elevated in P7 rats exposed to LPS. By P13, only two proinflammatory agents were elevated, whereas at P21 the levels of all six inflammatory mediators were similar between LPS and saline-treated rats. There were no sex-specific differences in the expression profile of any mediator in DRGs. In the spinal cord this expression profile was reversed with no change in inflammatory mediators at P7, elevation of two at P13 and four at P21 in LPS treated rats. Interestingly, these differences were greater in the spinal cords of female rats, indicating sex-specific modulation of neuroinflammation even at these early stages of postnatal development. The increased inflammatory mediator profile in the spinal cords of P21 LPS-treated rats was accompanied by sex-specific modulation of astrocytic (GFAP) activation, with females showing an increase and males a decrease in GFAP following LPS exposure. Together, these data indicate sensory neurons are more susceptible to acute inflammation whereas inflammation in the spinal cord is delayed. The sex-specific modulation of inflammation during critical phases of development may help explain altered pain behaviours in adult males and females.",

Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are the most promising vehicles for non-invasive gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), but reliable and reproducible in vitro models to assess their clinical potential are lacking. hCOs can take on these issues as they are a physiologically relevant model to assess AAV transduction efficiency, cellular tropism, and biodistribution within the tissue parenchyma, all of which could significantly modulate therapeutic efficacy. Here, we examine a variety of naturally occurring AAV serotypes and measure their ability to transduce neurons and glia in hCOs from multiple donors. We demonstrate cell tropism driven by AAV serotype and hCO donor and quantify fractions of neurons and astrocytes transduced with GFP as well as overall hCO health.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the intracellular concentration of free calcium (Ca2+) underpin egg activation and initiation of development in animals and plants. In mammals, the Ca2+ release is periodical, known as Ca2+ oscillations, and mediated by the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1). Another divalent cation, zinc (Zn2+), increases exponentially during oocyte maturation and is vital for meiotic transitions, arrests, and polyspermy prevention. It is unknown if these pivotal cations interplay during fertilization. Here, using mouse eggs, we showed that basal concentrations of labile Zn2+ are indispensable for sperm-initiated Ca2+ oscillations because Zn2+-deficient conditions induced by cell-permeable chelators abrogated Ca2+ responses evoked by fertilization and other physiological and pharmacological agonists. We also found that chemically-or genetically generated eggs with lower levels of labile Zn2+ displayed reduced IP3R1 sensitivity and diminished ER Ca2+ leak despite the stable content of the stores and IP3R1 mass. Resupplying Zn2+ restarted Ca2+ oscillations, but excessive Zn2+ prevented and terminated them, hindering IP3R1 responsiveness. The findings suggest that a window of Zn2+ concentrations is required for Ca2+ responses and IP3R1 function in eggs, ensuring optimal response to fertilization and egg activation.",

Here, we present a novel modeling approach leveraging recurrent neural networks to automatically discover the cognitive algorithms governing animal decision-making. We show that neural networks with only one or two units can predict choices of individual animals more accurately than classical cognitive models, and as accurately as larger neural networks, in three well-studied reward learning tasks. We then interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts such as state-space and fixed-point attractors, leading to a unified comparison of different cognitive models and a detailed characterization of the cognitive mechanisms underlying the animals choices. Our approach also estimates behavior dimensionality and provides insights into the algorithms emerging in meta-reinforcement learning agents. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for examining both healthy and dysfunctional cognition.",

    "abstract": "Splicing is a highly conserved, intricate mechanism intimately linked to transcription elongation, serving as a pivotal regulator of gene expression. Alternative splicing may generate specific transcripts incapable of undergoing translation into proteins, designated as unproductive. A plethora of respiratory viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), strategically manipulate the hosts splicing machinery to circumvent antiviral responses. During the infection, SARS-CoV-2 effectively suppresses interferon (IFN) expression, leading to B cell and CD8+ T cell leukopenia, while simultaneously increasing the presence of macrophages and neutrophils in patients with severe COVID-19. In this study, we integrated publicly available omics datasets to systematically analyze transcripts at the isoform level and delineate the nascent-peptide translatome landscapes of SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells. Our findings reveal a hitherto uncharacterized mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the predominant expression of unproductive splicing isoforms in key IFN signaling genes, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), class I MHC genes, and splicing machinery genes, including IRF7, OAS3, HLA-B, and HNRNPH1. In stark contrast, cytokine and chemokine genes, such as IL6, CXCL8, and TNF, predominantly express productive (protein-coding) splicing isoforms in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 employs a previously unreported tactic of exploiting the host splicing machinery to bolster viral replication and subvert the immune response by selectively upregulating unproductive splicing isoforms from antigen presentation and antiviral response genes. Our study sheds new light on the molecular interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system, offering a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.",

Here we show that this effect is not unique to halorhodopsin, but is also seen with activation of another electrogenic ion pump, archaerhodopsin. The two opsins differ however in the size of the rebound rise in extracellular potassium, [K+]o, after the end of activation, which is far larger with halorhodopsin than for archaerhodopsin activation. Multiple linear regression modelling indicates that most of the variance in the post-illumination surge in [K+]o was explained by the type of opsin, and almost nothing by the size of the preceding, illumination-induced drop in [K+]o. These data provide additional support for the hypothesis that intense chloride-loading of cells, as occurs naturally following intense bursts of GABAergic synaptic bombardment, or artificially following halorhodopsin activation, is followed by extrusion of both Cl and K+ coupled together. We discuss this with respect to the pattern of [K+]o rise that occurs at the onset of seizure-like events.",

Fluctuations in global cerebral blood volume (CBV), induced by concerted changes of brain-wide neuronal activity, are suggested to drive CSF-flux. To test this hypothesis, we performed two related experiments in healthy humans, namely electro-encephalography and blood oxygenation level-dependent functional-MRI during burst-suppression anesthesia, and arterial spin labeling and functional-MRI during transient hypercapnia challenges. Changes in total CBV, induced by changes in instantaneous global neuronal activity during burst-suppression or brain blood flow during hyper-normocapnia transitions, cause opposite functional-MRI signal changes in the basal cisternae, marking CSF flux from and into the brain. This direct coupling of global neuronal activity, brain blood volume and CSF flux indicates a mechanism to enhance brain waste clearance.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryHere we show that CSF flux is mediated by brain blood volume changes, which can be driven by global neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "Temporal predictions can be formed and impact perception when sensory timing is fully predictable: for instance, the detection of a target sound is enhanced if it is presented on the beat of an isochronous rhythm. However, natural sensory stimuli, like speech or music, are not entirely predictable, but still possess statistical temporal regularities. We investigated whether temporal expectations can be formed in non-fully predictable contexts, and how the temporal variability of sensory contexts affects auditory perception. Specifically, we asked how \"rhythmic\" an auditory stimulation needs to be in order to observe temporal predictions effects on auditory discrimination performances. In this behavioral auditory oddball experiment, participants listened to auditory sound sequences where the temporal interval between each sound was drawn from gaussian distributions with distinct standard deviations. Participants were asked to discriminate sounds with a deviant pitch in the sequences. Auditory discrimination performances, as measured with deviant sound discrimination accuracy and response times, progressively declined as the temporal variability of the sound sequence increased. Temporal predictability effects ceased to be observed only for the more variable contexts. Moreover, both global and local temporal statistics impacted auditory perception, suggesting that temporal statistics are promptly integrated to optimize perception. Altogether, these results suggests that temporal predictions can be set up quickly based on the temporal statistics of past sensory events and are robust to a certain amount of temporal variability. Therefore, temporal predictions can be built on sensory stimulations that are not purely periodic nor temporally deterministic.\n\nSignificance statementThe perception of sensory events is known to be enhanced when their timing is fully predictable. However, it is unclear whether temporal predictions are robust to temporal variability, which is naturally present in many auditory signals such as speech and music. In this behavioral experiment, participants listened to auditory sound sequences where the timing between each sound was drawn from distinct gaussian distributions. Participants ability to discriminate deviant sounds in the sequences was function of the temporal statistics of past events: auditory deviant discrimination progressively declined as the temporal variability of the sound sequence increased. Results therefore suggest that auditory perception is sensitive to prediction mechanisms that are involved even if temporal information is not totally predictable.",

    "abstract": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) form essential components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane (BM) and have both structural and signaling roles. Perlecan is a secreted ECM-localized HSPG that contributes to tissue integrity and cell-cell communication. Although a core component of the ECM, the role of Perlecan in neuronal structure and function is less understood. Here we identify a role for Drosophila Perlecan in the maintenance of larval motoneuron axonal and synaptic stability. Loss of Perlecan causes alterations in the axonal cytoskeleton, followed by axonal breakage and synaptic retraction of neuromuscular junctions. These phenotypes are not prevented by blocking Wallerian degeneration and are independent of Perlecans role in Wingless signaling. Expression of Perlecan solely in motoneurons cannot rescue synaptic retraction phenotypes. Similarly, removing Perlecan specifically from neurons, glia or muscle does not cause synaptic retraction, indicating the protein is secreted from multiple cell types and functions non-cell autonomously. Within the peripheral nervous system, Perlecan predominantly localizes to the neural lamella, a specialized ECM surrounding nerve bundles. Indeed, the neural lamella is disrupted in the absence of Perlecan, with axons occasionally exiting their usual boundary in the nerve bundle. In addition, entire nerve bundles degenerate in a temporally coordinated manner across individual hemi-segments throughout larval development. These observations indicate disruption of neural lamella ECM function triggers axonal destabilization and synaptic retraction of motoneurons, revealing a role for Perlecan in axonal and synaptic integrity during nervous system development.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by recurrent seizures generated in the limbic system, particularly in the hippocampus. In TLE, recurrent mossy fiber sprouting from dentate gyrus granule cells (DGCs) creates an aberrant epileptogenic network between DGCs which operates via ectopically expressed GluK2/GluK5-containing kainate receptors (KARs). TLE patients are often resistant to anti-seizure medications and suffer significant comorbidities; hence there is an urgent need for novel therapies. Previously we have shown that GluK2 knockout mice are protected from seizures. This study aims at providing evidence that downregulating KARs in the hippocampus using gene therapy reduces chronic epileptic discharges in TLE.\n\nMethodsWe combined molecular biology and electrophysiology in rodent models of TLE and in hippocampal slices surgically resected from patients with drug-resistant TLE.\n\nResultsHere we confirmed the translational potential of KAR suppression using a non-selective KAR antagonist that markedly attenuated Interictal-like Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) in TLE patient-derived hippocampal slices. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype-9 vector expressing anti-grik2 miRNA was designed to specifically downregulate GluK2 expression. Direct delivery of AAV9-anti grik2 miRNA into the hippocampus of TLE mice led to a marked reduction in seizure activity. Transduction of TLE patient hippocampal slices reduced levels of GluK2 protein and, most importantly, significantly reduced IEDs.\n\nInterpretationOur gene silencing strategy to knock down aberrant GluK2 expression demonstrates inhibition of chronic seizure in a mouse TLE model and IEDs in cultured slices derived from TLE patients. These results provide proof-of-concept for a gene therapy approach targeting GluK2 KARs for drug-resistant TLE patients.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are endogenous oscillations present in nearly all organisms from prokaryotes to humans, allowing them to adapt to cyclical environments close to 24 hours. Circadian rhythms are regulated by a central clock, which is based on a transcription-translation feedback loop. One important protein in the central loop in metazoan clocks is PERIOD, which is regulated in part by Casein kinase 1{varepsilon}/{delta} (CK1{varepsilon}/{delta}) phosphorylation. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, period and casein kinase 1{varepsilon}/{delta} are conserved as lin-42 and kin-20, respectively. Here we studied the involvement of lin-42 and kin-20 in circadian rhythms of the adult nematode using a bioluminescence-based circadian transcriptional reporter. We show that mutations of lin-42 and kin-20 generate a significantly longer endogenous period, suggesting a role for both genes in the nematode circadian clock, as in other organisms. These phenotypes can be partially rescued by overexpression of either gene under their native promoter. Both proteins are expressed in neurons and seam cells, a population of epidermal stem cells in C. elegans that undergo multiple divisions during development. Depletion of LIN-42 and KIN-20 specifically in neuronal cells after development was sufficient to lengthen the period of oscillating sur-5 expression. Therefore, we conclude that LIN-42 and KIN-20 are critical regulators of the adult nematode circadian clock through neuronal cells.",

A proteomic workflow, based on isolated microglia obtained from mouse brains by cell sorting and coupled to mass spectrometry for identification and quantification, was applied.

Firstly, BVC directional tunings align with environment walls in squares, but are uniformly distributed in circles, demonstrating that environmental geometry alters BVC receptive fields. Secondly, inserted barriers uncover both excitatory and inhibitory components to BVC receptive fields, demonstrating that inhibitory inputs contribute to BVC field formation.

    "abstract": "Interspecies organogenesis via blastocyst complementation provides a unique platform to study development in an evolutionarily context and holds potential to overcome world-wide organ shortages1. By using this technique, rat pancreas, thymus, heart, and eye tissues have been generated in mice2-4. To date, however, xeno-generation of brain tissues has not been achieved through blastocyst complementation. Here, we developed an optimized one-step blastocyst complementation strategy based on C-CRISPR5, which facilitated rapid screening of candidate genes to support blastocyst complementation. Among the seven WNT pathway-related genes selected for targeting, only Dkk1 or Hesx1 deficiency supported forebrain complementation by blastocyst injection of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Further, injecting rat ESCs (rESCs) into mouse blastocysts deficient for Hesx1 but not Dkk1 supported the development of adult chimeric forebrains comprised a large proportion of rat cells that were structurally and functionally similar to the mouse forebrains. Our analysis revealed that the rESC-derived forebrains developed along the spatial-temporal trajectory with the mouse forebrains rather than rat forebrains, but gene expression profiles of rESC-derived nerve cells surprisingly maintained the characteristics of the rat cells. We noted that the chimeric rate gradually decreased as development progressed, suggesting xenogeneic barriers during mid-to-late prenatal development. Interspecies forebrain complementation opens the door for studying evolutionarily conserved and divergent mechanisms underlying brain development and cognitive function. The C-CRIPSR based IBC strategy developed here holds great potential to broaden the study and application of interspecies organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "1By selectively focusing on a specific portion of the environment, animals can solve the problem of information overload, toning down irrelevant inputs and concentrate only on the relevant ones. This may be of particular relevance for animals such as the jumping spider, which possess a wide visual field of almost 360{degrees} and thus could benefit from a low-cost system for sharpening attention. Jumping spiders have a modular visual system composed of four pairs of eyes, of which only the two frontal eyes (i.e., AMEs) are motile, whereas the other secondary pairs remain immobile. We hypothesized that jumping spiders can exploit both primary and secondary eyes for stimulus detection and attentional shift, with the two systems working synergistically. In Experiment 1 we investigated AMEs attentional responses following a spatial cue presented to the secondary eyes. In Experiment 2, we tested for enhanced attention in the secondary eyes visual field congruent with the direction of the AMEs focus. In both experiments, we observed that animals were faster and more accurate in detecting a target when it appeared in a direction opposite to that of the initial cue. In contrast with our initial hypothesis, these results would suggest that attention is segregated across eyes, while each system works to compensate the other by attending to different spatial locations, rather than sharing a common attentional focus.",

    "abstract": "Behaviour is predicted to be a primary determinant of the success of the invasion process during the early phases of colonization. Comparing sympatric invaders and native species may provide a good approach to unravel behavioural traits involved in an invasion process. In this study, we carried out an experimental simulation of the introduction and the establishment phase into a new environment and assessed the expression of activity, alertness and habituation in a non-indigenous Mediterranean population of the South African nudibranch Godiva quadricolor comparing its profiles with those of the sympatric native Cratena peregrina and Caloria quatrefagesi. Individuals of these three species were subjected to three behavioural tests: spontaneous activity, carried out in the introduction phase (immediately after sampling) and after a week of acclimatization; alert test, in which a potential threat was simulated by means of a tactile stimulus; habituation test, where the same alert test stimulus was repeated five times at thirty- minute intervals. Native nudibranch had repeatable traits, although with species differences perhaps related to their different ecological niches. The comparison with the invasive species highlighted its low repeatability in activity levels, suggesting higher plasticity, a strong tendency to locomotor activity, and a marked sensitization in the habituation test. Such traits could play an important and active role in the ongoing invasion process.",

    "abstract": "Germinal matrix hemorrhages (GMH) and the consequent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) are among the most common and severe neurological complications of preterm birth that require lifelong complex neurosurgical care. GMH and PHH provoke disruption of neuroepithelium/ependyma development, a key structure implicated in brain development and homeostasis. Neuroepithelial/ependymal damage causes lifelong cognitive and motor deficits; however, no therapy is directed to recover the damaged ependyma. This study is aimed to test the possibilities of ependymal repair in GMH/PHH using neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal progenitors (EpPs). Thus, it sets the basis for a therapeutic approach to treating ependymal damage and preventing brain developmental deficits. GMH/PHH was induced in 4-day-old mice using different experimental procedures involving collagenase, blood, or blood serum injections. PHH severity was characterized using magnetic resonance, immunofluorescence, and protein expression quantification with mass spectrometry. Additionally, a new exvivo approach using ventricular walls from mice developing moderate and severe GMH/PHH was generated to study ependymal restoration and wall regeneration after stem cell treatments. NSCs or EpPs obtained from newborn mice were transplanted in the explants, and pretreatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was tested. Ependymal differentiation and the effect of MSC-conditioned microenvironment were investigated in both explants and primary cultures. In the animals, PHH severity was correlated with the extension of GMH, ependymal disruption, astroglial/microglial reactions, and ventriculomegaly. In the explants, the severity and extension of GMH hindered the survival rates of the transplanted NSCs/EpPs. In the explants affected with GMH, new multiciliated ependymal cells could be generated from transplanted NSCs and, more efficiently, from EpPs. Blood and TNF negatively affected ciliogenesis in cells expressing Foxj1. Pretreatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) improved the survival rates of EpPs and ependymal differentiation while reducing the edematous and inflammatory conditions in the explants. In conclusion, in GMH/PHH, the ependyma can be restored from either NSC or EpP transplantation, being EpPs in an MSC-conditioned microenvironment more efficient for this purpose. Modifying the neuroinflammatory microenvironment by MSC pretreatment positively influenced the success of the ependymal restoration.",

In a 2-year longitudinal study, 6-to-7-year-old children performed a reinforcement learning task in which they received feedback immediately or with a short delay following their response. Childrens learning was found to be sensitive to feedback timing modulations in their reaction time and inverse temperature parameter, which quantifies value-guided decision-making. They showed longitudinal improvements towards more optimal value-based learning, and their hippocampal volume showed protracted maturation. Better delayed model-derived learning covaried with larger hippocampal volume longitudinally, in line with the adult literature. In contrast, a larger striatal volume in children was associated with both better immediate and delayed model-derived learning longitudinally. These findings show, for the first time, an early hippocampal contribution to the dynamic development of reinforcement learning in middle childhood, with neurally less differentiated and more cooperative memory systems than in adults.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pandemic spread across multiple priority infectious disease threats. While the cell envelope plays a key role in AMR, this also makes it challenging to study how antibiotics function inside the cell. Herein, we present a Klebsiella pneumoniae cell-free gene expression (CFE) platform for the rapid profiling of intracellular antibiotic sensitivity and resistance. This cell-free approach provides the unique macromolecular and metabolite components from this microbe, which include multiple antibiotic targets from transcription, translation, and metabolic processes. First, we compare the K. pneumoniae CFE system to whole cell antimicrobial assays. We find that several antibiotic classes show higher sensitivity in the CFE system, suggesting limitations in antibiotic transport in the whole cell assay. Next, we evolved K. pneumoniae strains with resistance to specific antibiotics and use whole genome sequencing analysis for genotyping. As an exemplary case, we show that a single RNA polymerase beta subunit variant H526L (also frequently found in multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis) confers a 58-fold increase in CFE resistance to rifampicin. Overall, we describe a safe (i.e., non-living, non-pathogenic) platform suitable for studying an infectious disease model in a Containment Level 1 laboratory. Our CFE strategy is generalisable to laboratory and clinical K. pneumoniae strains and provides a new experimental tool to profile intracellular AMR variants. In conclusion, our CFE tool provides a significant advance towards understanding AMR and complements wider infectious disease studies.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are infamous producers of toxins. While the toxic potential of planktic cyanobacterial blooms is well documented, the ecosystem level effects of toxigenic benthic and epiphytic cyanobacteria are an understudied threat. The freshwater epiphytic cyanobacterium Aetokthonos hydrillicola has recently been shown to produce the \"eagle killer\" neurotoxin aetokthonotoxin causing the fatal neurological disease Vacuolar Myelinopathy. The disease affects a wide array of wildlife in the southeastern United States, most notably waterfowl and birds of prey, including the bald eagle. In an assay for cytotoxicity, we found the crude extract of the cyanobacterium to be much more potent than pure aetokthonotoxin, prompting further investigation. Here, we describe the isolation and structure elucidation of the aetokthonostatins, linear peptides belonging to the dolastatin compound family, featuring a unique modification of the C-terminal phenylalanine derived moiety. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and molecular modeling, we confirmed that aetokthonostatin acts as a potent tubulin binder. We also show that aetokthonostatin inhibits reproduction of the nematode C. elegans, resulting in increased population lethality of the combined action of the two toxins produced by A. hydrillicola. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the aetokthonostatin biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthe-tase/polyketide synthase accompanied by a unique tailoring machinery. The biosynthetic activity of a specific N-terminal methyltransferase was confirmed by in vitro biochemical studies, establishing a mechanistic link between the gene cluster and its product.\n\nSignificance StatementCyanotoxins have adverse effects on ecosystems. Our understanding of their potential risk has recently been expanded by the discovery of aetokthonotoxin, produced by the cyanobacterium Aetokthonos hydrillicola growing on invasive plants. Via trophic transfer, it acts as a neurotoxin causing mortality in animals including top predators like Bald Eagles. Closer examination of A. hydrillicola revealed that it also produces highly toxic dolastatin derivatives. A. hydrillicola is the first cultured cyanobacterium producing dolastatin derivatives, allowing us to uncover biosynthetic gene clusters of this compound family. In contrast to all other known dolastatin-producers, which are marine cyanobacteria, A. hydrillicola thrives in freshwater reservoirs, making it a potential threat also for human health. Monitoring of the cyanobacterium and its toxins is strongly recommended.",

ETT surfaces promote (poly)microbial colonization and biofilm formation, with a heavy burden for VAP. Devising safe, broad-spectrum antimicrobial materials to tackle ETT bioburden is needful. Herein, we immobilized ciprofloxacin (CIP) and/or chlorhexidine (CHX), through polydopamine (pDA)-based functionalization, onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces. These surfaces were characterized and challenged with single and polymicrobial cultures of VAP-relevant bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Acinetobacter baumannii; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis) and fungi (Candida albicans). The coatings imparted PVC surfaces with homogeneous morphology, varied wettability, and low roughness. Coated surfaces exhibited sustained CIP/CHX release, retaining long-term (10 days) stability. Surfaces evidencing no A549 lung cell toxicity exhibited broad-spectrum anti-biofilm activity. CIP/CHX co-immobilization resulted in better outcomes than CIP or CHX coatings, reducing bacteria up to >7 Log10, and modestly distressing (ca. 1 Log10) C. albicans. The anti-biofilm effectiveness of coated surfaces endured for dual biofilms, substantially preventing bacterial populations and fungi (ca. 2.7 Log10) in P. aeruginosa/C. albicans consortia. A less pronounced antifungal effect (ca. 1 Log10 reduction) was found in triple-species communities, but fully preventing P. aeruginosa and S. aureus populations. CIP/CHX co-immobilization holds a safe and robust broad-spectrum antimicrobial coating for PVC-ETTs, with the promise laying in reducing VAP incidence.",

    "abstract": "Proliferations of toxic benthic cyanobacteria are increasingly being reported around the world. Of particular concern are Microcoleus-dominated mats associated with anatoxin production that have resulted in dog fatalities. Although the impact of cyanophages has been demonstrated in planktonic systems, their role in the population dynamics of benthic cyanobacteria has received little attention. Here we use metagenomics to explore phage presence in benthic mats from the Wolastoq|Saint John River (WR; New Brunswick, Canada) and Eel River (ER; California, US). Our survey recovered multiple viral-like sequences associated with different putative bacterial hosts, including two cyanophage genomes with apparently different replication strategies. A lysogenic cyanophage (predicted as a prophage) was found integrated in the genomes of Microcoleus sp. 3 recovered from five ER mat samples. This Microcoleus phage is related to previously described Phormidium phage counterparts. Also, we recovered lytic cyanophages from WR and ER mats dominated by anatoxin-producing Microcoleus, which was predicted as the putative host. Despite the geographical distance between WR and ER, the lytic Microcoleus phage genomes recovered from each river have similar sizes (circa 239 Kbp) and share similar gene content with high sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these lytic Microcoleus phages are distant from any other cyanophage previously described. Our results constitute the first report of cyanophages predicted to infect and therefore influence the population dynamics of mat-forming Microcoleus spp. associated with anatoxin production.",

Although PhoP and PhoR have been structurally characterized, the signal(s) that this TCS responds to remains unknown. In this study, we show that PhoR is a sensor of acidic pH/high salt conditions, which activate PhoP via phosphorylation. Transcriptomic studies uncover that acidic pH-inducible expression of PhoP regulon is significantly inhibited in a PhoR-deleted M. tuberculosis. Using genome-wide screening we further identify a non-canonical mechanism of PhoP phosphorylation by the sensor kinase PrrB. To investigate how phosphorylation of PhoP is regulated, we discovered that PhoR functions as a phosphatase. Our results identify the motif/residues responsible for contrasting kinase/phosphatase dual functioning of PhoP, and collectively determine the homeostatic regulation of intra-mycobacterial P~PhoP which controls the final output of PhoP regulon. Together, these data uncover that PhoR plays a central role in mycobacterial adaptation to low pH conditions within the host macrophage phagosome. Consistent with these results a PhoR-deleted M. tuberculosis remains significantly attenuated in macrophages and animal models.",

    "abstract": "Human adenoviruses are ubiquitous contaminants of surface water. Indigenous protists may interact with adenoviruses and contribute to their removal from the water column, though the associated kinetics and mechanisms differ between protist species. In this work, we investigated the interaction of human adenovirus type 2 (HAdV2) with the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis. In co-incubation experiments in a freshwater matrix, T. pyriformis was found to efficiently remove HAdV2, with [&ge;] 4 log10 removal over 72 hours. Neither sorption onto the ciliate nor secreted compounds contributed to the observed loss of infectious HAdV2. Instead, internalization was shown to be the dominant removal mechanism, resulting in the presence of viral particles inside food vacuoles of T. pyriformis, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The fate of HAdV2 once ingested was scrutinized and no evidence of virus digestion was found over the course of 48 hours. This work shows that T. pyriformis can exert a dual role on microbial water quality: while they remove infectious adenovirus from the water column, they can also accumulate and potentially protect infectious viruses from exposure to environmental or engineered stressors.\n\nEnvironmental significanceHuman viruses are ubiquitous contaminants of surface water. The fate of human viruses, once discharged into the environment, is modulated by indigenous microorganisms in the surrounding water body. Among microorganisms, the role of protists in controlling virus persistence has been overlooked. Here, we investigate the interactions of the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis with human adenovirus type 2. We demonstrate that T. pyriformis can serve as a sink of adenovirus from the water column, but also act as a reservoir and potential protective barrier for infectious viruses against stressors. T. pyriformis ciliates are among the most abundant protists in surface waters. Understanding this dual role of protists is important for assessing and maintaining microbial water quality and infection risks.",

    "abstract": "Sore throat is one of the most common complaints encountered in the ambulatory clinical setting. Rapid, culture-independent diagnostic techniques that do not rely on pharyngeal swabs would be highly valuable as a point-of-care strategy to guide outpatient antibiotic treatment. Despite the promise of this approach, efforts to detect volatiles during oropharyngeal infection have yet been limited. In our research study, we sought to evaluate for specific bacterial volatile organic compounds (VOC) biomarkers in isolated cultures in vitro, in order to establish proof-of-concept prior to initial clinical studies of breath biomarkers. A particular challenge for diagnosis of pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes is the likelihood that many metabolites may be shared by S. pyogenes and other related oropharyngeal colonizing bacterial species. Therefore, we evaluated whether sufficient metabolic differences are present that distinguish the volatile metabolome of Group A streptococci from other streptococcal species that also colonize the respiratory mucosa, such as S. pneumoniae and S. intermedius. In this work, we identify candidate biomarkers that distinguish S. pyogenes from other species, and establish highly produced VOCs that indicate presence of S. pyogenes in vitro, supporting future breath-based diagnostic testing for streptococcal pharyngitis.\n\nIMPORTANCEAcute pharyngitis accounts for approximately 15 million ambulatory care visits in the USA. The most common and important bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenesis, accounting for 15% to 30% of pediatric pharyngitis. Distinguishing between bacterial and viral pharyngitis is key to management in US practice. Culture of a specimen obtained by throat swab is the standard laboratory procedure for the microbiologic confirmation of pharyngitis, however this method is time consuming which delays appropriate treatment. If left untreated, S. pyogenes pharyngitis may lead to local and distant complications. In this study, we characterized the volatile metabolomes of S. pyogenes and other related oropharyngeal colonizing bacterial species. We identify candidate biomarkers that distinguish S. pyogenes from other species and provides evidence to support future breath-based diagnostic testing for streptococcal pharyngitis.",

    "abstract": "Diamine oxidase (DAO) supplements have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their potential to support DAO deficiency, histamine intolerance and related symptoms. However, choosing a reliable and trustworthy DAO supplement can be a challenging task for patients and Healthcare practitioners. One of the main concerns is the lack of regulatory oversight on dietary supplements, which may result in misleading or incomplete labelling, incorrect dosages, and inadequate quality control. Such situations may lead to patients consuming supplements with insufficient amounts of active enzyme or with questionable purity, potentially resulting in undesired health outcomes. Thus, we tested the DAO activity of a variety of already in-the-market supplements and compared them with one another and against the specified activity, if any, by the manufacturer. Our results show a great discrepancy in most of the products and significant differences in DAO activity between different manufacturers.",

    "abstract": "Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue archives are the largest repository of clinically annotated specimens, and FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow had been developed and applied recently. However, for tissues where cells are hard to dissociate or brains with complex neuronal cells, nuclear transcriptomic profiling are desirable. Moreover, the effects of standard pathological practice on the transcriptome of samples obtained from such archived specimens was also largely anecdotal. Here, we performed RNA-seq of nuclei from hippocampal of mice that underwent freezing, paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation, and paraffin embedding. Then, we comprehensively evaluated the parameters affecting mRNA quality, transcription patterns, functional level and cell states of nuclei, including PFA fixation time and storage time of FFPE tissues. The results showed that the transcriptome signatures of nuclei isolated from fresh PFA-fixed and fresh FFPE tissues were more similar to matched frozen samples. By contrast, the brain fixed for more than 3 days had prominent impacts on the sequencing data, such as the numbers and biotypes of gene, GC content and ratio of reads interval. Commensurately, prolonged fixation time will result in more differentially expressed genes, especially those enriched in spliceosome and synaptic related pathways, affecting the analysis of gene splicing and neuron cells. MuSiC deconvolution results revealed that PFA infiltrating brains for 3 days will destroy the real cell states, and the proportion of neuron, endothelial and oligodendrocytes diminished while that of microglia was reversed. Yet the effect of storage time on cell composition was more neglectable for FFPE samples. In addition, oligodendrocyte precursor cells were most affected in all fixed samples, and their destruction was independent of fixation time and preservation time. The comprehensive results highlighted that fixation time had much more influences on the nuclear transcriptomic profiles than FFPE retention time, and the cliff-like effects appeared to occur over a fixed period of 1-3 days, with no more differences from additional fixation durations.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in the onset and progression of a variety of diseases. Modulating the expression of specific miRNAs is a possible option for therapeutic intervention. A promising strategy is the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to inhibit miRNAs. Targeting ASOs to specific tissues can potentially lower the dosage and improve clinical outcomes by alleviating systemic toxicity. We leverage here automated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) synthesis technology to manufacture an anti-miRNA oligonucleotide (antagomir) covalently attached to a 12-mer peptide that binds to transferrin receptor 1. Our PNA-peptide conjugate is active in cells and animals, effectively inhibiting the expression of miRNA-21 both in cultured mouse cardiomyocytes and different mouse organs (heart, liver, kidney, lung, and spleen), while remaining well-tolerated in animals up to the highest tested dose of 30 mg/kg. Conjugating the targeting ligand to the PNA antagomir significantly improved inhibition of miRNA-21 in the heart by over 50% relative to the PNA alone. Given the modulation of biodistribution observed with our PNA-peptide conjugate, we anticipate this antagomir platform to serve as a starting point for pre-clinical development studies.\n\nTable of Contents Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536802v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@645857org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e3be1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6286aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f76032_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SynopsisConjugating T12, a peptide targeting transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), to a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligonucleotide targeting microRNA-21 increases delivery of the PNA-T12 conjugate to cardiac tissue relative to PNA alone.",

    "abstract": "An unbiased screen for discovering novel genes for fertility identified the spcar3, spermatocyte arrest 3, mutant phenotype. The spcar3 mutation identified a new allele of the Setx gene, encoding senataxin, a DNA/RNA helicase that regulates transcription termination by resolving DNA/RNA hybrid R-loop structures. Although mutations in the human SETX gene cause neural disorders, Setxspcar3 mutant mice do not show any apparent neural phenotype, but instead exhibit male infertility and female subfertility. Histology of the Setxspcar3mutant testes revealed absence of spermatids and mature spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. Cytological analysis of chromosome spread preparations of the Setxspcar3 mutant spermatocytes revealed normal synapsis, but aberrant DNA damage in the autosomes, and defective formation of the sex body. Furthermore, Setxspcar3 testicular cells exhibited abnormal accumulation of R-loops compared to wild type testicular cells. Transient expression assays identified regions of the senataxin protein required for sub-nuclear localization. Together, these results not only confirm that senataxin is required for normal meiosis and spermatogenesis but also provide a new resource for determination of its role in maintaining R-loop formation and genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "Microbiome engineering offers the potential to leverage microbial communities to improve outcomes in human health, agriculture, and climate. To translate this potential into reality, it is crucial to reliably predict community composition and function. But a brute force approach to cataloguing community function is hindered by the combinatorial explosion in the number of ways we can combine microbial species. An alternative is to parametrize microbial community outcomes using simplified, mechanistic models, and then extrapolate these models beyond where we have sampled. But these approaches remain data-hungry, as well as requiring an a priori specification of what kinds of mechanism are included and which are omitted. Here, we resolve both issues by introducing a new, mechanism-agnostic approach to predicting microbial community compositions using limited data. The critical step is the discovery of a sparse representation of the community landscape. We then leverage this sparsity to predict community compositions, drawing from techniques in compressive sensing. We validate this approach on in silico community data, generated from a theoretical model. By sampling just [~] 1% of all possible communities, we accurately predict community compositions out of sample. We then demonstrate the real-world application of our approach by applying it to four experimental datasets, and showing that we can recover interpretable, accurate predictions from highly limited data.",

    "abstract": "Emerging fungal pathogens commonly originate from benign or non-pathogenic strains living in the natural environment. Assessing the evolutionary relationships between pathogenic and non-pathogenic species is one approach for tracing the origins of pathogenicity across species. The recently emerged human pathogen, Candida auris belongs to the Candida/Clavispora clade, a diverse group of 45 yeast species including human pathogens and environmental saprobes. C. auris is believed to have originated in the environment and recently transitioned to a human pathogen. We present a phylogenomic analysis of this clade aimed at testing for patterns implicated in the emergence of pathogenicity using an expanded sample of non-pathogenic strains and species. To build a robust framework for investigating these relationships, we developed a whole-genome sequence dataset of 108 isolates representing 18 species, including 4 newly sequenced species and 18 environmentally isolated strains. Our phylogeny, based on 619 orthologous genes, shows environmentally isolated species and strains interspersed with clinically isolated counterparts, rejecting the hypothesis of a single origin of pathogenicity within the lineage containing C. auris and its closest relatives. Our findings highlight the breadth of environments these yeasts inhabit, and imply, concerningly, that known pathogens could just as easily live outside the human body in diverse natural environments. Based on this result, we suggest that surveillance aimed at detecting emerging pathogens should expand to related environmentally-derived fungi with pathogenic potential.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe rapid rise in the number of fungal pathogens over the past few decades has been linked to climate change, globalization, intensive farming practices, and an increase in immunocompromised individuals. Candida auris is an example of a recently emerged fungal pathogen capable of causing severe disease and large outbreaks in vulnerable patient populations. The evolutionary origins of C. auris are poorly understood, however, they are essential to understanding how and when this pathogen emerged. In this study, we investigated relationships between a sample of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains and species in the Candida/Clavispora clade, a group of 45 yeast species including human pathogens (including C. auris) and environmental saprobes. We used these relationships to test for patterns that might support differing pathogen emergence hypotheses. We found that the relationships between pathogens and non-pathogens suggest many transitions between humans and other environments, rather than a single origin of pathogenicity. It seems plausible that these pathogens, often found in harsh environmental conditions such as seawater, already possessed traits that make them suitable human pathogens, which are perpetuated by increased at-risk patient populations. We should, therefore, be vigilant in our surveillance for clinical isolation of yeasts belonging to this clade from humans.",

    "abstract": "Age-related neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are characterized by deposits of protein aggregates, or amyloid, in various regions of the brain. Traditionally, aggregation of a single protein was observed to be correlated with these different pathologies: tau in AD and -synuclein (S) in PD. However, there is increasing evidence that the pathologies of these two diseases overlap, and the individual proteins may promote each others aggregation. Both tau and S are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), lacking stable secondary and tertiary structure under physiological conditions. In this study we used a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques to interrogate the interaction of tau with both soluble and fibrillar S. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to assess the interactions of specific domains of fluorescently labeled tau with full length and C-terminally truncated S in both monomeric and fibrillar forms. We found that full-length tau as well as individual tau domains interact with monomer S weakly, but this interaction is much more pronounced with S seeds. This interaction does not impact tau aggregation or fibril formation. These findings provide insight into the nature of interactions between tau and S as well as the domains responsible.",

Here, we demonstrate that selenium, via its metabolic intermediate hydrogen selenide, efficiently donates its electrons to ubiquinone to form ubiquinol in the mitochondria through catalysis by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR). Hydrogen selenide is superior to hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor owing to its larger valence shell. We show that this mechanism, independently of selenoprotein production, protects against ferroptosis via ubiquinol production in a manner that depends on xCT mediated selenide formation and SQOR activity. Our findings identify a regulatory mechanism against ferroptosis that implicates SQOR and expands our understanding of selenium in biology.",

Accordingly, identifying mechanisms that activate DNMT3A is of both fundamental and therapeutic interest. Here, we applied a base editor mutational scanning strategy with an improved DNA methylation reporter to systematically identify DNMT3A activating mutations in cells. By integrating an optimized cellular recruitment strategy with paired isogenic cell lines with or without the LOF hotspot R882H mutation, we identify and validate three distinct hyperactivating mutations within or interacting with the regulatory ADD domain of DNMT3A, nominating these regions as potential functional target sites for pharmacological intervention.

Cell treatment was performed at 37{degrees}C on B cells. The cells were plated in 6 well plates at 1.5x106 cells per well and stored at -80{degrees}C. Total RNA extraction and quality control were performed. RTq-PCR was performed according to Genecopoeias instructions. The cycle threshold method ({Delta}{Delta}Ct) was used for data analysis.\n\nResultsThe comparative Ct method quantification (2^-{Delta}Ct) and fold change for CD20, CD 30, CD 40 and CCR5 were - 5.65E+01, 4.80E-01, N/A, 2.47E-01; and 0.954,0.377, N/A and 0.577, respectively. The amount of total RNA extracted from about 4.5x106 cells was low and did not allow us to measure the RNA profile. The A260/A230 ratios were very low due to the low amount of RNA. The analysis of gene expression by qRT-PCR showed that CD40 was not expressed in untreated cells and cells treated with rose extract with the Ct values over 32. All other genes were expressed and well-measured in both B cell samples.\n\nConclusionThe treatment with rose extract at 0.0075% (v/v) did not modify the expression of CD20. However, the expression of CD30 and CCR5 decreased with the rose extract treatment. The range of the fold change showed that the result of CD30 expression was more accurate than for CCR5.",

We hypothesized that traits in primary forests would be more overdispersed due to the greater availability of ecological niches, while secondary forests would have stronger trait clustering due to a a stronger habitat filtering caused by more extreme microclimate.\nC_LIO_LIPrimary forests had higher species richness and PD than secondary forest. Surprisingly, we found higher FD in secondary forest. This pattern was robust even if we decoupled functional and phylogenetic signals or if non-native ant species were excluded from the data. Visitors did not contribute strongly to FD, but they increased PD. Community trait means further corroborate the functional distinctiveness of arboreal ants among secondary and primary forest, with almost all traits being impacted by disturbance and forest succession.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that the most plausible explanation is increased competition among closely related ant species in the secondary forest, which drives trait divergence. In the primary forest, abiotic habitat filters leads to more similar morphology and thus lower FD of phylogenetically more diverse ant assemblages.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The domestic pigeons exceptional phenotypic diversity was key in developing Darwins Theory of Evolution and establishing the concept of artificial selection in domestic species. However, unlike its domestic counterpart, its wild progenitor, the rock dove Columba livia, has received considerably less attention. Therefore, questions regarding their domestication, evolution, taxonomy, and conservation status remain unresolved. We generated whole-genome sequencing data from 65 historical rock dove samples representing all currently recognised subspecies and spanning the species original geographic distribution. Our dataset includes three specimens from Darwins collection and the type specimens of five different taxa. We characterised rock doves population structure, genomic diversity and gene-flow patterns. We show the West African subspecies C. l. gymnocyclus is basal to rock doves and domestic pigeons. Our results show gene-flow signals between the rock doves sister species C. rupestris and all rock doves except the West African populations. Our results led us to propose an evolutionary model for the rock dove considering the Pleistocene refugia theory. We propose that todays rock dove genetic diversity and introgression patterns derive from a history of allopatric cycles and dispersion waves during the Quaternary glacial and interglacial periods. To explore the rock dove domestication history, we combined our new dataset with available genomes from domestic pigeons. Our results point to at least one domestication event in the Levant region that gave rise to all domestic breeds analysed in this study. Finally, we propose a species-level taxonomic arrangement to reflect the evolutionary history of the West African rock dove populations.",

While Cas12a has been implemented for multiplexed knockout genetic screens, it has yet to be optimized for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens in human cells. Here we develop a new Cas12a-based transactivation domain (TAD) recruitment system using the ALFA nanobody and demonstrate simultaneous activation of up to four genes. We screen a genome-wide library to identify modulators of growth and MEK inhibition and we compare these results to those obtained with open reading frame (ORF) overexpression and Cas9-based CRISPRa. We find that the activity of multiplexed arrays is largely predictable from the best-performing guide and provide criteria for selecting active guides. We anticipate that these results will greatly accelerate the exploration of gene function and combinatorial phenotypes at scale.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) is an interferon-induced protein with two ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains linked by a short peptide chain, and the conjugated protein of the ISGylation system. Similar to ubiquitin and other Ubls, ISG15 is ligated to its target proteins with a series of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes known as Uba7, Ube2L6/UbcH8, and HERC5, respectively. Ube2L6/UbcH8 plays a literal central role in ISGylation, underscoring it as an important drug target for boosting innate antiviral immunity. Depending on the type of conjugated protein and the ultimate target protein, E2 enzymes have been shown to function as monomers, dimers, or both. UbcH8 has been crystalized in both monomeric and dimeric forms, but the functional state is unclear. Here, we used a combined approach of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize UbcH8s oligomeric state in solution. SAXS revealed a dimeric UbcH8 structure that could be dissociated when fused with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase molecule. NMR spectroscopy validated the presence of a concentration-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium and suggested a backside dimerization interface. Chemical shift perturbation and peak intensity analysis further suggest dimer-induced conformational dynamics at ISG15 and E3 interfaces - providing hypotheses for the proteins functional mechanisms. Our study highlights the power of combining NMR and SAXS techniques in providing structural information about proteins in solution.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma (M.) bovis, the agent of mastitis, pneumonia, and arthritis in cattle, harbors a small genome of approximately 1 Mbp. Combining data from Illumina and Nanopore technologies, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of 35 European strains and isolate DL422_88 from Cuba. While the high proportion of repetitive structures in M. bovis genomes represents a particular challenge, implementation of our own pipeline Mycovista (available on GitHub www.github.com/sandraTriebel/mycovista) in a hybrid approach enabled contiguous assembly of the genomes and, consequently, improved annotation rates considerably. To put our European strain panel in a global context, we analyzed the new genome sequences together with 175 genome assemblies from public databases. Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on core genes of these 219 strains revealed a clustering pattern according to geographical origin, with European isolates positioned on clades 4 and 5. Genomic data allowing assignment of strains to tissue specificity or certain disease manifestations could not be identified. Seven strains isolated from cattle with systemic circular condition (SCC), still a largely unknown manifestation of M. bovis disease, were located on both clades 4 and 5. Pairwise association analysis revealed 108 genomic elements associated with a particular clade of the phylogenetic tree. Further analyzing these hits, 25 genes are functionally annotated and could be linked to a M. bovis protein, e.g. various proteases and nucleases, as well as ten variable surface lipoproteins (Vsps) and other surface proteins. These clade-specific genes could serve as useful markers in epidemiological and clinical surveys.",

    "abstract": "Many plant and animal cells transition from canonical to non-canonical cell cycles during development, resulting in the formation of polyploid cells. Two types of non-canonical cell cycles exist: endoreplication, where cells increase their DNA content without entering M phase, and endomitosis, where cells enter M phase but exit prematurely. Although endoreplication has been extensively studied in plants and insects, much less is known on the regulation of endomitosis, which is the most common mode of polyploidization in mammals. In this study, we use fetal-derived human hepatocyte organoids (Hep-Org), to investigate how human hepatocytes initiate and execute endomitosis. We find that cells in endomitosis M phase have normal mitotic timings, but lose membrane anchorage to the midbody during cytokinesis, resulting in regression of the cytokinetic furrow and formation of binucleate cells. Using immunofluorescence, we find that three cortical anchoring proteins, RacGAP1, anillin, and citron kinase (CIT-K), lose their association with the cell cortex during cytokinetic regression. Moreover, reduction of WNT activity by withdrawal of CHIR99021, a GSK3 inhibitor, from the culturing medium increases the percentage of binucleated cells in Hep-Orgs. This effect is lost in organoids with mutations in the atypical E2F proteins, E2F7 and E2F8, which have been implicated in binucleation of rodent hepatocytes. Together, our results identify how human hepatocytes inhibit cell division in endomitosis, and highlight an evolutionary recurrent mechanism to initiate non-canonical cell cycles in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by high blood glucose due to compromised insulin secretion from pancreatic {beta}-cells. {beta}-cells primarily comprise insulin-secreting large-dense-core-vesicles/insulin-secretory-granules (ISGs) and also multivesicular-bodies (MVBs). MVBs are vesicles of endosomal origin containing intraluminal vesicles, which upon fusion with the plasma membrane, secrete exosomes. These play a significant role in the physiology and pathology of T2D via intercellular communication. The role of MVBs and their influence on ISGs of {beta}-cells or their characterization is yet to be uncovered. In our study, we characterized the role of MVBs by comparing them to largely well-characterized ISGs in {beta}-cells. We compared the density, localization, and exocytosis of MVBs with ISGs in {beta}-cells. For this, we developed a novel probe where we exploit the efficiency of tetraspanins CD63 and CD151 to label the MVBs in {beta}-cells. We showed that the {beta}-cells have a significantly higher density of ISGs than MVBs. MVBs and ISGs are spatially localized apart within {beta}-cells. The proteins that localize with MVBs are different from the ones that localize with ISGs. Exocytosis of ISGs occurs at the periphery of the {beta}-cells and takes significantly lesser time when compared to exosome release, which is non-peripheral and takes a longer duration. Further, we also observed a significant reduction in the density of ISGs and MVBs in T2D patients islets compared to healthy controls. Studying the effect of MVBs on insulin secretion in physiological and T2D conditions has huge potential. This study provides a strong basis to open new avenues for such future studies.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat majorly via the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The activation of BAT, which is enriched in the neck area and contains brown and beige adipocytes in humans, was considered as a potential therapeutic target to treat obesity. Therefore, finding novel agents that can stimulate the differentiation and recruitment of brown or beige thermogenic adipocytes are important subjects for investigation. The current study investigated how the availability of extracellular thiamine (vitamin B1), an essential cofactor of mitochondrial enzyme complexes that catalyze key steps in the catabolism of nutrients, affects the expression of thermogenic marker genes and proteins and subsequent functional parameters during ex vivo adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, we differentiated primary human adipogenic progenitors that were cultivated from subcutaneous (SC) or deep neck (DN) adipose tissues in the presence of gradually increasing thiamine concentrations during their 14 day long differentiation program. Higher thiamine levels resulted in increased expression of thiamine transporter 1 and 2 both at mRNA and protein levels in human neck area-derived adipocytes. Gradually increasing concentrations of thiamine led to increased basal, cAMP-stimulated, and proton-leak respiration along with elevated mitochondrial biogenesis of the differentiated adipocytes. The extracellular thiamine availability during adipogenesis determined the expression levels of UCP1, PGC1a, CKMT2, and other browning-related genes and proteins in primary SC and DN-derived adipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Providing abundant amounts of thiamine further increased the thermogenic competency of the adipocytes. Our study raises the possibility of a novel strategy with long-term thiamine supplementation, which can enhance the thermogenic competency of differentiating neck area-derived adipocytes for preventing or combating obesity.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration towards stiff substrates has been coined as durotaxis and implicated in development, wound healing and cancer, where complex interplays between immune and non-immune cells are present. Compared to the emerging mechanisms underlying the strongly adhesive mesenchymal durotaxis, little is known about whether immune cells - migrating in amoeboid mode - could follow mechanical cues. Here we develop an imaging-based confined migration device that provides stiffness gradient for cell migration. By tracking live cell trajectory and analyzing the directionality T cells and neutrophils, we observe that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further delineate the underlying mechanism to involve non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarization towards the soft-matrix-side but may not require differential actin flow up- or down-stiffness gradient. Using the protista Dictyostelium, we further demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of amoeboid durotaxis. Finally, these experimental phenomena are theoretically captured by an active gel model capable of mechanosensing. Collectively, these results may shed new lights on immune surveillance and recently identified confined migration of cancer cells, within the tumor microenvironment or the inflamed fibrotic tissues.",

    "abstract": "In the liver, mitochondria are exposed to different concentrations of nutrients due to their spatial positioning across the periportal (PP) and pericentral (PC) axis. How these mitochondria sense and integrate these signals to respond and maintain homeostasis is not known. Here, we combined intravital microscopy, spatial proteomics, and functional assessment to investigate mitochondrial heterogeneity in the context of liver zonation. We found that PP and PC mitochondria are morphologically and functionally distinct; beta-oxidation and mitophagy were elevated in PP regions, while lipid synthesis was predominant in the PC mitochondria. In addition, comparative phosphoproteomics revealed that mitophagy and lipid synthesis are regulated by phosphorylation in a zonated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that acute pharmacological modulation of nutrient sensing through AMPK and mTOR shifted mitochondrial phenotypes in the PP and PC regions of the intact liver. This study highlights the role of protein phosphorylation in mitochondrial structure, function, and overall homeostasis in hepatic metabolic zonation. The findings have important implications for liver physiology and disease.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536717v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b4fe8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb1463org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@37805eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ccc997_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract Kang et al.\n\nC_FIG",
