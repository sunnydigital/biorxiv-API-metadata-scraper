We previously reported that an uncharacterized protein with four-transmembrane domains, named as Stigmatic Privacy 1 (SPRI1), is responsible for rejecting hetero-specific pollen grains in Arabidopsis thaliana.\nC_LIO_LIWe have conducted a functional study of the SPRI1 protein, via point-mutational experiments and biochemical analysis. We studied the molecular regulatory mechanisms of SPRI1 and the relationships with its function.\nC_LIO_LIThe alanine- and glycine-scanning experiments together with the evolutional analysis showed that the structural integrity of the C-terminal regions of the extracellular domain of this protein is important for its function. In addition, we found two cysteines (C67 and C80) within the extracellular domain that may be involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. SPRI1 may form homo-multimers and is present as part of a ca. 300 kDa complex.\nC_LIO_LIOur present study indicates that molecular complex formation ability of SPRI1 may be important to maintain its stability and interspecific incompatibility functions in cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Soybean is the most cultivated oilseed crop in the world, with much of the merit obtained in recent years due to genetic improvement in which greater genetic progress can be obtained by improving physiological characteristics, which result in a greater impact on yield. Color spectra can be good indicators of the physiological quality of plants by quantifying the intensity of colors in the RGB spectra, being a non-destructive method that allows optimizing the collection and the number of data. We aimed to identify differences in spectral reflection between conventional, transgenic RR1 and RR2 soybean cultivars under the effect of glyphosate herbicide. The plants were cultivated in five-liter pots in a greenhouse in a randomized block design, following cultural treatments recommended for the soybean crop. Leaves of plants in vegetative stages V1 or V2 were collected and duly identified to compose a second experiment, being then submitted to incubation in plastic trays in which the treatments were organized in a completely randomized design in a 6x6 factorial scheme, with three replications. Glyphosate herbicide doses (0.0, 0.03%, 0.06%, 0.12% and 0.24% AE/ha) were added to the leaf petiole on a cotton pad in order to maintain constant contact with the respective dose. The trays were kept under ambient conditions for 14 days after incubation under 16h-light and 8h-dark of artificial light. Images were collected with a smartphone camera on the 13th day after leaves collection (DAC) in an appropriate studio to maintain adequate lighting, and on the 14th DAC SPAD index data were collected in three locations on the leaf, avoiding the midrib. The images were cropped and then segmented using manual thresholding in which the average values for the red, green and blue channels were extracted. The Excess Red Index (ExR) was calculated using the red and green channels data. The data obtained were analyzed and the significant effects of the model were analyzed by the Skott-Knott test for the cultivar factor and regression models were adjusted for the dose factor. Spearmans correlation was used to verify the relationship between the studied variables. In view of our results, glyphosate affects the chlorophyll of resistant plants when subjected to continuous exposure and at high doses, leading to senescence and that the red channel information can be used to infer the level of interference in the photosynthetic activity of plants subjected to the herbicide.",

    "abstract": "- Producing and maintaining flowers is essential for reproduction in most angiosperms, underpinning population persistence and speciation. Although the physiological costs of flowers often oppose pollinator selection, these physiological costs have rarely been quantified.\n- We measured a suite of physiological traits quantifying the water and carbon costs and drought tolerance on flowers and leaves of over 100 phylogenetically diverse species, including water and dry mass contents, minimum epidermal conductance to water vapor (gmin), vein density, and dry mass per area.\n- Although there was substantial variation among species, flowers had significantly higher gmin and water content per unit area than leaves, but significantly lower vein density and dry mass per area than leaves. Both leaves and flowers exhibited similarly strong scaling between dry mass investment and water content.\n- The higher gmin of flowers offset their higher water content, suggesting that flowers may desiccate more rapidly than leaves during drought. The coordination between dry mass and water investment suggests that flowers rely on a hydrostatic skeleton to remain upright rather than on a carbon-based skeleton. For short-lived structures like flowers, water may be relatively cheaper than carbon, particularly given the relatively high amount of water loss per unit of carbon synthesized in photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Butterfly color patterns provide visible and biodiverse phenotypic readouts of the patterning processes that occur in a developing epithelium. While the secreted ligand WntA was shown to instruct the color pattern formation in butterflies, its modes of reception and signal transduction remain elusive. Butterfly genomes encode four homologues of the Frizzled-family of Wnt receptors. Here we show that CRISPR mosaic knock-outs of frizzled2 (fz2) phenocopy the color pattern effects of WntA loss-of-function in multiple nymphalids. While WntA mosaic clones result in intermediate patterns of reduced size, consistently with a morphogen function, fz2 clones are cell-autonomous. Shifts in pupal expression in WntA crispants show that WntA and fz2 are under positive and negative feedback, respectively. Fz1 is required for Wnt-independent planar cell polarity (PCP) in the wing epithelium. Fz3 and Fz4 show phenotypes consistent with Wnt competitive-antagonist functions in vein formation (Fz3 and Fz4), wing margin specification (Fz3), and color patterning in the Discalis and Marginal Band Systems (Fz4). Overall, these data show that the WntA/Frizzled2 morphogen-receptor pair forms a signaling axis that instructs butterfly color patterning, and shed light on the functional diversity of insect Frizzled receptors.",

    "abstract": "As the climate changes, plants and their associated microbiomes face greater water limitation and increased frequency of drought. Historical precipitation patterns can leave a legacy effect on soil and root-associated microbiomes, but the impact of this conditioning on future drought performance is poorly understood. Moreover, agricultural practices, like irrigation, tillage, and fertilization, may disrupt precipitation legacies in natural systems. Precipitation gradients provide a means to assess these legacy effects. We collected soil microbiomes across a Kansas precipitation gradient from two agricultural fields and four native prairies. Seedlings of two Zea mays genotypes were inoculated with each soil microbiome in a factorial drought experiment. Drought caused plants to accumulate shoot mass more slowly and achieve greater root/shoot mass ratios. Drought restructured the bacterial root-associated microbiome, via depletion of Pseudomonadota and enrichment of Actinomycetota, whereas the fungal microbiome was largely unaffected. A historical precipitation legacy effect on prairie soil microbiomes interacted with plants during drought treatment. Prairie soil inocula from historically wetter locations increased shoot biomass under drought more than historically drier prairie soils. Agriculturally derived soil microbiomes tended to reduce biomass accumulation rates, with genotype-specific impacts. We demonstrate links between soil microbiome legacy effects and plant performance under drought, suggesting that future drying climates may condition soils to negatively impact plant performance.",

    "abstract": "The growth of the skeleton depends on the transmission of contractile muscle forces from tendon to bone across the extracellular matrix-rich enthesis. Loss of muscle loading leads to significant impairments in enthesis development. However, little is known about how the enthesis responds to increased loading during postnatal growth. To study the cellular and matrix adaptations of the enthesis in response to increased muscle loading, we used optogenetics to induce skeletal muscle contraction and unilaterally load the Achilles tendon and enthesis in young (i.e., during growth) and adult (i.e., mature) mice. In young mice, daily bouts of unilateral optogenetic loading led to expansion of the calcaneal apophysis and growth plate, as well as increased vascularization of the normally avascular enthesis. Daily loading bouts, delivered for 3 weeks, also led to a mechanically weaker enthesis with increased molecular-level accumulation of collagen damage in young mice. However, adult mice did not exhibit impaired mechanical properties or noticeable structural adaptations to the enthesis. We then focused on the transcriptional response of the young tendon and bone following optogenetic-induced loading. After 1 or 2 weeks of loading, we identified, in tendon, transcriptional activation of canonical pathways related to glucose metabolism (glycolysis) and inhibited pathways associated with cytoskeletal remodeling (e.g., RHOA and CREB signaling). In bone, we identified activation of inflammatory signaling (e.g., NFkB and STAT3 signaling) and inhibition of ERK/MAPK and PTEN signaling. Thus, we have demonstrated the utility of optogenetic-induced skeletal muscle contraction to elicit structural, functional, and molecular adaptation of the enthesis in vivo especially during growth.",

We found that isoLG-adducts are presented within the context of major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I) by an immunoproteasome dependent mechanism.\n\nPharmacologic inhibition of LMP7, the chymotrypsin subunit of the immunoproteasome, attenuates hypertension and tissue inflammation in the angiotensin II (Ang II) model of hypertension. Genetic loss of function of all immunoproteasome subunits or conditional deletion of LMP7 in dendritic cell (DCs) or endothelial cells (ECs) attenuated hypertension, reduced aortic T cell infiltration, and reduced isoLG-adduct MHC-I interaction. Furthermore, isoLG adducts structurally resemble double-stranded DNA and contribute to the activation of STING in ECs. These studies define a critical role of the immunoproteasome in the processing and presentation of isoLG-adducts. Moreover they define a role of LMP7 as a regulator of T cell activation and tissue infiltration in hypertension.",

    "abstract": "In order to recover from infection, organisms must balance robust immune responses to pathogens with the tolerance of immune-mediated pathology. This balance is particularly critical within the central nervous system, whose complex architecture, essential function, and limited capacity for self-renewal render it susceptible to both pathogen-and immune-mediated pathology. Here, we identify the alarmin IL-33 and its receptor ST2 as critical for host survival to neuroinvasive flavivirus infection. We identify oligodendrocytes as the critical source of IL-33, and microglia as the key cellular responders. Notably, we find that the IL-33/ST2 axis does not impact viral control or adaptive immune responses; rather, it is required to promote the activation and survival of microglia. In the absence of intact IL-33/ST2 signaling in the brain, neuroinvasive flavivirus infection triggered aberrant recruitment of monocyte-derived peripheral immune cells, increased neuronal stress, and neuronal cell death, effects that compromised organismal survival.

    "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) display peptides largely from intracellular proteins on the surface of cells in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes. These complexes provide a biological window into the cell, and peptides derived from disease-associated antigens can serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Thus, proper identification of peptides and the corresponding presenting HLA allele in disease phenotypes is important for the design and execution of therapeutic strategies using engineered T-cell receptors or antibodies. Yet, current mass spectrometry methods for profiling the immunopeptidome typically require large and complex sample inputs, complicating the study of several disease phenotypes and lowering the confidence of both peptide and allele identification. Here, we describe a novel secreted HLA (sHLA) Fc-fusion construct that allows for simple peptide identification from single HLA alleles in two important disease models: hypoxic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cellular senescence. We identify hypoxia and senescence-associated peptides that could act as future targets for immunotherapy. More generally, the method streamlines the time between sample preparation and injection from days to hours, yielding allele-restricted target identification in a temporally controlled manner. Overall, this method identified >30,000 unique HLA-associated peptides across two different HLA alleles and seven cell lines. Notably, [~]9,300 of these unique HLA-associated peptides had previously not been identified in the Immune Epitope Database. We believe the sHLA Fc-fusion capture technology will accelerate the study of the immunopeptidome as therapeutic interest in HLA-peptide complexes increases in cancer and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock enables anticipation of the day/night cycle in animals ranging from cnidarians to mammals. Circadian rhythms are generated through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) involving negative and positive factors. CLOCK is a central conserved positive factor in the animal kingdom. However, the functional evolutionary origin and mechanism of action of CLOCK in basal animals are unknown. In cnidarians, the transcription of putative core clock genes, including Clock, is arrhythmic under constant conditions, and it is unclear how the TTFL model can regulate physiological rhythms. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate a Clock mutant (Clock-/-) in Nematostella vectensis. High-throughput video tracking of locomotor activity in Clock-/- adults revealed that light regulates rhythmic behavior, while CLOCK maintains a 24-hour circadian rhythm under constant light conditions, and even under a 6-hour cycle, reminiscent of the tidal rhythm. Transcriptome profiling identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes in Clock-/- adults, particularly genes involved in cell cycle and neural development. In accordance with the rhythmic behavioral profile, computational analysis revealed rhythmic and arrhythmic gene expression in wild-type and Clock-/- adults, respectively, under constant dark conditions. Notably, hierarchal light-and Clock-signaling is required to drive rhythmic transcription of the core clock genes. These findings demonstrate that CLOCK has evolved in cnidarians to maintain synchronized 24-hour rhythmic physiology and behavior despite the chaotic inputs of environmental cues.",

    "abstract": "Accurately inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is a critical and challenging task in biology. GRNs model the activatory and inhibitory interactions between genes and are inherently causal in nature. To accurately identify GRNs, perturbational data is required. However, most GRN discovery methods only operate on observational data. Recent advances in neural network-based causal discovery methods have significantly improved causal discovery, including handling interventional data, improvements in performance and scalability. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) causal discovery methods in biology poses challenges, such as noisy data and a large number of samples. Thus, adapting the causal discovery methods is necessary to handle these challenges. In this paper, we introduce DiscoGen, a neural network-based GRN discovery method that can denoise gene expression measurements and handle interventional data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA neural network-based causal discovery methods.",

    "abstract": "The thymus, a key organ involved in the adaptive immune system, is damaged by a variety of insults including cytotoxic preconditioning. This damage can lead to atrophy and potentially to changes in the hemodynamics of the thymic blood vascular system. Although the thymus has an innate ability to regenerate, the production of T cells relies on the trafficking of lymphoid progenitors from the bone marrow through the altered thymic blood vascular system. Our understanding of thymic blood vascular hemodynamics is limited due to technical challenges associated with accessing the native thymus in live mice. To overcome this challenge, we developed an intravital two-photon imaging method to visualize the native thymus in vivo and investigated functional changes to the vascular system following sublethal irradiation. We were able to quantify blood flow velocity and shear rate in cortical blood vessels and identified a subtle but significant increase in vessel diameter and barrier function ~24 hrs post-sublethal irradiation. Ex vivo whole organ imaging of optically cleared thymus lobes confirmed a disruption of the thymus vascular structure, resulting in an increase in blood vessel diameter and vessel area, and concurrent thymic shrinkage. This novel two-photon intravital imaging method enables a new paradigm for directly investigating the thymic microenvironment in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable high throughput gene expression characterization within thin tissue sections. However, comparing spatial observations across sections, samples, and technologies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we developed STalign to align ST datasets in a manner that accounts for partially matched tissue sections and other local non-linear distortions using diffeomorphic metric mapping. We apply STalign to align ST datasets within and across technologies as well as to align ST datasets to a 3D common coordinate framework. We show that STalign achieves high gene expression and cell-type correspondence across matched spatial locations that is significantly improved over landmark-based affine alignments. Applying STalign to align ST datasets of the mouse brain to the 3D common coordinate framework from the Allen Brain Atlas, we highlight how STalign can be used to lift over brain region annotations and enable the interrogation of compositional heterogeneity across anatomical structures. STalign is available as an open-source Python toolkit at https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/STalign and as supplementary software with additional documentation and tutorials available at https://jef.works/STalign.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins self-assemble to form amyloid fibrils, which are highly organized structures stabilized by a characteristic cross-{beta} network of hydrogen bonds. This process underlies a variety of human diseases, and can be exploited to develop versatile functional biomaterials. Thus, amyloid aggregation has been widely studied, shedding light on the properties of fibrils and their intermediates. A question that remains open concerns the microscopic processes that underlie the long-time behaviour of the fibrillar assemblies. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to observe that the fibrils undergo a maturation process, with an increase in both fibril length and thickness, and a change in the cross-{beta} sheet content. These changes affect the ability of the fibrils to catalyse the formation of new aggregates through secondary nucleation. The identification of these changes helps us understand the fibril maturation processes, facilitate the targeting of amyloid fibrils in drug discovery, and offer insight into the development of biocompatible and sustainable protein based materials.",

    "abstract": "Integrin conformational change is the key to transmitting signals across the cell membrane. The integrin on the cell surface undergoes bending-unbending cycles while sensing and responding to the mechanical environment. Mechanical force triggers the unbending of integrin. However, how an integrin stably extends and how an extended integrin spontaneously bends back are unclear. I performed molecular dynamics simulations on integrin and its subunits to reveal the bending-unbending mechanism of integrin at the atomic level. According to the simulations, the integrin structure works like a human arm. The integrin  subunit serves as the bones, while the {beta} leg serves as the bicep. Thus, the integrin extension results in the stretching of the {beta} leg, and the extended integrin spontaneously bends as a consequence of the contraction of the {beta} leg. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of how the integrin secures in the bent inactivated state and sheds light on the mechanism of how the integrin could achieve the stable extended state.\n\nAuthor summaryAs a mechanosensitive protein, the integrin is a molecular machine, which converts the mechano-signal to others, or in the opposite way. The reversible conformational change of integrin is the key to the mechanosensing function. It is straightforward that the integrin would extend while it senses pulling force. However, how integrin bends back after releasing the force is not clear. The ability to bend back guarantees that the integrin can be reused in the bending-unbending cycles. With molecular dynamics simulations, this study shows the integrin works as a molecular arm in the bending-unbending working cycles, which answers how the integrin spontaneously bends back. Meanwhile, based on this study, several hypothesized mechanisms for integrin to be stably extended are proposed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfter stroke, deficits in paretic single limb stance (SLS) are commonly observed and affect walking performance. During SLS, the hip abductor musculature is critical in providing vertical support and regulating balance. Although disrupted paretic hip abduction torque production has been identified in individuals post-stroke, interpretation of previous results is limited due to the discrepancies in weight-bearing conditions.\n\nObjectiveTo investigate whether deficits in hip abduction torque production, vertical body support, and balance regulation remain during SLS when controlling for weight-bearing using a perturbation-based assessment, and whether these measures are associated with gait performance.\n\nMethodsWe compared hip abduction torque, vertical stiffness, and frontal plane angular impulse between individuals post-stroke and healthy controls when SLS was induced by removing the support surface underneath one limb. We also tested for correlations between vertical stiffness and angular impulse during perturbation-induced SLS and gait parameters during overground walking.\n\nResultsDuring the perturbation-induced SLS, lower hip abduction torque, less vertical stiffness, and increased frontal plane angular impulse were observed at the paretic limb compared to the non-paretic limb, while no differences were found between the paretic limb and healthy controls. Vertical stiffness during perturbation-induced SLS was positively correlated with single support duration during gait at the paretic limb and predicted self-selected and fast walking speeds in individuals post-stroke.\n\nConclusionsReduced paretic hip abduction torque during SLS likely affects vertical support and balance control. Enhancing SLS hip abduction torque production could be an important rehabilitation target to improve walking function for individuals post-stroke.",

Antioxidants are essential determinants of seed quality, longevity, and persistence. Understanding the environmental factors that regulate the accumulation, content, and function of antioxidant pools in sea oat seeds is critical for gene banking and understanding the environmental impacts on seed quality.\n\nMethodsGermination, viability, and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) were analyzed on seeds from 18 sea oat populations from the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. We first assessed baseline TEAC, followed by TEAC performed on imbibed seeds for 36 hours at 35/25 {degrees}C during the day and night, respectively. Then, we analyzed the relationship of the antioxidant pools from these 18 sea oat populations to sampling site environmental classifications.\n\nKey ResultsHigher baseline antioxidants were common in regions with extreme environmental conditions corresponding to sea oat populations growing at latitudinal extremes characterized by warmer and colder temperatures. Baseline antioxidants did not correlate with prevailing seed germination. However, higher concentrations of antioxidants following imbibition were associated with poor seed germination in warmer conditions.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that climatic conditions and environmental components associated with temperatures and precipitation may largely influence the innate pool of antioxidants in sea oat seeds. Also, a high amount of antioxidants following sea oat seeds imbibition suggest seed damage or poor viability influenced by environmental stress conditions during seed development.",

However, weight regain and relapse of hyperglycemia are not uncommon. Here, we investigated the role of somatostatin (Sst) in bariatric surgery outcomes using a mouse model of sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Sst knockout (sst-ko) mice fed with a calorie-rich diet gained weight normally, and had a mild favorable metabolic phenotype compared to heterozygous sibling controls, including elevated plasma levels of Glp1. Mathematical modeling of the feedback inhibition between Sst and Glp1 showed that Sst exerts its maximal effect on Glp1 under conditions of high hormonal stimulation, such as following SG. Obese sst-ko mice that underwent SG had higher levels of Glp1 compared with heterozygous SG-operated controls. Accordingly, SG-sst-ko mice regained less weight than controls and maintained lower glycemia months after surgery. Obese wild-type mice that underwent SG and were treated daily with a Sst receptor inhibitor for two months, had higher Glp1 levels, regained less weight, and improved glycemia compared to saline- treated SG-operated controls. Our results suggest that Sst signaling inhibition enhances and maintains the long-term favorable metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "Pre-clinical models suggest a causative nexus between mitochondrial oxidative stress and insulin resistance. However, the translational and pathophysiological significance of this mechanism in humans remains unclear. Herein, we employed an invasive in vivo mechanistic approach in humans to manipulate mitochondrial redox state while assessing insulin action. To this end, we combined intravenous infusion of a lipid overload with intake of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (mtAO) in conjunction with insulin clamp studies. During lipid overload, insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake, as determined by the femoral arteriovenous balance technique, was increased by mtAO. At the muscle molecular level, mtAO did not affect canonical insulin signaling but augmented insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation while decreasing the mitochondrial oxidative burden under lipid oversupply. Ex vivo studies revealed that mtAO ameliorated features of mitochondrial bioenergetics, including diminished mitochondrial H2O2 emission, in muscle fibers exposed to high intracellular lipid levels. These findings provide translational and mechanistic evidence implicating mitochondrial oxidants in the development of lipid-induced muscle insulin resistance in humans.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/535538v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (86K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@157d44eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13358dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e958eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17cbc6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "1.Intercellular communication is a critical process that ensures cooperation between distinct cell types at the embryo-maternal interface. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered to be potent mediators of this communication by transferring biological information in their cargo (e.g. miRNAs) to the recipient cells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that affect the function and fate of neighboring and distant cells by regulating gene expression. Focusing on the maternal side of the dialog, we recently revealed the impact of embryonic signals, including miRNAs, on EV-mediated cell-to-cell communication. In this study, we show the regulatory mechanism of the miR-125b-5p ESCRT-mediated EV biogenesis pathway and the further secretion of EVs by trophoblasts at the time when the crucial steps of implantation are taking place.\n\nTo test the ability of miR-125b-5p to influence the expression of genes involved in the generation and release of EV subpopulations in porcine conceptuses, we used an ex vivo approach. Next, in silico and in vitro analyses were performed to confirm miRNA-mRNA interactions. Finally, EV trafficking and release were assessed using several imaging and particle analysis tools.\n\nOur results indicated that conceptus development and implantation are accompanied by changes in the abundance of EV biogenesis and trafficking machinery. ESCRT-dependent EV biogenesis and the further secretion of EVs were modulated by miR-125b-5p, specifically impacting the ESCRT-II complex (via VPS36) and EV trafficking in primary porcine trophoblast cells. The identified miRNA-ESCRT interplay led to the generation and secretion of specific subpopulations of EVs.\n\nmiRNA present at the embryo-maternal interface governs EV-mediated communication between the mother and the developing conceptus, leading to the generation, trafficking, and release of characteristic subpopulations of EVs.",

    "abstract": "Mavacamten is a novel, FDA-approved, small molecule therapeutic designed to regulate cardiac function by selectively but reversibly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of myosin. It shifts myosin towards ordered off states close to the thick filament backbone. It remains unresolved whether mavacamten permanently sequesters these myosin heads in the off state(s) or whether these heads can be recruited in response to physiological stimuli when required to boost cardiac output. We show that cardiac myosins stabilized in these off state(s) by mavacamten are recruitable by Ca2+, increased heart rate, stretch, and {beta}-adrenergic ({beta}-AR) stimulation, all known physiological inotropic effectors. At the molecular level, we show that, in presence of mavacamten, Ca2+ increases myosin ATPase activity by shifting myosin heads from the reserve super-relaxed (SRX) state to the active disordered relaxed (DRX) state. At the myofilament level, both Ca2+ and passive lengthening can shift ordered off myosin heads from positions close to the thick filament backbone to disordered on states closer to the thin filaments in the presence of mavacamten. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, increased stimulation rates enhanced shortening fraction in mavacamten-treated cells. This observation was confirmed in vivo in telemetered rats, where left-ventricular dP/dtmax, an index of inotropy, increased with heart rate in mavacamten treated animals. Finally, we show that {beta}-AR stimulation in vivo increases left-ventricular function and stroke volume in the setting of mavacamten. Our data demonstrate that the mavacamten-promoted off states of myosin in the thick filament are activable, at least partially, thus leading to preservation of cardiac reserve mechanisms.\n\nSignificance statementMavacamten is the first myosin-targeted small molecule inhibitor approved by the FDA to treat obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by attenuating myocardial hyperdynamic contraction. The recruitment of cardiac contractility is, however, vital to ensure sufficient cardiac output during increased physiological demand. Here we show that major inotropic effectors are at least partially preserved in the setting of mavacamten, resulting in maintenance of cardiac reserve mechanisms. These results not only suggest an alternative mechanistic explanation, beyond mere LV outflow tract obstruction removal, for the clinically observed increase in peak oxygen uptake with exercise in HCM patients receiving mavacamten, but also lay the groundwork for a potential methodology to investigate the sarcomeric basis of chronotropic incompetence in disease states to motivate new therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Phenomics is the acquisition of high-dimensional data on an individual-wide scale and is proving transformational in areas of biological research related to human health including medicine and the crop sciences. However, more broadly, a lack of available transferrable technologies and research approaches is significantly hindering the uptake of phenomics, in contrast to molecular-omics for which transferrable technologies have been a significant enabler. Aquatic embryos are natural models for phenomics, due to their small size, taxonomic diversity, ecological relevance, and high levels of temporal, spatial and functional change. Here, we present LabEmbryoCam, an autonomous phenotyping platform for timelapse imaging of developing aquatic embryos cultured in a multiwell plate format. The LabEmbryoCam capitalises on 3D printing, single board computers, consumer electronics and stepper motor enabled motion.

    "abstract": "Curative therapies against autoimmune diseases are lacking. Indeed, most of currently available treatments are only targeting symptoms. We have developed a novel strategy for a therapeutic vaccine against autoimmune diseases based on intranasal administration of a fusion protein tolerogen, which consists of a mutant, enzymatically inactive, cholera toxin A1-subunit genetically fused to disease relevant high affinity peptides and a dimer of D-fragments from protein A. The CTA1R7K-MOG/PLP-DD fusion proteins effectively reduced clinical symptoms in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)-model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The treatment induced Tr1 cells, in the draining lymph node, which produced IL-10 and suppressed effector CD4+ T cell responses. This effect was dependent on IL-27 signalling, since treatment was ineffective in bone marrow chimeras lacking IL-27R within their hematopoietic compartment. scRNA-seq of dendritic cells (DC) in draining lymph nodes demonstrated distinct gene transcriptional changes of cDC1, including enhanced lipid metabolic pathways, induced by the tolerogenic fusion protein. Thus, our results with the tolerogenic fusion protein demonstrates the possibility to vaccinate and protect against disease progression by reinstating tolerance in MS and other autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cellular immunotherapies, such as those utilizing T lymphocytes expressing native or engineered T cell receptors (TCRs), have already demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. However, some high-affinity TCRs have also proved to be fatal due to off-target immunotoxicity. This process occurs when the immune system acts against epitopes found on both tumor cells and healthy tissues. Moreover, some TCRs can be cross-reactive to epitopes with highly dissimilar sequences. To address this issue, we developed ARDitox, a novel in silico method based on computational immunology and artificial intelligence (AI) for predicting and analyzing potential off-target binding. We tested the performance of ARDitox in silico on different cases found in the literature where TCRs were used to target cancer-related antigens, as well as on a set of TCRs targeting a viral epitope. ARDitox was able to identify previously reported cross-reactive epitopes in line with the data available in the literature. In addition, we investigated a TCR targeting an HLA-A*02:01-restricted immunodominant epitope from the glioblastoma-associated antigen NLGN4X, identifying a cross-reactive ADH1A epitope that would not be detected in murine models. In conclusion, our in silico approach is a powerful tool that identifies potential off-target epitopes, complementing preclinical studies in developing safer cell therapies targeting tumor(- associated) antigens.",

Recent theoretical work has connected nestedness to the functionality of complex systems and has suggested it is a structural by-product of the skewed degree distributions often seen in empirical data. However, mechanisms for generating nestedness remain poorly understood, limiting the connections that can be made between system processes and observed network structures. Here, we show that a mechanistic model based on phenology -- the timing of co-presences among interaction partners -- can produce highly nested structures and explain a large fraction of interactions in two trade and 22 ecological networks. The simple model assumes actors have no preference for specific interactions and therefore provides an instructive baseline for investigating higher-level selection processes in interaction networks.",

    "abstract": "The masking theory states that genes expressed in haploid stage will be under more efficient selection. In contrast, selection will be less efficient in genes expressed in diploid stage, where the fitness effects of recessive deleterious or beneficial mutations can be hidden from selection in heterozygous form. This difference can influence several evolutionary processes such as maintenance of genetic variation, adaptation rate, and genetic load. Masking theory expectations have been confirmed in single-cell haploid and diploid organisms. However, in multicellular organisms, such as plants, the effects of haploid selection are not clear-cut. In plants, the great majority of studies indicating haploid selection have been carried out using male haploid tissues in angiosperms. Hence, evidence in these systems is confounded with the effects of sexual selection and intra-specific competition. Evidence from other plant groups is scarce and results show no support for the masking theory.\n\nHere we have used a gymnosperm Scots pine megagametophyte, a maternally-derived seed haploid tissue, and four diploid tissues to test the strength of purifying selection on a set of genes with tissue-specific expression. By using targeted resequencing data of those genes, we obtained estimates of genetic diversity, the site frequency spectrum of 0-fold and 4-fold sites, and inferred the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations in haploid and diploid tissue-specific genes. Our results show that purifying selection is stronger for tissue-specific genes expressed in the haploid megagametophyte tissue, and that this signal of strong selection is not an artifact driven by high expression levels",

    "abstract": "Comparative analyses of gene birth-death dynamics (GBDD) have the potential to reveal gene families that played an important role in the evolution of morphological, behavioral, or physiological variation. Here, we used whole genomes of 30 species of butterflies and moths to identify GBDD among the Lepidoptera that are associated with specialist or generalist feeding strategies. Our work advances this field by using a uniform set of annotated proteins for all genomes, investigating associations while correcting for phylogeny, and assessing all gene familes rather than a priori subsets. We discovered that the sizes of several important gene families (e.g., those associated with pesticide resistance, xenobiotic detoxification, and/or protein digestion) are significantly correlated with diet breadth. We also found 12 gene families showing significant shifts in GBDD at the butterfly (Papilionoidea) crown node, the most notable of which was a family of pheromone receptors that underwent a contraction potentially linked with a shift to visual-based mate recognition. Our findings highlight the importance of uniform annotations, phylogenetic corrections and unbiased gene family analyses in generating a list of candidate genes that warrant further exploration.\n\nSignificance StatementGene duplications and gene deaths are important for the development of novel traits, but their study is often complicated by methodological issues, such as input data coming from different sources with different biases. Here, we address many of these issues in an analysis of gene duplication and death across 30 species of moths by using standardized, genome-wide input data. Importantly, our analysis uses a model that can correlate gene family sizes with any quantitative trait, while also accounting for relatedness between species. Using this model, we provide novel evolutionary insights by showing that the sizes of several important gene families are correlated with increases or decreases in the number of host plant orders that Lepidoptera eat.",

We paired iPSC-derived BMECs with recombinant vitamin A serum transport proteins, retinol binding protein (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR), to create an in vitro model for the study of vitamin A (retinol) delivery across the human BBB. iPSC-derived BMECs display a strong barrier phenotype, express key vitamin A metabolism markers and can be used for quantitative modeling of retinol accumulation and permeation. Manipulation of retinol, RBP and TTR concentrations, and the use of mutant RBP and TTR, yielded novel insights into the patterns of retinol accumulation in, and permeation across, the BBB.

    "abstract": "Ophthalmic disease treatment remains a significant problem globally, resulting in poor vision and blindness. UV irradiation and bacterial infection may cause severe damage to the corneal, leading to vision loss within a few days. Corneal neovascular abnormally growth that bock lights reach to eyes, causes low vision. Thus it requires urgent and efficient clinical treatment. Contact lenses play an essential role in treating ophthalmic issues. In this work, we synthesized the chitosan-stabilized Au nanoparticles with a simple method. The Au nanoparticles were further physically adsorbed with negatively charged fluorescent nanodiamonds, yielding Au-CS@FNDs. These Au-CS@FNDs particles were proven with excellent UV adsorption, antibacterial properties, and photothermal conversation ability. Furthermore, we embedded Au-CS@FNDs particles into contact lenses to prevent corneal damage from UV light and bacterial infection. Moreover, the Au-CS@FNDs embedded contact lenses were used to inhibit the neovascularization in the Human Vascular Endothelial Cells via the photodynamic effect of Au nanoparticles. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that gold and diamond nanoparticles were used as additives in contact lenses, aiming at clinically corneal neovascular. Our results suggest that the controllable photothermal effect of Au-CS@FNDs embedded contact lenses may provide a unique way to intervene the neovascular-induced vision loss.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536356v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b94b65org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f598org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198058forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1950cd3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "AbstractPumping of the heart is powered by filaments of the motor protein myosin, which pull on actin filaments to generate cardiac contraction. In addition to myosin, the filaments contain cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), which modulates contractility in response to physiological stimuli, and titin, which functions as a scaffold for filament assembly1. Myosin, cMyBP-C and titin are all subject to mutation, which can lead to heart failure. Despite the central importance of cardiac myosin filaments to life, their molecular structure has remained a mystery for 60 years2. Here, we have solved the structure of the main (cMyBP-C-containing) region of the human cardiac filament to 6 [A] resolution by cryo-EM. The reconstruction reveals the architecture of titin and cMyBP-C for the first time, and shows how myosins motor domains (heads) form 3 different types of motif (providing functional flexibility), which interact with each other and with specific domains of titin and cMyBP-C to dictate filament architecture and regulate function. A novel packing of myosin tails in the filament backbone is also resolved. The structure suggests how cMyBP-C helps generate the cardiac super-relaxed state3, how titin and cMyBP-C may contribute to length-dependent activation4, and how mutations in myosin and cMyBP-C might disrupt interactions, causing disease5, 6. A similar structure is likely in vertebrate skeletal myosin filaments. The reconstruction resolves past uncertainties, and integrates previous data on cardiac muscle structure and function. It provides a new paradigm for interpreting structural, physiological and clinical observations, and for the design of potential therapeutic drugs.",

    "abstract": "The refractory period of cardiac tissue can be quantitatively described using strength-interval (SI) curves. The information captured in SI curves is pertinent to the design of anti-arrhythmic devices including pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. As computational cardiac modelling becomes more prevalent, it is feasible to consider the generation of computationally derived SI curves as a supplement or precursor to curves that are experimentally derived. It is beneficial, therefore, to examine the profiles of the SI curves produced by different cardiac tissue models to determine whether some models capture the refractory period more accurately than others. In this study, we compare the unipolar SI curves of two tissue models: the current state-of-the-art bidomain model and the recently developed extracellular-membrane-intracellular (EMI) model. The EMI models resolution of individual cell structure makes it a more detailed model than the bidomain model, which forgoes the structure of individual cardiac cells in favour of treating them homogeneously as a continuum. We find that the resulting SI curves elucidate differences between the models, including that the behaviour of the EMI model is noticeably closer to the refractory behaviour of experimental data compared to that of the bidomain model. These results hold implications for future computational pacemaker simulations and shed light on the predicted refractory properties of cardiac tissue from each model.\n\nAuthor summaryMathematical modelling and computational simulation of cardiac activity have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of heart function and improve the precision of cardiac medicine. The current state-of-the-art model is the bidomain model, which considers a volume average of cardiac activity. Although the bidomain model has had success in several applications, in other situations, its approach may obscure critical details of heart function. The extracellular-membrane-intracellular (EMI) model is a recently developed model of cardiac tissue that addresses this limitation. It models cardiac cells individually; therefore, it offers significantly greater physiological accuracy than bidomain simulations. This increase in accuracy comes at a higher computational cost, however. To explore the benefits of one model over the other, here we compare the performance of the bidomain and EMI models in a pacing study of cardiac tissue often employed in pacemaker design. We find that the behaviour of the EMI model is noticeably closer to experimental data than the behaviour of the bidomain model.\n\nThese results hold implications for future pacemaker design and improve our understanding of the two models in relation to one another.",

Here we report the longitudinal single-cell transcriptome profiling of blood mononuclear cells in patients undergoing kidney transplantation rejection. We identify a gene expression module which is associated to transcriptional regulation, homing and early activation in multiple cell types. The circulating cells expressing this module are reduced in patients undergoing graft rejection. This reduction was confirmed in a pig model of acute kidney transplantation rejection. In connection with this, the module expression drastically increased in the kidney grafts undergoing rejection indicating a preferential recruitment of cells highly expressing this module. We identify the receptor CXCR4 within the module and its ligand CXCL12 expressed in the graft as a likely recruitment mechanism between circulating cells and the tissue. We then explore publicly available transcriptomics data in circulating cells and show that this module is generally expressed in healthy individuals and more importantly is associated with the response to infection, including SARS Covid-19. Moreover, we find that module expression is predictive of immune mediated diseases.

First, we report on exclusive satellite cell production in intraspecies mouse chimeras by injection of CRISPR/Cas9-corrected DMD-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into blastocysts carrying an ablation system of host Pax7+ satellite cells. Additionally, injection of genetically-corrected DMD-iPSCs into rat blastocysts produced interspecies rat-mouse chimeras harboring mouse muscle stem cells that efficiently restored dystrophin expression in DMD mice. This study thus provides a proof-of-principle for the generation of therapeutically-competent stem cells between divergent species, raising the possibility of procuring human stem cells in large animals for regenerative medicine purposes.",

In Trypanosoma brucei, TbArl13 acts as a GEF for two distinct TbArl3 proteins, TbArl3A and TbArl3C.

    "abstract": "Replication gaps can arise as a consequence of perturbed DNA replication and their accumulation might undermine the stability of the genome. Loss of RAD52, a protein involved in the regulation of fork reversal, promotes accumulation of parental ssDNA gaps during replication perturbation. Here, we demonstrate that this is due to the engagement of Pol downstream of the extensive degradation of perturbed replication forks after their reversal, and is not dependent on PrimPol. Pol is hyper-recruited at parental ssDNA in the absence of RAD52, and this recruitment is dependent on fork reversal enzymes and RAD51. Of note, we report that the interaction between Pol and RAD51 is stimulated by RAD52 inhibition, and Pol-dependent gap accumulation requires nucleation of RAD51 suggesting that it occurs downstream strand invasion. Altogether, our data indicate that RAD51-Pol-dependent repriming is essential to promote fork restart and limit DNA damage accumulation when RAD52 function is disabled.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPrimary air liquid interface (ALI) cultures of bronchial epithelial cells are used extensively to model airway responses. A recent advance is the development of conditional reprogramming that enhances proliferative capability. Several different media and protocols are utilized, yet even subtle differences may influence cellular responses. We compared the morphology and functional responses, including innate immune responses to rhinovirus infection in conditionally reprogrammed primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) differentiated using two commonly used culture media.\n\nMethodspBECs from healthy participants (n = 5) were CR using {gamma}-irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts and Rho Kinase inhibitor. CRpBECs were differentiated at ALI in either PneumaCult (PN-ALI) or Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (BEGM)-based differentiation media (BEBM:DMEM, 50:50, Lonza) - (AB-ALI) for 28 days. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), immunofluorescence, histology, cilia activity, ion channel function, and expression of cell markers were analyzed. Viral load was assessed by RT-qPCR and anti-viral factors quantified by Legendplex following Rhinovirus-A1b (RVA1b) infection.\n\nResultsCRpBECs differentiated in PneumaCult were smaller and had a lower TEER and cilia beat frequency (CBF) compared to BEGM media. PneumaCult media cultures exhibited significantly increased FOXJ1 expression, more ciliated cells with a larger active area, increased intracellular mucins, and increased calcium-activated chloride channel current. However, there were no significant changes in viral RNA or host antiviral responses.\n\nConclusionThere are distinct structural and functional differences in CRpBECs cultured in the two commonly used ALI differentiation media. Such factors need to be taken into consideration when designing and comparing CRpBECs ALI experiments.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that signals through 5-HT receptors to control key functions in the nervous system. Serotonin receptors are also ubiquitously expressed in various organs and have been detected in embryos of different organisms. Potential morphogenetic functions of serotonin signaling have been proposed based on pharmacological studies but a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we uncover a role of serotonin signaling in axis extension of Drosophila embryos by regulating MyosinII (MyoII) activation, cell contractility and cell intercalation. We find that serotonin and serotonin receptors 5HT2A and 5HT2B form a signaling module that quantitatively regulates the amplitude of planar polarized MyoII contractility specified by Toll receptors and the GPCR Cirl. Remarkably, serotonin signaling also regulates actomyosin contractility at cell junctions, cellular flows and epiblast morphogenesis during chicken gastrulation. This phylogenetically conserved mechanical function of serotonin signaling in regulating actomyosin contractility and tissue flow reveals an ancestral role in morphogenesis of multicellular organisms.",

Vector control is the main option to prevent mosquito-borne diseases, and an accurate genome sequence of these mosquitoes is essential to better understand their biology and to develop effective control strategies. Here, we present a de novo genome assembly of the Ae. japonicus (Ajap1) and Ae. koreicus (Akor1) based on a hybrid approach that combines Oxford Nanopore long reads and Illumina short reads data. Their quality was ascertained using various metrics. Masking of repetitive elements, gene prediction and functional annotation was performed. Sequence analysis revealed a very high presence of repetitive DNA and, among others, thermal adaptation genes and insecticide-resistance genes. The RNA sequencing analysis of larvae and adults of Ae. koreicus and Ae. japonicus exposed to different temperatures revealed genes showing a thermal-dependent activation. The assembly of Akor1 and Ajap1 genomes constitutes the first updated collective knowledge of the genomes of both mosquito species, providing the possibility to understand key mechanisms of their biology such as the ability to adapt to harsh climates and to develop insecticide-resistance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes significant changes during prostate cancer (PCa) progression and actively regulates PCa growth and invasion. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of PCa cohorts and found that downregulation or loss of ITGA1 and ITGA2 integrin genes was associated with tumor progression to metastasis and poor prognosis in PCa patients. Genomic deletion of both 1- and 2-integrins activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in benign prostate epithelial cells, thereby enhancing their invasive potential in vitro and converting them into tumorigenic cells in vivo. Mechanistically, EMT was induced by enhanced secretion and subsequent activation of autocrine TGF{beta}1 and nuclear targeting of YAP1. Our unbiased genome-wide co-expression analysis of large PCa cohort datasets identified the transcription factor TEAD1 as a key regulator of ITGA1 and ITGA2 expression in PCa cells while TEAD1 loss phenocopied the dual loss of 2- and 2-integrins in vitro and in vivo. Notably, clinical data analysis revealed that TEAD1 downregulation or loss was associated with aggressive PCa and could synergize with ITGA1 and ITGA2 expression to impact PCa prognosis and progression. Altogether, our results demonstrate that loss of 1- and 2-integrins, either via deletion/inactivation of the ITGA1/ITGA2 locus or via loss of TEAD1, contributes to PCa progression by inducing TGF{beta}1-driven EMT.",

However, the ability to stratify patients who will benefit from such treatment modalities based on shared etiology is critical for the success of disease-modifying therapies. Ciliary and centrosomal alterations are commonly associated with pathogenic LRRK2 kinase activity and can be detected in many cell types. We previously found centrosomal deficits in immortalized lymphocytes from G2019S-LRRK2 PD patients. Here, to investigate whether such deficits may serve as a potential blood biomarker for PD which is susceptible to LRKK2 inhibitor treatment, we characterized patient-derived cells from distinct PD cohorts. We report centrosomal alterations in peripheral cells from a subset of early-stage idiopathic PD patients which is mitigated by LRRK2 kinase inhibition, supporting a role for aberrant LRRK2 activity in idiopathic PD. Centrosomal defects are detected in R1441G-LRRK2 and G2019S-LRRK2 PD patients and in non-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers, indicating that they acumulate prior to a clinical PD diagnosis. They are present in immortalized cells as well as in primary lymphocytes from peripheral blood. These findings indicate that analysis of centrosomal defects as a blood-based patient stratification biomarker may help nominate PD patients who will benefit from LRRK2-related therapeutics.\n\nOne-sentence summaryPeripheral blood-derived cells can be employed to stratify Parkinsos disease patients most likely to respond to LRRK2-related therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The photoreceptor outer segment is a highly specialized primary cilium essential for phototransduction and vision. Biallelic pathogenic variants in the cilia-associated gene CEP290 cause non-syndromic Leber congenital amaurosis 10 (LCA10) and syndromic diseases, where the retina is also affected. While RNA antisense oligonucleotides and gene editing are potential treatment options for the common deep intronic variant c.2991+1655A>G in CEP290, there is a need for variant-independent approaches that could be applied to a broader spectrum of ciliopathies. Here, we generated several distinct human models of CEP290-related retinal disease and investigated the effects of the flavonoid eupatilin as a potential treatment. Eupatilin improved cilium formation and length in CEP290 LCA10 patient-derived fibroblasts, in gene-edited CEP290 knockout (CEP290 KO) RPE1 cells, and in both CEP290 LCA10 and CEP290 KO iPSCs-derived retinal organoids. Furthermore, eupatilin reduced rhodopsin retention in the outer nuclear layer of CEP290 LCA10 retinal organoids. Eupatilin altered gene transcription in retinal organoids, by modulating the expression of rhodopsin, and by targeting cilia and synaptic plasticity pathways. This work sheds light into the mechanism of action of eupatilin, and supports its potential as a variant-independent approach for CEP290-associated ciliopathies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536565v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c2d45borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103c8b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e025eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d8be7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Light triggers numerous non-image forming (NIF), or non-visual, biological effects. The brain correlates of these NIF effects have been investigated, notably using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and short light exposures varying in irradiance and spectral quality. However, it is not clear whether having light in subsequent blocks may induce carry over effects of one light block onto the next, thus biasing the study. We reasoned that pupil light reflex (PLR) was an easy readout of one of the NIF effects of light that could be used to address this issue. We characterized the sustained PLR in 13 to 16 healthy young individuals under short light exposures during three distinct cognitive processes (executive, emotional and attentional). Light conditions pseudo-randomly alternated between monochromatic orange light [0.16 melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance (mel EDI) lux] and polychromatic blue-enriched white light of three different levels [37, 92, 190 mel EDI lux]. As expected, higher melanopic irradiance was associated with larger sustained PLR in each cognitive domain. This result was stable over the light block sequence under higher melanopic irradiance levels as compared to lower ones. Exploratory frequency-domain analyses further revealed that PLR was more variable within a light block under lower melanopic irradiance levels. Importantly, PLR varied across tasks independently of the light condition pointing to a potential impact of the light history and/or cognitive context on PLR. Together, our results emphasize that the distinct contribution and adaptation of the different retinal photoreceptors influence the NIF effects of light and therefore potentially their brain correlates.",

Here, we employed pathological, behavioral, expansion microscopy, electrophysiology and transcriptomic approaches to evaluate the effects of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau on neuropathological progression, synaptic function, and memory and emotional symptoms in amyloid precursor protein (APP), Tau and double novel APP/Tau transgenic mice expressing the mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPSw,Ind) and/or microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) in excitatory neurons. APP/Tau mice of both sexes show spatial learning and memory deficits associated with synaptic tau accumulation and reduced synaptic proteins and neurotransmission in the hippocampus. By contrast, male and female APP/Tau mice exhibit innate anxious behavior and impaired fear memory extinction linked to A{beta} pathology and with absence of synaptic tau in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Intriguingly, APP/Tau mice show NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits in the hippocampus but not in the amygdala. Bulk RNA sequencing reveals region-specific but also common transcriptional changes in response to A{beta}/tau pathology, including downregulation of synapse transmission and ion channel activity genes. Importantly, we detected 65 orthologs of human AD risk genes identified in GWAS (e.g., APOE, BIN1, CD33, CLU, PICALM, PLCG2, PTK2B, TREM2, SORL1, USP6NL) differentially expressed in the hippocampus and/or BLA of APP/Tau mice, indicating that this APP/Tau model exhibits transcriptional alterations linked to known molecular determinants of AD development. In conclusion, simultaneous development of A{beta} and tau neuropathologies in this double APP/Tau transgenic mouse model reproduces synaptic, behavioral, and molecular alterations associated with AD pathophysiology in a region-specific manner. Our findings highlight region-specific pathological effects of A{beta} and tau in excitatory neuronal circuits mediating emotional and memory processing, providing evidence that both factors and their molecular cascades should be considered in future AD preventive and therapeutic strategies.\n\nGraphical abstractAge-dependent vulnerability of memory and emotional neural circuits in response to tau and A{beta} pathologies.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536603v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@efbe90org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c7f1dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7764borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9738ec_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of spinal networks below a spinal cord injury (SCI) is a promising approach to restore functions compromised by inadequate excitatory neural drive. The most translationally successful examples are paradigms intended to increase neural transmission in weakened yet spared motor pathways and spinal motor networks rendered dormant after being severed from their inputs by lesion. Less well understood is whether spinal stimulation is also capable of reducing neural transmission in pathways made pathologically overactive by SCI. Debilitating spasms, spasticity, and neuropathic pain are all common manifestations of hyperexcitable spinal responses to sensory feedback. But whereas spasms and spasticity can often be managed pharmacologically, SCI-related neuropathic pain is notoriously medically refractory. Interestingly, however, spinal stimulation is a clinically available option for ameliorating neuropathic pain arising from etiologies other than SCI, and it has traditionally been assumed to modulate sensorimotor networks overlapping with those engaged by spinal stimulation for motor rehabilitation. Thus, we reasoned that spinal stimulation intended to increase transmission in motor pathways may simultaneously reduce transmission in spinal pain pathways. Using a well-validated pre-clinical model of SCI that results in severe bilateral motor impairments and SCI-related neuropathic pain, we show that the responsiveness of neurons integral to the development and persistence of the neuropathic pain state can be enduringly reduced by motor-targeted spinal stimulation while preserving spinal responses to non-pain-related sensory feedback. These results suggest that spinal stimulation paradigms could be intentionally designed to afford multi-modal therapeutic benefits, directly addressing the diverse, intersectional rehabilitation goals of people living with SCI.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in neuroscience for how individual-specific structural and functional features of the cortex relate to cognitive traits. This work builds on previous research which, using classical high-dimensional approaches, has proven that the interindividual variability of functional connectivity profiles reflects differences in fluid intelligence. To provide an additional perspective into this relationship, the present study uses a recent framework for investigating cortical organization: functional gradients. This approach places local connectivity profiles within a common low-dimensional space whose axes are functionally interretable dimensions. Specifically, this study uses a data-driven approach focussing on areas where FC variability is highest across individuals to model different facets of intelligence. For one of these loci, in the right ventral-lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), we describe an association between fluid intelligence and relative functional distance from sensory and high-cognition systems. Furthermore, the topological properties of this region indicate that with decreasing functional affinity with the latter, its functional connections are more evenly distributed across all networks. Participating in multiple functional networks may reflect a better ability to coordinate sensory and high-order cognitive systems.\n\nSignificant StatementThe human brain is highly variable. In particular, the way brain regions communicate to one another - that is, how they are functionally connected - constitutes a neural fingerprint of the individual. In this study, we make use of a recent methodological approach to characterize the connectivity patterns of transmodal (closely linked to abstract processing) and unimodal (closely linked to sensory processing) brain regions in an attempt to explain how this balance affects intelligence. We show that the more the functional profile of executive control regions is distant to that of abstract processing, the better they are at integrating information coming from widespread neural systems, ultimately leading to better cognitive performance.",

Here, we capitalized on the high spatiotemporal precision of intracranial EEG to localize such abstract decision signals. Presurgical epilepsy patients judged the direction of random-dot stimuli and responded either with a speeded button press (N=23), or vocally, after a randomized delay (N=11). We found a widely distributed motor-independent network of regions where high-frequency activity exhibited key characteristics consistent with evidence accumulation, including a gradual build-up that was modulated by the strength of the sensory evidence, and an amplitude that predicted subjects choice accuracy and response time.

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption continues to cause a significant health burden globally. The advent of genome-wide association studies has unraveled many genetic loci associated with alcohol consumption. However, the biological effect of these loci and the pathways involved in alcohol consumption and its health consequences such as alcohol liver disease (ALD) remain to be elucidated. We combined human studies with model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol consumption and the health outcomes caused by alcohol intake. Using genetics and metabolite data within the Airwave study, a sample of police forces in the UK, we performed several analyses to identify changes in circulating metabolites that are triggered by alcohol consumption. We selected a set of genes annotated to genetic variants that are (1) known to be implicated in alcohol consumption, (2) are linked to liver function, and (3) are associated with expression (cis-eQTL) of their annotated genes. We used mutations and/or RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of these genes in C. elegans and Drosophila. We examined the effect of this suppression on ethanol consumption and on the sedative effects of ethanol. We also investigated the alcohol-induced changes in triacylglycerol (TGA) levels in Drosophila and tested differences in locomotion of C. elegans after acute exposure to ethanol. In human population, we found an enrichment of the alcohol-associated metabolites within the linoleic acid (LNA) and alpha linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism pathway. We further showed the effect of ACTR1B and MAPT on locomotion in C. elegans after exposure to ethanol. We demonstrated that three genes namely WDPCP, TENM2 and GPN1 modify TAG levels in Drosophila. Finally, we showed that gene expression of WDPCP in human population is linked to liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Our results underline the impact of alcohol consumption on metabolism of lipids and pinpoints WDPCP as a gene with potential impact on fat accumulation upon exposure to ethanol suggesting a possible pathway to ALD.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the neurobiological processes that govern learning and memory can be different in males and females, and here we asked specifically whether the endocannabinoid (eCB) system could modulate Pavlovian fear conditioning in a sex-dependent manner. Systemic (i.p.) injection of CB1R antagonist AM251 in adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats prior to auditory cued fear conditioning produced a female-specific increase in freezing that persisted across extinction and extinction retrieval tests but was prevented by co-administration of TRPV1R antagonist Capsazepine. Notably, AM251 also produced robust freezing in a novel context prior to auditory cue presentation the day following drug administration, but not the day of, suggesting that CB1R blockade elicited contextual fear generalization in females. To identify a potential synaptic mechanism for these sex differences, we next used liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, Western Blot, and confocal-assisted immunofluorescence techniques to quantify anandamide (AEA), TRPV1R, and perisomatic CB1R expression, respectively, focusing on the ventral hippocampus (vHip). Fear conditioning elicited increased vHip AEA levels in females only, and in both sexes, CB1R expression around vHip efferents targeting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was twice that at neighboring vHip neurons. Finally, quantification of the vHip-BLA projections themselves revealed that females have over twice the number of neurons in this pathway that males do. Together, our data support a model in which sexual dimorphism in vHip-BLA circuitry promotes a female-specific dependence on CB1Rs for context processing that is sensitive to TRPV1-mediated disruption when CB1Rs are blocked.",

    "abstract": "Iridescent objects and animals are quite mesmerizing to look at, since they feature multiple intense colors whose distribution can vary quite dramatically as a function of viewing angle. These properties make them a particularly interesting and unique stimulus to experimentally investigate the factors that contribute to single color impressions of multi-colored objects. Our stimuli were 3D printed shapes of varying complexity that were covered with three different types of iridescent coatings. For each shape-color combination, participants performed single- and multi-color matches for different views of the stationary object, as well as single color matches for a corresponding rotating stimulus. In the multi-color matching task, participants subsequently rated the size of the surface area on the object that was covered by the match-identified color. Results show that single-color appearance of iridescent objects varied with shape complexity, view, and object motion. Moreover, hue similarity of color settings in the multi color match task best predicted single color appearance, however this predictor was weaker for predicting single color matches in the motion condition. Taken together our findings suggest that the single color appearance of iridescent objects may be modulated by chromatic factors, spatial-relations and the characteristic dynamics of color changes that are typical for this type of material.",

    "abstract": "While huge strides have recently been made in language-based machine learning, the ability of artificial systems to comprehend the sequences that comprise animal behavior has been lagging behind. In contrast, humans instinctively recognize behaviors by finding similarities in behavioral sequences. Here, we develop an unsupervised behavior-mapping framework, SUBTLE (spectrogram-UMAP-based temporal-link embedding), to capture comparable behavioral repertoires from 3D action skeletons. To find the best embedding method, we devise a temporal proximity index as a metric to gauge temporal representation in the behavioral embedding space. The method achieves the best performance compared to current embedding strategies. Its spectrogram-based UMAP clustering not only identifies subtle inter-group differences but also matches human-annotated labels. SUBTLE framework automates the tasks of both identifying behavioral repertoires like walking, grooming, standing, and rearing, and profiling individual behavior signatures like subtle inter-group differences by age. SUBTLE highlights the importance of temporal representation in the behavioral embedding space for human-like behavioral categorization.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUnsupervised behavior-mapping from 3D action skeletons achieves superior performance, captures behavioral repertoires, and identifies inter-group differences, emphasizing how temporal representation is critical in the behavioral embedding space.",

    "abstract": "SorLA, encoded by the gene SORL1, is an intracellular sorting receptor of the VPS10P domain receptor gene family. Although SorLA is best recognized for its ability to shuttle target proteins between intracellular compartments in neurons, recent data suggest that also its microglial expression can be of high relevance for the pathogenesis of brain diseases, including glioblastoma (GBM). Here we interrogated the impact of SorLA on the functional properties of glioma-associated microglia and macrophages (GAMs). In the GBM microenvironment, GAMs are re-programmed and in turn lose the ability to elicit anti-tumor responses. Instead, they acquire glioma-supporting phenotype, which is a key mechanism promoting glioma progression. Our analysis of scRNA-seq data from GBM patients revealed that the pro-tumorigenic and pro-inflammatory properties of GAMs are linked to high and low SORL1 expression, respectively. Using cell models, we confirm that SorLA levels are differentially regulated by the presence of glioma cells and by inflammatory cues. We further show that SorLA acts as a sorting receptor for the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF to restrain its secretion from microglia. As a consequence, loss of SorLA enhanced the pro-inflammatory potential of microglia, having a remarkable impact on glioma progression. In a murine model of glioma, SorLA-deficient mice develop smaller tumors and show hallmarks of anti-tumor response including altered microglia morphology, enhanced necroptosis, and massive neutrophil influx into the tumor parenchyma. Our findings indicate that SorLA is a key player in shaping the phenotype of GAMs, and its depletion can unlock an anti-tumor response.\n\nSignificance statementOur study provides insight into the mechanisms shaping the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma (GBM), the most prevalent and aggressive brain malignancy in adults. Poor prognosis in GBM largely results from the properties of the glioma milieu that blocks the anti-tumor response. We show that SorLA restricts release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF from microglia, thereby hampering their anti-glioma response. SorLA depletion reinforces the pro-inflammatory properties of tumor microenvironment and inhibits glioma growth. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of glioma biology, indicating SorLA-TNF interaction as a potential target in GBM therapies. They also offer a new perspective on SorLA activities in microglia which emerge as highly relevant not only for the pathogenesis GBM, but also of other brain diseases such as Alzheimers disease.",

Here, we examined whether such dissociations are also evident in older adults. Young and older participants encoded a series of word-object image pairs, judging which of the denoted objects was the smaller. At test, participants first judged whether a test word was old or new. For items judged old, they were required to recall the associated image and hold it in mind across a variable delay period. A post-delay cue denoted which of three judgments should be made on the retrieved image. Older adults demonstrated significantly lower associative memory performance than young adults. Replicating prior findings, transient recollection effects were identified in the left hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate, while sustained effects were widespread across left lateral cortex and were also evident in the bilateral striatum. With the exception of those in the left insula, all effects were age-invariant. These findings add to the evidence that recollection-related BOLD effects in different neural regions can be temporally dissociated. Additionally, the findings suggest that both transient and sustained recollection effects are largely stable across much of the healthy adult lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is a salient feature of Parkinsons disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The onset of dementia reflects the spread of Lewy pathology throughout forebrain structures. The mere presence of Lewy pathology, however, provides limited indication of cognitive status. Thus, it remains unclear whether Lewy pathology is the de facto substrate driving cognitive dysfunction in PD and DLB. Through application of -synuclein fibrils in vivo, we sought to examine the influence of pathologic inclusions on cognition. Following stereotactic injection of -synuclein fibrils within the mouse forebrain, we measured the burden of -synuclein pathology at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-injection within subregions of the hippocampus and cortex. Under this paradigm, the hippocampal CA2/3 subfield was especially susceptible to - synuclein pathology. Strikingly, we observed a drastic reduction of pathology in the CA2/3 subfield across time-points, consistent with the consolidation of -synuclein pathology into dense somatic inclusions followed by neurodegeneration. Silver-positive degenerating neurites were observed prior to neuronal loss, suggesting that this might be an early feature of fibril-induced neurotoxicity and a precursor to neurodegeneration. Critically, mice injected with -synuclein fibrils developed progressive deficits in spatial learning and memory. These findings support that the formation of -synuclein inclusions in the mouse forebrain precipitate neurodegenerative changes that recapitulate features of Lewy-related cognitive dysfunction.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMice injected with -synuclein fibrils develop hippocampal and cortical - synuclein pathology with a dynamic regional burden at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-injection.\nC_LIO_LISilver-positive neuronal processes are an early and enduring degenerative feature of the fibril model, while extensive neurodegeneration of the hippocampal CA2/3 subfield is detected at 6-months post-injection.\nC_LIO_LIMice exhibit progressive hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits.\nC_LIO_LIForebrain injection of -synuclein fibrils may be used to model aspects of Lewy-related cognitive dysfunction.\nC_LI",

Primary sensory cortices, such as V1, respond weakly to stimuli that typical in their context but strongly to novel stimuli, an effect known as \"deviance detection\". How deviance detection occurs in associative cortical regions that are downstream of V1 is not well-understood. Here we investigated parietal associative area (PTLp) responses to auditory, visual, and audio-visual mismatches with two-photon calcium imaging and local field potential recordings. We employed basic unisensory auditory and visual oddball paradigms as well as a novel multisensory oddball paradigm, involving typical parings (VaAc or VbAd) presented at p=.88 with rare \"deviant\" pairings (e.g. VaAd or VbAc) presented at p=.12. We found that PTLp displayed robust deviance detection responses to auditory-visual mismatches, both in individual neurons and in population theta and gamma-band oscillations. In contrast, V1 neurons displayed deviance detection only to visual deviants in a unisensory context, but not to auditory or auditory-visual mismatches. Taken together, these results accord with a predictive processing framework for cortical responses, wherein modality specific prediction errors (i.e. deviance detection responses) are computed in functionally specified cortical areas and feed-forward to update higher brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Light has many non-image-forming functions including modulation of pupil size and stimulation of alertness and cognition. Part of these non-image-forming effects may be mediated by the brainstem locus coeruleus. The processing of sensory inputs can be associated with a transient pupil dilation that is likely driven in part by the phasic activity of the locus coeruleus. Here, we aimed to characterise the task-evoked pupil response associated with auditory inputs under different light levels and across two cognitive tasks. We continuously monitored the pupil of 20 young healthy participants (24.05y {+/-}4.0; 14 women) while they completed an attentional and an emotional auditory task whilst exposed to repeated 30-to-40s-blocks of light interleaved with darkness periods. Blocks could either consist of monochromatic orange light [0.16 melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance (EDI) lux] or blue-enriched white light of three different levels [37, 92, 190 melanopic EDI lux; 6500K]. For the analysis 15 and then 14 participants were included in the attentional and emotional tasks respectively. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed a significant main effect of light level on the task-evoked pupil responses triggered by the attentional and emotional tasks (p[&le;].0001). The impact of light was different for the target vs. non-target stimulus of the attentional task but was not different for the emotional and neutral stimulus of the emotional task. Despite a smaller sustained pupil size during brighter light blocks, a higher light level triggers a stronger task-evoked pupil response to auditory stimulation, presumably through the recruitment of the locus coeruleus.",

    "abstract": "Defects in blood development frequently occur among syndromic congenital anomalies. Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius (TAR) Syndrome is a rare congenital condition with reduced platelets (hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia) and forelimb anomalies, concurrent with more variable heart and kidney defects. TAR syndrome associates with hypomorphic gene function for RBM8A/Y14 that encodes a component of the exon junction complex involved in mRNA splicing, transport, and nonsense-mediated decay. How perturbing a general mRNA-processing factor causes the selective TAR Syndrome phenotypes remains unknown. Here, we connect zebrafish rbm8a perturbation to early hematopoietic defects via attenuated non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling that controls developmental cell arrangements. In hypomorphic rbm8a zebrafish, we observe a significant reduction of cd41-positive thrombocytes. rbm8a-mutant zebrafish embryos accumulate mRNAs with individual retained introns, a hallmark of defective nonsense-mediated decay; affected mRNAs include transcripts for non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway components. We establish that rbm8a-mutant embryos show convergent extension defects and that reduced rbm8a function interacts with perturbations in non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway genes wnt5b, wnt11f2, fzd7a, and vangl2. Using live-imaging, we found reduced rbm8a function impairs the architecture of the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) that forms hematopoietic, cardiovascular, kidney, and forelimb skeleton progenitors as affected in TAR Syndrome. Both mutants for rbm8a and for the PCP gene vangl2 feature impaired expression of early hematopoietic/endothelial genes including runx1 and the megakaryocyte regulator gfi1aa. Together, our data propose aberrant LPM patterning and hematopoietic defects as possible consequence of attenuated non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling upon reduced rbm8a function. These results link TAR Syndrome to a potential LPM origin and developmental mechanism.",

    "abstract": "For millennia, humans have watched nocturnal insects flying erratically around fires and lamps. Explanations have included theories of \"lunar navigation\" and \"escape to light\". However, without three-dimensional flight data to test them rigorously, this odd behaviour has remained unexplained. We employed high-resolution motion capture in the laboratory and stereo-videography in the field to reconstruct the 3D kinematics of insect flights around artificial lights. Contrary to the expectation of attraction, insects do not steer directly toward the light. Instead, insects turn their dorsum toward the light, generating flight bouts perpendicular to the source. Under natural sky light, tilting the dorsum towards the brightest visual hemisphere helps maintain proper flight attitude and control. Near artificial sources, however, this highly conserved dorsal-light-response can produce continuous steering around the light and trap an insect. Our guidance model demonstrates that this dorsal tilting is sufficient to create the seemingly erratic flight paths of insects near lights and is the most plausible model for why flying insects gather at artificial lights.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of drivers of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) is evolving, but it is apparent that not all lakes are created equal. Nitrogen (N) is an important component of all cHABs and is crucial for cyanotoxin production. It is generally assumed that external nitrogen inputs are the primary N source for cHABs. However, in northern lakes, nitrogen inputs are typically low, and suggests that internal nitrogen cycling, through heterotrophic organic matter decomposition or nitrogen fixation, may play a significant role in cHAB development and sustainment. Using Lake of the Woods as a testbed, we quantified nutrients, cyanotoxins, nitrogen fixation, and the microbial community in the southern extent of the lake. During our temporal study, inorganic nitrogen species (NO3-+NO2- and NH4+) were either at very low concentrations or below detection, while phosphorus was in excess. These conditions resulted in nitrogen-deficient growth and thereby favored nitrogen fixing cyanobacterial species. In response, nitrogen fixation rates increased exponentially throughout the summer and coincided with the Aphanizomenon sp. bloom. Despite nitrogen limitation, microcystin, anatoxin, saxitoxin, and cylindrospermopsin were all detected, with microcystin being the most abundant cyanotoxin detected. Microcystin concentrations were highest when free nitrogen was available and coincided with an increase in Microcystis. Together, our work suggests that internal nitrogen dynamics are responsible for the dominance of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and that additions of nitrogen may increase the likelihood of other cyanobacterial species, currently at low abundance, to increase growth and cyanotoxin production.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis study is the first assessment of nitrogen fixation rates and water column 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in Lake of the Woods during a harmful algal bloom season. The aim of this study is to better understand nitrogen dynamics and the microbial ecology of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms on Lake of the Woods. Result from this study reveal that internal nitrogen cycling via nitrogen fixation may alleviate nitrogen deficiencies, and structure and control the cyanobacterial community and cyanotoxin production. Molecular analysis reveals that cyanotoxins in Lake of the Woods are produced by less abundant cyanobacteria that are limited by nitrogen. This study has significant management implication as agencies continue to mitigate toxic blooms on Lake of the Woods, the largest shoreline lake in the United States. Our work is an important initial assessment and jumping off point for further research on Lake of the Woods when assessing how nitrogen plays a role in bloom formation and toxicity. Submitting to L&O, we believe would allow for the greatest outreach and access to an audience that will continue to build upon our findings. Additionally, submitting with L&O our work will reach beyond the scientific audience, but also reach other parties participating in the mitigation of harmful algal blooms.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), poses a global health challenge and is responsible for over a million deaths each year. Current treatment is lengthy and complex, and new, abbreviated regimens are urgently needed. Mtb adapts to nutrient starvation, a condition experienced during host infection, by shifting its metabolism and becoming tolerant to the killing activity of bactericidal antibiotics. An improved understanding of the mechanisms mediating antibiotic tolerance in Mtb can serve as the basis for developing more effective therapies. We performed a forward genetic screen to identify candidate Mtb genes involved in tolerance to the two key first-line antibiotics, rifampin and isoniazid, under nutrient-rich and nutrient-starved conditions. In nutrient-rich conditions, we found 220 mutants with differential antibiotic susceptibility (218 in the rifampin screen and 2 in the isoniazid screen). Following Mtb adaptation to nutrient starvation, 82 mutants showed differential antibiotic susceptibility (80 in the rifampin screen and 2 in the isoniazid screen). Using targeted mutagenesis, we validated the rifampin-hypersusceptible phenotype under nutrient starvation in Mtb mutants lacking the following genes: ercc3, moeA1, rv0049, and rv2179c. These findings shed light on potential therapeutic targets, which could help shorten the duration and complexity of antitubercular regimens.\n\nImportanceTreatment of Mtb infection requires a long course of combination antibiotics, likely due to subpopulations of tolerant bacteria exhibiting decreased susceptibility to antibiotics. Identifying and characterizing the genetic pathways involved in antibiotic tolerance is expected to yield therapeutic targets for the development of novel TB treatment-shortening regimens.",

    "abstract": "Human astrovirus is a positive sense, single stranded RNA virus. Astrovirus infection causes gastrointestinal symptoms and can lead to encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. Positive strand RNA viruses typically utilize host intracellular membranes to form replication organelles, which are potential antiviral targets. Many of these replication organelles are double membrane vesicles (DMVs). Here we show that astrovirus infection leads to an increase in DMV formation, and this process is replication-dependent. Our data suggest that astrovirus infection induces rearrangement of endoplasmic reticulum fragments, which may become the origin for DMV formation. Transcriptional data suggested that formation of DMVs during astrovirus infection requires some early components of the autophagy machinery. Results indicate that the upstream class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, but not LC3 conjugation machinery, is utilized in DMV formation. Inhibition of the PI3K complex leads to significant reduction in viral replication and release from cells. Elucidating the role of autophagy machinery in DMV formation during astrovirus infection reveals a potential target for therapeutic intervention for immunocompromised patients.\n\nImportanceThese studies provide critical new evidence that astrovirus replication requires formation of double membrane vesicles, which utilize class III PI3K, but not LC3 conjugation autophagy machinery for biogenesis. These results are consistent with replication mechanisms for other positive sense RNA viruses. This suggests that targeting PI3K could be a promising therapeutic option for not only astrovirus, but other positive sense RNA virus infections.",

    "abstract": "We report the sequencing and analysis of 60 XBC and 114 XBC.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in the Philippines from August to September 2022, which are regarded as recombinant lineages of the BA.2 Omicron and B.1.617.2 Delta (21I Clade) variants. The sequences described here place the Philippines as the country with the earliest and highest number of XBC and XBC.1 cases within the included period. Majority of the detected cases were sampled from the adjacent Davao and Soccskargen regions in southern Philippines, but have also been observed at lower proportions in other regions of the country. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis with global samples from GISAID reaffirms the supposed root of XBC-like cases from the Philippines. Furthermore, the apparent clustering of some foreign cases separate from those collected in the country suggests several occurrences of cross-border transmissions resulting in the spread of XBC-like lineages within and among those countries. The consensus mutation profile shows regions harboring mutations specific to either the Omicron BA.2 or Delta B.1.617.2 lineages, supporting the recombinant nature of XBC. Finally, alternative allele fraction pattern and intrahost mutation analysis revealed that a relatively early case of XBC collected in March 2022 is likely to be an active co-infection event. This suggests that co-infection of Omicron and Delta was already occurring in the Philippines early in 2022, facilitating the generation of recombinants that may have further evolved and gained additional mutations enabling its spread across certain local populations at a later time.\n\nAuthor summaryMore recently, various lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent COVID-19 pandemic, have been observed to form recombinant lineages, further expanding the ways by which the virus can evolve and adapt to human interventions. Therefore, a large part of biosurveillance efforts is dedicated to detecting and observing new lineages, including recombinants, for early and effective control. In this paper, we present an analysis of 174 XBC and XBC.1 cases detected in the Philippines between August and September of 2022 which contextualize these cases as some of the earliest reported cases of this hybrid lineage. We show that when compared to cases from other countries collected at a similar time, the earliest cases of the XBC lineage are from the Philippines. Additionally, when samples were reclassified following an update of Pangolin, a tool for assigning SARS-CoV-2 lineages to samples, we found two samples of interest reclassified as XBC pointing to a potential origin via co-infection events occurring as early as March of 2022.",

    "abstract": "PI3K{gamma} is a critical immune signaling enzyme activated downstream of diverse cell surface molecules, including Ras, PKC{beta} activated by the IgE receptor, and G{beta}{gamma} subunits released from activated GPCRs. PI3K{gamma} can form two distinct complexes, with the p110{gamma} catalytic subunit binding to either a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit, with these complexes being differentially activated by upstream stimuli. Here using a combination of cryo electron microscopy, HDX-MS, and biochemical assays we have identified novel roles of the helical domain of p110{gamma} in regulating lipid kinase activity of distinct PI3K{gamma} complexes. We defined the molecular basis for how an allosteric inhibitory nanobody potently inhibits kinase activity through rigidifying the helical domain and regulatory motif of the kinase domain. The nanobody did not block either p110{gamma} membrane recruitment or Ras/G{beta}{gamma} binding, but instead decreased ATP turnover. We also identified that p110{gamma} can be activated by dual PKC{beta} helical domain phosphorylation leading to partial unfolding of an N-terminal region of the helical domain. PKC{beta} phosphorylation is selective for p110{gamma}-p84 compared to p110{gamma}-p101, driven by differential dynamics of the helical domain of these different complexes. Nanobody binding prevented PKC{beta} mediated phosphorylation. Overall, this works shows an unexpected allosteric regulatory role of the helical domain of p110{gamma} that is distinct between p110{gamma}-p84 and p110{gamma}-p101 and reveals how this can be modulated by either phosphorylation or allosteric inhibitory binding partners. This opens possibilities of future allosteric inhibitor development for therapeutic intervention.",

In this study, we present a total of nine cryo-electron microscopy structures at a resolution ranging from 2.4 to 3.1 [A], along with functional and computational studies of the human flippase ATP8B1-CDC50A complex, describing the autophosphorylation steps from ATP, substrate recognition and occlusion, as well as its regulation by phosphoinositides. Our findings show that the P4-ATPase transport site is filled with water upon phosphorylation from ATP. Additionally, we identify two different autoinhibited states, a closed and an outward-open conformation. Furthermore, we identified and characterized the PI(3,4,5)P3 binding site of ATP8B1 in an electropositive pocket between transmembrane segments 5, 7, 8, and 10. Our study also highlights the structural basis of ATP8B1 broad specificity for lipids and identifies a new transport substrate for P4-ATPases, phosphatidylinositol (PI). We report the critical role of the sn-2 ester bound of glycerophospholipids in substrate recognition by ATP8B1. These findings provide fundamental insights into ATP8B1 regulation, the catalytic cycle, and substrate recognition in P4-ATPases.",

    "abstract": "Amongst the wide array of alternative splicing events (ASE), the intrinsic mechanisms of intron retention have remained elusive. This particular type of ASE has long been characterized as an artifact, but recent studies have shown its implication in numerous diseases. It has also been revealed that numerous viruses choose to disrupt alternative splicing to escape cellular immune response and further their proliferation. The main focus of this study was to investigate the G-quadruplex role in Alternative Splicing Events (ASEs) that occur following Flavivirus infections. After having demonstrated that G-quadruplexes structures are mainly formed in Intron Retained Transcripts by RNA-seq, our attention turned toward the ULK3 gene, coding for a serine/threonine kinase regulating autophagy, an essential mechanism in the cellular response to stress and even pathogen infections. In this study, we revealed the presence of a G-quadruplex in the first intron of the ULK3 gene near the 3  splice site. Furthermore, we assayed the formation and stability of this G-quadruplex in vitro and showed that its formation affects IR, as demonstrated by comparisons between wild-type and mutant transfected mini-genes. Finally, we identified the specific RNA-binding protein signature for this G-quadruplex, thereby uncovering the novel role of G-quadruplexes in Alternative Splicing.",

    "abstract": "Main protease (MPro) of SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen of COVID-19, is a crucial nonstructural protein that plays a vital role in the replication and pathogenesis of the virus. Its protease function relies on three active site pockets to recognize P1, P2, and P4 amino acid residues in a substrate and a catalytic cysteine residue for catalysis. By converting the P1 C atom in an MPro substrate to nitrogen, we showed that a large variety of azapeptide inhibitors with covalent warheads targeting the MPro catalytic cysteine could be easily synthesized. Through the characterization of these inhibitors, we identified several highly potent MPro inhibitors. Specifically, one inhibitor, MPI89 that contained an aza-2,2-dichloroacetyl warhead, displayed a 10 nM EC50 value in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 from infecting ACE2+ A549 cells and a selectivity index of 875. The crystallography analyses of MPro bound with 6 inhibitors, including MPI89, revealed that inhibitors used their covalent warheads to covalently engage the catalytic cysteine and the aza-amide carbonyl oxygen to bind to the oxyanion hole. MPI89 represents one of the most potent MPro inhibitors developed so far, suggesting that further exploration of the azapeptide platform and the aza-2,2-dichloroacetyl warhead is needed for the development of potent inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 MPro as therapeutics for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Continued global outbreaks of H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have been reported in poultry since the emergence of the Asian Goose/Guangdong lineage of HPAIV H5N1 in 1996. Consequently, vaccines have been developed and employed to protect commercial and non-commercial poultry flocks. However, constant changes in virus immunogenetics makes vaccine candidates that prevent morbidity, mortality, reduce shedding, and prevent transmission a moving target. Here, we tested the effects of disrupting the mRNA splice sites and thus expression of either of the two isoforms of the viral ion channel M2 and M42 expressed by the H5N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) progenitor of the 1983 Pennsylvania HPAIV outbreak. Both G52C ({Delta}M2) and G145A ({Delta}M42) versions of the A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1/83 (Ck/Penn) virus replicated well in vitro and in ovo, but showed altered virion morphology, with the G145A virus exhibiting filamentous budding. The G52C and G145A viruses also infected chickens efficiently and stimulated robust immune responses; however, unlike the wild type virus, they did not transmit to naive-contact birds. In protection studies, vaccination of birds with G52C or G145A viruses protected 100% of birds from lethal challenge with homologous and distant heterologous H5 HPAIV strains from North American and Asian lineages and significantly reduced virus shedding compared to controls. Furthermore, the live virus vaccines decreased virus shedding 10,000-fold more than corresponding inactivated forms of the vaccine virus. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a strategy for developing a non-transmittable but highly protective live attenuated virus for AIV.",

    "abstract": "Bi-directional extracellular electron transfer (EET) is crucial to upholding microbial metabolism with insoluble electron acceptors or donors in anoxic environments. Investigating bi-directional EET-capable microorganisms is desired to understand the cell-cell and microbe-mineral interactions and their role in mineral cycling besides leveraging their energy generation and conversion, biosensing, and bio-battery applications. Here, we report on iron cycling by haloalkaliphilic Geoalkalibacter halelectricus via bi-directional EET under haloalkaline conditions. It efficiently reduces Fe3+-oxide (Fe2O3) to Fe0 at a 2.29{+/-}0.07 mM/day rate linked to acetate oxidation via outward EET and oxidizes Fe0 to Fe3+ with a 0.038{+/-}0.002 mM/day rate via inward EET to reduce fumarate. Bioelectrochemical cultivation confirmed its outward and inward EET capabilities. It produced 895{+/-}23 A/cm2 current by linking acetate oxidation to anode reduction via outward EET and reduced fumarate by drawing electrons from the cathode (-2.5{+/-}0.3 A/cm2) via inward EET. The cyclic voltammograms of G. halelectricus biofilms revealed redox moieties with different formal potentials, suggesting the involvement of different membrane components in bi-directional EET. The cyclic voltammetry and GC-MS analysis of the cell-free spent medium revealed the lack of soluble redox mediators, suggesting direct electron transfer by G. halelecctricus in achieving bi-directional EET. By reporting on the first haloalkaliphilic bacterium capable of oxidizing and reducing insoluble Fe0 and Fe3+-oxide, respectively, this study advances the limited understanding of the metabolic capabilities of extremophiles to respire on insoluble electron acceptors or donors via bi-directional EET and invokes the possible role of G. halelectricus in iron cycling in barely studied haloalkaline environments.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536630v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8080aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@187d9d9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef6066org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2081b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum invades and replicates asexually within human erythrocytes. CD44 expressed on erythrocytes was previously identified as an important host factor for P. falciparum infection through a forward genetic screen, but little is known about its regulation or function in these cells, nor how it may be utilized by the parasite. We found that CD44 can be efficiently deleted from primary human hematopoietic stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and that the efficiency of ex-vivo erythropoiesis to enucleated cultured red blood cells (cRBCs) is not impacted by lack of CD44. However, the rate of P. falciparum invasion was substantially reduced in CD44-null cRBCs relative to isogenic wild-type (WT) control cells, validating CD44 as an important host factor for this parasite. We identified two P. falciparum invasion ligands as binding partners for CD44, Erythrocyte Binding Antigen-175 (EBA-175) and EBA-140, and demonstrated that their ability to bind to human erythrocytes relies primarily on their canonical receptors-glycophorin A and glycophorin C, respectively. We further show that EBA-175 induces phosphorylation of erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins in a CD44-dependent manner. Our findings support a model where P. falciparum exploits CD44 as a co-receptor during invasion of human erythrocytes, stimulating CD44-dependent phosphorylation of host cytoskeletal proteins that alter host cell deformability and facilitate parasite entry.",

    "abstract": "Trichoderma harzianum is a filamentous ascomycete frequently applied as plant beneficial agent in agriculture. While mycoparasitism and antagonism of Trichoderma spp. against fungal pathogens are well known, early responses of the fungus to the presence of a plant await broader investigation. In this study we analyzed these early stages of plant-fungus communication at the molecular level. We show that T. harzianum B97 is an efficient colonizer of plants and chemotropically responds to a plant extract. Patterns of secreted metabolites revealed that the fungus chemically responds to the presence of the plant and that the plant secrets a fungus specific metabolite as well. Hence we developed a strategy for omics analysis to simulate the conditions of the early plant recognition eliciting a chemotropic response in the fungus and found only 102 genes to be differentially regulated, including nitrate and nitrite reductases. Among them, a so far uncharacterized, presumably silent gene cluster was strongly induced upon recognition of the plant. Gene deletion of two genes of this Plant Communication Associated (PCA) cluster revealed that they are essential for colonization of soybean roots. Moreover, for part of the gene cluster, a DNA motif with palindromic sequence was detected. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PCA cluster is only present in the Harzianum clade of Trichoderma and was likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Metarhizium spp., with the clustered genes originating from fungi, bacteria and plants.\n\nWe conclude that the plant recognition specific PCA cluster mediates early chemical communication between plant and fungus, is required for colonization and it is likely responsible for the high potential of T. harzianum and closely related species for biocontrol applications.\n\nSignificance statementInteractions of plants with fungi - beneficial or pathogenic - are crucial for the ecological function of both partners. Yet, the chemical \"language\" they use and how or when they use it is still insufficiently known. We describe discovery of a novel secondary metabolite cluster, which is transcriptionally induced in the early phase of interaction, even before contact. Presence of this cluster is essential for colonization of the plant, hence reflecting the very start of an intimate plant-fungal interkingdom interaction. Acquisition of the cluster from other organisms highlights the evolutionary adaptation of T. harzianum to plant interaction and likely contributes to its success as plant symbiont.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal maintenance is vital for the survival of bacteria. In Caulobacter crescentus, chromosome replication initiates at ori and segregation is delayed until the nearby centromere-like region parS is replicated. Our understanding of how this sequence of events is regulated remains limited. The segregation of parS has been shown to involve multiple steps including polar release from anchoring protein PopZ, slow movement, and fast ParA-dependent movement to opposite cell pole. In this study, we demonstrate that ParAs competing attractions from PopZ and from DNA are critical for segregation of parS. Interfering with this balance of attractions - by expressing a variant ParA-R195E unable to bind DNA and thus favoring interactions exclusively between ParA-PopZ - results in cell death. Our data revealed that ParA-R195Es sole interactions with PopZ obstruct PopZs ability to release the polar anchoring of parS resulting in cells with multiple parS loci fixed at one cell pole. We show that the inability to separate and segregate multiple parS loci from the pole is specifically dependent on the interaction between ParA and PopZ. Interfering with interactions between PopZ and the partitioning protein ParB, which is the interaction that anchors parS at the cell pole, does not rescue the ability of cells to separate the fixed parS loci when expressing parA-R195E. Thus, ParA and PopZ appear to have a distinct conversation from ParB yet can impact the release of ParB-parS from the anchoring at the cell pole. Collectively, our results reveal that the initial steps in chromosome segregation are highly regulated.",

However, the widely varying efficiency of prime editing across target sites of interest has limited its adoption in the context of both basic research and clinical settings. Here, we set out to exhaustively characterize the impact of the cis-chromatin environment on prime editing efficiency. Using a newly developed and highly sensitive method for mapping the genomic locations of a randomly integrated \"sensor\", we identify specific epigenetic features that strongly correlate with the highly variable efficiency of prime editing across different genomic locations. Next, to assess the interaction of trans-acting factors with the cis-chromatin environment, we develop and apply a pooled genetic screening approach with which the impact of knocking down various DNA repair factors on prime editing efficiency can be stratified by cis-chromatin context. Finally, we demonstrate that we can dramatically modulate the efficiency of prime editing through epigenome editing, i.e. altering chromatin state in a locus-specific manner in order to increase or decrease the efficiency of prime editing at a target site. Looking forward, we envision that the insights and tools described here will broaden the range of both basic research and therapeutic contexts in which prime editing is useful.",

    "abstract": "Aims/HypothesisDiabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Though animal models have taught us much about the molecular mechanisms of DKD, translating these findings to human disease requires greater knowledge of the molecular changes caused by diabetes in human kidneys. Establishing this knowledge base requires building carefully curated, reliable, and complete repositories of human kidney tissue, as well as tissue proteomics platforms capable of simultaneous, spatially resolved examination of multiple proteins.\n\nMethodsWe used the multiplexed immunofluorescence platform CO-Detection by indexing (CODEX) to image and analyze the expression of 21 proteins in 23 tissue sections from 12 individuals with diabetes and healthy kidneys (DM, 5 individuals), DKD classes IIA, and IIB (2 individuals per class), IIA-B intermediate (2 individuals), and III (one individual).\n\nResultsAnalysis of the 21-plex immunofluorescence images revealed 18 cellular clusters, corresponding to 10 known kidney compartments and cell types, including proximal tubules, distal nephron, podocytes, glomerular endothelial and peritubular capillaries, blood vessels, including endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, cells of the myeloid lineage, broad CD45+ inflammatory cells and the basement membrane. DKD progression was associated with co-localized increase in collagen IV deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as loss of native proteins of each nephron segment at variable rates. Compartment-specific cellular changes corroborated this general theme, with compartment-specific variations. Cell type frequency and cell-to-cell adjacency highlighted (statistically) significant increase in inflammatory cells and their adjacency to tubular and SMA+ cells in DKD kidneys. Finally, DKD progression was marked by substantial regional variability within single tissue sections, as well as variability across patients within the same DKD class. The sizable intra-personal variability in DKD severity impacts pathologic classifications, and the attendant clinical decisions, which are usually based on small tissue biopsies.\n\nConclusions/InterpretationsHigh-plex immunofluorescence images revealed changes in protein expression corresponding to differences in cellular phenotypic composition and microenvironment structure with DKD progression. This initial dataset demonstrates the combined power of curated human kidney tissues, multiplexed immunofluorescence and powerful analysis tools in revealing pathophysiology of human DKD.",

    "abstract": "Langya virus (LayV) is a paramyxovirus in the Henipavirus genus, closely related to the deadly Nipah and Hendra viruses, that was identified in August 2022 through disease surveillance following animal exposure in eastern China. Paramyxoviruses present two glycoproteins on their surface, known as attachment and fusion proteins, that mediate entry into cells and constitute the primary antigenic targets for immune response. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of the uncleaved LayV fusion protein (F) ectodomain in pre- and post-fusion conformations. The LayV-F protein exhibits pre- and post-fusion architectures that, despite being highly conserved across paramyxoviruses, show differences in their surface properties, in particular at the apex of the prefusion trimer, that may contribute to antigenic variability. While dramatic conformational changes were visualized between the pre- and post-fusion forms of the LayV-F protein, several domains remained invariant, held together by highly conserved disulfides. The LayV-F fusion peptide is buried within a highly conserved, hydrophobic, interprotomer pocket in the pre-fusion state and is notably less flexible than the rest of the protein, highlighting its \"spring-loaded\" state and suggesting that the mechanism of pre-to-post transition must involve perturbations to the pocket and release of the fusion peptide. Together, these results offer a structural basis for how the Langya virus fusion protein compares to its Henipavirus relatives and propose a mechanism for the initial step of pre- to post-fusion conversion that may apply more broadly to paramyxoviruses.\n\nImportanceThe Henipavirus genus is quickly expanding into new animal hosts and geographic locations. This study compares the structure and antigenicity of the Langya virus fusion protein to other henipaviruses, which has important vaccine or therapeutic development implications. Furthermore, the study proposes a new mechanism to explain the early steps of the fusion initiation process that can be more broadly applied to the Paramyxoviridae family.",

    "abstract": "tRNAs undergo an extensive maturation process involving post-transcriptional modifications often associated with tRNA structural stability and promoting the native fold. Impaired post-transcriptional modification has been linked to human disease, likely through defects in translation, mitochondrial function, and increased susceptibility to degradation by various tRNA decay pathways. More recently, evidence has emerged that bacterial tRNA modification enzymes can act as tRNA chaperones to guide tRNA folding in a manner independent from catalytic activity. Here, we provide evidence that the fission yeast tRNA methyltransferase Trm1, which dimethylates nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs at G26, can also promote tRNA functionality in the absence of catalysis. We show that wild type and catalytic-dead Trm1 are active in an in vivo tRNA-mediated suppression assay and possess RNA strand annealing and dissociation activity in vitro, similar to previously characterized RNA chaperones. Trm1 and the RNA chaperone La have previously been proposed to function synergistically in promoting tRNA maturation, yet we surprisingly demonstrate that La binding to nascent pre-tRNAs decreases Trm1 tRNA dimethylation in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis for tRNA modification enzymes that combine catalytic and non-catalytic activities to promote tRNA maturation, as well as expand our understanding of how La function can influence tRNA modification.",

    "abstract": "The nonenzymatic copying of RNA is thought to have been necessary for the transition between prebiotic chemistry and ribozyme-catalyzed RNA replication in the RNA World. We have previously shown that a potentially prebiotic nucleotide activation pathway based on phospho-Passerini chemistry can lead to the efficient synthesis of 2-aminoimidazole activated mononucleotides when carried out under freeze-thaw cycling conditions. Such activated nucleotides react with each other to form 5'-5' 2-aminoimidazolium bridged dinucleotides, enabling template-directed primer extension to occur within the same reaction mixture. However, mononucleotides linked to oligonucleotides by a 5'-5' 2-aminoimidazolium bridge are superior substrates for nonenzymatic primer extension, due to their higher intrinsic reactivity and their higher template affinity. Here we show that eutectic phase phospho-Passerini chemistry efficiently activates short oligonucleotides and promotes the formation of monomer-bridged-oligonucleotide species during freeze-thaw cycles. We then demonstrate that in-situ generated monomer-bridged-oligonucleotides lead to efficient nonenzymatic template copying in the same reaction mixture. Our findings pave the way for future research into the activation of complex mixtures of mono- and oligonucleotides for the enhanced copying and potentially the replication of arbitrary RNA sequences.",

    "abstract": "Administration of tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) to individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is an important facet of global tuberculosis control. The use of long-acting injectable (LAI) drug formulations may simplify and shorten regimens for this indication. Rifapentine and rifabutin have anti-tuberculosis activity and physiochemical properties suitable for LAI formulation, but there are limited data available for determining the target exposure profiles required for efficacy in TPT regimens. The objective of this study was to determine exposure-activity profiles of rifapentine and rifabutin to inform development of LAI formulations for TPT. We utilized a validated paucibacillary mouse model of TPT in combination with dynamic oral dosing of both drugs to simulate and understand exposure-activity relationships to inform posology for future LAI formulations. This work identified several LAI-like exposure profiles of rifapentine and rifabutin that, if achieved by LAI formulations, could be efficacious as TPT regimens and thus can serve as experimentally-determined targets for novel LAI formulations of these drugs. We present novel methodology to understand the exposure-response relationship and inform the value proposition for investment in development of LAI formulations that has utility beyond latent tuberculosis infection.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial evolution is affected by mobile genetic elements such as phages and conjugative plasmids, which may provide novel adaptive traits but also incur in fitness costs. Infection by these elements is affected by the bacterial capsule. Yet, its importance has been difficult to quantify and characterise because of the high diversity of bacterial genomes regarding confounding mechanisms such as anti-viral systems. We swapped capsule loci between Klebsiella pneumoniae strains to quantify their effect on transfer of conjugative plasmids and phages independently of the genetic background. Capsule swaps systematically invert phage susceptibility, demonstrating that serotypes are key determinants of phage infection. Capsule types also affect conjugation efficiency in both donor and recipient cells depending on the serotype, a mechanism shaped by the capsule volume and depending on the structure of the conjugative pilus. Comparative genomics confirmed that more permissive serotypes in the lab correspond to the strains acquiring more conjugative plasmids in nature. The pili least sensitive to capsules (F-like) are also the most frequent in the species plasmids, and are the only ones associated with both antibiotic resistance and virulence factors, driving the convergence between virulence and antibiotics resistance in the population. These results show how the traits of cellular envelopes define slow and fast lanes of infection by mobile genetic elements, with implications for population dynamics and horizontal gene transfer.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/536574v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@157bc4eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10bc979org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d85080org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d331e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Senescence is a state of indefinite cell cycle arrest associated with aging, cancer, and age-related diseases. Here, using label-based mass spectrometry, ribosome profiling and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we explore the coordinated interaction of translational and transcriptional programs of human cellular senescence. We find that translational deregulation and a corresponding maladaptive integrated stress response (ISR) is a hallmark of senescence that desensitizes senescent cells to stress. We show that senescent cells maintain high levels of eIF2 phosphorylation, typical of ISR activation, but translationally repress the stress response transcription factor 4 (ATF4) by ineffective bypass of the inhibitory upstream open reading frames. Surprisingly, ATF4 translation remains inhibited even after acute proteotoxic and amino acid starvation stressors, resulting in a highly diminished stress response. Furthermore, absent a response, stress exacerbates the senescence secretory phenotype and inflammatory pathways thus acting as a possible mechanistic link to disease. Our results reveal a novel mechanism that senescent cells exploit to evade an adaptive stress response and remain viable.",

    "abstract": "Maize is the most-produced cereal in the world, but its production faces constraints such as parasitic attacks from stemborers. We evaluated the resistance of a core-collection of 18 maize lines by measuring their palatability to European Corn Borer (ECB) larvae fed on maize leaf discs. Using an original consumption test device that takes into account the variability of larvae behaviour, we were able to phenotype the resistance of the 18 maize lines. We matched consumption data to existing enzymatic and metabolomic data that characterized the maize core-collection and identified some metabolites such as caffeoyl-lquinate, trocopherol, digalactosylglycerol and tyrosine that are positively or negatively correlated with the palatability to ECB larvae. Altogether, our results confirm the metabolic complexity involved in the establishment of plant defenses. Metabolic changes associated to leaf palatability mostly concern membrane and cell wall composition. Some of them, pointing-out to the phenylpropanoids pathway, were observed independently of plant developmental pace and plant earliness.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive divergence of Aedes aegypti populations to heterogeneous environments may be a driving force behind the recent expansion of their habitat distribution and outbreaks of dengue disease in urbanized areas. In this study, we investigated the population genomics of Ae. aegypti at a regional scale in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines using double digestion restriction-site association DNA sequencing (ddRAD-Seq). Specifically, we used a Pool-Seq approach to generate a high number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were used to determine local adaptation and population structure. We detected 65,473 SNPs in 217 Ae. aegypti individuals from 14 populations with 76 non-neutral SNP loci. Additionally, 57 of these non-neutral SNP loci were associated with 8 landscape variables (e.g., open space, forest, etc) and 4 climate variables (e.g., air temperature, humidity, etc). Furthermore, the percentage of the area of landscape variables, such as forest, parks and recreation, air temperature, man-made building, and open space per local population was frequently associated with non-neutral SNP loci. Most non-neutral SNP loci formed four clusters that were in linkage disequilibrium with each other in physical proximity on the chromosome and were associated with a common environmental variable. Male and female populations exhibited contrasting spatial divergence, i.e., males exhibited greater divergence, likely reflecting their different dispersal abilities. In comparative analysis of the same Ae. aegypti individuals, the pairwise FST values of 11 microsatellite markers were lower than those of neutral SNP loci, indicating that the neutral SNP loci generated via ddRAD-Seq were more sensitive in terms of detecting genetic differences between populations at fine-spatial scales. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of ddRAD-Seq for examining genetic differences in Ae. aegypti populations, and our data on mosquito dispersal at a regional spatial scale could inform vector control programs.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe population expansion of dengue vector, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is one of the factors that may promote the outbreak of the diseases. Understanding the population genomics of Ae.aegypti may contribute to better knowledge about mosquito expansion and how they can adapt to the change in environment. In this study, we used pool-based ddRAD-Seq (Double Digest Restriction site Association DNA Sequencing) to generate SNPs that occur between the Ae.aegypti populations in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines. We found that non-neutral SNP loci are frequently associated with landscape variables compared to climatic variables. Landscape variables such as forest, park and recreation, air temperature, man-made building and open space are more frequently associated with non-neutral SNPs loci. Those landscape variables may relate to the mosquitos fitness, therefore, induce the adaptive divergence within Ae.aegypti population. We also found male and female populations are exhibiting a contrast spatial divergence by using neutral SNP loci. In addition, neutral SNPs loci showed higher resolution in population structuring than microsatellite markers using the same individuals.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) exits cells by direct translocation across the plasma membrane, a type I pathway of unconventional protein secretion. This process is initiated by PI(4,5)P2-dependent formation of highly dynamic FGF2 oligomers at the inner plasma membrane leaflet, inducing the formation of lipidic membrane pores. Cell surface heparan sulfate chains linked to glypican-1 (GPC1) capture FGF2 at the outer plasma membrane leaflet, completing FGF2 membrane translocation into the extracellular space. While the basic steps of this pathway are well understood, the molecular mechanism by which FGF2 oligomerizes on membrane surfaces remains unclear. In the current study, we show FGF2 dimerization on membrane surfaces to be dependent on the formation of a C95-C95 disulfide bridge, producing the building block for higher FGF2 oligomers that drive the formation of membrane pores. We find FGF2 with a C95A substitution to be defective in oligomerization, pore formation, and membrane translocation. Consistently, we demonstrate a C95A variant of FGF2 to be characterized by a severe secretion phenotype. By contrast, while also important for efficient FGF2 secretion from cells, a second cysteine residue on the molecular surface of FGF2 (C77) is not involved in FGF2 oligomerization. Rather, we find C77 to be part of the protein-protein interaction interface through which FGF2 binds to the 1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, the landing platform for FGF2 at the inner plasma membrane leaflet. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and cryo-electron tomography, we provide insights into the protein-protein interface of C95-C95 disulfide bridged FGF2 dimers and propose a mechanism by which they bind with high avidity to PI(4,5)P2 on membrane surfaces. Our findings further imply a tight coupling between FGF2 secretion and the formation of ternary signaling complexes on cell surfaces, indicating that C95-C95 bridged FGF2 dimers are functioning as the molecular units triggering autocrine and paracrine FGF2 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Statins form a class of drugs often administered in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, for which their antioxidant capacity appears particularly relevant. Although experiments have long provided empirical evidence that statins can suppress various oxidation pathways, theoretical attempts to quantify the antioxidant activity of statins (read, atorvastatin ATV, because this is the only one studied so far) were not published until last year. Molecular and clinical differences of stains trace back to the ring attached to the statins active moiety. This can be, e.g., a pyrrole, as the case of the aforementioned ATV or a quinoline, as the case of pitavastatin (PVT), which represents the focus of the present work. Extensive results reported here for PVT and derivative include the thermodynamic antioxidant descriptors (bond dissociation enthalpy BDE, adiabatic ionization potential IP, proton dissociation enthalpy PDE, proton affinity PA, and electron transfer enthalpy ETE) related to the three antioxidant mechanisms (hydrogen atom transfer HAT, stepwise electron transfer proton transfer SETPT, sequential proton loss electron transfer SPLET). Our particular emphasis is on the PVTs hydroxylated derivatives wherein a hydroxy group replaces a hydrogen atom either on the quinoline core (Q-hydroxylated metabolites) or on the fluorophenyl ring (F-hydroxylated metabolites). Our calculations indicate that both the Q- and F-hydroxylated metabolites possess antioxidant properties superior to the parent PVT molecule.

    "abstract": "In X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, experimental maps can be heterogeneous, showing different regions of the structure with different level of details. In this work we interpret the heterogeneity in terms of two parameters, assigned individually for each atom, combining the conventional parameter of atomic displacement with the resolution of the atomic image in the map. We propose a local real-space procedure to estimate the values of these heterogeneity parameters, assuming that a fragment of the density map and preliminary values of atomic coordinates are given. The procedure is based on the representation of the atomic image in an analytical form, as a function of the inhomogeneity parameters and atomic coordinates. In this article, we report the results of the tests both with simulated maps and maps derived from experimental data. For simulated heterogeneous maps containing regions with different resolutions, the method determines the local map resolution near the atomic centers and the values of the atomic displacement parameter with reasonable accuracy. For experimental maps, obtained as a Fourier synthesis of a given global resolution, estimated values of the local resolution are close to the global one, and the values of the estimated displacement parameters are close to the respective values in the refined model. Shown examples of the application of the proposed method to the experimental crystallographic and cryo-EM maps can be seen as a practical proof of method.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration and chronic progressive neuroinflammation are well-documented in neurological lysosomal storage diseases, including Sanfilippo disease or mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS III). Since chronic neuroinflammation has been linked to white matter tract pathology and defects in axonal transmission, we analysed axonal myelination and white matter density in the mouse model of MPS IIIC and human post-mortem brain samples from MPS IIIA, C, and D patients. Analyses of corpus callosum (CC) and spinal cord tissues by immunohistochemistry revealed substantially reduced levels of myelin-associated proteins including Myelin Basic Protein, Myelin Associated Glycoprotein, and Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein. Furthermore, ultrastructural analyses revealed disruption of myelin sheath organization and reduced myelin thickness in the brains of MPS IIIC mice and human MPS IIIC patients compared to healthy controls. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the CC of MPS IIIC mice were scarce, while examination of the remaining cells revealed numerous enlarged lysosomes containing heparan sulfate, GM3 ganglioside or \"zebra bodies\" consistent with accumulation of lipids and myelin fragments. In addition, OLs contained swollen mitochondria with largely dissolved cristae, resembling those previously identified in the dysfunctional neurons of MPS IIIC mice. When brains of 7-month-old MPS IIIC mice were analysed by ex-vivo Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging to assess microarchitectural changes in the corpus callosum, we found compelling signs of demyelination (26% increase in radial diffusivity) and tissue loss (76% increase in hindered diffusivity). Our findings demonstrate an import role for white matter injury in the pathophysiology of MPS III.
