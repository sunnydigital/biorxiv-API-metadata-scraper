    "abstract": "In this paper we construct a mathematical surface-network where topological changes of the network are linked to signal generating events within it. The surface nature of the network is used to show how changes to a set of topological parameters of a subsystem of the network, produced by local geometric deformations, generate output traveling signals and that these signals carry with them the topological and geometric deformation parameter values that created them. In this scheme, topological architectural information of this subsystem and traveling signals are mathematically linked. We suggest that the possibility of such a theoretical link between a systems topology and the signals it produces could have major implications in our understanding of biological networks, such as the brain.",

    "abstract": "In episodic encoding, an unfolding experience is rapidly transformed into a memory representation that binds separate episodic elements into a memory form to be later recollected. However, it is unclear how brain activity changes over time to accommodate the encoding of incoming information. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of the representational format that contributed to memory formation of sequential episodes. We combined Representational Similarity Analysis and multivariate decoding approaches on EEG data to compare whether \"category-level\" or \"item-level\" representations supported memory formation during the online encoding of a picture triplet sequence and offline, in the period that immediately followed encoding. The findings revealed a gradual integration of category-level representation during the online encoding of the picture sequence and a rapid item-based neural reactivation of the encoded sequence at the episodic offset. However, we found that only memory reinstatement at episodic offset was associated with successful memory retrieval from long term memory. These results suggest that post-encoding memory reinstatement is crucial for the rapid formation of unique memory for episodes that unfold over time. Overall, the study sheds light on the dynamics of representational format changes that take place during the formation of episodic memories.",

    "abstract": "Cellular lineage tracking provides a means to observe population makeup at the clonal level, allowing exploration of heterogeneity, evolutionary and developmental processes and individual clones relative fitness. It has thus contributed significantly to understanding microbial evolution, organ differentiation and cancer heterogeneity, among others. Its use, however, is limited because existing methods are highly specific, expensive, labour-intensive, and, critically, do not allow the repetition of experiments. To address these issues, we developed gUMI-BEAR (genomic Unique Molecular Identifier Barcoded Enriched Associated Regions), a modular, cost-effective method for tracking populations at high resolution. We first demonstrate the systems application and resolution by applying it to track tens of thousands of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lineages growing together under varying environmental conditions applied across multiple generations, revealing fitness differences and lineage-specific adaptations. Then, we demonstrate how gUMI-BEAR can be used to perform parallel screening of a huge number of randomly generated variants of the Hsp82 gene. We further show how our method allows isolation of variants, even if their frequency in the population is low, thus enabling unsupervised identification of modifications that lead to a behaviour of interest.",

    "abstract": "Microbial plankton play a central role in marine biogeochemical cycles, but the timing in which abundant lineages diversified into ocean environments remains unclear. Here, we reconstructed the timeline in which major clades of bacteria and archaea colonized the ocean using a high-resolution benchmarked phylogenetic tree that allows for simultaneous and direct comparison of the ages of multiple divergent lineages. Our findings show that the diversification of the most prevalent marine clades spans throughout a period of 2.2 Ga, with most clades colonizing the ocean during the last 800 million years. The oldest clades - SAR202, SAR324, Ca. Marinimicrobia, and Marine Group II - diversified around the time of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), during which oxygen concentration increased but remained at microaerophilic levels throughout the Mid-Proterozoic, consistent with the prevalence of some clades within these groups in oxygen minimum zones today. We found the diversification of the prevalent heterotrophic marine clades SAR11, SAR116, SAR92, SAR86, and Roseobacter as well as the Marine Group I, to occur near to the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (0.8-0.4 Ga). The diversification of these clades is concomitant with an overall increase of oxygen and nutrients in the ocean at this time, as well as the diversification of eukaryotic algae, consistent with the previous hypothesis that the diversification of heterotrophic bacteria is linked to the emergence of large eukaryotic phytoplankton. The youngest clades correspond to the widespread phototrophic clades Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and Crocosphaera, whose diversification happened after the Phanerozoic Oxidation Event (0.45-0.4 Ga), in which oxygen concentrations had already reached their modern levels in the atmosphere and the ocean. Our work clarifies the timing at which abundant lineages of bacteria and archaea colonized the ocean, thereby providing key insights into the evolutionary history of lineages that comprise the majority of prokaryotic biomass in the modern ocean.",

    "abstract": "Among the numerous questions about human impacts on ecosystems, there is a growing interest for acoustic pollution. First studies on underwater acoustic pollution focused, and showed effects, on vertebrates behaviours. Knowledge on the effects on invertebrates is more limited and there is a huge lack concerning zooplankton species, although widely used as bioindicators in chemical pollution. Consequently, it is critical to assess the impact of noise on zooplanktons fitness (survival and fecundity). Here, isolated water fleas, Daphnia magna, were reared from birth to death in the presence or absence of motorboat noises. Effects on lifespan and clonal offspring production (e.g., clutch size, number of offspring produced along life) were assessed and chronic exposure to boat noise did not affect Daphnias fitness. The spectral and temporal features of the sounds could explain the results. This study highlights the importance of integrating noise pollution into ecotoxicological research to understand, and prevent, human impacts on communities.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that seaweed farming contributes to carbon burial below the farms was tested by quantifying burial rates in 20 seaweed farms distributed globally, ranging from 2 to 300 years in operation and from 1 ha to 15,000 ha in size. This involved combining analyses of organic carbon density with sediment accumulation rate in sediments below seaweed farms relative to reference sediments beyond the farm and/or prior to the farm operation. One in every four farms sampled was set over environments that export, rather than retain materials. For the farms that were placed over depositional environments, where sediment accumulation could be quantified, the thickness of sediment layers and stocks of carbon accumulated below the farms increased with farm age, reaching 140 ton C ha-1 for the oldest farm, and tended to exceed those in reference sediments beyond the farm and/or prior to the operation of the farms. Organic carbon burial rates in the farm sediments averaged ({+/-} SE) 1.87 {+/-} 0.73 ton CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) ha-1 year-1 (median 0.83, range 0.10 - 8.99 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1), twice the average ({+/-} SE) burial rate in reference sediments (0.90 {+/-} 0.27, median 0.64, range 0.10-3.00 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1), so that the excess organic carbon burial attributable to the seaweed farms averaged 1.06 {+/-} 0.74 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1 (median 0.09, range -0.13-8.10 ton CO2-eq ha-1 year-1). This first direct quantification of carbon burial in sediments below seaweed farms confirms that, when placed over depositional environments, seaweed farming tend to sequester carbon in the underlying sediments, but do so at widely variable rates, increasing with farm yield.",

    "abstract": "Recent adaptive radiations provide evolutionary case studies which can be parsed to reveal the relationship between genomic variation and the origins of distinct phenotypes. Sympatric radiations of the charr complex (genus Salvelinus) present a trove for comparative genomics as charrs have repeatedly diversified into multiple morphs with distinct feeding specializations. However, stereotypical species flocks are assemblages of only two to three lineages. However, a species flock of Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) in Lake Kronotskoe contains at least seven lineages, each with defining morphological and ecological traits. This is the most extensive radiation described for the genus. Here, we perform the first genome-wide analysis of this species flock to parse the genetic foundations of adaptive change. Our data support distinct, reproductively isolated lineages with little hybridization. We also find that specific selection on thyroid and craniofacial genes forms a shared basis for the radiation. The data also implicate thyroid signaling in subsequent lineage specification. These results delineate a clear genetic basis for the diversification of specialized lineages, and highlight the role of developmental mechanisms in shaping the forms generated during adaptive radiation.",

    "abstract": "Phyllachora maydis is a fungal pathogen causing tar spot of corn (Zea mays L.), a new and emerging, yield-limiting disease in the United States. Since being first reported in Illinois and Indiana in 2015, P. maydis can now be found across much of the corn growing of the United States. Knowledge of the epidemiology of P. maydis is limited but could be useful in developing tar spot prediction tools. The research presented here aims to elucidate the environmental conditions necessary for the development of tar spot in the field and the creation of predictive models to anticipate future tar spot epidemics. Extended periods (30-day windowpanes) of moderate ambient temperature were most significant for explaining the development of tar spot. Shorter periods (14- to 21-day windowpanes) of moisture (relative humidity, dew point, number of hours with predicted leaf wetness) were negatively correlated with tar spot development. These weather variables were used to develop multiple logistic regression models, an ensembled model, and two machine learning models for the prediction of tar spot development. This work has improved the understanding of P. maydis epidemiology and provided the foundation for the development of a predictive tool for anticipating future tar spot epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin (ART) is a quick-killing and effective antimalarial activated by the haem derived from haemoglobin digestion. Mutations in the parasites Kelch 13 (K13) protein compromise the efficacy of this drug. Recent studies indicate an undefined role for K13 in haemoglobin uptake. Here, we show that K13 is associated with the collar that constricts cytostomal invaginations required for the parasite to ingest host cytosol. Induced mislocalisation of K13 led to the formation of atypical invaginations lacking the cytostomal ring and constricted neck normally associated with cytostomes. Moreover, the levels of haemoglobin degradation products, haem and haemozoin, are decreased when K13 is inactivated. Our findings demonstrate that K13 is required for normal formation and/or stabilisation of the cytostome, and thereby the parasites uptake of haemoglobin. This is consistent with perturbation of K13 function leading to decreased activation of ART and consequently, reduced killing.\n\nSignificance StatementArtemisinin-resistant parasites contain mutations in the gene encoding the Kelch 13 protein (K13). How K13 mutations result in artemisinin resistance is unclear. Here, we present evidence that normal K13 is required for the formation of the cytostome, a specialised parasite feeding apparatus used to endocytose host cell haemoglobin. Our results suggest that artemisinin resistance is due to a decrease in artemisinin activation brought about by a decrease in efficiency of haemoglobin uptake and consequently reduced production of haem.",

No decrease in gene drive homing was seen despite target site heterology, demonstrating the applicability of gene drives to wild populations.",

    "abstract": "The cultivation of transplanted rice has led to depletion of groundwater levels in many parts of the world. Direct-seeded rice under aerobic conditions is an alternative production technology that requires much less water. However, under aerobic conditions, iron in the soil is oxidized from ferric to ferrous, which is not easily available for rice, resulting in iron deficiency-induced chlorosis (IDIC) and a drastic reduction in seed yield. Cultivated rice genotypes have limited variations for IDIC tolerance, therefore, wild Oryza germplasm could be a better source for IDIC tolerance. In this study, 313 Oryza accessions were evaluated for IDIC tolerance at the tillering stage under aerobic conditions using IDIC rating, SPAD value, and iron content in leaves. Based on these parameters, twenty IDIC tolerant lines were selected. These 20 lines exhibited no chlorosis, high SPAD values, and iron content, while 8 cultivated controls showed mild to high chlorosis symptoms and low SPAD and iron content. In a subsequent year, the selected lines were evaluated again to confirm their tolerance, and they exhibited similar levels of tolerance. These accessions may be useful for developing IDIC-tolerant cultivars for aerobic rice cultivation, and future study to understand the molecular mechanism of IDIC tolerance in rice.",

The timing, duration and architectural characteristics of inflorescence growth are crucial for optimising crop productivity and have been targets of selection during domestication. We report a robust and versatile procedure for computationally assessing environmentally-responsive flowering dynamics. In the oilseed crop, Brassica napus, there is wide variation in flowering response to winter cold (vernalization). We subjected a diverse set of B. napus accessions to different vernalization temperatures and monitored shoot responses using automated image acquisition. We developed methods to computationally infer multiple aspects of flowering from this dynamic data, enabling characterisation of speed, duration and peaks of inflorescence development across different crop types. We input these multiple traits to genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies, and identified potentially causative variation in a priori phenology genes (including EARLY FLOWERING3) for known traits and in uncharacterised genes for computed traits. These results could be used in marker assisted breeding to design new ideotypes for improved yield and better adaptation to changing climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Protein complexes are vital to many biological processes and their understanding can lead to the development of new drugs and therapies. Although the structure of individual protein chains can now be predicted with high accuracy, determining the three-dimensional structure of a complex remains a challenge. Protein docking, the task of computationally determining the structure of a protein complex given the unbound structures of its components (and optionally binding site information), provides a way to predict protein complex structure. Traditional docking methods rely on empirical scoring functions and rigid body simulations to predict the binding poses of two or more proteins. However, they often make unrealistic assumptions about input structures, and are not effective at accommodating conformational flexibility or binding site information. In this work, we present DockGPT (Generative Protein Transformer for Docking), an end-to-end deep learning method for flexible and site-specific protein docking that allows conformational flexibility and can effectively make use of binding site information. Tested on multiple benchmarks with unbound and predicted monomer structures as input, we significantly outperform existing methods in both accuracy and running time. Our performance is especially pronounced for antibody-antigen complexes, where we predict binding poses with high accuracy even in the absence of binding site information. Finally, we highlight our methods generality by extending it to simultaneously dock and co-design the sequence and structure of antibody complementarity determining regions targeting a specified epitope.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful technique used to probe the local environment of fluorophores. The phasor approach to FLIM data is a fit-free analysis and is increasingly used due to its ease of interpretation. To date, no open-source graphical user interface (GUI) for phasor analysis of FLIM data is available thus limiting the widespread use of phasor analysis in biomedical research. Here we present (F)luorescence (L)ifetime (U)l(t)imate (E)xplorer (FLUTE), a Python GUI that is designed to fill this gap. FLUTE simplifies and automates many aspects of FLIM analysis, such as calibrating the FLIM data, performing interactive exploration of the phasor plot with cursors, displaying the phasor plot and the FLIM images with different lifetime contrasts and calculating the relative concentration of molecular species. The final edited datasets after applying the desired filters and thresholds can be exported for further user specific analysis. FLUTE was tested using several FLIM datasets including autofluorescence of Zebrafish embryos, cells in vitro and intact live tissues. In summary, our user-friendly GUI extends the advantages of phasor plotting by making the data visualization and analysis easy and interactive, allows for analysis of large FLIM datasets and accelerates FLIM analysis for non-specialized labs.\n\nImpact statementThis work introduces the first open-source graphical user interface (GUI) for phasor analysis of Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy (FLIM) data. Phasor analysis is increasingly used for FLIM data analysis in biomedical research as it reduces the complexity of the analysis and provides a powerful visualization of the data content and optimization of data handling with respect to multiexponential fitting. However, the development of quantitative FLIM applications in the life sciences has been until now hampered by the lack of an open source and user-friendly graphical user interface. Here we introduce FLUTE that expands some possibilities of phasor FLIM image processing, accelerates the whole FLIM analysis and simplifies the visualization and the analysis of FLIM data, thus making phasor analysis possible for a broader base of researchers. FLUTE will be of interest to researchers with interests ranging from physics to biology and will facilitate research in several biomedical fields.",

    "abstract": "While predicting a new ligand to bind to a protein is possible with current methods, the converse of predicting a receptor for a ligand is highly challenging, except for very closely-related known protein-ligand complexes. Predicting a receptor for any given ligand will be path-breaking in understanding protein function, mapping sequence-structure-function relationships and for several aspects of drug discovery including studying the mechanism of action of phenotypically discovered drugs, off-target effects and drug repurposing. We use a novel approach for predicting receptors for a given ligand through de novo design combined with structural bioinformatics. We have developed a new algorithm CRD, that has multiple modules which combines fragment-based sub-site finding, a machine learning function to estimate the size of the site, a genetic algorithm that encodes knowledge on protein structures and a physics-based fitness scoring scheme. CRD has a pseudo-receptor design component followed by a mapping component to identify possible proteins that house the site. CRD is designed to cater to ligands with known and unknown complexes. CRD accurately recovers sites and receptors for several known natural ligands including ATP, SAM, Glucose and FAD. It designs similar sites for similar ligands, yet to some extent distinguishes between closely related ligands. More importantly CRD correctly predicts receptor classes for several drugs such as penicillins and NSAIDs. We expect CRD to be a valuable tool in fundamental biology research as well as in the drug discovery and biotechnology industry.",

    "abstract": "The majority of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies filter and analyse neural signals in specific frequency ranges, known as \"canonical\" frequency bands. However, this segmentation, is not exempt from limitations, mainly due to the lack of adaptation to the neural idiosyncrasies of each individual. In this study, we introduce a new data-driven method to automatically identify frequency ranges based on the topological similarity of the frequency-dependent functional neural network. The resting-state neural activity of 195 cognitively healthy subjects from three different databases (MEG: 123 subjects; EEG1: 27 subjects; EEG2: 45 subjects) was analysed. In a first step, MEG and EEG signals were filtered with a narrow-band filter bank (1 Hz bandwidth) from 1 to 70 Hz with a 0.5 Hz step. Next, the connectivity in each of these filtered signals was estimated using the orthogonalized version of the amplitude envelope correlation to obtain the frequency-dependent functional neural network. Finally, a community detection algorithm was used to identify communities in the frequency domain showing a similar network topology. We have called this approach the \"Connectivity-based Meta-Bands\" (CMB) algorithm. Additionally, two types of synthetic signals were used to configure the hyper-parameters of the CMB algorithm. We observed that the classical approaches to band segmentation reflect the underlying network topologies at group level for the MEG signals, but they fail to adapt to the individual differentiating patterns revealed by our methodology. On the other hand, the sensitivity of EEG signals to reflect this underlying frequency-dependent network structure is limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that proposes an unsupervised band segmentation method based on the topological similarity of functional neural network across frequencies. This methodology fully accounts for subject-specific patterns, providing more robust and personalized analyses, and paving the way for new studies focused on exploring the frequency-dependent structure of brain connectivity.",

There are different methods of building pangenome graphs, but few tools are available to visualize them. To address this problem, we developed PanGraphViewer, which is written in Python 3 and runs on all major operating systems. The PanGraphViewer package contains two separate versions: a desktop-based application and a web-based application. Compared to other graph viewers that are initially designed to visualize individual genome graphs, PanGraphViewer targets pangenome graphs and allows the viewing of pangenome graphs built from multiple genomes in either the (reference) graphical fragment assembly format or the variant call format (VCF). Apart from visualization of different types of structural variations (SV), PanGraphViewer also integrates genome annotations with graph nodes to analyze insertions or deletions in a particular gene model. The graph node shapes in PanGraphViewer can represent different types of genomic variations when a VCF file is used. Notably, PanGraphViewer displays subgraphs from a chromosome or sequence segment based on any given coordinates. This function is absent from most genome graph viewers.

    "abstract": "MotivationThe search for conserved motifs in DNA sequences is an important problem in bioinformatics. The growing availability of large-scale genomic data poses significant challenges for computational biology, particularly in terms of efficiency in analysis, kmer identification, and noise presence. The detection of conserved motifs and patterns in DNA sequences is crucial for understanding gene functions and regulations. Therefore, it is essential to develop a data structure that can handle these large volumes of information and provide accurate and fast results.\n\nResultsWe present SMT, an innovative tool designed to efficiently store and count kmers, optimizing memory usage and computation time. The application of SMT has also proven effective in discovering motifs in noisy datasets, allowing the identification of conserved regions in sequences. Furthermore, SMT enables exact searches in constant time and recovers the most abundant k-mers, as well as performs approximate searches in linear time to find fragments with up to d mutations. This approach facilitates large-scale data analysis and provides important insights into the conserved properties of biological sequences. The application of SMT in motif discovery demonstrates its potential to drive research in bioinformatics and genomics.

    "abstract": "SummaryPangenomes are replacing single reference genomes as the definitive representation of DNA sequence within a species or clade. Pangenome analysis predominantly leverages graph-based methods that require computationally intensive multiple genome alignments, do not scale to highly complex eukaryotic genomes, limit their scope to identifying structural variants (SVs), or incur bias by relying on a reference genome. Here, we present PanKmer, a toolkit designed for reference-free analysis of pangenome datasets consisting of dozens to thou-sands of individual genomes. PanKmer decomposes a set of input genomes into a table of observed k-mers and their presence-absence values in each genome. These are stored in an efficient k-mer index data format that encodes SNPs, INDELs, and SVs. It also includes functions for downstream analysis of the k-mer index, such as calculating sequence similarity statistics between individuals at whole-genome or local scales. For example, k-mers can be \"anchored\" in any individual genome to quantify sequence variability or conservation at a specific locus. This facilitates workflows with various biological applications, e.g. identifying cases of hybridization between plant species. PanKmer provides researchers with a valuable and convenient means to explore the full scope of genetic variation in a population, without reference bias.\n\nAvailability and implementationPanKmer is implemented as a Python package with components written in Rust, released under a BSD license.

This goal requires an increase in the chloroplast compartment of bundle sheath cells in C3 species. To facilitate large-scale testing of candidate regulators of chloroplast development in the rice bundle sheath, a simple and robust method to phenotype this tissue in C3 species is required.\n\nResultsWe established a leaf ablation method to accelerate phenotyping of rice bundle sheath cells. The approach allowed bundle sheath cell dimensions, chloroplast area and chloroplast number per cell to be measured. Using this method, bundle sheath cell dimensions of maize were also measured and compared with rice. Our data show that bundle sheath width but not length significantly differed between C3 rice and C4 maize. Comparison of paradermal versus transverse bundle sheath cell width indicated that bundle sheath cells were intact after leaf ablation. Moreover, comparisons of planar chloroplast areas and chloroplast numbers per bundle sheath cell between wild-type and transgenic rice lines expressing the maize GOLDEN-2 (ZmG2) showed that the leaf ablation method allowed differences in chloroplast parameters to be detected.\n\nConclusionsLeaf ablation is a simple approach to accessing bundle sheath cell files in C3 species. We show that this method is suitable for obtaining parameters associated with bundle sheath cell size, chloroplast area and chloroplast number per cell.",

The gravity sensing mechanism has long been considered a mechanosensing process by which amyloplasts transmit forces to intracellular structures, but the molecular support has not been reported. This study revealed that LAZY1-LIKE family proteins involved in gravity signaling in statocytes are localized to the amyloplast periphery and its proximal plasma membrane, resulting in polar localization according to the direction of gravity. We propose a gravity sensing mechanism by which LZY transmits the positional information of amyloplasts, i.e., the direction of gravity, by translocating to the plasma membrane.",

We identified 14 distinct alloreactive B cell lineages, which spanned the rejected organ and blood and expressed high-affinity anti-donor HLA-specific B cell receptors - many of which were clonally linked to circulating DSA. The alloreactive B cell response was focused on exposed, solvent-accessible mismatched HLA residues, while also demonstrating extensive contacts with self-HLA residues. Consistent with structural evidence of self-recognition, measurable self-reactivity by donor-specific B cells was common and positively correlated with anti-donor affinity maturation. Thus, allo- and self-reactive signatures appeared to converge, suggesting that during AMR, the recognition of non-self and breaches of tolerance conspire to produce a pathogenic donor-specific adaptive response.",

As a test case, we apply this approach to identify novel antagonists of the human adenosine transmembrane receptor type 2A, an attractive target against Parkinsons disease and cancer. The identified antagonists were tested here in a radioligand binding assay. Among those, we found a promising ligand whose chemotype differs significantly from all so-far reported antagonists, with a binding affinity of 310{+/-}23.4 nM.

    "abstract": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are critical components of the adaptive immune system, and machine learning methods were proposed to analyze the TCR repertoire data. However, most methods work solely on the hypervariable CDR3 regions of TCRs, overlooking the information encoded in other domains. Representing full TCRs as informative vectors can be indispensable for developing reliable and effective machine learning models. We introduce TCR2vec, a deep representation learning framework with 12 layers of transformer blocks, to pave the way for downstream modelings of full TCRs. Together with masked language modeling (MLM), we propose a novel pretraining task named similarity preservation modeling (SPM) to capture the sequence similarities of TCRs. Through a multi-task pretraining procedure on MLM and SPM, TCR2vec learns a contextual understanding of TCRs within a similarity-preserved vector space. We first verify the effectiveness of TCR2vec in predicting TCRs binding specificity and TCR clustering through comparison with three other embedding approaches. TCR2vec can be finetuned on small task-specific labeled data for enhanced performance, which outperforms state-of-the-art models by 2-25% in predicting TCRs binding specificity. Next, we compare the performance of two versions of TCR2vec pretrained on full TCRs (TCR2vec) or CDR3s (CDR3vec) and demonstrate that TCR2vec consistently outperforms CDR3vec by 12-14%. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that residues outside CDR3 also make notable contributions to the recognition of antigens.

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectiveGenetic markers (especially short tandem repeats or STRs) located on the X chromosome are a valuable resource to solve complex kinship cases in forensic genetics in addition or alternatively to autosomal STRs. Groups of tightly linked markers are combined into haplotypes, thus increasing the discriminating power of tests. However, this approach requires precise knowledge of the recombination rates between adjacent markers.\n\nRecombination rates vary across the human genome and cannot be automatically derived from linkage physical maps. The International Society of Forensic Genetics recommends that recombination rate estimation on the X chromosome is performed from pedigree genetic data while taking into account the confounding effect of mutations. However, the only existing implementations that satisfy these requirements have several drawbacks: they were never publicly released, they are very slow and/or need cluster-level hardware and strong computational expertise to use.\n\nIn order to address these key concerns, we developed Recombulator-X, a new open-source Python tool.\n\nMethodsThe most challenging issue, namely the running time, was addressed with dynamic programming techniques to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, coupled with JIT compilation to further increase performance. We also extended the statistical framework from STR to any polymorphic marker.\n\nResultsCompared to the previous methods, Recombulator-X reduces the estimation times from weeks or months to less than one hour for typical datasets. Moreover, the estimation process, including preprocessing, has been streamlined and packaged into a simple command-line tool that can be run on a normal PC.\n\nWhere previous approaches were limited to small panels of STR markers (up to 15), our tool can handle greater numbers (up to 100) of mixed STR and non-STR markers.\n\nConclusionsIn the genetic forensic community, state-of-the-art estimation methods for X chromosome recombination rates have seen limited usage due to the technical hurdles posed by previous implementations. Recombulator-X makes the process much simpler, faster and accessible to researchers without a computational background, hopefully spurring increased adoption of best practices. Moreover, it extends the estimation framework to larger panels of genetic markers (not only STRs), allowing analyses of sequencing-based data.",

    "abstract": "Integration of multi-omics data holds great promise for understanding the complex biology of diseases, particularly Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and cancer. However, the integration is challenging due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. Traditional machine learning methods are not well-suited for handling the complex relationships between different types of omics data. Many models were proposed that utilize graph-based learning models to extract hidden representations and network structures from different omics data to enhance cancer prediction, patient categorization, etc. The existing graph neural network-based (GNN-based) multi-omics approaches for cancer subtype prediction have three shortcomings: (a) Do not consider all types of omics data, (b) Fail to determine the relative significance of the neighboring nodes (in this case, samples or patients) when it comes to downstream analyses, such as subtype classification, patient stratification, etc., and (c) Use the same approach for generating initial graphs for different omics data. To overcome these shortcomings, we present MOGAT, a novel multi-omics integration approach, leveraging a graph attention network (GAT) model that incorporates graph-based learning with an attention mechanism. MOGAT utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism that can more efficiently extract information for a specific sample by assigning unique attention coefficients to its neighboring samples. To evaluate the performance of MOGAT, we explored its capability via a case study of predicting breast cancer subtypes. Our results showed that MOGAT performs better than the state-of-the-art multi-omics integration approaches.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing technologies allow one to probe expression and chromatin accessibility states as a proxy for cellular phenotypes at the resolution of individual cells. A key challenge of cancer research is to consistently map such states on genetic clones, within an evolutionary framework. To this end we introduce CONGAS+, a Bayesian model to map single-cell RNA and ATAC profiles generated from independent or multimodal assays on the latent space of copy numbers clones. CONGAS+ can detect tumour subclones associated with aneuploidy by clustering cells with the same ploidy profile. The framework is implemented in a probabilistic language that can scale to analyse thousands of cells thanks to GPU deployment. Our tool exhibits robust performance on simulations and real data, highlighting the advantage of detecting aneuploidy from two distinct molecules as opposed to other single-molecule models, and also leveraging real multi-omic data. In the application to prostate cancer, lymphoma and basal cell carcinoma, CONGAS+ did retrieve complex subclonal architectures while providing a coherent mapping among ATAC and RNA, facilitating the study of genotype-phenotype mapping, and their relation to tumour aneuploidy.\n\nAuthor summaryAneuploidy is a condition caused by copy number alterations (CNAs), which brings cells to acquire or lose chromosomes. In the context of cancer progression and treatment response, aneuploidy is a key factor driving cancer clonal dynamics, and measuring CNAs from modern sequencing assays is therefore important. In this framing, we approach this problem from new single-cell assays that measure both chromatin accessibility and RNA transcripts. We model the relation between single-cell data and CNAs and, thanks to a sophisticated Bayesian model, we are capable of determining tumour clones from clusters of cells with the same copy numbers. Our model works when input cells are sequenced independently for both assays, or even when modern multi-omics protocols are used. By linking aneuploidy to gene expression and chromatin conformation, our new approach provides a novel way to map complex genotypes with phenotype-level information, one of the missing factors to understand the molecular basis of cancer heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Discovering the entire list of human ciliary genes would help in the diagnosis of cilia-related human disorders known as ciliopathy, but at present the genetic diagnosis of many ciliopathies (over 30%) is far from complete (Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2015; Knopp et al., 2015; Paff et al., 2018). In a theory, many independent approaches may uncover the whole list of ciliary genes, but 30% of the genes on the ciliary gene list are still ciliary candidate genes (van Dam et al., 2019; Vasquez et al., 2021). All of these cutting-edge techniques, however, have relied on a different single strategy to discover ciliary candidate genes. Because different methodologies demonstrated distinct capabilities with varying quality, categorizing the ciliary candidate genes in the ciliary gene list without further evidence has been difficult. Here, we present a method for predicting ciliary capacity of each human gene that incorporates diverse methodologies (single-cell RNA sequencing, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), comparative genomics, transcription factor (TF)-network analysis, and text mining). By integrating multiple approaches, we reveal previously undiscovered ciliary genes. Our method, CilioGenics, outperforms other approaches that are dependent on a single method. Our top 500 gene list contains 256 new candidate ciliary genes, with 31 experimentally validated. Our work suggests that combining several techniques can give useful evidence for predicting the ciliary capability of all human genes.",

    "abstract": "Type 9 secretion system (T9SS) is one of the least characterized secretion systems exclusively found in the Bacteroidetes phylum which comprise various environmental and economically relevant bacteria. While T9SS plays a central role in bacterial movement termed gliding motility, survival and pathogenicity, there is an unmet need for a comprehensive tool that predicts T9SS, gliding motility and proteins secreted via T9SS. In this study, we develop such a computational tool, Type 9 secretion system and Gliding motility Prediction (T9GPred). To build this tool, we manually curated published experimental evidence and identified mandatory components for T9SS and gliding motility prediction. We also compiled experimentally characterized proteins secreted via T9SS and determined the presence of three unique types of C-terminal domain signals, and these insights were leveraged to predict proteins secreted via T9SS. Notably, using recently published experimental evidence, we show that T9GPred has high predictive power. Thus, we used T9GPred to predict the presence of T9SS, gliding motility and associated secreted proteins across 693 completely sequenced Bacteroidetes strains. T9GPred predicted 402 strains to have T9SS, of which 327 strains are also predicted to exhibit gliding motility. Further, T9GPred also predicted putative secreted proteins for the 402 strains. In a nutshell, T9GPred is a novel computational tool for systems-level prediction of T9SS and streamlining future experimentation.

    "abstract": "MotivationT-cell receptors (TCR) on T cells recognize and bind to epitopes presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in case of an infection or cancer. However, the high diversity of TCRs, as well as their unique and complex binding mechanisms underlying epitope recognition, make it difficult to predict the binding between TCR and epitope. Here, we present the utility of transformers, a deep learning strategy that incorporates an attention mechanism that learns the informative features, and show that these models pretrained on a large set of protein sequences outperform current strategies.\n\nMethodWe compared three pre-trained auto-encoder transformer models (ProtBERT, ProtAlbert, ProtElectra) and one pre-trained auto-regressive transformer model (ProtXLNet) to predict the binding specificity of TCRs to 25 epitopes from the VDJdb database (human and murine). Two additional modifications were performed to incorporate gene usage of the TCRs in the four transformer models.\n\nResultsOf all 12 transformer implementations (4 models with 3 different modifications), a modified version of the ProtXLNet model could predict TCR-epitope pairs with the highest accuracy (weighted F1 score 0.55 simultaneously considering all 25 epitopes). The modification included additional features representing the gene names for the TCRs. We also showed that the basic implementation of transformers outperformed the previously available methods, i.e. TCRGP, TCRDist and DeepTCR, developed for the same biological problem, especially for the hard-to-classify labels.\n\nConclusionWe show that the proficiency of transformers in attention learning can indeed be made operational in a complex biological setting like TCR binding prediction. Further ingenuity in utilizing the full potential of transformers, either through attention head visualization or introducing additional features, can further extend T-cell research avenues.\n\nAvailabilityData and code are available on https://github.com/InduKhatri/tcrformer",

Inclusion of management and environmental factors enables in silico studies to predict the effect of specific management interventions or future climates. Despite the value such models would confer, much work remains to improve the accuracy of phenotypic predictions. Rather than advocate for a single specific modeling strategy, here we demonstrate within large multi-environment and multi-genotype maize trials that combining predictions from disparate models using simple ensemble approaches most often results in better accuracy than using any one of the models on their own. We investigated various ensemble combinations of different model types, model numbers, and model weighting schemes to determine the accuracy of each.\n\nWe find that ensembling generally improves performance even when combining only two models. The number and type of models included alter accuracy with improvements diminishing as the number of models included increases. Using a genetic algorithm to optimize ensemble composition reveals that, when weighted by the inverse of each models expected error, using combinations of best linear unbiased predictors, linear fixed effects models, deep learning models, and select machine learning models perform best on our datasets.",

    "abstract": "An organism continuously experiences shifts in biological states necessitating extensive rearrangement of physiology and molecular order of the cell. Here we model transitions between optimal growth conditions (homeostasis), fully induced pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and back in Arabidopsis thaliana, chronologically measuring changes in protein synthesis and degradation rates, transcript, protein and phytohormone abundance of 99 targets using qPCR and LC-MS parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Temporally changing synthesis and degradation rates were primary determinants of abundance, next to changes in mRNA levels, of tryptophan, glucosinolate (GS) biosynthesis and photosynthesis associated (PAP) proteins particularly in the earlier establisher phases but also in fully induced PTI. While transcripts returned to growth levels 3 to 16 hours post elicitation, protein levels remained at fully induced PTI levels up to 16 hours into the transitory phase back to optimal growth. A notable exception were polar auxin transporters PIN3 and PIN7 levels which decreased in PTI but quickly returned to initial homeostasis levels after transition, although global auxin levels only decreased by 20%. Tryptophan, GS and JA biosynthesis proteins all increased in abundance in the wild type and the myc234 mutant background linking induction of the tryptophan and GS biosynthesis pathways to flg22 treatment and PTI independent of MYC2 and homologs. PAPs abundance was depleted in fully induced PTI however not in the myc234 mutant linking this active immune response to these bHLH transcription factors. FERREDOXIN-NADP(+)-OXIDOREDUCTASE (FNR1) synthesis rates decreased while its degradation rate increased in the earlier PTI establisher phase. FNR1 is the penultimate protein in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and imparts electrons onto NADP+ however in its absence electrons are used for oxygen photoreduction and H2O2 production, an active defense compound. Thus FNR1 may be a molecular switch that switches photosystem activity between growth and defense under post-transcriptional control. The myc234 mutation generally led to delayed changes in transcript and protein abundance and also abolished IAA depletion. Protein turn-over rates of a set of PAPs were affected in the mutant suggesting a possible positive role of the transcription factors in controlling post-transcriptional regulatory processes in PTI induction.",

Further, the level of RD awareness among healthcare professionals, researchers, and general public is considerably low. As a result, many cases of RDs remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated. To frame policies regarding RDs, it is crucial to understand the current level of RD awareness among healthcare professional and researchers, as they are key stakeholders in diagnosis, treatment, policy making, and drug development. We conducted an exploratory survey to understand the current level of RD awareness among healthcare professionals and researchers based on identification of an RD, time for diagnosis, treatment options, and relationship with family history and geographic location. We noted that our respondents have considerably low level of RD awareness. They correctly identified the importance of family history but failed to realize the association with geographic location.

Sterol-containing chemical chimeras aimed at identifying new sterol binding proteins by targeted degradation, led to a significant reduction in Golgi-associated proteins. The degradation was found to occur at lysosomes, concomitant with changes in general protein glycosylation, indicating that the degradation of Golgi proteins was a downstream effect. By establishing a sterol transport protein biophysical assay panel, we discovered that the oxybipins potently inhibited OSBP, resulting in blockage of retrograde trafficking and attenuating Shiga toxin toxicity.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDetermining a proteins quaternary state, i.e. how many monomers assemble together to form the functioning unit, is a critical step in protein characterization, and deducing it is not trivial. Many proteins form multimers for their activity, and over 50% are estimated to naturally form homomultimers. Experimental quaternary state determination can be challenging and require extensive work. To complement these efforts, a number of computational tools have been developed for quaternary state prediction, often utilizing experimentally validated structural information. Recently, dramatic advances have been made in the field of deep learning for predicting protein structure and other characteristics. Protein language models that apply computational natural-language models to proteins successfully capture secondary structure, protein cell localization and other characteristics, from a single sequence. Here we hypothesize that information about the protein quaternary state may be contained within protein sequences as well, allowing us to benefit from these novel approaches in the context of quaternary state prediction.\n\nResultsWe generated embeddings for a large dataset of quaternary state labels, extracted from the curated QSbio dataset. We then trained a model for quaternary state classification and assessed it on a non-overlapping set of distinct folds (ECOD family level). Our model, named QUEEN (QUaternary state prediction using dEEp learNing), performs worse than approaches that include information from solved crystal structures. However, we show that it successfully learned to distinguish multimers from monomers, and that the specific quaternary state is predicted with moderate success, better than a simple model that transfers annotation based on sequence similarity. Our results demonstrate that complex, quaternary state related information is included in these embeddings.\n\nConclusionsQUEEN is the first to investigate the power of embeddings for the prediction of the quaternary state of proteins. As such, it lays out the strength as well as limitations of a sequence-based protein language model approach compared to structure-based approaches. Since it does not require any structural information and is fast, we anticipate that it will be of wide use both for in-depth investigation of specific systems, as well as for studies of large sets of protein sequences.

    "abstract": "Shoot growth angle is a fundamental determinant of plant form. In their later development, lateral branches maintain gravitropic setpoint angles (GSAs) in which growth is set and maintained relative to gravity. The typically non-vertical GSAs are the product of an auxin-dependent antigravitropic offset that counteracts underlying gravitropic response in the branch (Roychoudhry et al., 2013).

    "abstract": "Shoot growth angle is a fundamental determinant of plant form. In their later development, lateral branches maintain gravitropic setpoint angles (GSAs) in which growth is set and maintained relative to gravity. The typically non-vertical GSAs are the product of an auxin-dependent antigravitropic offset that counteracts underlying gravitropic response in the branch (Roychoudhry et al., 2013).

    "abstract": "Palytoxin (PTX) is a potent neurotoxin found in marine animals that can cause serious symptoms such as muscle contractions, haemolysis of red blood cells and potassium leakage. Despite years of research, very little is known about the mechanism of PTX. However, recent advances in the field of cryoEM, specifically the use of microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), have allowed us to determine the structure of PTX. It was discovered that PTX folds into a hairpin motif and is able to bind to the extracellular gate of Na,K-ATPase, which is responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. These findings, along with molecular docking simulations, have provided important insights into the mechanism of PTX and can potentially aid in the development of molecular agents for treating cases of PTX exposure.",

    "abstract": "The phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins is emerging as an important mechanism for cellular organization. However, efforts to connect protein sequences to the physical properties of condensates, i.e., the molecular grammar, are hampered by a lack of effective approaches for probing high-resolution structural details. Using a combination of multiscale simulations and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy experiments, we systematically explored a series of systems consisting of diblock elastin-like polypeptides (ELP). The simulations succeeded in reproducing the variation of condensate stability upon amino acid substitution and revealed different microenvi-ronments within a single condensate, which we verified with environmentally sensitive fluorophores. The interspersion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues and a lack of secondary structure formation result in a frustrated microphase separation, which explains both the strong correlation between ELP condensate stability and interfacial hydrophobicity scales, as well as the prevalence of protein-water hydrogen bonds. Our study uncovers new mechanisms for condensate stability and organization that may be broadly applicable.",

    "abstract": "Anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-XL promote cell survival by sequestering pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, an activity that frequently contributes to tumorigenesis. Thus, the development of small-molecule inhibitors for anti-apoptotic proteins, termed BH3-mimetics, is revolutionizing how we treat cancer. BH3 mimetics kill cells by displacing sequestered pro-apoptotic proteins to initiate tumor-cell death. Recent evidence has demonstrated that in live cells the BH3-only proteins PUMA and BIM resist displacement by BH3-mimetics, while others like tBID do not. Analysis of the molecular mechanism by which PUMA resists BH3-mimetic mediated displacement from full-length anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-XL, BCL-2, BCL-W and MCL-1) reveals that both the BH3-motif and a novel binding site within the carboxyl-terminal sequence (CTS) of PUMA contribute to binding. Together these sequences bind to anti-apoptotic proteins, which effectively \"double-bolt locks\" the proteins to resist BH3-mimetic displacement. The pro-apoptotic protein BIM has also been shown to double-bolt lock to anti-apoptotic proteins however, the novel binding sequence in PUMA is unrelated to that in the CTS of BIM and functions independent of PUMA binding to membranes. Moreover, contrary to previous reports, we find that when exogenously expressed, the CTS of PUMA directs the protein primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rather than mitochondria and that residues I175 and P180 within the CTS are required for both ER localization and BH3-mimetic resistance. Understanding how PUMA resists BH3-mimetic displacement will be useful in designing more efficacious small-molecule inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins.",

Thus, iSN04 is expected to be a nucleic acid drug for the muscle wasting associated with chronic diseases. The present study investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism of iSN04 in the murine myoblast cell line C2C12. Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1) induced nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B), resulting in upregulated expression of TNF- and interleukin-6. Pre-treatment with iSN04 significantly suppressed these inflammatory responses by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of {beta}-catenin induced by TNF- or TLR ligands. These results demonstrate that antagonizing nucleolin with iSN04 downregulates the inflammatory effect mediated by the {beta}-catenin/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway in myoblasts. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of iSN04 were also observed in smooth muscle cells and pre-adipocytes, suggesting that iSN04 may be useful in preventing inflammation induced by metabolic disorders.",

Previously, we identified VDAC1, best known to regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics, to negatively regulate ciliogenesis. Here, we show that downregulation of VDAC1 in pancreatic cancer-derived Panc1 and glioblastoma-derived U-87 cells significantly increased ciliation. Those PCs were remarkably longer than the control cells. Such increased ciliation inhibited cell cycle, which contributed to reduced proliferation of these cells. VDAC1-depletion also led to longer PCs in quiescent RPE1 cells. Therefore, serum-induced PC disassembly was slower in VDAC1-depleted RPE1 cells. Overall, this study reiterates the importance of VDAC1 in modulating tumorigenesis, due to its novel role in regulating PC length and disassembly.",

    "abstract": "The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) is an essential GPCR in renal regulation of water homeostasis. Upon stimulation, the V2R activates Gs and Gq/11, which is followed by robust recruitment of {beta}-arrestins and receptor internalization into endosomes. Unlike canonical GPCR signaling, the {beta}-arrestin association with the V2R does not terminate Gs activation, and thus, Gs-mediated signaling is sustained while the receptor is internalized. Here, we demonstrate that this V2R ability to co-interact with G protein/{beta}-arrestin and promote endosomal G protein signaling is not restricted to Gs, but also involves Gq/11. Furthermore, our data implies that {beta}-arrestins potentiate Gs/Gq/11 activation at endosomes rather than terminating their signaling. Surprisingly, we found that the V2R internalizes and promote endosomal G protein activation independent of {beta}-arrestins to a minor degree. These new observations challenge the current model of endosomal GPCR signaling and suggest that this event can occur in both {beta}-arrestin-dependent and -independent manners.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe vasopressin type 2 receptor promotes dual Gs and Gq/11 signaling at early endosomes in {beta}-arrestin-dependent and -independent manners.",

    "abstract": "Amelogenesis, the formation of dental enamel, is driven by specialized epithelial cells called ameloblasts, which undergo successive stages of differentiation. Ameloblasts secrete enamel matrix proteins (EMPs), proteases, calcium, and phosphate ions in a stage-specific manner to form mature tooth enamel. Developmental defects in tooth enamel are common in humans, and they can greatly impact the well-being of affected individuals. Our understanding of amelogenesis and developmental pathologies is rooted in past studies using epithelial Cre driver and knockout alleles. However, the available mouse models are limited, as most do not allow targeting different ameloblast sub-populations, and constitutive loss of EMPs often results in severe phenotype in the mineral, making it difficult to interpret defect mechanisms. Herein, we report on the design and verification of a toolkit of twelve mouse alleles that include ameloblast-stage specific Cre recombinases, fluorescent reporter alleles, and conditional flox alleles for the major EMPs. We show how these models may be used for applications such as sorting of live stage specific ameloblasts, whole mount imaging, and experiments with incisor explants.

Many pathogenic NMDAR variants result in their protein misfolding, inefficient assembly, reduced surface expression, and impaired functionality at the plasma membrane, causing neurological disorders including epilepsy and intellectual disability. Here, we concentrate on the proteostasis maintenance of NMDARs containing epilepsy-associated variations in the GluN2A (or NR2A) subunit, including M705V and A727T. We showed that these two variants are targeted to the proteasome for degradation and have reduced functional surface expression. We demonstrated that the application of BIX, a known small molecule activator of an HSP70 family chaperone BiP (Binding immunoglobulin Protein) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), significantly increases total and surface protein levels, and thus the function of the M705V and A727T variants in HEK293T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that BIX promotes folding, inhibits degradation, and enhances anterograde trafficking of the M705V variant by modest activation of the IRE1 pathway of the unfolded protein response. Our results showed that adapting the ER proteostasis network restores the folding, trafficking, and function of pathogenic NMDAR variants, representing a potential treatment for neurological disorders resulting from NMDAR dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Oriented cell divisions produce different cell types and maintain tissue and organ patterning in plants; this is particularly true of the highly organized Arabidopsis root meristem. Because plant cells are encased by walls, the precise orientation of cell divisions is especially important for cell fate specification and tissue/organ organization. Mutant alleles of the transmembrane receptor kinase INFLORESCENCE AND ROOT APICES RECEPTOR KINASE (IRK) exhibit excess endodermal cell divisions, resulting in more cells in the radial axis of irk roots. IRK localizes to the outer polar domain of endodermal cells, which suggests directional signal perception is necessary to repress endodermal cell proliferation. Here, we conducted a detailed examination of endodermal cell divisions in irk and identified a distinct cell division orientation defect. Many excess endodermal divisions in irk-4 have outwardly skewed division planes, therefore we termed them  radial askew divisions. An IRK truncation lacking the kinase domain retains polar localization and rescues these radial askew divisions, but exhibits excess periclinal divisions, phenocopying the weaker irk-1 allele. These results expand IRKs function beyond repression of endodermal cell division activity showing its also required for division plane orientation. Based on its polarity, we propose that IRK at the outer lateral endodermal cell face interferes with division plane selection, maintenance, and/or cell plate attachment to influence endodermal cell division orientation.",

By using two CMT1A mouse models overexpressing human PMP22, we discovered that PMP22 dose-dependently downregulates genes that are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Lipidomic analysis on CMT1A mouse sciatic nerves confirmed lipid metabolic abnormalities primarily associated with cholesterol and sphingolipids. We observed similar lipidomic profiles and downregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism in human CMT1A patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Schwann cell precursors (iPSC-SCPs). We confirmed these findings by demonstrating altered lipid raft dynamics and plasma membrane fluidity in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Additionally, we identified impaired cholesterol incorporation in the plasma membrane due to altered lipid storage homeostasis in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs, which could be modulated by changing the lipid composition of the cell culture medium. These findings suggest that PMP22 plays a role in regulating the lipid composition of the plasma membrane and lipid storage homeostasis.

    "abstract": "Protein translation is essential for some forms of synaptic plasticity. We used nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSN), co-cultured with cortical neurons to restore excitatory synapses, to examine whether dopamine modulates protein translation in NAc MSN. FUNCAT was used to measure translation in MSNs under basal conditions and after disinhibiting excitatory transmission using the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (2 hr). Under basal conditions, translation was not altered by the D1-class receptor (D1R) agonist SKF81297 or the D2-class receptor (D2R) agonist quinpirole. Bicuculline alone robustly increased translation. This was reversed by quinpirole but not SKF81297. It was also reversed by co-incubation with the D1R antagonist SCH23390, but not the D2R antagonist eticlopride, suggesting dopaminergic tone at D1Rs. This was surprising because no dopamine neurons are present. An alternative explanation is that bicuculline activates translation by increasing glutamate tone at NMDA receptors (NMDAR) within D1R/NMDAR heteromers, which have been described in other cell types. Supporting this, immunocytochemistry and proximity ligation assays revealed D1/NMDAR heteromers on NAc cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further, bicucullines effect was reversed to the same extent by SCH23390 alone, the NMDAR antagonist APV alone, or SCH23390+APV. These results suggest that: 1) excitatory synaptic transmission stimulates translation in NAc MSNs, 2) this is opposed when glutamate activates D1R/NMDAR heteromers, even in the absence of dopamine, and 3) antagonist occupation of D1Rs within the heteromers prevents their activation. Our study is the first to suggest a role for D2 receptors and D1R/NMDAR heteromers in regulating protein translation.",

    "abstract": "The causal connectivity of a network is often inferred to understand the network function. It is arguably acknowledged that the inferred causal connectivity relies on the causality measure one applies, and it may differ from the networks underlying structural connectivity. However, the interpretation of causal connectivity remains to be fully clarified, in particular, how causal connectivity depends on causality measures and how causal connectivity relates to structural connectivity. Here, we focus on nonlinear networks with pulse signals as measured output, e.g., neural networks with spike output, and address the above issues based on four intensively utilized causality measures, i.e., time-delayed correlation coefficient, time-delayed mutual information, Granger causality, and transfer entropy. We theoretically show how these causality measures are related to one another when applied to pulse signals. Taking the simulated Hodgkin-Huxley neural network and the real mouse brain network as two illustrative examples, we further verify the quantitative relations among the four causality measures and demonstrate that the causal connectivity inferred by any of the four well coincides with the underlying network structural connectivity, therefore establishing a direct link between the causal and structural connectivity. We stress that the structural connectivity of networks can be reconstructed pairwise without conditioning on the global information of all other nodes in a network, thus circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our framework provides a practical and effective approach for pulse-output network reconstruction.\n\nSignificance StatementInferring network connectivity is a key challenge in many diverse scientific fields. We investigate networks with pulse signal as measured output and solve the above reverse-engineering issue by establishing a direct link between the networks causal connectivity and structural connectivity. Here, the causal connectivity can be inferred by any one of the four causality measures, i.e., time-delayed correlation coefficient, time-delayed mutual information, Granger causality, and transfer entropy. We analytically reveal the relationship among these four measures and show that they are equally effective to fully reconstruct the network connectivity pairwise. Our work provides a practical framework to reconstruct the structural connectivity in general pulse-output nonlinear networks or subnetworks.",

    "abstract": "The glymphatic system that clears out brain wastes, such as amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau, through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow may play an important role in aging and dementias. However, a lack of non-invasive tools to assess the glymphatic function in humans hindered the understanding of the glymphatic changes in healthy aging. The global infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) brain activity measured by the global mean resting-state fMRI signal (gBOLD) was recently found to be coupled by large CSF movements. This coupling has been used to measure the glymphatic process and found to correlate with various pathologies of Alzheimers disease (AD), including A{beta} pathology. Using resting-state fMRI data from a large group of 719 healthy aging participants, we examined the sex-specific changes of the gBOLD-CSF coupling, as a measure of glymphatic function, over a wide age range between 36-100 years old. We found that this coupling index remains stable before around age 55 and then starts to decline afterward, particularly in females. Menopause may contribute to the accelerated decline in females.",

However, the degree to which this form of long-range synchronization influences memory-guided choice remains unknown. Here, we developed a brain machine interface that initiated trials on T-maze tasks based on the magnitude of prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization, then measured choice outcomes. Strong prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony was found to bias correct choices on both working memory dependent and cued-response tasks. Prefrontal-thalamic neural interactions increased with prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony and optogenetic activation of the ventral midline thalamus entrained prefrontal neural activity and prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchrony. Together, our results show that prefrontal-hippocampal theta synchronization leads to correct choices and strengthens prefrontal-thalamic dialogue.

    "abstract": "IntroductionAntiretroviral treatment regimens can effectively control HIV replication and some aspects of disease progression. However, molecular events in end-organ diseases such as central nervous system (CNS) disease are not yet fully understood, and routine eradication of latent reservoirs is not yet in reach. Brain tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (bdEVs) act locally in the source tissue and may indicate molecular mechanisms in HIV CNS pathology. Regulatory RNAs from EVs have emerged as important participants in HIV disease pathogenesis. Using brain tissue and bdEVs from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV disease, we profiled messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), seeking to identify possible networks of RNA interaction in SIV infection and neuroinflammation.\n\nMethodsPostmortem occipital cortex tissue were collected from pigtailed macaques: uninfected controls and SIV-infected subjects (acute phase and chronic phase with or without CNS pathology). bdEVs were separated and characterized in accordance with international consensus standards. RNAs from bdEVs and source tissue were used for sequencing and qPCR to detect mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA levels\n\nResultsMultiple dysregulated bdEV RNAs, including mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs, were identified in acute infection and chronic infection with pathology. Most dysregulated mRNAs in bdEVs reflected dysregulation in their source tissues. These mRNAs are disproportionately involved in inflammation and immune responses, especially interferon pathways. For miRNAs, qPCR assays confirmed differential abundance of miR-19a-3p, let-7a-5p, and miR-29a-3p (acute SIV infection), and miR- 146a-5p and miR-449a-5p (chronic with pathology) in bdEVs. In addition, target prediction suggested that several circRNAs that were differentially abundant in source tissue might be responsible for specific differences in small RNA levels in bdEVs during SIV infection.\n\nConclusionsRNA profiling of bdEVs and source tissues reveals potential regulatory networks in SIV infection and SIV-related CNS pathology.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic heterogeneity is a hallmark of complex nervous systems that enables reliable and responsive communication in neural circuits. In this study, we investigated the contributions of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) to synaptic heterogeneity at two closely related Drosophila glutamatergic motor neurons, one low-and one high-Pr. We find that VGCC levels are highly predictive of heterogeneous release probability among individual active zones (AZs) of low-or high-Pr inputs, but not between neuronal subtypes. Underlying organizational differences in the AZ cytomatrix, VGCC composition, and a more compact arrangement of VGCCs alter the relationship between VGCC levels and Pr at AZs of low-vs. high-Pr inputs, explaining this apparent paradox. We further find that the CAST/ELKS AZ scaffolding protein Bruchpilot differentially regulates VGCC levels at low-and high-Pr AZs following acute glutamate receptor inhibition, indicating that synapse-specific organization also impacts adaptive plasticity. These findings reveal intersecting levels of molecular and spatial diversity with context-specific effects on heterogeneity in synaptic strength and plasticity.",

Its impact on neural function appears mild relative to its effects on other organs, but therapeutic advances have led to substantially increased life expectancy, necessitating deeper understanding of its impact on neurocognitive function. Behaviorally, some deficits in executive function have been noted in this population, but the underlying neural processes are not understood. Using standardized cognitive assessments and a Go/No-Go response inhibition task in conjunction with high-density electrophysiological recordings (EEG), we sought to investigate the behavioral and neural dynamics of inhibition of a prepotent response and of error monitoring (critical components of executive function) in individuals with cystinosis, when compared to age-matched controls. Thirty-seven individuals diagnosed with cystinosis (7-36 years old, 24 women) and 45 age-matched controls (27 women) participated in this study. Analyses focused on N2 and P3 No-Go responses and error-related positivity (Pe). Atypical inhibitory processing was shown behaviorally. Electrophysiological differences were additionally found between the groups, with individuals with cystinosis showing larger No-Go P3s. Error-monitoring was likewise different between the groups, with those with cystinosis showing reduced Pe amplitudes.",

This anatomical relationship positions the Re as an ideal candidate to facilitate memory consolidation. Evidence is, however, lacking whether this role extends beyond spatial memory and contextual fear memory, both of which are strongly associated with hippocampal function. We therefore trained intact male Long-Evans rats on an odour-trace-object paired-association task in which the explicit 10-second delay between paired items renders the task sensitive to hippocampal function. Neurons in the RE showed markedly increased immediate early gene (Zif268) activation when rats were re-tested for the previous non-spatial memory 25 days after acquisition training, relative to a group tested at 5-days post-acquisition, as well as a control group tested 25 days after acquisition but with a new pair of non-spatial stimuli, and home cage controls. The remote recall group also showed relatively augmented IEG expression in the superficial layers of the medial PFC (anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic cortex). These findings support the conclusion that the RE is preferentially engaged during remote recall in this non-spatial task and thus has a role beyond spatial memory and contextual fear memory.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, as therapeutic options for mitigating the long-term deficits precipitated by the event remain limited. Acute administration of the neuroendocrine modulator insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) attenuates ischemic stroke damage in preclinical models, and clinical studies suggest IGF-1 can reduce the risk of stroke and improve overall outcomes. The cellular mechanism by which IGF-1 exerts this protection is poorly defined, as all cells within the neurovascular unit express the IGF-1 receptor. We hypothesize that the functional regulation of both neurons and astrocytes by IGF-1 is critical in minimizing damage in ischemic stroke. To test this, we utilized inducible astrocyte-specific or neuron-specific transgenic mouse models to selectively reduce IGF-1R in the adult mouse brain prior to photothrombotic stroke. Acute changes in blood brain barrier permeability, microglial activation, systemic inflammation, and biochemical composition of the brain were assessed 3 hours following photothrombosis, and significant protection was observed in mice deficient in neuronal and astrocytic IGF-1R. When the extent of tissue damage and sensorimotor dysfunction was assessed for 3 days following stroke, only the neurological deficit score continued to show improvements, and the extent of improvement was enhanced with additional IGF-1 supplementation. Overall, results indicate that neuronal and astrocytic IGF-1 signaling influences stroke damage but IGF-1 signaling within these individual cell types is not required for minimizing tissue damage or behavioral outcome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTime series analysis is critical for understanding brain signals and their relationship to behavior and cognition. Cluster-based permutation tests (CBPT) are commonly used to analyze a variety of electrophysiological signals including EEG, MEG, ECoG, and sEEG data without a priori assumptions about specific temporal effects. However, two major limitations of CBPT include the inability to directly analyze experiments with multiple fixed effects and the inability to account for random effects (e.g. variability across subjects). Here, we propose a flexible multi-step hypothesis testing strategy using CBPT with Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMEs) and Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models (GLMEs) that can be applied to a wide range of experimental designs and data types.\n\nMethodsWe first evaluate the statistical robustness of LMEs and GLMEs using simulated data distributions. Second, we apply a multi-step hypothesis testing strategy to analyze ERPs and broadband power signals extracted from human ECoG recordings collected during a simple image viewing experiment with image category and novelty as fixed effects. Third, we assess the statistical power differences between analyzing signals with CBPT using LMEs compared to CBPT using separate t-tests run on each fixed effect through simulations that emulate broadband power signals. Finally, we apply CBPT using GLMEs to high-gamma burst data to demonstrate the extension of the proposed method to the analysis of nonlinear data.\n\nResultsFirst, we found that LMEs and GLMEs are robust statistical models. In simple simulations LMEs produced highly congruent results with other appropriately applied linear statistical models, but LMEs outperformed many linear statistical models in the analysis of \"suboptimal\" data and maintained power better than analyzing individual fixed effects with separate t-tests. GLMEs also performed similarly to other nonlinear statistical models. Second, in real world human ECoG data, LMEs performed at least as well as separate t-tests when applied to predefined time windows or when used in conjunction with CBPT. Additionally, fixed effects time courses extracted with CBPT using LMEs from group-level models of pseudo-populations replicated latency effects found in individual category-selective channels. Third, analysis of simulated broadband power signals demonstrated that CBPT using LMEs was superior to CBPT using separate t-tests in identifying time windows with significant fixed effects especially for small effect sizes. Lastly, the analysis of high-gamma burst data using CBPT with GLMEs produced results consistent with CBPT using LMEs applied to broadband power data.\n\nConclusionsWe propose a general approach for statistical analysis of electrophysiological data using CBPT in conjunction with LMEs and GLMEs. We demonstrate that this method is robust for experiments with multiple fixed effects and applicable to the analysis of linear and nonlinear data. Our methodology maximizes the statistical power available in a dataset across multiple experimental variables while accounting for hierarchical random effects and controlling FWER across fixed effects. This approach substantially improves power and accuracy leading to better reproducibility. Additionally, CBPT using LMEs and GLMEs can be used to analyze individual channels or pseudo-population data for the comparison of functional or anatomical groups of data.\n\nHighlights[bullet] Combining CBPT with GLMEs allows statistical analysis to match experimental design.\n[bullet]CBPT with GLMEs accounts for subject variability and hierarchical random effects.\n[bullet]The proposed method maintains control of type I error, type II error, and FWER.\n[bullet]CBPT with GLMEs can be applied to individual channels and pseudo-population data.",

    "abstract": "The gradual shifting of preferred neural spiking relative to local field potentials (LFPs), known as phase precession, plays a prominent role in neural coding. Correlations between the phase precession and behavior have been observed throughout various brain regions. As such, phase precession is suggested to be a global neural mechanism that promotes local neuroplasticity. However, causal evidence and neuroplastic mechanisms of phase precession are lacking so far. Here we show a causal link between LFP dynamics and phase precession. In three experiments, we modulated LFPs in humans, a non-human primate, and computational models using alternating current stimulation. We show that continuous stimulation of motor cortex oscillations in humans lead to a gradual phase shift of maximal corticospinal excitability by [~]90{degrees}. Further, exogenous alternating current stimulation induced phase precession in a subset of neurons ([~]17%) in the non-human primate. Multiscale modeling of realistic neural circuits suggests that alternating current stimulation-induced phase precession is driven by NMDA-mediated synaptic plasticity. Altogether, the three experiments provide mechanistic and causal evidence for phase precession as a global neocortical process. Alternating current-induced phase precession and consequently synaptic plasticity is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic neuromodulation methods.",

    "abstract": "Animals generate a wide range of highly coordinated motor outputs, which allows them to execute purposeful behaviors. Individual neuron classes in the circuits that generate behavior have a remarkable capacity for flexibility, as they exhibit multiple axonal projections, transmitter systems, and modes of neural activity. How these multi-functional properties of neurons enable the generation of highly coordinated behaviors remains unknown. Here we show that the HSN neuron in C. elegans evokes multiple motor programs over different timescales to enable a suite of behavioral changes during egg-laying. Using HSN activity perturbations and in vivo calcium imaging, we show that HSN acutely increases egg-laying and locomotion while also biasing the animals towards low-speed dwelling behavior over longer timescales. The acute effects of HSN on egg-laying and high-speed locomotion are mediated by separate sets of HSN transmitters and different HSN axonal projections. The long-lasting effects on dwelling are mediated by HSN release of serotonin that is taken up and re-released by NSM, another serotonergic neuron class that directly evokes dwelling. Our results show how the multi-functional properties of a single neuron allow it to induce a coordinated suite of behaviors and also reveal for the first time that neurons can borrow serotonin from one another to control behavior.",

Immunoproteasome activity is also associated with facilitating degradation of misfolded and oxidized proteins, which prevents cellular stress. While extensively studied during diseases with increasing evidence suggesting a role for the immunoproteasome during pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, this enzyme complex is believed to be mainly inactive in the healthy brain. Here, we show an age-dependent increase in polyubiquitination in the brain of wild-type mice, accompanied with induction of immunoproteasomes, which was most prominent in neurons and microglia. In contrast, mice completely lacking immunoproteasomes (triple-knockout (TKO) mice deficient for LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1), displayed a strong increase in polyubiquitinated proteins already in the young brain and developed spontaneous epileptic seizures, beginning at the age of 6 months. Injections of kainic acid led to high epilepsy-related mortality of aged TKO mice, confirming increased pathological hyperexcitability states. Notably, the expression of the immunoproteasome was reduced in the brains of patients suffering from epilepsy. In addition, aged TKO mice showed increased anxiety, tau hyperphosphorylation and degeneration of Purkinje cell population with the resulting ataxic symptoms and locomotion alterations.

    "abstract": "Exposing rats to repeated unpredictable stressors is a popular method for modelling depression. The sucrose preference test is used to assess the validity of this method, as it measures a rats preference for a sweet solution as an indicator of its ability to experience pleasure. Typically, if stressed rats show a lower preference compared to unstressed rats, it is concluded they are experiencing stress-induced anhedonia. While conducting a systematic review, we identified 18 studies that used thresholds to define anhedonia and to distinguish \"susceptible\" from \"resilient\" individuals. Based on their definitions, researchers either excluded \"resilient\" animals from further analyses or treated them as a separate cohort. We performed a descriptive analysis to understand the rationale behind these criteria, and found that the methods used for characterizing the stressed rats were largely unsupported. Many authors failed to justify their choices or relied exclusively on referencing previous studies. When tracing back the method to its origins, we converged on a pioneering article that, although employed as a universal evidence-based justification, cannot be regarded as such. What is more, through a simulation study, we provided evidence that removing or splitting data, based on an arbitrary threshold, introduces statistical bias by overestimating the effect of stress. Caution must be exercised when implementing a predefined cut-off for anhedonia. Researchers should be aware of potential biases introduced by their data treatment strategies and strive for transparent reporting of methodological decisions.",

The EOLS was subjected to qualitative validation methods and post-hoc free-text analysis to evaluate its ability to thoroughly capture scientifically relevant aspects of companion dogs death.\n\nResultsThe EOLS was well-received with excellent face validity as assessed by dog owners and experts. The EOLS had fair to substantial reliability for the three validation themes: cause of death (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI [0.5-0.95]), perimortem quality of life (kappa = 0.49; 95% CI [0.26-0.73]), and reason for euthanasia (kappa = 0.3; 95% CI [0.08-0.52]) and had no need for any substantial content alterations based on free-text analysis.\n\nClinical RelevanceThe EOLS has proven to be a well-accepted, comprehensive, and valid instrument for capturing owner-reported companion dog mortality data and has the potential to enhance veterinarians ability to care for the aging dog population by illuminating their understanding of companion dogs end-of-life experiences.",

    "abstract": "In this research to assess emotions from biometric signals, participants are asked to evaluate the emotions they subjectively experienced in order to confirm whether the assumed emotions were actually elicited. However, the evaluation of emotions is not routinely performed in daily life, and it is possible that this evaluation may alter biological signals. In fMRI studies, evaluation has been shown to activate the amygdala, which is said to be related to emotional expression. However, electroencephalography (EEG) studies do not take into consideration the effects of such evaluations, and it is unclear how these evaluations affect emotion-related brain activity observed in EEG. We hypothesized that emotion evaluations would amplify emotions and c alter Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA), which has been shown to be related to emotional pleasantness and unpleasantness. We suspect this is because in order to evaluate ones emotions, one must pay attention to ones internal state, and this self-focused attention has been found to enhance the subjective emotional experience. We measured a 29-channel EEG when presented with unpleasant and highly arousing images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) from 40 healthy male and female participants. The results revealed that FAA was significantly lower in the condition in which participants rated their own emotions compared to the condition in which they did not. Similar to fMRI studies, this result indicates that emotion-related brain activity is amplified on an EEG. This paper provides a cautionary note regarding the use of such evaluations in EEG emotion estimation studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCaudo-rostral migration of pathological forms of -synuclein from the gut to the brain is proposed as an early feature in Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Intestinal enteroendocrine cells sense and respond to numerous luminal signals, including bacterial factors, and transmit this information to the brain via the enteric nervous system and vagus nerve. There is evidence that gut bacteria composition and their metabolites change in PD patients and these alterations can trigger -synuclein pathology in animal models.\n\nObjectiveHere we investigated the effect of toll-like receptor (TLR) and free fatty acid receptor (FFA2/3) agonists on -synuclein levels in mouse STC-1 enteroendocrine cells.\n\nMethodsSTC-1 cells were treated with TLR and FFA2/3 agonists alone and in combination with selective antagonists. The level of -synuclein protein was measured in cell lysates and cell culture media by western blot and ELISA. And the level of -synuclein and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR.\n\nResultsTLR and FFA receptor agonists significantly increased intracellular and extracellular -synuclein levels and antagonists significantly reduced these effects. TLR and FFA receptor agonists also significantly increased TNF transcription and this was inhibited by corresponding antagonists.\n\nConclusionsElevated intracellular -synuclein increases the likelihood of aggregation and conversion to toxic forms. Factors derived from bacteria induce -synuclein accumulation in STC-1 cells. Here we provide support for a mechanism by which exposure of enteroendocrine cells to specific bacterial factors found in PD gut dysbiosis might facilitate accumulation and transmission of -synuclein pathology from the gut to the brain.",

    "abstract": "Invasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems through Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals require efficient recognition of spatiotemporal patterns from a multi-electrodes sensor array. Such signals are excellent candidates for automated pattern recognition through machine learning algorithms. The importance of these patterns can be highlighted through feature extraction techniques. However, the signal variability due to non-stationarity is ignored while extracting features, and which features to use can be challenging to figure out by visual inspection. In this study, we introduce the signal split parameter to account for the variability of the signal and increase the accuracy of the machine learning classifier. We use genetic selection, which allows the selection of the optimal combination of features from a pool of 8 different feature sets. Genetic selection of features increases accuracy and reduces the BCIs prediction time. Along with Genetic selection, we also use a reduced signal length, which leads to a higher Information Transfer Rate. Thus this approach enables the design of a fast and accurate motorrelated EcoG BCI system.",

    "abstract": "Motor contagions refer to implicit effects in ones actions induced by the observation of actions made by others. A plethora of studies over the last two decades have exhibited that observed, as well as predicted, actions can induce various kinds of motor contagions in a human observer. However, motor contagion has always been investigated in regard to different features of an observed action and it remains unclear whether the environment, in which an observed action takes place, modulates motor contagions as well. Here we investigated the effect of the observed environment on motor contagions using an empirical hand steering task in which the participants were required to move a cursor through visual channels of different shapes. We observed the movement time of observers to be influenced by both the movement of the cursor they observed, as well as the background (channel shape) in which the cursor movement was observed. Observers consistently made faster movements after observing steering movements in a  narrowing channel compared to a  widening channel. These results show a distinct effect of the environment, in which an observed action occurs, on ones own movement.",

    "abstract": "Cystinosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease, is characterized by cystine crystallization and accumulation within tissues and organs, including the kidneys and brain. Its impact on neural function appears mild relative to its effects on other organs, but therapeutic advances have led to substantially increased life expectancy, necessitating deeper understanding of its impact on neurocognitive function.\n\nBehavioral difficulties have been reported in cystinosis in the visual and visual-processing domain. Very little is known, however, about how the brains of people living with cystinosis process visual information, although cysteamine accumulation in the retina is a prominent feature of cystinosis. Here, electrophysiology was recorded during a Go/No-Go task to investigate early visual processing in cystinosis, compared to an age-matched control group. Analyses focused on early stages of cortical visual processing.\n\nThe groups differed in their initial cortical response, with individuals with cystinosis exhibiting a significantly larger visual evoked potential (VEP) in the 130 to 150 ms time window. The timing and topography of this response suggested an enhanced P1 in cystinosis that could be the result of cortical hyperexcitability and/or differences in attentional engagement and explain, at least partially, the visual and visual-spatial difficulties described in this population. The groups also differed in the associations between neural responses and verbal abilities: While controls with higher IQ scores presented larger neural responses, that relationship was not observed in cystinosis.",

    "abstract": "The brain tissue phase contrast in MRI sequences reflects the spatial distributions of multiple substances, such as iron, myelin, calcium, and proteins. These substances with paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibilities often colocalize in one voxel in brain regions. Both opposing susceptibilities play vital roles in brain development and neurodegenerative diseases. Conventional QSM methods only provide voxel-averaged susceptibility value and cannot disentangle intravoxel susceptibilities with opposite signs. Advanced susceptibility imaging methods have been recently developed to distinguish the contributions of opposing susceptibility sources for QSM. The basic concept of separating paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility proportions is to include the relaxation rate [Formula] with [Formula] in QSM. The magnitude decay kernel, describing the proportionality coefficient between [Formula] and susceptibility, is an essential reconstruction coefficient for QSM separation methods. In this study, we proposed a more comprehensive complex signal model that describes the relationship between 3D GRE signal and the contributions of paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility to the frequency shift and [Formula] relaxation. The algorithm is implemented as a constrained minimization problem in which the voxel-wise magnitude decay kernel and sub-voxel susceptibilities are determined alternately in each iteration until convergence. The calculated voxel-wise magnitude decay kernel could realistically model the relationship between the [Formula] relaxation and the volume susceptibility. Thus, the proposed method effectively prevents the errors of the magnitude decay kernel from propagating to the final susceptibility separation reconstruction. Phantom studies, ex vivo macaque brain experiments, and in vivo human brain imaging studies were conducted to evaluate the ability of the proposed method to distinguish paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provides state-of-the-art performances for quantifying brain iron and myelin compared to previous QSM separation methods. Our results show that the proposed method has the potential to simultaneously quantify whole brain iron and myelin during brain development and aging.\n\nThe proposed model was also deployed with multiple-orientation complex GRE data input measurements, resulting in high-quality QSM separation maps with more faithful tissue delineation between brain structures compared to those reconstructed by single-orientation QSM separation methods.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRecently, a seizure classification approach derived from complex systems and nonlinear dynamics has been suggested, termed the \"taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes.\" This framework is based on modeling the dynamical process of the transition in and out of a seizure. It has been examined in computational and animal models in-vitro and recently in human intracranial data. However, its applicability and value in surface EEG remain unclear. This study examined the applicability of dynamotype classification to seizure information extracted from surface EEG and tested how it relates to clinical factors.\n\nMethodsSurface EEG recordings from 1,215 seizures were analyzed. We used an automated pre-processing pipeline, resulting in independent components (ICs) for each seizure. Subsequently, we visually identified ICs with clear seizure information and classified them based on the suggested taxonomy. To examine the possibility of automatic classification, we applied a random forest classifier combined with EEG features and evaluated its performance in identifying seizure-related ICs and classifying dynamical types. Lastly, we used a Bayesian estimator to examine the likelihood of the different dynamical types under various clinical conditions.\n\nResultsWe found an apparent onset and offset bifurcation in 49.5% and 40.3% of seizures, respectively. Bifurcation prevalence aligns with that previously reported using intracranial data and computational modeling. The automated classifiers, evaluated with a leave-one-patient-out paradigm, provided good performance. In addition, bifurcation prevalence differed between vigilance states and seizure classes.\n\nSignificanceWe demonstrated a method to extract seizure information and classify dynamotypes in non-invasive recordings with a visual as well as an automated framework. Extending this classification to a larger scale and a broader population may provide further insights into seizure dynamics.\n\nKey Points BoxO_LIWe characterized the dynamical types of transitions at seizure onset and offset based on seizure information extracted from surface EEG.\nC_LIO_LIWe classified the dynamical types (dynamotypes) in 49.5% and 40.3% of seizure onsets and offsets, respectively.\nC_LIO_LIThe dynamotype distribution in surface EEG data aligns with previous findings from intracranial EEG and theoretical expectations.\nC_LIO_LIThe likelihood of the dynamical type of a seizure exhibits differences across clinical seizure classes and vigilance states.\nC_LIO_LIAutomated detection and classification of seizure bifurcations are possible using relevant features and pre-existing tools.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "MotivationA patients disease phenotype can be driven and determined by specific groups of cells whose marker genes are either unknown, or can only be detected at late-stage using conventional bulk assays such as RNA-Seq technology. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable gene expression profiling in cell-level resolution, and therefore have the potential to identify those cells driving the disease phenotype even while the number of these cells is small. However, most existing methods rely heavily on accurate cell type detection, and the number of available annotated samples is usually too small for training deep learning predictive models.\n\nResultsHere we propose the method ScRAT for clinical phenotype prediction using scRNA-seq data. To train ScRAT with a limited number of samples of different phenotypes, such as COVID and non-COVID, ScRAT first applies a mixup module to increase the number of training samples. A multi-head attention mechanism is employed to learn the most informative cells for each phenotype without relying on a given cell type annotation. Using three public COVID datasets, we show that ScRAT outperforms other phenotype prediction methods. The performance edge of ScRAT over its competitors increases as the number of training samples decreases, indicating the efficacy of our sample mixup. Critical cell types detected based on high-attention cells also support novel findings in the original papers and the recent literature. This suggests that ScRAT overcomes the challenge of missing marker genes and limited sample number with great potential revealing novel molecular mechanisms and/or therapies.",

    "abstract": "The sulfate transporter gene SLC26A2 is responsible for diastrophic dysplasia, which represents skeletal dysplasia in humans. This highlights the importance of sulfate metabolism in skeletal formation. SLC26A2-related chondrodysplasia is also known to exhibit abnormalities in craniofacial and tooth development. Although the function of SLC26A2 in mammals has been investigated using genetic mouse models, the essential role of SLC26A2 during craniofacial and tooth development has not been elucidated.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate the pivotal roles of SLC26A2-mediated sulfate metabolism during tooth development. Analysis of Slc26a2 expression reveals that it is predominantly expressed in dental tissues, including odontoblasts and ameloblasts, during tooth development. Slc26a2 knockout mice (Slc26a2-KO-{Delta}exon2) exhibit a retrognathic upper jaw, small upper incisors, and hypoplasia of upper molars. Additionally, upper incisors and molars in Slc26a2-KO-{Delta}exon2 mice display flattened odontoblasts and nuclei that lack intracellular polarity. In contrast, tooth phenotype is not remarkable in lower incisors and molars.\n\nFurthermore, the expression of odontoblast differentiation markers, Dspp and Dmp1, is significantly decreased in the upper molars of Slc26a2-deficient mice. Ex vivo organ culture of tooth germs by implantation of Slc26a2-deficient tooth germs under the kidney capsule reveals hypoplasia of the dentin matrix as well as tooth root shortening. In vitro studies using human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) show that the expression levels of Dspp and Dmp1 in shSlc26a2 knockdown cells are significantly decreased compared to control cells.\n\nCollectively, our data demonstrate that SLC26A2-mediated sulfate metabolism is essential for tooth development. This study may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying tooth abnormalities in patients with recessively inherited chondrodysplasias caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene.",

    "abstract": "In fungi, conserved homeobox-domain (HD) proteins are transcriptional regulators governing development. In Aspergillus species, several HD transcription factor genes have been identified, among them, hbxA/hbx1. For instance, in the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, hbxA is involved in conidial production and germination, as well as virulence and secondary metabolism (SM), including production of fumigaclavines, fumiquinazolines, and chaetominine. In the agriculturally important fungus Aspergillus flavus, disruption of hbx1 results in fluffy aconidial colonies unable to produce sclerotia. hbx1 also regulates production of aflatoxins, cyclopiazonic acid and aflatrem. Furthermore, transcriptome studies revealed that hbx1 has a broad effect on the A. flavus genome, including numerous genes involved in SM. These studies underline the importance of the HbxA/Hbx1 regulator, not only in developmental processes but also in the biosynthesis of a broad number of fungal natural products, including potential medical drugs and mycotoxins. To gain further insight into the regulatory scope of HbxA in Aspergilli, we studied its role in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Our present study of the A. nidulans hbxA-dependent transcriptome revealed that more than one thousand genes are differentially expressed when this regulator was not transcribed at wild-type levels, among them numerous transcription factors, including those involved in development as well as in SM regulation. Furthermore, our metabolomics analyses revealed that production of several secondary metabolites, some of them associated with A. nidulans hbxA-dependent gene clusters, was also altered in deletion and overexpression hbxA strains compared to the wild type, including synthesis of nidulanins A, B and D, versicolorin A, sterigmatocystin, austinol, dehydroaustinol, and three unknown novel compounds.",

    "abstract": "Side-stream Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (S2EBPR) has been incorporated with B-stage process to enable simultaneous phosphorus and nitrogen removal. However, the dominating phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) in this novel configuration has not been evaluated. The dominance of Acinetobacter was confirmed by 16S sequencing. In addition, single cell Raman spectrum (SCRS) analysis in couple with in situ fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to obtain the feature spectrum and verify the phosphorus release/uptake activity of Acinetobacter spp. The phenotypic profiling further suggested the dominance of Acinetobacter-like organisms among all poly-phosphorus containing organisms and only certain phenotypic Acinetobacter (oligotype 1) contribution to P-removal in a unique HRAS-P(D)N-S2EBPR system. The findings suggest that Acinetobacter may outcompete other heterotrophic organisms in EBPR systems due to their sensitivity to operational conditions. However, stable P-removal was only observed during a specific section of the operation period, coinciding with an increase in the VFA/P ratio. Further research is needed to identify the phenotypes of Acinetobacter responsible for P-removal in EBPR systems. The study contributes to a better understanding of the microbial ecology and engineering aspects of EBPR systems and wastewater treatment in general.",

    "abstract": "An essential ability of many cell types is to detect stimuli in the form of shallow chemical gradients. Such cues may indicate the direction that new growth should occur, or the location of a mate. Amplification of these faint signals is due to intra cellular mechanisms while the cue itself is generated by the noisy arrival of signaling molecules to surface bound membrane receptors. We employ a new hybrid numerical-asymptotic technique coupling matched asymptotic analysis and numerical inverse Laplace transform to rapidly and accurately solve the parabolic exterior problem describing the dynamic diffusive fluxes to receptors. We observe that equilibration occurs on long timescales, potentially limiting the usefulness of steady state quantities for localization at practical biological timescales. We demonstrate that directional information is encoded primarily in early arrivals to the receptors, while equilibrium quantities inform on source distance. We develop a new homogenization result showing that complex receptor configurations can be replaced by a uniform effective condition. In the extreme scenario where the cell adopts the angular direction of the first impact, we show this estimate to be surprisingly accurate.",

Besides the effects of specific mutations on thyroid cancer development, the molecular mechanisms controlling tumorigenesis, tumor behavior, and drug resistance are still largely unknown. Cancer organoids have been proposed as a powerful tool to study aspects related to tumor development and progression and appear promising to test individual responses to therapies. Here, using mESC-derived thyroid organoids, we developed a BrafV637E-inducible model able to recapitulate the features of papillary thyroid cancer in vitro. Overexpression of BrafV637E rapidly leads to MAPK activation, cell dedifferentiation, and disruption of follicular organization. BrafV637E-expressing organoids show a transcriptomic signature for p53, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions, EMT, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Finally, PTC-like thyroid organoids were used for drug screening assays. The combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors reversed Braf oncogene-promoted cell dedifferentiation while restoring thyroid follicle organization and function in vitro. Our results demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells-derived thyroid cancer organoids can mimic tumor development and features while providing an efficient tool for testing novel targeted therapies.",

Our study investigated two orphan GPCRs, AAEL003647 and AAEL019988, in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. From our phylogenetic analysis, we found that AAEL003647 is orthologous to the SIFamide-2/SMYamide receptor, while AAEL019988 is orthologous to the Trapped in endoderm (Tre1) receptor of Drosophila melanogaster. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that both receptors had highest expression in the ovaries, suggesting they may be important for reproduction. We then used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down both genes and found a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid per individual female mosquito, suggesting both receptors are important for Ae. aegypti reproduction.",

The Darwinian dynamics and the endogenous network theory established a few years ago provide a mathematical and theoretical framework of a dynamical structure, and a general constitutive structure for theory-experiment coupling, respectively, for answering this question from the first principle perspective. By revisiting a gene network that explains the anterior-posterior patterning of the vertebrate telencephalon, we found that with the increase of the cooperative effect in this network, the fixed points gradually evolve, accompanied by the occurrence of two bifurcations. The dynamic behavior of this network consists with the knowledge obtained from experiments on telencephalon evolution. Furtherly, our work drew an answer quantitatively of how the telencephalon anterior-posterior patterning evolved from the pre-vertebrate chordate to the vertebrate and gave a series of verifiable predictions in a first principle manner.\n\nFigure Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Platinum (Pt) compounds are an important class of anti-cancer therapeutics, but outstanding questions remain regarding their mode of action. In particular, emerging evidence indicates that oxaliplatin, a Pt drug used to treat colorectal cancer, kills cells by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress rather than through DNA damage generation, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that oxaliplatin-induced ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcriptional silencing and nucleolar stress occur downstream of DNA damage signaling involving ATM and ATR. We show that NBS1 and TOPBP1, two proteins involved in the nucleolar DNA damage response (n-DDR), are recruited to nucleoli upon oxaliplatin treatment. However, we find that rRNA transcriptional inhibition by oxaliplatin does not depend upon NBS1 or TOPBP1, nor does oxaliplatin induce substantial amounts of nucleolar DNA damage, distinguishing it from previously characterized n-DDR pathways. Taken together, our work indicates that oxaliplatin induces a distinct DDR signaling pathway that functions in trans to inhibit Pol I transcription in the nucleolus, demonstrating how nucleolar stress can be linked to DNA damage signaling and highlighting an important mechanism of Pt drug cytotoxicity.",

It has been speculated that through its study, insights into regeneration and cancer could be obtained. Previously, using bulk RNA-Seq data, we reported that Transposable Elements (TEs) become activated during the SMG development. However, an outstanding question was as to whether their activity influenced different cell populations. Here, taking advantage of a single cell RNA-Seq atlas of the developing SMG, I studied TE expression to find out whether their activity can be recapitulated across its development, and if so, how they influenced cell types and cell fate specification. In this work, I found a total of 339 TEs that are markers of different cell populations, and then, through the modeling of the SMG development using Trajectory Inference methods, I found 2 TEs that could be potentially influencing differentiation processes. In sum, this short report reveals that TEs may be involved in the normal development of the SMG, and it highlights the importance of considering them in scRNA-Seq studies.",

Additionally, resource partitioning decreases niche overlap among clownfishes allowing coexistence in species-rich habitats.\n\nMain conclusionsWe provide a framework to estimate the effects of species interactions and demonstrate the importance of including biotic interaction to improve the estimation of species ecological niches. Finally, we show how resource partitioning regulates competition and provides the ecological basis to explain why clownfishes have different sets of associations with sea anemones. The variety of mutualistic strategies serves to ecosystem sustainability, reducing the effect of saturation by species richness and competitive exclusion. Competition avoidance through resource partitioning may be the primary mechanism that shapes clownfish communities across the Indo-Pacific.

However, several major challenges still remain for existing fine-mapping methods. First, the strong linkage disequilibrium among variants can limit the statistical power and resolution of fine-mapping. Second, it is computationally expensive to simultaneously search for multiple causal variants. Third, the confounding bias hidden in GWAS summary statistics can produce spurious signals. To address these challenges, we develop a statistical method for cross-population fine-mapping (XMAP) by leveraging genetic diversity and accounting for confounding bias. By using cross-population GWAS summary statistics from global biobanks and genomic consortia, we show that XMAP can achieve greater statistical power, better control of false positive rate, and substantially higher computational efficiency for identifying multiple causal signals, compared to existing methods. Importantly, we show that the output of XMAP can be integrated with single-cell datasets, which greatly improves the interpretation of putative causal variants in their cellular context at single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is the deadliest reproductive system cancer. Its high lethality is due to the high recurrence rate and the development of chemotherapeutic resistance, which requires synergy between cancer cells and non-cancerous cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Analysis of gene expression microarray data from paired primary and recurrent OC tissues revealed significantly elevated expression of the gene encoding periostin (POSTN) in recurrent OC compared to matched primary tumors (p=0.014). Finding POSTN primarily localized to the TME, we investigated the role of TME POSTN in OC cell viability, migration/invasion, and chemosensitivity. Conditioned media with high levels of POSTN (CMPOSTNhigh) was generated using POSTN-transfected fibroblastic preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. CMPOSTNhigh-cultured OC cells exhibited faster migration, more invasiveness (p=0.006), and more chemoresistance (p<0.05) compared to OC cells cultured with control medium (CMCTL). Furthermore, CMPOSTNhigh-cultured HEYA8 cells demonstrated increased resistance to paxlitaxel-induced apoptosis. Multiple OC cell lines (HEYA8, CAOV2, and SKOV3) cultured with CMPOSTNhighshowed increases in stem cell side population relative to CMCTL-cultured cells. POSTN-transfected 3T3-L1 cells exhibited more intracellular and extracellular lipids, and this was linked to increased cancer cell expression of the oncogene fatty acid synthetase (FASN). Additionally, POSTN functions in the TME were linked to Akt pathway activities. In a xenograft mouse model of OC, the mean tumor volume in mice injected with CMPOSTNhigh-grown OC cells was larger than that in mice injected with CMCTL-grown OC cells (p=0.0023). Altogether, higher POSTN expression is present in recurrent OC and promotes a more aggressive and chemoresistant oncogenic phenotype in vitro. Within cancer TME fibroblasts, POSTN can stimulate lipid production and is associated with increased OC stem cell side population, consistent with its known role in maintaining stemness. Our results bolster the need for further study of POSTN as a potential therapeutic target in treatment and potential prevention of recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\nAuthor SummaryOvarian cancer has a high rate of recurrent disease that is often resistant to chemotherapy. Comparing primary and recurrent ovarian cancer tumors, we found that the gene POSTN, which encodes the protein periostin, is more highly expressed in recurrent tumors, and more highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment, outside of the cancer cells. We transfected cells with vectors encoding POSTN or with blank vectors to generate conditioned media with high POSTN or control media. Ovarian cancer cells cultured in the POSTN-high conditioned media showed faster wound healing, more invasiveness, and more resistance to apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutic agents, and increased stemness, an important trait in cancer cells, especially recurrent cells. POSTN-transfected cells showed higher expression of the enzyme fatty acid synthase and higher concentrations of lipids, indicating that POSTN may play a role in increasing the energy available to cancer cells. The Akt pathway, often activated in ovarian cancer growth, was activated more in cells cultured in the POSTN-high environment. Finally, we injected immunocompromised mice with ovarian cancer cells that were grown in either the POSTN-high media or the control media, and the average tumor size was higher in mice injected with the cells that were grown in the POSTN-high media.",

    "abstract": "Microdamage accumulated through sustained periods of cyclic loading or single over-loading events contributes to bone fragility through a reduction in stiffness and strength. Monitoring microdamage in vivo remains unattainable by clinical imaging modalities. As such, there are no established computational methods for clinical fracture risk assessment that account for microdamage that exists in vivo at any specific timepoint. We propose a method that combines multiple clinical imaging modalities to identify an indicative surro-gate, which we term hidden porosity, that incorporates pre-existing bone microdamage in vivo. To do so, we use the third metacarpal bone of the equine athlete as an exemplary model for fatigue induced microdamage, which coalesces in the subchondral bone. N=10 metacarpals were scanned by clinical quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI). We used a patch-based similarity method to quantify the signal intensity of a fluid sensitive MRI sequence in bone regions where microdamage coa-lesces. The method generated MRI-derived pseudoCT images which were then used to de-termine a pre-existing damage (Dpex) variable to quantify the proposed surrogate and which we incorporate into a nonlinear constitutive model for bone tissue. The minimum, median, and maximum detected Dpex of 0.059, 0.209, and 0.353 reduced material stiffness by 5.9%, 20.9%, and 35.3% as well as yield stress by 5.9%, 20.3%, and 35.3%. Limb-specific voxel-based finite element meshes were equipped with the updated material model. Lateral and medial condyles of each metacarpal were loaded to simulate physiological joint loading dur-ing gallop. The degree of detected Dpex correlated with a relative reduction in both condylar stiffness (p = 0.001, R2 > 0.74) and strength (p < 0.001, R2 > 0.80). Our results illustrate the complementary value of looking beyond clinical CT, which neglects the inclusion of micro-damage due to partial volume effects. As we use clinically available imaging techniques, our results may aid research beyond the equine model on fracture risk assessment in human diseases such as osteoarthritis, bone cancer, or osteoporosis.",
