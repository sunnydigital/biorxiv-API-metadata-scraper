    "abstract": "Mutations in the ABCB4 gene lead to a wide-spectrum of rare liver diseases including progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) and low-phospholipid associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) syndrome. PFIC3 patients develop symptoms during late infancy, including severe itching, jaundice, and failure to thrive. The condition may progress to liver failure during childhood or adulthood. This is a highly unmet medical condition where liver transplantation is the only option to correct this disease. Recently, exciting data suggested that restoration of the ABCB4 function via gene replacement could rescue liver phenotypes associated with ABCB4 dysfunction in a preclinical PFIC3 mouse model. Here, we used mRNA LNP platform to determine expression and durability of ABCB4 in the liver of wildtype mice. In addition, we generated Abcb4-/- mice to study the efficacy of systemic delivery of ABCB4 mRNA LNP. We observed a robust and durable expression of hABCB4 up to 72 hours post systemic dosing in the liver of wild-type mice. Systemic administration of hABCB4 mRNA achieved a remarkable restoration of phosphatidylcholine levels in bile, a significant decrease in liver stiffness as measured by shear wave elastography, and amelioration of liver histopathology including fibrosis and ductular reaction. We conclude that administration of hABCB4 mRNA LNPs was sufficient to ameliorate fibrosis markers in the PFIC3 mouse model. Our data suggests that gene replacement using mRNA LNP modality could provide an excellent opportunity for patients with biliary diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although most thyroid nodules can be diagnosed preoperatively by thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, it remains a challenge to accurately identify malignancy of thyroid nodules when the biopsy is indeterminate. This study aims to explore a novel biomarker to distinguish benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Tissue samples from patients with Stage I&II papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and benign thyroid nodules (BTN) were collected for genome profiling by methylation EPIC 850K array and RNA-Sequencing. Genes with significantly differential DNA methylation and inverse mRNA expression were filtered out. The altered methylation of RUNX1 gene was validated in two independent case-control studies with a total of 699 formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples using mass spectrometry and calculated by binary logistic regression analysis. Hypomethylation of RUNX1 gene in PTC patients compared to BTN subjects was verified in Validation (140 PTC vs. 189 BTN, ORs [&ge;] 1.50 per-10% methylation, P [&le;] 4.40E-05, for all measurable CpG sites) and Validation (184 PTC vs. 186 BTN, ORs [&ge;] 1.72 per-10% methylation, P [&le;] 2.38E-11, for all measurable CpG sites). Besides, RUNX1 methylation achieved good accuracy in differentiating early-stage PTC from BTN in Validation (AUC: 0.74) and Validation (AUC: 0.79). Gender- and age-stratified analysis revealed RUNX1 hypomethylation as an important risk factor for thyroid disease in younger women. We disclosed a significant association between RUNX1 hypomethylation and PTC, suggesting RUNX1 methylation based on FFPE tissue samples as a potential biomarker for predicting malignancy of thyroid nodules.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy inducing pulmonary vascular remodeling and rosiglitazone inhibiting pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Monocrotaline (MCT) was intraperitoneally injection to induce the rat PAH model. The right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI), right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP), percentage of medial wall thickness (%MT) and histomorphologic analyses were performed to evaluate the development of PAH. The translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) p65 subunit from cytosol to nucleus, the protein expression levels of LC3B, Beclin 1 and RND3 were determined by western blot. Furthermore, NF-{kappa}B inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{gamma} (PPAR{gamma}) activator, rosiglitazone, were used to inhibit the activation of NF-{kappa}B and activate PPAR{gamma} signaling, respectively. MCT injection dramatically induced PAH models in rats as manifested by the increased RVSP, RVHI, and %MT. In addition, the activation of NF-{kappa}B and autophagy were significantly enhanced and the RND3 were markedly decreased in MCT-induced PAH in rat. However, these effects could be significantly suppressed either by the supplementation of PDTC or rosiglitazone. NF-{kappa}B promotes the development of PAH by activation of autophagy and consequent down-regulation of RND3 expression. Activation of PPAR{gamma} suppresses autophagy by inhibiting NF-{kappa}B in MCT-induced PAH. Our results not only uncovered the mechanisms of PPAR{gamma} activator in the protection of PAH but also provided potential therapeutic target for PAH treatment.",

    "abstract": "Homo-dimer formation is important for the function of many proteins. Although dimeric forms of cryptochromes (Cry) have been found by crystallography and were recently observed in vitro for European robin Cry4a, little is known about the dimerisation of avian cryptochromes and the role it could play in the mechanism of magnetic sensing in migratory birds. Here we present a combined experimental and computational investigation of the dimerisation of robin Cry4a resulting from covalent and non-covalent interactions. Experimental studies using native mass spectrometry, mass spectrometric analysis of disulphide bonds, chemical cross-linking and photometric measurements show that disulphide-linked dimers are routinely formed, the most likely cysteines being C317 and C412. Computational modelling and molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate and assess a number of possible dimer structures. The relevance of these findings to the proposed role of Cry4a in avian magnetoreception is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Single nucleotide variants are the most frequent type of sequence changes detected in the genome and these are frequently variants of uncertain significance (VUS). VUS are changes in DNA for which disease risk association is unknown. Thus, methods that classify the functional impact of a VUS can be used as evidence for variant interpretation. In the case of the breast and ovarian cancer specific tumor suppressor protein, BRCA1, pathogenic missense variants frequently score as loss of function in an assay for homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks. We previously published functional results using a multiplexed assay for 1056 amino acid substitutions residues 2-192 in the amino terminus of BRCA1. In this study, we have re-assessed the data from this multiplexed assay using an improved analysis pipeline. These new analysis methods yield functional scores for more variants in the first 192 amino acids of BRCA1, plus we report new results for BRCA1 amino acid residues 193-302. We now present the functional classification of 2172 BRCA1 variants in BRCA1 residues 2-302 using the multiplexed HDR assay. Comparison of the functional determinations of the missense variants with clinically known benign or pathogenic variants indicated 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity for this assay. The results from BRCA1 variants tested in this assay are a resource for clinical geneticists for evidence to evaluate VUS in BRCA1.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMost missense substitutions in BRCA1 are variants of unknown significance (VUS), and individuals with a VUS in BRCA1 cannot know from genetic information alone whether this variant predisposes to breast or ovarian cancer. We apply a multiplexed functional assay for homology directed repair of DNA double strand breaks to assess variant impact on this important BRCA1 protein function. We analyzed 2172 variants in the amino-terminus of BRCA1 and demonstrate that variants that are known as pathogenic have a loss of function in the DNA repair assay. Conversely, variants that are known to be benign are functionally normal in the multiplexed assay. We suggest that these functional determinations of BRCA1 variants can be used to augment the information that clinical cancer geneticists provide to patients who have a VUS in BRCA1.",

    "abstract": "Building evolutionarily appropriate baseline models for natural populations is not only important for answering fundamental questions in population genetics - including quantifying the relative contributions of adaptive vs. non-adaptive processes - but it is also essential for identifying candidate loci experiencing relatively rare and episodic forms of selection (e.g., positive or balancing selection). Here, a baseline model was developed for a human population of West African ancestry, the Yoruba, comprising processes constantly operating on the genome (i.e., purifying and background selection, population size changes, recombination rate heterogeneity, and gene conversion). Specifically, to perform joint inference of selective effects with demography, an approximate Bayesian approach was employed that utilizes the decay of background selection effects around functional elements, taking into account genomic architecture. This approach inferred a recent 6-fold population growth together with a distribution of fitness effects that is skewed towards effectively neutral mutations. Importantly, these results further suggest that, while strong and/or frequent recurrent positive selection is inconsistent with observed data, weak to moderate positive selection is consistent but unidentifiable if rare.",

    "abstract": "Domain insertion engineering is a promising approach to recombine the functions of evolutionarily unrelated proteins. Insertion of light-switchable receptor domains into a selected effector protein, for instance, can yield allosteric effectors with light-dependent activity. However, the parameters that determine domain insertion tolerance are poorly understood.\n\nHere, we used an unbiased screen to systematically assess the domain insertion permissibility of several evolutionary unrelated proteins. Training machine learning models on the resulting data allowed us to dissect features informative for domain insertion tolerance and revealed sequence conservation statistics as the strongest indicators of suitable insertion sites. Finally, extending our experimental pipeline towards the identification of switchable hybrids resulted in opto-chemogenetic derivatives of the transcription factor AraC that function as single-protein Boolean logic gates. Our study reveals determinants of domain insertion tolerance and facilitates the engineering of switchable proteins with unique mechanistic properties.",
