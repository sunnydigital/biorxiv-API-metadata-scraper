    "abstract": "Oligodendrocyte-lineage cells of patients and animal models undergo prominent changes in various neurodegenerative disorders. This raises the question of how myelinating cells interact with neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the role of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2 glia) in prion infections. We found that NG2 glia were activated in prion-infected cerebellar organotypic cultured slices (COCS) and in brains of prion-inoculated mice. In both model systems, depletion of NG2 glia exacerbated prion-induced neurodegeneration and accelerated prion pathology, suggesting a protective effect for NG2 glia. Loss of NG2 glia unleashed a microglial reaction promoting the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which augmented prion toxicity in HovS cells and COCS through binding to the EP1 and EP4 receptors. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis attenuated prion-induced neurodegeneration in COCS and mice, antagonized the enhanced neurodegeneration in NG2 glia-depleted COCS and brains after prion infection, and dampened the acceleration of prion disease in NG2 glia-depleted mice. These data unveil a non-cell-autonomous interaction involving NG2 glia and microglia in prion disease and suggest that PGE2 signaling may represent an actionable target against prion diseases.",

    "abstract": "When faced with unfamiliar circumstances, we often turn to our past experiences with similar situations to shape our expectations. This results in the well-established sequential effect, in which previous trials influence the expectations of the current trial. Studies have revealed that, in addition to the classical behavioral metrics, the inhibition of eye movement could be used as a biomarker to study temporal expectations. This pre-stimulus oculomotor inhibition is found a few hundred milliseconds prior to predictable events, with a stronger inhibition for predictable than unpredictable events. The phenomenon has been found to occur in various temporal structures, such as rhythms, cue-association and conditional probability, yet it is still unknown whether it reflects local sequential information of the previous trial. To explore this, we examined the relationship between the sequential effect and the pre-stimulus oculomotor inhibition. Our results (N=40) revealed that inhibition was weaker when the previous trial was longer than the current trial, in line with findings of behavioral metrics. These findings indicate that the pre-stimulus oculomotor inhibition covaries with expectation based on local sequential information, demonstrating the tight connection between this phenomenon and expectation and providing a novel measurement for studying sequential effects in temporal expectation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion MRI) is widely employed to probe the diffusive motion of water molecules within the tissue. Numerous diseases and processes affecting the central nervous system can be detected and monitored via diffusion MRI thanks to its sensitivity to microstructural alterations in tissue. The latter has prompted interest in quantitative mapping of the microstructural parameters, such as the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), which is instrumental for noninvasively mapping the underlying axonal fiber tracts in white matter through a procedure known as tractography. However, such applications demand repeated acquisitions of MRI volumes with varied experimental parameters demanding long acquisition times and/or limited spatial resolution. In this work, we present a deep-learning-based approach for increasing the spatial resolution of diffusion MRI data in the form of fODFs obtained through constrained spherical deconvolution. The proposed approach is evaluated on high quality data from the Human Connectome Project, and is shown to generate upsampled results with a greater correspondence to ground truth high-resolution data than can be achieved with ordinary spline interpolation methods.",

    "abstract": "Although avoidance is a prevalent feature of anxiety-related psychopathology, differences in existing measures of avoidance between humans and non-human animals impede progress in its theoretical understanding and treatment. To address this, we developed a novel translational measure of anxiety-related avoidance in the form of an approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task, by adapting a paradigm from the non-human animal literature to study the same cognitive processes in human participants. We used computational modelling to probe the putative cognitive mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance behaviour in this task and investigated how they relate to subjective task-induced anxiety. In a large online study, participants (n = 372) who experienced greater task- induced anxiety avoided choices associated with punishment, even when this resulted in lower overall reward. Computational modelling revealed that this effect was explained by greater individual sensitivities to punishment relative to rewards. We replicated these findings in an independent sample (n = 627) and we also found fair-to-excellent reliability of measures of task performance in a sub-sample retested one week later (n = 57). Our findings demonstrate the potential of approach-avoidance reinforcement learning tasks as translational and computational models of anxiety-related avoidance. Future studies should assess the predictive validity of this approach in clinical samples and experimental manipulations of anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Learning to perform a perceptual decision task is generally achieved through sessions of effortful practice with feedback. Here, we investigated how passive exposure to relevant stimuli, which is relatively effortless and does not require feedback, influences active learning. First, we trained mice in a sound-categorization task with various schedules combining passive exposure and active training. Mice that received passive exposure exhibited faster learning, regardless of whether this exposure occurred entirely before active training or was interleaved between active sessions. We next trained neural-network models with different architectures and learning rules to perform the task. Networks that use the statistical properties of stimuli to enhance separability of the data via unsupervised learning during passive exposure provided the best account of the behavioral observations. We further found that, during interleaved schedules, there is an increased alignment between weight updates from passive exposure and active training, such that a few interleaved sessions can be as effective as schedules with long periods of passive exposure before active training, consistent with our behavioral observations. These results provide key insights for the design of efficient training schedules that combine active learning and passive exposure in both natural and artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily travelled distance (an index of ecological constraints) and population density (an index of social constraint). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data clarifies the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.",

    "abstract": "Speech production is known to engage a distributed network. The brain regions responsible for the initiation of articulation are unclear, and they would be expected to coordinate a distributed network. Using direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort, during stereotyped speech production to eliminate confounds of phonological and semantic complexity, we performed a comprehensive analysis of cortical sites engaged in speech initiation. We found that the supplementary motor area (SMA) was the earliest speech motor region to be active prior to speech onset and was active almost exclusively prior to articulation. Broadband gamma activity in the SMA was predictive of the response time of word production, predicting response time from 250 ms after stimulus onset. Neural activity in SMA began at a highly predictable time after stimulus onset and extended until speech onset. SMA activity offset coincided with ventral premotor cortex and primary motor activity onset. This suggests that the SMA may coordinate the concerted activation of motor execution cortex. Our results support the idea that SMA is a key node in the speech initiation network.\n\nSignificance statementProducing speech requires coordination across multiple brain regions. One cortical region - the supplementary motor area (SMA) - has long been a candidate region to coordinate across other regions to initiate speech production. In this study, we used human intracranial recordings from patients with epilepsy to investigate the role of the SMA in initiating speech. In a picture-naming task, subjects repeated the word \"scrambled\" scores of times; using this condition to eliminate any linguistic confounds, we found that the SMA was consistently one of the earliest regions to activate during word production. We also uncovered the SMAs temporally precise tuning to speech onset at the single-trial level.",

The database includes harmonized dMRI data, 800 white matter clusters, 73 anatomically labeled white matter tracts both in full-resolution (for analysis) and low-resolution (for visualization), and 804 different dMRI-derived measures per subject. It is available via the NIMH Data Archive and offers tremendous potential for scientific discoveries in structural connectivity studies of neurodevelopment in children and adolescents.

    "abstract": "Naturalistically, multisensory information of gesture and speech is intrinsically integrated to enable coherent comprehension. Such cross-modal semantic integration is temporally misaligned, with the onset of gesture preceding the relevant speech segment. It has been proposed that gestures prime subsequent speech. However, there are unresolved questions regarding the roles and time courses that the two sources of information play in integration. Here, in two between-subject experiments of healthy college students, we segmented the gesture-speech integration period into 40-ms time windows (TWs) based on two separately division criteria, while interrupting the activity of the integration node of the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In Experiment 1, we created fixed time-advances of gesture over speech and divided the TWs from the onset of speech. In Experiment 2, we differentiated the processing stages of gesture and speech and segmented the TWs in reference to the speech lexical identification point (IP), while speech onset occurred at the gesture semantic discrimination point (DP). The results showed a TW-selective interruption of the pMTG and IFG only in Experiment 2, with the pMTG involved in TW1 (-120[~]-80 ms of speech IP), TW2 (-80[~]-40 ms), TW6 (80[~]120 ms) and TW7 (120[~]160 ms) and the IFG involved in TW3 (-40[~]0 ms) and TW6. Meanwhile no significant disruption of gesture-speech integration was reported in Experiment 1. We determined that after the representation of gesture has been established, gesture-speech integration occurs such that speech is first primed in a phonological processing stage before gestures are unified with speech to form a coherent meaning. Our findings provide new insights into multisensory speech and co-speech gesture integration by tracking the causal contributions of the two sources of information.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations can lead to the transformation of healthy cells into malignant cells and allow their evasion from immune surveillance. To uncover genes that play a role in the detection and lysis of tumor cells by natural killer (NK) cells, a B lymphoblastoid cell line was subjected to a genome-wide CRISPR screen. Among the top hits that facilitated NK evasion was SPPL3, which encodes an intramembrane protease that cleaves transmembrane glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus. SPPL3-deficient cells accumulated glycosyltransferases, such as acetylglucosaminyltransferase 5 (MGAT5), and displayed increased N-glycosylation. Binding of NK receptors NKG2D and CD2 to their corresponding ligands MICB and CD58, and binding of rituximab to CD20, was disrupted by SPPL3-deletion. Inhibition of N-glycan maturation restored receptor binding and sensitivity to NK cells. To elucidate the mechanism of this resistant phenotype, a secondary CRISPR screen was performed in SPPL3-deficient cells. This screen identified glycosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of highly branched N-glycans and N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc) extensions as key regulators that prevent killing. A significant enrichment of poly-LacNAc-containing tetra-antennary species was confirmed by glycoproteomic analysis. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how SPPL3 deletions have been linked to cancer.",

Developing molecular tools such as reporter-carrying versions of flaviviruses for studying viral replication and screening of antiviral compounds therefore represents a top priority. However, the engineering of flaviviruses carrying either fluorescent or luminescent reporters remains challenging due to the genetic instability caused by marker insertion; therefore, new approaches to overcome these limitations are needed. Here, we describe reverse genetic methods which includes design and validation of infectious clones of Zika, Kunjin and Dengue viruses harboring different reporter genes for infection, rescue, imaging and morphology using super-resolution microscopy. It was observed that for different flaviviruses constructs with identical design displayed strikingly different genetic stability while corresponding virions resembled wild-type virus particles in shape and size. A successful strategy was assessed to increase stability of rescued reporter virus and permit antiviral drug screening based on quantitative automated fluorescence microscopy and replication studies.",

    "abstract": "Iridescent colors in animals may vary with the arrangement of the observer and the light source relative to the animal. When these highly directional colors are used as signals, there may be transmission problems for senders in that the perception of the signal by intended receivers can be greatly affected by the spatial arrangement of the sender, receiver, and sources of contributing light. One potential solution to this problem is for senders to behave in a manner that arranges the positions of sender, light source, and receiver to enhance signal perception by the receiver. We tested this idea by describing the structure of courtship behavior of males of the Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor) butterfly and analyzing its consequences for the female detection of the males iridescent sexual signal which is used in mate choice by females. During courtship, males perform a swoop maneuver that brings their dorsal hindwing from below to directly in front of the female. Several swoops in rapid succession occur in aerial courtships that lead to copulation. We measured under solar radiation the radiance of the males dorsal hindwing as seen by the female during a swoop. Regardless of how the males swoop path is oriented relative to the sun, there will be a brief, bright, and saturated flash of blue visible to the female. Our results support the conclusion that male swoops enhance the visibility of the males iridescent color signal to the female during courtship.",

To overcome these limitations, we have developed a rapid computational method that incorporates N-linked glycans to mask epitopes or protein interaction surfaces, thereby providing an atomistic mapping of these regions. Using human coagulation factor IXa (fIXa) as a model system, we could rapidly and reliably delineate epitopes through the insertion of N-linked glycans that efficiently disrupt binding in a site-selective manner. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted ELISA experiments and high-throughput yeast surface display assays.

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms through which metastatic genes regulate lipid metabolism remain unclear. Here, we describe a new oncogenic-metabolic feedback loop between the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor ZEB2 and the key lipid enzyme ACSL4 (long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4), resulting in enhanced cellular lipid storage and fatty acid oxidation to drive breast cancer metastasis. Functionally, Depletion of ZEB2 or ACSL4 significantly reduced lipid droplets (LD) abundance and cell migration. ACSL4 overexpression rescued the invasive capabilities of the ZEB2 knockdown cells, suggesting that ACSL4 is crucial for ZEB2-mediated metastasis. Mechanistically, ZEB2 activated ACSL4 expression by directly binding to the ACSL4 promoter. ACSL4 binds to and stabilizes ZEB2 by reducing ZEB2 ubiquitination. Notably, ACSL4 not only promotes the intracellular lipogenesis and lipid droplet accumulation but also enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ATP production by upregulating the FAO rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoform A). Finally, we demonstrated that ACSL4 knockdown significantly reduced metastatic lung nodes in vivo. In conclusion, we reveal a novel positive regulatory loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4, which promotes LD storage to meet the energy needs of breast cancer metastasis, and identify the ZEB2-ACSL4 signaling axis as an attractive therapeutic target for overcoming breast cancer metastasis.\n\nHighlightsZEB2 activates FAO through transcription of ACSL4\n\nACSL4 regulates lipid metabolism through FAO, promoting breast cancer metastasis Targeting ZEB2-ACSL4 signaling axis inhibits breast cancer metastasis\n\nSignificanceWe describe a novel positive feedback loop between ZEB2 and ACSL4 that results in enhanced cellular lipid storage and FA oxidation to drive breast cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade trials have yet to produce a robust anti-cancer response in prostate cancer patients as a monotherapy due to the immunosuppressed prostate cancer tumour immune microenvironment. ST3Gal1 and other sialyltransferases are implicated in cancer and immune suppression by synthesizing sialoglycans, which act as ligands for Siglec receptors. These checkpoints are important for the immune response. However, its unclear how the synthesis of Siglec ligands is regulated, and little is known about the role of sialoglycan-Siglec-axis in prostate cancers evasion of anti-tumour immunity. We report that ST3Gal1 levels negatively correlate with androgen signalling in prostate tumours. Utilising syngeneic mouse models, we demonstrate that ST3Gal1 plays an important role in modulating tumour immune evasion. Using mouse models, patient samples and in vitro models we show that ST3Gal1 synthesises sialoglycans with the capacity to engage the Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 immunoreceptors preventing immune clearance of cancer cells. For the first time we provide evidence of the expression of Siglec-7/9 ligands and their respective immunoreceptors in prostate tumours. Importantly, we show that these interactions can be modulated by enzalutamide and may maintain immune suppression in enzalutamide treated tumours. We conclude that the activity of ST3Gal1 is critical to prostate cancer anti-tumour immunity and provide rationale for the use of glyco-immune checkpoint targeting therapies in advanced prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "The development of safe and effective second-generation COVID-19 vaccines to improve affordability and storage stability requirements remains a high priority to expand global coverage. In this report, we describe formulation development and comparability studies with a self-assembled SARS-CoV-2 spike ferritin nanoparticle vaccine antigen (called DCFHP), when produced in two different cell lines and formulated with an aluminum-salt adjuvant (Alhydrogel, AH). Varying levels of phosphate buffer altered the extent and strength of antigen-adjuvant interactions, and these formulations were evaluated for their (1) in vivo performance in mice and (2) in vitro stability profiles. Unadjuvanted DCFHP produced minimal immune responses while AH-adjuvanted formulations elicited greatly enhanced pseudovirus neutralization titers independent of [~]100%, [~]40% or [~]10% of the DCFHP antigen adsorbed to AH. These formulations differed, however, in their in vitro stability properties as determined by biophysical studies and a competitive ELISA for measuring ACE2 receptor binding of AH-bound antigen. Interestingly, after one month of 4{degrees}C storage, small increases in antigenicity with concomitant decreases in the ability to desorb the antigen from the AH were observed. Finally, we performed a comparability assessment of DCFHP antigen produced in Expi293 and CHO cells, which displayed expected differences in their N-linked oligosaccharide profiles. Despite consisting of different DCFHP glycoforms, these two preparations were highly similar in their key quality attributes including molecular size, structural integrity, conformational stability, binding to ACE2 receptor and mouse immunogenicity profiles. Taken together, these studies support future preclinical and clinical development of an AH-adjuvanted DCFHP vaccine candidate produced in CHO cells.",

Here, we uncover the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization of the phytopathogen Verticillium dahliae, known to possess distinct genomic regions, designated adaptive genomic regions (AGRs), enriched in transposable elements and genes that mediate host infection. Short-range DNA interactions form clear topologically associating domains (TADs) with gene-rich boundaries that show reduced levels of gene expression and reduced genomic variation. Intriguingly, TADs are less clearly structured in in AGRs than in the core genome. At a global scale, the genome contains bipartite long-range interactions, particularly enriched for AGRs and more generally containing segmental duplications. Notably, the patterns observed for V. dahliae are also present in other Verticillium species. Thus, our analysis links 3D genome organization to evolutionary features conserved throughout the Verticillium genus.",

Using \"VIP-Seq\", a novel method based on supernatant sequencing, we identified and quantified the activity of 120 spontaneously induced prophages in a collection of 63 Erwinia and Pseudomonas strains isolated from wheat flag leaves collected from the same field. These bacterial strains exhibited high levels of spontaneous prophage induction, with some producing > 108 virions/mL in overnight culture. Significant induction in planta also occurred from a lysogenic Erwinia strain inoculated on wheat seedlings. The potential of these active prophages in bacterial warfare was exhibited by their widespread killing of rival bacterial strains. Evidence of transduction was observed, and the prophages were shown to contribute a majority of the non-core genome of E. aphidicola isolates. Many additional prophages were predicted by bioinformatic tools, and we found that the predicted prophages that were not spontaneously induced had a significantly higher number of IS elements. Our results suggest that spontaneous induction of prophages may represent an unknown but wide-spread competition mechanism involved in phyllosphere microbiome assembly and function. This may also have implications for the design and resilience of synthetic bacterial communities used as biocontrol for certain plant diseases.",

    "abstract": "Deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems with prevailing extreme thermal conditions for life offer unique habitats to source heat tolearant enzymes with potential new enzymatic properties. Here, we present the novel C11 protease globupain, prospected from a metagenome-assembled genome of uncultivated Archaeoglobales sampled from the Soria Moria hydrothermal vent system located on the Arctic Mid- Ocean Ridges. By sequence comparisons against the MEROPS-MPRO database, globupain showed highest sequence identity to C11-like proteases present in human gut and intestinal bacteria. Successful recombinant expression in Escherichia coli of the active zymogen and 13 mutant substitution variants allowed assesment of residues involved in maturation and activity of the enzyme. For activation, globupain required the addition of DTT and Ca{superscript 2}. When activated, the 52 kDa proenzyme was processed at Lys137 and Lys144 into a 12 kDa light- and 32 kDa heavy chain heterodimer. A structurally conserved His132/Cys185 catalytic dyad was responsible for the proteolytic activity, and the enzyme demonstrated the ability to activate in-trans. Globupain exhibited caseinolytic activity and showed a strong preference for arginine in the P1 position, with Boc-QAR- aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) as the best substrate out of a total of 17 fluorogenic AMC substrates tested. Globupain was thermostable (Tm activated enzyme = 94.51 {+/-} 0.09{degrees}C) with optimal activity at 75 {degrees}C and pH 7.1. By characterizing globupain, our knowledge of the catalytic properties and activation mechanisms of temperature tolerant marine C11 proteases have been expanded. The unique combination of features such as elevated thermostability, activity at relatively low pH values, and ability to operate under high reducing conditions makes globupain a potential intriguing candidate for use in diverse industrial and biotechnology sectors.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge faced by bacteria is infection by bacteriophage (phage). Abortive infection is one strategy for combating phage in which an infected cell kills itself to limit phage replication, thus protecting neighboring kin. One class of abortive infection systems is the cyclic oligonucleotide based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) which relies on two core enzymatic activities; an oligo-nucleotide cyclase that is activated following phage infection and a cyclic-oligo-nucleotide sensitive effector whose activity kills the infected cell. However, the mechanisms behind the deployment and activation of these lethal CBASS systems prior-to and following infection have largely remained a mystery. While exploring unique genomic features of the current pandemic Vibrio cholerae biotype El Tor for clues underlying its pandemic success we found its CBASS was spuriously activated by the folate biosynthesis inhibitor sulfamethoxazole, but only after the population had reached a high-cell density. This population density dependent activity revealed that transcription of both the oligo-nucleotide cyclase, dncV, and the CBASS phospholipase effector, capV, is enhanced at high-cell density by quorum sensing. Together, these results demonstrate that the V. cholerae CBASS is deployed when the environment is densely populated and activated in response to a perturbation in folate biosynthesis.\n\nSignificanceTo counteract infection with phage, bacteria have evolved a myriad of molecular defense systems. Some of these systems initiate a process called abortive infection, in which the infected cell kills itself to prevent phage propagation. However, such systems must be inhibited in the absence of phage infection to prevent spurious death of the host. Here we show that the cyclic oligonucleotide based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) accomplishes this by sensing intracellular folate molecules and only expressing this system in a group. These results enhance our understanding of the evolution of the 7th V. cholerae pandemic and more broadly how bacteria defend themselves against phage infection.",

    "abstract": "Although river ecosystems comprise less than 1% of Earths total non-glaciated area, they are critical modulators of microbially and virally orchestrated global biogeochemical cycles. However, most studies either use data that is not spatially resolved or is collected at timepoints that do not reflect the short life cycles of microorganisms. As a result, the relevance of microbiome interactions and the impacts they have over time on biogeochemical cycles are poorly understood. To assess how viral and microbial communities change over time, we sampled surface water and pore water compartments of the wastewater-impacted River Erpe in Germany every 3 hours over a 48-hour period resulting in 32 metagenomes paired to geochemical and metabolite measurements. We reconstructed 6,500 viral and 1,033 microbial genomes and found distinct communities associated with each river compartment. We show that 17% of our vMAGs clustered to viruses from other ecosystems like wastewater treatment plants and rivers. Our results also indicated that 70% of the viral community was persistent in surface waters, whereas only 13% were persistent in the pore waters taken from the hyporheic zone. Finally, we predicted linkages between 73 viral genomes and 38 microbial genomes. These putatively linked hosts included members of the Competibacteraceae, which we suggest are potential contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling. Together, these findings demonstrate that microbial and viral communities in surface waters of this urban river can exist as stable communities along a flowing river; and raise important considerations for ecosystem models attempting to constrain dynamics of river biogeochemical cycles.",

We previously showed that {Delta}40p53 regulates miR-186-5p-YY1 axis, independent of p53, to decrease cell proliferation. In this study, we screened small RNA sequences globally to identify miRNAs differentially regulated by {Delta}40p53 and p53. We report that the expression of certain miRNAs is exclusively regulated by {Delta}40p53. Overexpression of {Delta}40p53, but not full-length p53, substantially downregulated expression of the novel miR-4671-5p. However, upon over expression of different ratios of {Delta}40p53 and FLp53, miR-4671-5p levels changed which implies that this novel miRNA is not a direct but a p53 modifiable target. Predicted miR-4671-5p targets included N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 11B and CDK5 regulatory subunit 1 (CDK5R1). Overexpression of miR-4671-5p directly inhibited SGSH and consequently triggered intra-S-phase cell cycle arrest. {Delta}40p53-miR-4671-5p-SGSH axis emerges as a novel axis capable of regulating cell cycle progression. SGSH gene expression levels have potential prognostic relevance on survival that trends in the opposite direction of miR-4671-5p levels associated with the same cancer types, supporting a possible physiological relevance of the interaction.

    "abstract": "A coordinated oxidative stress response, partly triggered by the transcription factor Nrf2, protects cells from the continual production of reactive oxygen species. Left unbuffered, reactive oxygen species can lead to protein aggregation which has been implicated in a spectrum of diseases including cataract of the ocular lens and myopathy of the heart. While proteostasis is maintained by diverse families of heat shock proteins, the interplay between the oxidative and proteostatic stress responses in the lens and the heart have not been investigated. Capitalizing on multiple zebrafish lines that have compromised function of Nrf2 and/or the two zebrafish small heat-shock proteins Ba- and Bb-crystallin, we uncovered a transcriptional relationship that leads to a substantial increase in Bb-crystallin transcripts in the heart in response to compromised function of Nrf2. In the lens, the concomitant loss of function of Nrf2 and Ba-crystallin leads to upregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway thus mitigating the phenotypic consequences of the Ba-crystallin knockout. In contrast, abrogation of Nrf2 function accentuates the penetrance of a heart edema phenotype characteristic of embryos of B-crystallin knockout lines. Multiple molecular pathways, such as genes involved in extracellular interactions and implicated in cardiomyopathy, are revealed from transcriptome profiling thus identifying novel targets for further investigation. Together our transcriptome/phenotypic analysis establishes an intersection between the oxidative stress and chaperone responses in the lens and the heart.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the spatial occurrence of wildlife is a major challenge for ecology and management. In Latin America, knowledge of the true number and locations of vampire bat colonies precludes informed allocation of measures intended to limit lethal rabies spillover to humans and livestock. We inferred the complete spatial distribution of vampire bat roosts while accounting for observation effort and environmental covariates by fitting a Log Gaussian Cox Process model to the locations of 563 roosts in three regions of Peru. Our model explained 47% of the variance in the observed roost distribution and identified landscape correlates of roost establishment. Our model estimated that 1,795 roosts (76%) remain undiscovered and identified hotspots of undetected roosts in currently rabies-free areas, implying high risk for viral incursion. Incorporating the locations of undetected roosts improved spatial predictions of rabies spillover to livestock, revealed areas with disproportionate underreporting to surveillance systems, and indicated a higher rabies burden than previously estimated. We provide a robust approach to infer the distribution of a mostly unobserved bat reservoir that can inform strategies to prevent the re-emergence of an important zoonosis.",

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of RNA viruses is highly structured untranslated regions (UTRs) in their genomes. These conserved RNA structures are often essential for viral replication, transcription, or translation. In this report, we discovered and optimized a new coumarin derivative C30 that binds to a four-way RNA helix called SL5 in the 5 UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. To locate the binding site, we developed a novel sequencing-based method namely cgSHAPE-seq, in which the acylating chemical probe was directed to crosslink with the 2-OH groups of ribose at the ligand binding site. This crosslinked RNA could then create read-through mutations during reverse transcription (i.e., primer extension) at single-nucleotide resolution to uncover the acylation locations. cgSHAPE-seq unambiguously determined that a bulged G in SL5 was the primary binding site of C30 in the SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR, which was validated through mutagenesis and in vitro binding experiments. C30 was further used as a warhead in RNA-degrading chimeras (RIBOTACs) to reduce viral RNA expression levels. We demonstrated that replacing the acylating moiety in the cgSHAPE probe with ribonuclease L recruiter (RLR) moieties yielded RNA degraders active in the in vitro RNase L degradation assay and SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR expressing cells. We further explored another RLR conjugation site on the E ring of C30 and discovered potent activity in vitro and in cells. The optimized RIBOTAC C64 inhibited live virus replication in lung epithelial carcinoma cells.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic persists despite the development of effective vaccines. As such, it remains crucial to identify new targets for antiviral therapies. The causative virus of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense RNA virus with RNA structures that could serve as therapeutic targets. One such RNA with established function is the frameshift stimulatory element (FSE), which promotes programmed ribosomal frameshifting. To accelerate identification of additional functional RNA elements, we introduce a novel computational approach termed the Functional RNA Identification (FRID) pipeline. The guiding principle of our pipeline, which uses established component programs as well as customized component programs, is that functional RNA elements have conserved secondary and pseudoknot structures that facilitate function. To assess the presence and conservation of putative functional RNA elements in SARS-CoV-2, we compared over 6,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic isolates. We identified 22 functional RNA elements from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14 of which have conserved pseudoknots and serve as potential targets for small molecule or antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics. The FRID pipeline is general and can be applied to identify pseudoknotted RNAs for targeted therapeutics in genomes or transcriptomes from any virus or organism.",

We studied full thickness CD tissues to characterize fibroblast heterogeneity and function by generating the first single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) atlas of strictured bowel and providing proof of principle for therapeutic target validation.\n\nMethodsWe performed scRNAseq of 13 fresh full thickness CD resections containing non-involved, inflamed non-strictured, and strictured segments as well as 7 normal non-CD bowel segments. Each segment was separated into mucosa/submucosa or muscularis propria and analyzed separately for a total of 99 tissue samples and 409,001 cells. We validated cadherin-11 (CDH11) as a potential therapeutic target by using whole tissues, isolated intestinal cells, NanoString nCounter, next generation sequencing, proteomics and animal models.\n\nResultsOur integrated dataset revealed fibroblast heterogeneity in strictured CD with the majority of stricture-selective changes detected in the mucosa/submucosa, but not the muscle layer. Cell-cell interaction modeling revealed CXCL14+ as well as MMP/WNT5A+ fibroblasts displaying a central signaling role in CD strictures. CDH11, a fibroblast cell-cell adhesion molecule, was broadly expressed and upregulated, and its pro-fibrotic function was validated by NanoString nCounter, RNA sequencing, tissue target expression, in vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments, proteomics, and two animal models of experimental colitis.\n\nConclusionA full-thickness bowel scRNAseq atlas revealed previously unrecognized fibroblast heterogeneity and interactions in CD strictures and CDH11 was validated as a potential therapeutic target. These results provide a new resource for a better understanding of CD stricture formation and opens potential therapeutic developments.",

A number of virulence factors like biofilm formation, hemolysin production, gelatin hydrolysis have important role in the pathogenesis of Enterococci and also associated with antibiotic resistance. The aim of our study was to detect the virulence factors and their encoding genes (asa, gelE, esp, ebpR, hyl gene for biofilm; cylA gene for hemolysis; gelE gene for gelatin hydrolysis) and also observe their association with antimicrobial resistance Enterococci. A total of 87 Enterococci were collected from different clinical samples. Virulence factors were detected phenotypically and antibiotic sensivity were done by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Virulence genes were detected by conventional multiplex PCR and only the ebpR gene was detected by single conventional PCR. Majority of the isolated Enterococci were E. faecalis (75%) followed by E. faecium (23%) and (2%) E. raffinosus were also detected. About 52.3% of E. faecalis and 35% of E. faecium isolates were biofilm producers. Significant association was found between biofilm formation and asa, esp, ebpR genes both in E. faecalis and in E. faecium. Hemolysis was observed phenotypically in 30.8% isolates of E. faecalis and 20% isolates of E. faecium. Significant association was observed between cylA gene and hemolysin production in E. faecalis. Antibiotic resistance were higher in biofilm and hemolysin producing isolates of both species. Resistance to some antibiotics including ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin were significantly higher among biofilm and hemolysin producer in E. faecalis.",

    "abstract": "The conservation of migratory birds poses a fundamental challenge: their conservation requires coordinated action across the hemisphere, but those actions must be designed and implemented locally. To address this challenge, we describe a multi-level framework for linking broad-scale, full annual cycle prioritizations to local conservation actions for migratory birds. We developed hemisphere-scale spatial prioritizations for the full annual cycle of migratory birds that breed in six different ecosystems in North America. The full annual cycle prioritizations provide a hemispheric context within which regional priorities can be identifieed. Finer resolution, regional prioritizations can then inform local conservation actions more effectively. We describe the importance of local conservation practitioner contributions at each level of the process and provide two examples of regional spatial prioritizations that were developed to guide local action. The fierst example focused on coastal North and South Carolina, USA, and used information on marsh birds, shorebirds, ecological integrity, and co-benefiets for people to identify Cape Romain, South Carolina as a high-priority site for conservation action. The second example in Colombia used information on migrant and resident birds to identify the Cauca Valley as a high priority site. The multi-level conceptual framework we describe is one pathway for identifying sites for implementation of local conservation actions that are guided by conservation priorities for migratory birds across their full annual cycle.",

    "abstract": "What is the optimal way to harvest an ecological population sustainably is a fundamental problem in natural resource management. Here we use the framework of the stochastic logistic model which captures random birth-death of individuals to determine the optimal harvesting strategy that maximizes the integrated yield over time. Harvesting is assumed to occur at either a constant or state-dependent rate, and individuals are harvested with a certain probability whenever a harvesting event occurs. A special case of state-dependent harvesting is a threshold-based strategy, where harvesting is done when the population crosses a threshold. We use moment closure schemes to develop analytical formulas quantifying the mean and optimal yield. Moreover, as populations are susceptible to extinction at high harvesting rates, the Finite State Projection (FSP) method is used to estimate the probabilities of extinction across strategies and parameter regimes. Our results show that the threshold-based strategy is most effective in maximizing the yield as it suppresses population fluctuations and minimizes extinction events.",

    "abstract": "Rapid evolution may play an important role in the range expansion of invasive species and modify forecasts of invasion, which are the backbone of land management strategies. However, losses of genetic variation associated with colonization bottlenecks may constrain trait and niche divergence at leading range edges, thereby impacting management decisions that anticipate future range expansion. The spatial and temporal scales over which adaptation contributes to invasion dynamics remains unresolved. We leveraged detailed records of the [~]130 year invasion history of the invasive polyploid plant, leafy spurge (Euphorbia virgata), across [~]500km in Minnesota, U.S.A. We examined the consequences of range expansion for population genomic diversity, niche breadth, and the evolution of germination behavior. Using genotyping-by-sequencing, we found some population structure in the range core, where introduction occurred, but panmixia among all other populations. Range expansion was accompanied by only modest losses in sequence diversity, with small, isolated populations at the leading edge harboring similar levels of diversity to those in the range core. The climatic niche expanded during most of range expansion, and the niche of the range core was largely non-overlapping with the invasion front. Ecological niche models indicated that mean temperature of the warmest quarter was the strongest determinant of habitat suitability and that populations at the leading edge had the lowest habitat suitability. Guided by these findings, we tested for rapid evolution in germination behavior over the time course of range expansion using a common garden experiment and temperature manipulations. Germination behavior diverged from early to late phases of the invasion, with populations from later phases having higher dormancy at lower temperatures. Our results suggest that trait evolution may have contributed to niche expansion during invasion and that distribution models, which inform future management planning, may underestimate invasion potential without accounting for evolution.",

Here, we utilize the UAS/GAL4 system to express a pathogenic HD construct in the muscle of the fly, and characterize the effects. We observe detrimental phenotypes such as reduced lifespan, decreased locomotion, and accumulation of protein aggregates. Strikingly, depending on the GAL4 driver used to express the construct we saw different aggregate distributions and severity of phenotypes. These different aggregate distributions were found to be dependent on expression level and the timing of expression. Hsp70, a well-documented suppressor of polyglutamine aggregates, was found to strongly reduce the accumulation of aggregates in the eye, but in the muscle it did not prevent the reduction of the lifespan. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of aggregates in the muscle are distinct from the nervous system.",

Our experimental design includes both fresh and artificially damaged samples from the same tumours, which also provides a comparable dataset to examine their performance under challenging conditions. The performance metrics used in this study consist of gene sensitivity, mitochondrial content, reproducibility, clustering capabilities, cell type representation and ambient RNA contamination. These analyses showed that BD Rhapsody and 10x Chromium have similar but higher gene sensitivity than Drop-seq, while BD Rhapsody has the highest mitochondrial content. Interestingly, we found cell type detection biases between platforms, including a lower proportion of endothelial and myofibroblast cells in BD Rhapsody and lower gene sensitivity in granulocytes for 10x Chromium. Moreover, the source of the ambient noise was different between plate-based and droplet-based platforms. In conclusion, our reported platform differential performance should be considered for the selection of the scRNAseq method during the study experimental designs.",

Intestinal bacteria and viruses influence gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. Viruses infecting bacteria, known as bacteriophages, play a key role in modulating bacterial communities within the human gut. However, the identification and characterisation of novel bacteriophages remain a challenge. Available tools use similarities between sequences, nucleotide composition, and the presence of viral genes/proteins. Most available tools consider individual contigs to determine whether they are of viral origin. As a result of the challenges in viral assembly, fragmentation of viral genomes can occur, leading to the need for new approaches in viral identification.\n\nResultsWe introduce Phables, a new computational method to resolve bacteriophage genomes from fragmented viral metagenomic assemblies. Phables identifies bacteriophage-like components in the assembly graph, models each component as a flow network, and uses graph algorithms and flow decomposition techniques to identify genomic paths. Experimental results of viral metagenomic samples obtained from different environments show that over 80% of the bacteriophage genomes resolved by Phables have high quality and are longer than the individual contigs identified by existing viral identification tools.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationPhables is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Vini2/phables (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7645166).\n\nContactvijini.mallawaarachchi@flinders.edu.au",

Experimental ED-based grid matching score (ExptGMS) was developed to score compounds by measuring the degree of matching between their binding conformations and a series of multi-resolution experimental ED grids. The efficiency of ExptGMS was validated using both in-silico tests with the Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced dataset and wet-lab tests on Covid-19 3CLpro-inhibitors. ExptGMS improved the active compound enrichment in top-ranked molecules by approximately 20%. Furthermore, ExptGMS helped identify four new and active inhibitors of 3CLpro, with the top showing an IC50 value of 1.9 {micro}M.

    "abstract": "Comparing chromatin contact maps is an essential step in quantifying how three-dimensional (3D) genome organization shapes development, evolution, and disease. However, no gold standard exists for comparing contact maps, and even simple methods often disagree. In this study, we propose novel comparison methods and evaluate them alongside existing approaches using genome-wide Hi-C data and 22,500 in silico predicted contact maps. We also quantify the robustness of methods to common sources of biological and technical variation, such as boundary size and noise. We find that simple difference-based methods such as mean squared error are suitable for initial screening, but biologically informed methods are necessary to identify why maps diverge and propose specific functional hypotheses. We provide a reference guide, codebase, and benchmark for rapidly comparing chromatin contact maps at scale to enable biological insights into the 3D organization of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced autoimmunity (DIA) is an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction. Although first reported in the mid-1940s, the mechanisms underlying DIA remain unclear, and there is little understanding of why it is only associated with some drugs. Because it only occurs in a small number of patients, DIA is not normally detected until a drug has reached the market. We describe an ensemble machine learning approach using transcriptional data to predict DIA. The genes comprising the signature implicate dysregulation of cell cycling or proliferation as part of the mechanism of DIA. This approach could be adapted by pharmaceutical companies as an additional preclinical safety screen, reducing the risk of drugs with the potential to cause autoimmunity reaching the market.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained resource allocation models (C-GRAMs) are simple mathematical models of whole cell physiology, where large components of the macromolecular composition are abstracted into single entities. The dynamics and steady-state behaviour of such models provides insights on optimal allocation of cellular resources and have explained experimentally observed cellular growth laws. Here, we formulate a minimal C-GRAM with nitrogen and carbon pathways converging on biomass production, with parameterizations accounting for respiro-fermentative and purely respiratory growth. The model describes the effects of the uptake of sugars, ammonium, and/or compound nutrients such as amino acids on the translational resource allocation towards proteome sectors that maximised the growth rate. It robustly recovers cellular growth laws including the Monod law and the ribosomal growth law. Furthermore, we show how the growth-maximizing balance between carbon uptake, recycling, and excretion depends on the nutrient environment. Lastly, we find a robust linear correlation between the ribosome fraction and the abundance of amino acid equivalents in the optimal cell, which supports the view that simple regulation of translational gene expression can enable cells to achieve an approximately optimal growth state.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate chromatin states to silence gene transcription in plants and animals. Most PcG proteins function as part of distinct multi-subunit Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). Gene repression by the Polycomb system involves chromatin compaction by canonical PRC1 (cPRC1), mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2Aub1) by non-canonical PRC1 (ncPRC1) and tri-methylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) by PRC2. Prevalent models for Polycomb repression emphasize a tight functional coupling between PRC1 and PRC2. However, whether this paradigm indeed reflects the evolution and functioning of the Polycomb system remains unclear. Here, we examined the relationship between cPRC1, ncPRC1 and PRC2 through a comprehensive analysis of their presence and evolution across the entire eukaryotic tree of life. We show that both PRC1 and PRC2 were present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), but that their subsequent evolution is uncoupled. The identification of orthologs for ncPRC1-defining subunits in unicellular relatives of animals and of fungi suggests that the origin of ncPRC1 predates that of cPRC1, and we develop a scenario for the evolution of cPRC1 from ncPRC1. Our results demonstrate the independent evolution and function of PRC1 and PRC2 and show that crosstalk between these complexes is a secondary development in evolution.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism is an indispensable part of T-cell proliferation, activation, and exhaustion, yet the metabolism of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells remains incompletely understood. CARs are comprised of extracellular domains that determine cancer specificity, often using single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), and intracellular domains that trigger signaling upon antigen binding. Here we show that CARs differing only in the scFv reprogram T-cell metabolism differently. Even in the absence of antigens, some CARs increase proliferation and nutrient uptake in T cells. Using stable isotope tracers and mass spectrometry, we observe basal metabolic fluxes through glycolysis doubling and amino acid uptake overtaking anaplerosis in CAR-T cells harboring rituximab scFv, unlike other similar anti-CD20 scFvs. Disparate rituximab and 14g2a-based anti-GD2 CAR-T cells are similarly hypermetabolic and channel excess nutrients to nitrogen overflow metabolism. Since CAR-dependent metabolic reprogramming alters cellular energetics, nutrient utilization, and proliferation, metabolic profiling should be an integral part of CAR-T cell development.",
