    "abstract": "Monosynaptic tracing is a widely-used technique for mapping neural circuitry, but its cytotoxicity has confined it primarily to anatomical applications. Here we present a second-generation system for labeling direct inputs to targeted neuronal populations with minimal toxicity, using double-deletion-mutant rabies viruses. Spread of the viruses requires expression of both deleted viral genes in trans in postsynaptic source cells; suppressing this expression with doxycycline following an initial period of viral replication reduces toxicity to postsynaptic cells. Longitudinal two-photon imaging in vivo indicated that over 90% of both presynaptic and source cells survived for the full twelve-week course of imaging. Ex vivo whole-cell recordings at 5 weeks postinfection showed that the second-generation system perturbs input and source cells much less than does the first-generation system. Finally, two-photon calcium imaging of labeled networks of visual cortex neurons showed that their visual response properties appeared normal for 10 weeks, the longest we followed them.",

    "abstract": "Understanding global patterns of genetic diversity (GD) is essential for describing, monitoring, and preserving life on Earth. To date, efforts to map macrogenetic patterns have been restricted to vertebrates, which comprise only a small fraction of Earths biodiversity. Here, we construct the first global map of predicted insect mitochondrial (COI) GD, derived from publicly available data. We calculate the mitochondrial GD mean (GDM) and evenness (GDE) of insect assemblages across the globe, identify their environmental correlates, and make predictions of mitochondrial GD levels in unsampled areas based on environmental data. Using the largest single-locus genetic dataset yet assembled, we find that mitochondrial GDE follows a quadratic latitudinal gradient peaking in the subtropics. Both mitochondrial GDM and GDE positively correlate with seasonally hot temperatures, as well as climate stability since the last glacial maximum. Our models explain 27.9% and 24.0% of the observed variation in mitochondrial GDM and GDE in insects, respectively, making an important step towards understanding global biodiversity patterns in the most diverse animal taxon.",

    "abstract": "The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) shows robust activation during the perception of faces and voices. However, little is known about what categorical features of social stimuli drive neural activity in this region. Since perception of identity and expression are critical social functions, we examined whether neural responses to naturalistic stimuli were driven by these two categorial features in the prefrontal cortex. We recorded single neurons in the VLPFC, while two macaques viewed short audiovisual videos of unfamiliar conspecifics making expressions of aggressive, affiliative, and neutral valence. Of the 285 neurons responsive to the audiovisual stimuli, 111 neurons had a main effect (two-way ANOVA) of identity, expression or their interaction in their stimulus related firing rates; however, decoding of expression and identity using single unit firing rates rendered poor accuracy. Interestingly, when decoding from pseudopopulations of recorded neurons, the accuracy for both expression and identity increased with population size, suggesting that the population transmitted information relevant to both variables. Principal components analysis of mean population activity across time revealed that population responses to the same identity followed similar trajectories in the response space, facilitating segregation from other identities. Our results suggest that identity is a critical feature of social stimuli that dictates the structure of population activity in the VLPFC, during the perception of vocalizations and their corresponding facial expressions. These findings enhance our understanding of social behavior beyond the temporal lobe in macaques and humans.\n\nSignificance StatementPrimates are unique in their ability to process and utilize complex, multisensory social information. The brain networks that support this are distributed across the temporal and frontal lobes. In this study, we characterize how social variables like identity and expression are encoded in the neural activity of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a prefrontal region of the macaque brain. We found that single neurons do not appear to encode these variables, but populations of neurons display similar activity patterns that are primarily differentiated by the identity of the conspecific that a macaque is attending to. Furthermore, by employing dynamic, multisensory stimuli, our experiment better approximates real world conditions, making our findings more generalizable.",

    "abstract": "Information theory is a viable candidate to advance our understanding of how the brain processes information generated in the internal or external environment. With its universal applicability, information theory enables the analysis of complex data sets, is free of requirements about the data structure, and can help infer the underlying brain mechanisms. Information-theoretical metrics such as Entropy or Mutual Information have been highly beneficial for analyzing neurophysiological recordings. However, a direct comparison of the performance of these methods with well-established metrics, such as the t-test, is rare. Here, such a comparison is carried out by evaluating the novel method of Encoded Information with Mutual Information, Gaussian Copula Mutual Information, Neural Frequency Tagging, and t-test. We do so by applying each method to event-related potentials and event-related activity in different frequency bands originating from intracranial electroencephalography recordings of humans and marmoset monkeys. Encoded Information is a novel procedure that assesses the similarity of brain responses across experimental conditions by compressing the respective signals. Such an information-based encoding is attractive whenever one is interested in detecting where in the brain condition effects are present.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCulture-independent 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding is a commonly used method in microbiome profiling. However, this approach can only reflect the proportion of sequencing reads, rather than the actual cell fraction. To achieve more quantitative cell fraction estimates, we need to resolve the 16S gene copy numbers (GCN) for different community members. Currently, there are several bioinformatic tools available to estimate 16S GCN, either based on taxonomy assignment or phylogeny.\n\nMethodHere we develop a novel algorithm, Stacked Ensemble Model (SEM), that estimates 16S GCN directly from the 16S rRNA gene sequence strings, without resolving taxonomy or phylogeny. For accessibility, we developed a public, end-to-end, web-based tool based on the SEM model, named Artificial Neural Network Approximator for 16S rRNA Gene Copy Number (ANNA16).\n\nResultsBased on 27,579 16S rRNA gene sequence data (rrnDB database), we show that ANNA16 outperforms the most commonly used 16S GCN prediction algorithms. The prediction error range in the 5-fold cross validation of SEM is completely lower than all other algorithms for the 16S full-length sequence and partially lower at 16S subregions. The final test and a mock community test indicate ANNA16 is more accurate than all currently available tools (i.e., rrnDB, CopyRighter, PICRUSt2, & PAPRICA). SHAP value analysis indicates ANNA16 mainly learns information from rare insertions.\n\nConclusionANNA16 represents a deep learning based 16S GCN prediction tool. Compared to the traditional GCN prediction tools, ANNA16 has a simple structure, faster inference speed without precomputing, and higher accuracy. With increased 16S GCN data in the database, future studies could improve the prediction errors for rare, high-GCN taxa due to current under sampling.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptor proteins are versatile toolbox for developing biosensors for optogenetic applications. These molecular tools get activated upon illumination of blue light, which in turn offers a non-invasive method for gaining high spatiotemporal resolution and precise control of cellular signal transduction. The Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain family of proteins is a well-recognized system for constructing optogenetic devices. Translation of these proteins into efficient cellular sensors is possible by tuning their photochemistry lifetime. However, the bottleneck is the need for more understanding of the relationship between the protein environment and photocycle kinetics. Significantly, the effect of the local environment also modulates the electronic structure of chromophore, which perturbs the electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction within the binding site. This work highlights the critical factors hidden in the protein networks, linking with their experimental photocycle kinetics. It presents an opportunity to quantitatively examine the alternation in chromophores equilibrium geometry and identify details which have substantial implications in designing synthetic LOV constructs with desirable photocycle efficiency.",

A longstanding challenge is incorporating metabolites without losing tractability. In this paper, we do so using a new second-order cone representation of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The resulting model consists of linear stoichiometric constraints alongside second-order cone constraints that couple the reaction fluxes to metabolite concentrations.\n\nWe formulate several new problems around this model: conic flux balance analysis, which augments flux balance analysis with metabolite concentrations; dynamic conic flux balance analysis; and finding minimal cut sets of networks with both reactions and metabolites. Solving these problems yields information about both fluxes and metabolite concentrations. They are second-order cone or mixed-integer second-order cone programs, which, while not as tractable as their linear counterparts, can nonetheless be solved at practical scales using existing software.",

    "abstract": "Walking is a complex motor activity that requires coordinated interactions between sensory and motor systems. We used mobile EEG and EMG to investigate the brain-muscle networks involved in gait control during overground walking in young, older and individuals with Parkinsons Disease. Dynamic interactions between the sensorimotor cortices and eight leg muscles within a gait cycle were assessed using multivariate analysis. We identified three distinct brain-muscle networks during a gait cycle. These networks include a bilateral network, a left-lateralised network activated during the left swing phase, and a right-lateralised network active during right swing. The trajectories of these networks are contracted in older adults, indicating a reduction in neuromuscular connectivity with age. Individuals with impaired tactile sensitivity of the foot showed a selective enhancement of the bilateral network, possibly reflecting a compensation strategy to maintain gait stability. These findings provide a parsimonious description of interindividual differences in neuromuscular connectivity during gait.\n\nTeaserDynamic network analysis shows how brain-muscle connectivity during gait varies with age and somatosensory function.",

A study on Astrovirus circulation and diversity in different insectivorous and frugivorous chiropteran species roosting in trees, caves and building basements was carried out at 11 different sites across Zimbabwe. Pooled and individual faecal sampling methods were used for this study, collection date ranged from June 2016 to July 2021. In two sites, Magweto and Chirundu, sampling was carried out at monthly intervals from August 2020 to July 2021. Astroviruses and bat mitochondrial genes were amplified using pan-AstVs and CytB /12S RNA PCR systems respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp Astrovirus sequences revealed a high genetic diversity of astroviruses. All the bat astroviruses tested in this study clustered with the Mamastrovirus genus. Two distinct groups of the amplified sequences were identified. One group comprised of sequences isolated from Hipposideros, Rhinolophus and E. helvum spp clustered with Human Astrovirus strains: HuAstV types1-6, HuAstV-MLB1-3 and HuAstV-VA-1. A second group comprised of the majority of the sequences clustered with different strains of Bat AstVs. Results from the longitudinal study at Magweto and Chirundu showed an overall AstV prevalence of 13.7% and 10.4% respectively. Peaks of AstV infection at Chirundu coincided with the period when juveniles are 4-6 months old. Coinfection of bats with CoVs and AstVs at Magweto and Chirundu sites was 2.6% and 3.5% respectively.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that computational pathology not only automate the tumor diagnosis, but also showed great potential to uncover tumor-related genetic alterations and transcriptomic patterns. In this paper, we propose wsi2rppa, a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to infer the protein levels of tumor biomarkers from whole slide images (WSIs) in breast cancer. We firstly conducted contrastive learning-based pre-training on tessellated tiles to extract histopathological features, which are then aggregated by attention pooling and adapted to downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in tumor diagnostic task, and also performed well in predicting clinically relevant protein levels and drug response. To show the model interpretability, we spatially visualized the WSIs colored the tiles by their attention scores, and found that the regions with high scores were highly consistent with the tumor and necrotic regions annotated by a 10-year experienced pathologist. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic data further verified that the heatmap generated by attention scores agree greatly with the spatial expression landscape of two typical tumor biomarker genes. In particular, our method achieved 0.79 AUC value in predicting the response of breast cancer patients to the drug trastuzumab treatment. These findings showed the remarkable potential of deep learning-based morphological feature is very indicative of clinically relevant protein levels, drug response and clinical outcomes.",

Light is the main entraining signal of the circadian clock, but can also directly increase alertness, locomotor activity, body temperature and heart rate in diurnal animals including humans. Thus, immediate effects of light can enhance or even overwrite circadian output and thereby mask circadian behaviour.\n\nIn Drosophila melanogaster, immediate light effects are most evident as a lights-on response in two well described behavioural rhythms of the fly - the emergence rhythm of the adult insect from the pupa, called eclosion, and the diurnal rhythm of locomotor activity. Here, we show that the immediate effect of light on rhythmic eclosion depends on the R8 photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes, while the light response of locomotor activity is triggered by different light detecting cells and organs, that seem to compensate for the loss of each other.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived brain organoids could recapitulate the earliest phase of brain development, making them an effective in vitro system for simulating both normal brain development and disorders. However, the current techniques for creating brain organoids are low throughput, suffer from high variability in organoid generation, and frequently involve lengthy processes of transferring and encapsulating the cells in hydrogels. These limitations hinder the application of brain organoids for high-throughput assessment of compounds in academic and industry settings. Here we demonstrate a simple method of generating multiple cerebral organoids from iPSCs on a unique 36PillarPlate with sidewalls and slits without tedious manual intervention that leads to the reproducible generation of cerebral organoids. Embryoid bodies (EBs) formed in an ultra-low attachment (ULA) 384-well plate were transferred to the 36PillarPlate with Matrigel on one-to-one basis by a simple sandwiching and inverting method. The success rate of spheroid transfer was 95 - 100%. Cerebral organoids were generated robustly with the coefficient of variation (CV) below 19% by differentiating EBs on the pillar plate, which demonstrate the robustness of our approach to support organoid culture. The spheroid transfer method on the pillar plate could overcome the potential limitation of organoid variability, reduce cell culture volume, and enhance assay throughput as compared to conventional organoid culture in petri dishes, spinner flasks, and 6-/24-well plates.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical and thermal stimuli acting on the skin are detected by morphologically and physiologically distinct sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Achieving a holistic view of how this diverse neuronal population relays sensory information from the skin to the central nervous system (CNS) has been challenging with existing tools. Here, we used transcriptomic datasets of the mouse DRG to guide development and curation of a genetic toolkit to interrogate transcriptionally defined DRG neuron subtypes. Morphological analysis revealed unique cutaneous axon arborization areas and branching patterns of each subtype. Physiological analysis showed that subtypes exhibit distinct thresholds and ranges of responses to mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The somatosensory neuron toolbox thus enables comprehensive phenotyping of most principal sensory neuron subtypes. Moreover, our findings support a population coding scheme in which the activation thresholds of morphologically and physiologically distinct cutaneous DRG neuron subtypes tile multiple dimensions of stimulus space.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that humans combine multiple sources of spatial information such as self-motion and landmark cues, while navigating through an environment. However, it is unclear whether this involves comparing multiple representations obtained from different sources during navigation (parallel hypothesis) or building a representation first based on self-motion cues and then combining with landmarks later (serial hypothesis). We tested these two hypotheses (parallel vs. serial) in an active navigation task using wireless mobile scalp EEG recordings. Participants walked through an immersive virtual hallway with or without conflicts between self-motion and landmarks (i.e., intersections) and pointed toward the starting position of the hallway. We employed the oscillatory signals recorded during mobile wireless scalp EEG as means of identifying when participant representations based on self-motion vs. landmark cues might have first emerged. We found that path segments, including intersections present early during navigation, were more strongly associated with later pointing error, regardless of when they appeared during encoding. We also found that there was sufficient information contained within the frontal-midline theta and posterior alpha oscillatory signals in the earliest segments of navigation involving intersections to decode condition (i.e., conflicting vs. not conflicting). Together, these findings suggest that intersections play a pivotal role in the early development of spatial representations, suggesting that memory representations for the geometry of walked paths likely develop early during navigation, in support of the parallel hypothesis.",

However, achieving efficient and selective target degradation is a preeminent challenge with ligands that engage CRBN. Here, we report that the cyclimids, ligands derived from the C-terminal cyclic imide degrons of CRBN, exhibit distinct modes of interaction with CRBN and offer a facile approach for developing potent and selective bifunctional degraders. Quantitative TR-FRET-based characterization of 60 cyclimid degraders in binary and ternary complexes across different substrates revealed that ternary complex binding affinities correlated strongly with cellular degradation efficiency. Our studies establish the unique properties of the cyclimids as versatile warheads in TPD and a systematic biochemical approach for quantifying ternary complex formation to predict their cellular degradation activity, which together will accelerate the development of degraders that engage CRBN.",

    "abstract": "Microdroplets are compartments made in the laboratory that allow the miniaturisation of chemical and biological experiments to the femto- to picolitre scale, replacing the classical test tube with a droplet. Ideally containment of the contents of individual droplets would be perfect, but in reality this situation rarely occurs. Instead the leaking of molecules even from intact droplets presents a challenge to the success of miniaturisation and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. We now present a new method for quantitative determination of leakage: a sheath fluid-free flow cytometer (Guava EasyCyte) is used to directly determine the fluorescence of water-in-oil droplets as a function of time. We validate this method by demonstrating that this assessment of leakage provides a framework for experimental improvements that reduce the leakage of two widely used fluorophores. A 40-fold better retention compared to current protocols is achieved for resorufin with an optimized mix (oil: FC-70, surfactant: 0.1% w/w AZ900C, additive: 1% BSA) to maintain useful retention for up to 130 hours. Likewise leakage of the fluorophore methylumbelliferone is reduced by 75-fold. The availability of a method to quantitate leakage quickly for a variety of experimental conditions will facilitate future applications of droplet-based experiments (e.g. in directed evolution or diagnostics), aid miniaturisation of lab-scale assays into this format, and improve the degrees of freedom in setting up such ultrahigh-throughput experiments.",

    "abstract": "In interphase nuclei, chromatin is organized into interspersed dense domains with characteristic sizes, both in the nuclear interior and periphery. However, the quantitative impact of transcription and histone modifications on the size and distribution of these domains remains unclear. Here, we introduce a mesoscale theoretical model that investigates the relationship between heterochromatic domain sizes and loop extrusion rates from these domains. The model considers chromatin-chromatin and chromatin-lamina interactions, methylation and acetylation kinetics, and diffusion of epigenetic marks and nucleoplasm. Our model generates testable predictions that help reveal the biophysics underlying chromatin organization in the presence of transcription-driven loop extrusion. This process is kinetically captured through the conversion of heterochromatin to euchromatin in response to RNAPII activity. We discovered that a balance between diffusive and reactive fluxes governs the steady-state sizes of heterochromatin domains. Using theory and simulations, we predicted that a loss of transcription results in increased chromatin compaction and larger heterochromatin domain sizes. To validate our predictions, we employed complementary super-resolution and nano-imaging techniques on five different cell lines with impaired transcription. We quantitatively assessed how domain sizes scale with loop extrusion rates at the hetero-euchromatin interfaces. Our analysis of previously obtained super-resolution images of nuclei revealed that excessive loop extrusion leads to smaller heterochromatin domains. The model successfully recapitulated these observations, explaining how transcription loss can counteract the effects of cohesin overloading. As the general biophysical mechanisms regulating heterochromatin domain sizes are independent of cell type, our findings have significant implications for understanding the role of transcription in global genome organization.",

Axial traps, however, are typically weaker than their lateral counterparts requiring a high laser power to maintain a well calibrated, linear restoring force. Moreover, at higher forces, unless the surface tethering is carefully designed, various linkages involved in the tethering may rupture before the actual system of interest. Here we show how rupture force measurements on surface tethered molecules, up to a maximum force of [~] 45 pN, may be designed and performed with axial optical tweezers. As both a proof of principle and a study in designing a protein handle, we explore the rupture forces involved in detaching ssDNA oligomers of varying lengths from a tethered DNA substrate. We find that the presence of short stretches of ssDNA, between the bound oligomer and substrate DNA, can significantly stabilize the binding interaction under an applied force.",

    "abstract": "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare and lethal cancer that afflicts young individuals. The tumor arises in the background of a healthy liver, and patients typically present with advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis. Unfortunately, for these patients with advanced or recurrent cancer, no proven systemic therapies exist resulting in only 30-45% of patients surviving to 5 years. Investigations into the molecular underpinning of FLC have revealed a unique gene fusion between heat shock protein 40 (DNAJB1) and the catalytic subunit alpha of protein kinase A (PRKACA), leading to the formation of an oncoprotein (DNAJ-PKAc) that retains kinase activity and is a proven tumor-causing event in FLC. To uncover potential therapeutic targets, we engineered an FLC cell line by introducing the DNAJB1-PRKACA oncogene rearrangement into human hepatocellular cells using CRISPR/Cas9. We identified aberrant cell cycle progression, and follow-up molecular analysis revealed evidence of enhanced cyclin dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) activation in the DNAJB1-PRKACA expressing FLC cells. These findings were confirmed in human samples of FLC. In turn, targeting CDK7 with selective inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in several patient-derived models of FLC, with minimal toxicity to normal liver. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel candidate therapeutic vulnerability in FLC.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models (DGMs) have shown great success in the understanding of data-driven design of proteins. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a popular DGM approach that can learn the correlated patterns of amino acid mutations within a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of protein sequences and distill this information into a low-dimensional latent space to expose phylogenetic and functional relationships and guide generative protein design. Autoregressive (AR) models are another popular DGM approach that typically lack a low-dimensional latent embedding but do not require training sequences to be aligned into an MSA and enable the design of variable length proteins. In this work, we propose ProtWave-VAE as a novel and lightweight DGM employing an information maximizing VAE with a dilated convolution encoder and autoregressive WaveNet decoder. This architecture blends the strengths of the VAE and AR paradigms in enabling training over unaligned sequence data and the conditional generative design of variable length sequences from an interpretable low-dimensional learned latent space. We evaluate the models ability to infer patterns and design rules within alignment-free homologous protein family sequences and to design novel synthetic proteins in four diverse protein families. We show that our model can infer meaningful functional and phylogenetic embeddings within latent spaces and make highly accurate predictions within semi-supervised downstream fitness prediction tasks. In an application to the C-terminal SH3 domain in the Sho1 transmembrane osmosensing receptor in bakers yeast, we subject ProtWave-VAE designed sequences to experimental gene synthesis and select-seq assays for osmosensing function to show that the model enables de novo generative design, conditional C-terminus diversification, and engineering of osmosensing function into SH3 paralogs.",

The majority of viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) were identified as Caudoviricetes (65.36%). By clustering sequences, we identified 48,299 vOTU genomes, of which 92.83% were not found in existing major databases. The PVD database contains a total of 18,161,503 protein-coding genes that can be used to explore the functional potential of the pig gut virome. Our study showed that the PVD can improve the detection of viruses that carry antibiotic/metal resistance genes, mobile genetic elements, virulence factor genes, and quorum sensing systems.

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria) play a pivotal role in shaping both the evolution and dynamics of bacterial populations. Bacteria employ arsenals of genetically encoded phage defense systems, but can alternatively achieve protection by changing the availability of cellular resources that phages rely on for propagation. These physiological changes are often adaptive responses to unique environmental signals. The facultative pathogen Vibrio cholerae adapts to both aquatic and intestinal environments with niche-specific physiological changes that ensure its evolutionary success in such disparate settings. In both niches, V. cholerae is susceptible to predation by lytic phages like ICP1. However, both phages and susceptible bacterial hosts coexist in nature, indicating that environmental cues may modulate V. cholerae cell state to protect against phage infection. This work explores one such modification in response to the intestine-specific signals of bile and anaerobicity. We found that V. cholerae grown in these conditions reduces O1-antigen decoration on its outer membrane lipopolysaccharide. Because the O1-antigen is an essential moiety for ICP1 phage infection, we investigated the effect of partial O1-antigen depletion as a mechanism of phage defense and observed that O1-depletion limits phage adsorption. We identified mechanistic contributions to O1-depletion, including the essentiality of a weak acid tolerance system for O1 production at low pH, and alterations in transcriptional profiles indicating limitations in resources for O1-biosynthesis. This analysis illustrates a complex interplay between signals relevant to the intestinal environment and bacterial physiology that provide V. cholerae with protection from phage predation.",

Here we report the discovery of numerous mummified cadavers of leaf-eared mice, Phyllotis vaccarum, from the summits of three different Andean volcanoes at elevations 6029-6233 m (19,780-20,449 ft) above sea level in the Puna de Atacama (Chile-Argentina). Such extreme elevations were previously assumed to be completely uninhabitable by mammals. In combination with a live-captured specimen of the same species from the nearby summit of Volcan Llullaillaco (6739 m [=22,110 ft]), the 13 summit mummies represent the highest physical records of mammals in the world. We report a chromosome-level genome assembly for P. vaccarum in combination with a whole-genome re-sequencing analysis and radiocarbon dating analysis that provide insights into the provenance and antiquity of the summit mice. We test alternative hypotheses to explain the existence of mouse graveyards on the summits of Atacama volcanoes. Radiocarbon data indicate that the most ancient of the mummies were at most a few centuries old. Genomic polymorphism data revealed a high degree of continuity between the summit mice and conspecifics from lower elevations in the surrounding Altiplano. Genomic data also revealed equal numbers of males and females among the summit mice and evidence of close kinship between some individuals from the same summit groups. These findings bolster evidence for self-sustaining populations of Phyllotis at elevations >6000 m and challenge assumptions about the environmental limits of vertebrate life and the physiological tolerances of small mammals.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we reported a novel mutation in the Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) gene associated with multiple idiopathic cervical root resorption (MICRR), an aggressive form of tooth root resorption mediated by increased osteoclast activity. The IRF8 G388S variant in the highly conserved C-terminal motif is predicted to alter the protein structure, likely impairing IRF8 function. To investigate the molecular basis of MICRR and IRF8 function, we generated Irf8 knock-in (KI) mice using CRISPR/Cas9 modeling the human IRF8G388S mutation. The heterozygous (Het) and homozygous (Homo) Irf8 KI mice showed no gross morphological defects, and the development of hematopoietic cells was unaffected and similar to that in wild-type (WT) mice. The Irf8 KI Het and Homo mice showed no difference in macrophage gene signatures important for antimicrobial defenses and inflammatory cytokine production. Consistent with the phenotype observed in MICRR patients, Irf8 KI Het and Homo mice demonstrated significantly increased osteoclast formation and resorption activity in vivo and in vitro when compared to WT mice. The oral ligature inserted Irf8 KI Het and Homo mice displayed increased osteoclast-mediated alveolar bone loss and tooth root resorption compared to WT mice. The increased osteoclastogenesis noted in KI mice is due to the inability of mutant Irf8 G388S isoform to negatively inhibit NFATc1-dependent transcriptional activation and downstream osteoclast specific transcripts. This translational study delineates the IRF8 domain important for osteoclast function and provides novel insights into the IRF8 mutation associated with MICRR. Irf8G388S mutation mainly affects osteoclastogenesis while sparing immune cell development and function. The Irf8 KI mice serve as a novel translational model for studying the etiopathology of MICRR and developing targeted therapies for MICRR and other skeletal disorders mediated by increased osteoclast activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3)/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease. SCA3/MJD causative gene, ATXN3, is known to undergo alternative splicing (AS) and 54 transcripts are currently annotated. Differences in the toxicity of ataxin-3 protein isoforms, harbouring on its C-terminus two or three ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs), were previously uncovered, raising the hypothesis that specific ATXN3 splice variants play key roles in promoting the selective toxicity displayed in SCA3/MJD.\n\nMethodsUsing RNA-seq datasets we identified and determined the abundance of annotated ATXN3 transcripts in blood (n=60) and cerebellum (n=12) of SCA3/MJD subjects and controls.\n\nResultsGlobally, the number and the abundance of individual ATXN3 transcripts were higher in the cerebellum than in the blood. While the most abundant transcript in the cerebellum was a protein with a coding sequence not defined of unknown function (ATXN3-208), the transcript with the highest abundance in blood was the reference transcript (ATXN3-251) which translates into an ataxin-3 isoform harboring three UIMs. Noteworthy, the abundance of ATXN3-251 and ATXN3-214, two out of the four transcripts that encode full-length ataxin-3 protein isoforms but differ in the C-terminus were strongly related with tissue expression specificity: ATXN3-251 (3UIM) was expressed in blood 50-fold more than in cerebellum, whereas ATXN3-214 (2UIM) was expressed in the cerebellum 20-fold more than in blood.\n\nConclusionsThese findings provide new insights into the elucidation of ATXN3 AS in different tissues, contributing for a better understanding of SCA3/MJD pathogenesis and providing information for the development of future effective ATXN3 mRNA-lowering therapies.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes and other biting arthropods transmit diseases worldwide, causing over 700,000 deaths each year, and costing about 3 billion annually for Aedes species alone. These insects also pose a significant threat to agricultural animals. While clothing could provide a simple solution to vector-borne diseases, modern textiles do not effectively block mosquito bites. To address this issue, we have designed three micro-resolution knitted structures, with five adjustable parameters, that can block bites. These designs were integrated into a computer numerical control knitting robot for mass production of bite-blocking garments with minimal human labor. We then quantified the comfort of blocking garments. Our knits enable individuals to protect themselves from insects amidst their day-to-day activities without impacting the environment.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe create micro-resolution mosquito bite blocking knits produced by robotic manufacturing to protect humans against vector-borne disease.",

    "abstract": "Plants compete for light by growing taller than their nearest competitors. This is part of the shade avoidance syndrome and is a response to an increase of Far-Red light (FR) reflected from neighboring leaves. The root responds to this shoot-sensed FR cue by reducing lateral root emergence. It is well-established that the plant hormone Gibberellic Acid (GA) is involved in supplemental FR-induced shoot elongation. Although GA is also transported from shoot to root, its role in regulating lateral root growth is unclear. We show via GA manipulations, both chemical and genetic, that GA modulates the lateral root reduction induced by shoot-sensed FR enrichment. Using the FRET-based GA biosensor GPS1, we observed detailed GA changes in the root upon shoot exposure to FR enrichment and when GA was supplied to the shoot. Supplying GA to the shoot also mitigated the FR-enrichment root phenotype, indicating a functional link between GA and changes in root development in response to shoot-sensed FR. The regulatory role of GA in root growth appears to be partially dependent upon the role of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), a light-responsive transcription factor that regulates root growth. Shoot-to-root transported GA4 led to an increase in HY5 protein levels in the lateral root primordia. HY5 then repressed auxin signaling to repress lateral root growth. Our data unveil a novel way in which hormone and light signaling coordinate development across spatial scales by adjusting (lateral) root growth from above-ground FR light signals.",

    "abstract": "Salinity remains a major inhibitor of crop production in irrigated and marginal lands. The identification of genes involved in salinity tolerance has been predominantly limited to model plants and crop species. However, plants naturally adapted to highly saline environments can provide key insights into mechanisms of salinity tolerance. Plants of the genus Salicornia grow in coastal salt marshes, and their growth is even stimulated by NaCl - much can be learnt from them. We generated genome sequences of two Salicornia species and studied the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of Salicornia bigelovii to NaCl. Through the generation of subcellular membrane proteomes, we found that SbiSOS1, a homolog of the well-known SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE 1 (SOS1) protein, appears to localize to the tonoplast, where it could be involved in mediating Na+ translocation into the vacuole to prevent toxicity in the cytosol. We identified 11 proteins of interest which, when expressed in yeast, altered salinity tolerance. One of these proteins, SbiSALTY, substantially improves yeast growth on saline media. Structural characterization using NMR showed it to be an intrinsically disordered protein and to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum in planta, where it could interact with ribosomes and RNA, potentially stabilizing or protecting them during salt stress. The study and understanding of the molecular mechanisms providing high salinity tolerance in S. bigelovii is likely to provide significant insights for improving salinity tolerance of crop plants.",

Here we report cryo-EM structures of M4-SIgA and CD89-SIgA complexes, which unexpectedly reveal different SIgA-binding stoichiometry for M4 and CD89. Structural data, supporting experiments, and modeling indicate that copies of SIgA bound to S. pyogenes M4 will adopt similar orientations on the bacterium surface and leave one host FcR binding site open.

    "abstract": "Preventing parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes is recognised to be critical for achieving elimination and eradication of malaria. Consequently developing new antimalarial drugs with transmission-blocking properties is a priority. Large screening campaigns have identified many new transmission-blocking molecules, however little is known about how they target the mosquito-transmissible Plasmodium falciparum stage V gametocytes, or how they affect their underlying cell biology. To respond to this knowledge gap, we have developed a machine learning image analysis pipeline to characterise and compare the cellular phenotypes generated by transmission-blocking molecules during male gametogenesis. Using this approach, we studied 40 molecules, categorising their activity based upon timing of action and visual effects on the organisation of tubulin and DNA within the cell. Our data both proposes new modes of action and corroborates existing modes of action of identified transmission-blocking molecules. Furthermore, the characterised molecules provide a new armoury of tool compounds to probe gametocyte cell biology and the generated imaging dataset provides a new reference for researchers to correlate molecular target or gene deletion to specific cellular phenotype. Our analysis pipeline is not optimised for a specific organism and could be applied to any fluorescence microscopy dataset containing cells delineated by bounding boxes, and so is extendible to any disease model.",

They are related to small GTPases and thus, generally, present GTPase activity which may play an important (although incompletely understood) role in their organization and function. Septins polymerase into long non-polar filaments, in which each subunit interacts with two others by alternating interfaces, NC and G. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae four septins are organized in the following manner, [Cdc11-Cdc12-Cdc3-Cdc10- Cdc10-Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11]n in order to form filaments. Although septins were originally discovered in yeast and much is known regarding their biochemistry and function, only limited structural information about them is currently available. Here we present crystal structures of Cdc3/Cdc10 which provide the first view of the physiological interfaces formed by yeast septins. The G-interface has properties which place it in between that formed by SEPT2/SEPT6 and SEPT7/SEPT3 in human filaments. Switch I from Cdc10 contributes significantly to the interface, whereas in Cdc3 it is largely disorded. However, the significant negative charge density of the latter suggests it may have a unique role. At the NC-interface, we describe an elegant means by which the sidechain of a glutamine from helix 0 imitates a peptide group in order to retain hydrogen-bond continuity at the kink between helices 5 and 6 in the neighbouring subunit, thereby justifying the conservation of the helical distortion.

    "abstract": "Bats host a range of viruses that cause severe disease in humans without displaying clinical symptoms to these infections. The mechanisms of bat adaptation to these viruses are a continuous source of interest but remain largely unknown. To understand the landscape of bat antiviral response in a comprehensive and comparative manner, we studied this response in two bat species - the Egyptian fruit bat and the insectivore Kuhls pipistrelle, representing the two major bat subordinal clades. We profiled the transcriptional response to dsRNA - that triggers a rapid innate immune response - in skin fibroblasts from a large cohort of replicates from each bat species, using RNA-sequencing, and compared bat response with responses in primates and rodents. Both bat species upregulate a similar set of genes, many of which are known to be involved in the antiviral response across mammals. However, a subset of these genes is transcriptionally divergent in response between the two bat species.\n\nThese transcriptionally divergent genes also evolve rapidly in coding sequence across the bat clade and have particular regulatory and functional characteristics, including specific promoter architectures and association with expression programs thought to underlie tolerance and resistance in response to viral infection. In addition, using single-cell transcriptomics, we show that transcriptionally divergent genes display high expression variability between individual cells. A focused analysis of dsRNA-sensing pathways further points to significant differences between bat and human in basal expression of genes important for triggering antiviral responses. Finally, a survey of genes recently lost or duplicated in bats points to a limited set of antiviral genes that have undergone rapid gene loss or gain in bats, with the latter group resulting in paralogs displaying divergence in both coding sequence and expression in bat tissues. Our study reveals a largely conserved regulatory program of genes upregulated in response to viral infection across bats and other mammals, and points to a set of genes that evolved rapidly in bats through multiple evolutionary mechanisms. This divergence can contribute to bat adaptation to viral infection and provides directions to understanding the mechanisms behind it.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphSomatic variation contributes to biological heterogeneity by modulating cellular proclivity to differentiate, expand, adapt, or die. While large-scale sequencing efforts have revealed the foundational role of somatic variants to drive human tumor evolution, our understanding of the contribution of mutations to modulate cellular fitness in non-malignant contexts remains understudied. Here, we identify a mosaic synonymous variant (m.7076A>G) in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded cytochrome c-oxidase subunit 1 gene (MT-CO1, p.Gly391=), which was present at homoplasmy in 47% of immune cells from a healthy donor. Using single-cell multi-omics, we discover highly specific selection against the m.7076G mutant allele in the CD8+ effector memory T cell compartment in vivo, reminiscent of selection observed for pathogenic mtDNA alleles1, 2 and indicative of lineage-specific metabolic requirements. While the wildtype m.7076A allele is translated via Watson-Crick-Franklin base-pairing, the anticodon diversity of the mitochondrial transfer RNA pool is limited, requiring wobble-dependent translation of the m.7076G mutant allele. Notably, mitochondrial ribosome profiling revealed altered codon-anticodon affinity at the wobble position as evidenced by stalled translation of the synonymous m.7076G mutant allele encoding for glycine. Generalizing this observation, we provide a new ontogeny of the 8,482 synonymous variants in the human mitochondrial genome that enables interpretation of functional mtDNA variation. Specifically, via inter- and intra-species evolutionary analyses, population-level complex trait associations, and the occurrence of germline and somatic mtDNA mutations from large-scale sequencing studies, we demonstrate that synonymous variation impacting codon:anticodon affinity is actively evolving across the entire mitochondrial genome and has broad functional and phenotypic effects. In summary, our results introduce a new ontogeny for mitochondrial genetic variation and support a model where organismal principles can be discerned from somatic evolution via single-cell genomics.",

Current research on protein aggregation often involves the use of fluorescent labels to visualize and monitor the dynamics of protein expression, which can alter the biophysical properties of proteins and the final ultrastructure, composition, and toxic properties of the formed aggregates. To overcome this limitation, we present a method for label-free identification of NDD-associated aggregates (LINA). Our approach utilizes deep learning to detect unlabeled and unaltered Httex1 aggregates in living cells from quantitative phase images, without the need for fluorescent labeling. We developed pixel-classification and pixel-regression models and validated them on aggregates formed by different constructs of Httex1. Our results reveal that Httex1 proteins with shorter polyglutamine repeat lengths form aggregates with a higher average dry mass and area, highlighting the differences in their ultrastructure and aggregation mechanisms. LINA enables the dynamic identification of label-free aggregates and measurement of their dry mass and area changes during their growth process. Our models offer high speed, specificity, and simplicity to analyze label-free protein aggregation dynamics and obtain high-fidelity information.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging super-resolution imaging technique for deep tissue microvascular imaging. However, conventional localization methods are constrained by low microbubble (MB) concentration, as accurate localization requires a strict separation of MB point spread functions (PSFs). Furthermore, deep learning-based localization techniques are often limited in their ability to generalize to in vivo ultrasound data due to challenges in accurately modeling highly variable MB PSF distributions and ultrasound imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-pipeline, LOcalization with Context Awareness (LOCA)-ULM, which employs simulation that incorporates MB context to generate synthetic data that closely resemble real MB signals, and a loss function that considers both MB count and localization loss. In in silico experiments, LOCA-ULM outperformed conventional localization with superior MB detection accuracy (94.0% vs. 74.9%) and a significantly lower MB missing rate (13.2% vs 74.8%). In vivo, LOCA-ULM achieved up to three-fold increase in MB localization efficiency and a x 9.5 faster vessel saturation rate than conventional ULM.",

To investigate the functions of the six maize COI proteins (COI1a, COI1b, COI1c, COI1d, COI2a, and COI2b), we made single, double, and quadruple loss-of-function mutants. Double-mutant coi2a coi2b pollen was inviable, and no homozygous mutant plants were obtained. The coi1 quadruple mutant (coi1-4x) exhibited shortened internode lengths, decreased photosynthesis, leaf discoloration, microelement deficiencies, and accumulation of DWARF9, a DELLA-family protein that represses the gibberellic acid signaling pathway. Co-expression of maize COI and DWARF9 genes in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that the COI proteins lead to proteasome-dependent DELLA degradation. Many genes expressed at lower levels in the coi1-4x mutant are normally induced by gibberellic acid. The majority of these genes are predicted to be bundle sheath or mesophyll-enriched including those encoding C4-specific photosynthetic enzymes. Ectopic expression of maize COI genes in N. benthamiana showed that COI2a is fully localized in the nucleus and interacts with maize JAZ proteins, the canonical COI repressor partners. However, maize COI1a and COI1c proteins showed only partial nuclear localization and failed to bind to most of the JAZ proteins tested.

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a workhorse of industrial biotechnology owing to the organisms prominence in alcohol fermentation and the suite of sophisticated genetic tools available to manipulate its metabolism. However, S. cerevisiae is not suited to overproduce many bulk bioproducts, as toxicity constrains production at high titers. Here we employ a high-throughput assay to screen 108 publicly accessible yeast strains for tolerance to 20 g L-1 adipic acid (AA), a nylon precursor. We identify 15 tolerant yeasts and select Pichia occidentalis for production of cis,cis-muconic acid (CCM), a precursor to AA. By developing a genome editing toolkit for P. occidentalis, we demonstrate fed-batch production of CCM with a maximum titer (38.8 g L-1), yield (0.134 g g-1 glucose) and productivity (0.511 g L-1 h-1) that surpasses all metrics achieved using S. cerevisiae. This work brings us closer to the industrial bioproduction of AA and underscores the importance of host selection in bioprocessing.",

    "abstract": "During development down the erythroid lineage, hematopoietic stem cells undergo dramatic changes to cellular morphology and function in response to a complex and tightly regulated program of gene expression. In malaria infection, Plasmodium spp. parasites accumulate in the bone marrow parenchyma, and emerging evidence suggests erythroblastic islands are a protective site for parasite development into gametocytes. While it has been observed that Plasmodium falciparum infection of late-stage erythroblasts can delay terminal erythroid differentiation and enucleation, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon are unknown. Here, we apply RNA-seq after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of infected erythroblasts to identify transcriptional responses to direct and indirect interaction with Plasmodium falciparum. Four developmental stages of erythroid cells were analyzed: proerythroblast, basophilic erythroblast, polychromatic erythroblast, and orthochromatic erythroblast. We found extensive transcriptional changes in infected erythroblasts compared to uninfected cells in the same culture, including dysregulation of genes involved in erythroid proliferation and developmental processes. Whereas some indicators of cellular oxidative and proteotoxic stress were common across all stages of erythropoiesis, many responses were specific to cellular processes associated with developmental stage. Together, our results evidence multiple possible avenues by which parasite infection can induce dyserythropoiesis at specific points along the erythroid continuum, advancing our understanding of the molecular determinants of malaria anemia.\n\nKey PointsO_LIErythroblasts at different stages of differentiation have distinct responses to infection by Plasmodium falciparum.\nC_LIO_LIP. falciparum infection of erythroblasts alters expression of genes related to oxidative and proteotoxic stress and erythroid development.\nC_LI",
